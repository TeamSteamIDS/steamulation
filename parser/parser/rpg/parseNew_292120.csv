												This game has a tremendous polarizing effect on gamers. Either you love it, or you hate it. Hence I'm not surprised to see such mixed reviews. (Of course, the poor port is adding fuel to the negative flames, but I'll address my views on that later on).So here is where I am coming from; I have NEVER played a Final Fantasy game. This is my entry point into the franchise. I have played JRPGs but not on the PC, PS3 or Xbox; only old-school stuff like Sword of Mana on the Gameboy.I did not expect much from the game, as whilst I patiently waited for it to download, I read almost exclusively negative feedback on steam and on the internet. I tried to ignore it, yet it did leave a sour taste. I launched the game expecting the PC to practically burst into flames. Hence my extreme surprise at how much I am genuinely enjoying myself.I expected the game to be ""unplayable"". Touch wood, but the game has not yet crashed/stuttered/glitched whilst I have been playing it. I have not needed to tweak Nvidia settings besides fiddling with V-sync; I did this after I had some lag in one battle with 6 or so enemies. After switching it off, the lag didn't happen again (I don't know if that was conicidence or not). My computer is not state of the art. I could list the specs but, really, it's not the newest nor the best. However, it does exceed the minimum and recommended specs listed below. I think that perhaps one should bear that in mind when buying this game; I don't know how well it will run on either listed specs. Perhaps ensure that you either hit recommended or exceed it.Now, about the port. Yes, I wish the resolution wasn't fixed/I could adjust graphics or sound in game/the file size wasn't so damn large. But honestly? I am really captivated by this game. Perhaps this is due to me being fresh-faced. Perhaps I don't have preconceived standards for JRPGs and SE and FF. But, to me, the game looks magnificent and beautiful. I haven't even bothered to download the resolution fix because I'm enjoying the game as it is. Just as a side note, I am using a controller but I played for a bit with the keyboard and it was highly manageable. I prefer using the controller simply because I think the buttons have been mapped appropriately.Now the actual game itself. The issues I saw on the internet about the game mainly revolved around A) a confusing story B) linearity C) rubbish characters. Here is what I think; The story really isn't that confusing. I have spent a bit of time reading the in-game datalog but I'm following it just fine. The game is linear at the beginning, but it hasn't exactly irked me up to this point like I expected it to. In fact, I needed the slow, linear, tutorialized start because I am completely new to the game style. In terms of characters, they all are fantastic. Yes, the infamous Vanille is poorly English voice acted and makes, um, extremely strange sighs and moans. At one point I turned to my sister and said, ""This sounds like a dodgy adult film."" But she is overshadowed by the incredible Lightning Farron and Sazh. Lightning is a badass, yet her pain and inner conflict is so evident and tangible. Sazh is just great. Plus he has an afro with a chocobo chick just chilling inside it, try and not find that adorable.The combat is REALLY great. I was worried it would bore me, but it has not as of yet. With the tougher enemies you need to micro-manage the fights intently; using Paradigm Shift has been a really interesting strategy and I'm starting to use it to my advantage. Combat is rewarding and I feel as though this game hits just the right difficulty; not too hard, not too easy. Just right for you to enjoy yourself yet still be challenged, without getting frustrated. This is so rare to find in a game.I know my views conflict with others, yet I reiterate again; I come from a fresh-faced point of view. I had low expectations that were exceeded by this game. If you are a first timer to the franchise, I hope your experience will be similar and as engaging as mine.			"

												From what I have gathered, this game is somewhat controversial. I have 3 playthroughs now, looking forward to a 4th, and I would like to bring up a few points and offer my opinions, that potential players might have a better perspective on the game beforehand. This review will be quite lengthy, for there is a lot to cover, even scratching the surface as I am. I assure you there are no story spoilers.Journey - The game is very linear. The first 80% of the story takes you on a singular path from one locale to the next, with little deviation, before it opens up into the main side-questing hub. (Firsttime players: at this point, I strongly advise following the map and pressing on with the main story for the best experience; there will be plenty of time later to complete this content, and you will be much better prepared.) Those of you looking for a cohesive, story-driven rpg that will keep you glued to your controller for 40 hours before you even get to the endgame, look no further.Story - An intricate and well-developed plot replete with heroism, hope, despair, and intrigue. Consciously make sure you develop a firm understanding of the terms being used (l'Cie, fal'cie, etc.), or you will find yourself a bit confused often. The game introduces the story in a very logical way, and if you diligently read the journal entries, you may find yourself thoroughly immersed. The characters are very human (if sometimes melodramatic), and the overall experience was satisfying and complete.Presentation - The polish in this game is quite astounding. The graphical style of the characters seems to deviate just enough from photorealism to avoid the uncanny valley, yet be very believeable; and I found myself often taking time away from the story to just stare at the environments for a bit. The soundtrack is phenomenal, sound design is very pleasing, and the voice acting is absurdly well done. If there was such a thing as a quadruple A title, this would be one.Combat - Combat starts almost insultingly simple, but evolves into an extremely tactical and customizable aspect of the game. The systems used are quite novel, and somewhat difficult to describe. Your party maximum is 3 members, but you only control the party leader, and the commands you select are executed when your command queue (called ATB gauge, which charges within seconds at a set rate over time) finishes charging. This makes combat a much faster and action oriented experience than the customary Final Fantasy turn-based combat. Another aspect of combat is the paradigm system, wherein you save up to 6 builds (called paradigms in the game) for your party (out of combat) by specifying each member's role. These paradigms can then be cycled through (called paradigm shift) on-the-fly in combat to fit the given situation. There are 6 different role types. Put simply: tank, healing, damage, damage multiplier increasing, debuffing, and buffing. There is a ton of potential for diversity here. In order to survive many battles post-game, careful timing, thoughtful planning, and equipment tailored to the situation will all be required.Progression - This is one of my favorite things about the game. While the system for leveling up is arguably as linear as the story to a certain degree, it simply cannot be denied that there is a vast and satisfying journey to be had in regards to increasing your party's strength. The game's EXP is used to purchase abilities and stat upgrades from giant role 'skill/stat trees' (for lack of a better term). All 6 roles have their own trees, and eventually become accessible to everyone, but each character is 'native' to specific roles, meaning that progression with EXP through their native trees is much cheaper. This essentially means that your characters will be limited in their individual role capabilities until you are well past the end of the story. Maxing out each tree is possible, but it is an extremely daunting goal that will take many hours of post-game play to achieve, so there is a certain definite replayability in the way you level up your characters. At a certain point, you can also decide which 3 of 6 party members you utilize as your active party, and who you use as party leader (all of which can be changed at any time, once available). The role trees will be your primary source of progression, but upgrading weapons will increase their damage stat (there are 2 damage stats: strength and magic) boosts, and earlier in the game you will also find it useful to use accessories to boost your stats.Endgame - As mentioned earlier, some of the endgame content is actually accessible before you finish the story. The trick here is that most of the encounters in this area will either leave you sweating by the end, or simply have you die within the first 10 seconds from a single blow. There are 64 side quests in the game, with some of them actually being woven into and required to complete for the main story. Each quest is essentially a boss enemy you are tasked with hunting down, and the 'quest givers' (term used to avoid plot details) are spread throughout a great portion of the game. To offset this, there is a fast travel network you unlock as you complete certain quests. Generally, the higher the quest number, the more difficult the boss and the better the item and EXP rewards. The fact that there are enemies that can simply wipe the floor with you by hardly trying is one of the things that makes this such a fun experience for me. Because eventually, if you do enough side quests, farm some of the more lucrative quests (quests are repeatable), and obtain the right equipment, you will eventually be more than a match for that enemy. And those groups you were sweating to beat when the quest hub unlocked will die in seconds. Other activities aside from questing include working at completing a robust set of achievements, upgrading your weapons to their ultimate forms (very expensive), upgrading your accessories, and maxing out role trees.Replayability - As mentioned earlier, there is some replayability value in the design of the role tree system, and which 3 characters you choose to have your experience with when the feature is unlocked. There is also a choice to make for each character: that is if you are specializing them for strength or magic or both, in regards to weapon choice. Some characters may be more naturally inclined to one stat over the other, but it's still your choice. Personally, I think that perhaps the story itself is one of the greatest advocates for replayability. Despite its extreme linearity, it was an amazing and intense journey that I look back fondly on.Beginner Tips - 1.Once you start gaining experience, don't rush the game and skip encounters. Doing so will leave you much weaker once you near the end of the story, and you will really just be making the game uncomfortably difficult for yourself. 2.Best defense is a good offense here most of the time. 3.Paradigm shift. A lot. 4.Grab ATB and accessory upgrades from the role trees asap.Other opinions - As far as hearsay regarding this game in comparison to FFXIII-2 and FFXIII-3: The second and third games seemed little more than truly terrible fan fiction to me, and featured some awful game mechanic and interface changes/additions. I simply can't understand why anyone would claim that they were an improvement over this game in any way whatsoever. Unfortunately, I found that the only way to preserve the memory of the wonderful characters I came to know and love in this game was to pretend that the second and third games do not even exist. Story and mechanics aside, they are absolutely abysmal ports, with the first game being BY FAR the best optimized port of the three. FFXIII is the masterpiece, people.Closing - If you've taken the time to read this entire review, I hope you've gained a better understanding of what to expect from this game, and wish you a very enjoyable experience.

												It's really hard to talk about this game. I've finally beaten Final Fantasy XIII and the first thing that comes to mind is, it really is a unique experience. So, is it good? Well, I can't say I liked it, but I can see why others would enjoy it or even love it. That's why you'll find so many different opinions about this game. I'm not recommending it because buying it is a risky move anyway. But let me tell you, if you think you're going to like it, you probably will, so go ahead and buy it if that's the case.I can't say anything that hasn't already been said. The game is extremely linear. No excuses. The problem isn't that you go from point A to point B and you can't do side quests or something else, that's something to be expected in some RPGs to be honest. But here, it's not just side quests that you can't do. You can't do anything. 90% of the game is a hallway. You can't find hidden stuff. You can't pick a different path to get to point B. You can't even *talk* to NPCs (well, you can, but you just have to stand in front of them and that's it). The interaction with the environment does not exist. I honestly can't feel attached to a world that seems to be static and unalterable. But of course, maybe you don't mind playing a game like this.Once you get to Gran Pulse you are allowed to do a bunch of sidequests, mount chocobos and find treasures, yes, but that doesn't change the fact that the worlds feels... dead. You can't do much, you still can't explore and meet people, explore towns, or at least know a bit more about the main characters. It doesn't feel like an open world game just because you're free to move around.The story is rather confusing, but that doesn't mean it's bad (especially if that's the kind of stuff you like). And I hope you like it because it's the most important thing that this game has to offer, and if you don't, you're screwed. Same with the main characters, they play a big role in the game, and they're not your typical heroes. Instead, they seem to be taken straight from a shonen anime, with extremely pronounced personalities. That's been done before (remember Palom and Porom? Locke? Zidane?) so keep that in mind.I think this Final Fantasy has a way better battle system than the previous ones, and most people seem to agree. It's dynamic and relatively fast-paced, and probably my favorite aspect of this game. But since you don't have much to do in the game, you're going to see it a lot.In short, you have to like the story, the style, and maybe the battle system. That's pretty much what Final Fantasy XIII is. An on-rails RPG with no interactivity, with a long story and lots of battles.			"

ok, now i finally beat this game, time for a review english is not my main language, so bear with it.FFXIII is different from other's FF i've played (VII, VIII, IX)If you are looking for another [insert your favorite Final Fantasy here]. you wont get it here.StoryWhen I started playing this game, I had no idea what's going on, too many terms i dont understand.  The plot slowly revealed as you played the game, and the story itself is great. They give you this feature called datalog, basically it has informations about the story, enemy and other informations you need.CombatThe combat in FFXIII is different from other FF i've played, it's basically 85% change the paradigm, 15% choose abilty manually.The combat in FFXIII mainly focused on how you choose the best paradigm to use at the right moment.Like the story, the combat goes deeper as you played, the first 4 hour you can just stay in 1 paradigm, hitting 1 button and keep stomping the enemies, but it will change later, believe me, i died more than 10 times to random enemies, and it's not even a boss. Also you dont get gil from battles :(Graphics and Charactersthe graphic and the cutscenes are beautiful. The character design and voice acting are great. sometimes the fps drop but it didnt bother me at all.TLDR;Pros:>Fantastic graphic>Great Story>Great Combat >Cool Eidolons.>Interesting Characters>Good Voice ActingCons:>Unstable FPS>Early-game Story is confusing>Early-game Combat is so ez>Hope at the beginning of the game is unbearable.>Muh Grinding for complete achievements :(((((((Final Verdict : 7.5/10			"

Posted: November 1, 2014
This review is spoiler-free.First things first: let me list some important points which may very well influence you taking my recommendation seriously.I am new to Final Fantasy series. I heard a lot about these games, but never actually got to play any of them seriously before this particular installment.I am also relatively inexperienced with JRPGs in general. I played several of them, but I am mostly D&D-type of a guy.I did beat the game, so I can talk about it safely from the beginning till the end.I played the game with GeDoSaTo on (downsampling program by Durante which basically allows to launch the game in any possible resolution).And finally: I am somewhat biased towards Japanese voice acting, and while it doesn't really have any significant influence on my opinion on the game overall, I tend to enjoy some pieces of dialogue other people would consider cringeworthy. Which is why I played FFXIII with Japanese voices, so I can't tell anything about the English ones.There is a tl;dr section at the end, if you want short conclusions.With all of that out of the way, let's proceed with the recommendation, shall we?Firstly I will address the port issue. And, my God, there is an issue here. What does this port have? 60 FPS. Theoretically. However these 60 FPS often turn into anything but 60. Sometimes you get 30. And sometimes it drops below even that. And if I may remind you, FFXIII is almost five years old at the time of writing. What does this port not have? Plenty of things, actually. There are no sound options. Half of the keys are not rebindable for some reason. On launch the game was locked at 720p with nasty black bars on all four sides of the screen (at least on my machine, maybe it's Radeon-specific). There is no way SE could not have made all the options and optimization. They just chose not to. To give Square Enix credit though, they listened to the fans and gave us dual-audio. Appreciate the option. The game is also quite stable - it only crashed twice for me in 87 hours of gameplay. The controls with keyboard and mouse are at least okay, but a proper mouse support in menus (instead of it just functioning as a mini-keyboard) would be nice.UPD: As of December 11 the game now has resolution options (up to 1080p, so no 4k for you) as well as AA and shadow resolution. It's good that SE gave us an ear and implemented these, although the fact still remains that there were no graphic options of any description on launch. And the time it took them to respond with some action is, well, two months.Now let us move on to the game itself. While I am strongly disappointed by the port quality, the contents of the game I am pleased with. Let me warn you: FFXIII is linear. As in linearly linear. In more ways than one. But is it really bad? No, I do not think so. This game is about watching cutscenes and fighting. If those things are good, then I myself do not care about linearity. And, well, they are. It also means that if you happen to dislike combat and/or cutscenes, you won't like the game either. The cutscenes are gorgeous and all, but the battle system is the highlight in my opinion, so let's talk about it a bit. The battles take place in real time with some turn-based limitations, where you have to make quick decisions while the action gauge fills. Your party consists of up to 3 characters (you can't choose them until chapter 10) and each of them has a role or a class. The combination of two or three classes (depending on how many characters are in the party now) is called Paradigm. Outside of the battle you can prepare 6 Paradigms and after that you can switch between them at any time in the battle. That is called Paradigm Shift and it allows you to quickly react to the situation at hand or to just choose your tactics on a whim. It turns already spectacular battles into something more interesting. Yes, you can just hit Auto Battle button and let AI do everything for you, but it's boring this way, and the AI doesn't make optimal choices considering AoE, buffs/debuffs and the type of your attack. Personally, I didn't get bored of fighting in this game even once. It's flashy, dynamic and requires some thinking to do right. It also has a lot of smaller nuances, like trying to initiate a battle with your enemy not noticing you (which makes the fight much easier) or character's action animation actually influencing his/her position (if during an attack your character is in the jumping animation, enemies may instead hit the ground or just cancel their attack).The game opens up rather slowly with the first several hours being basically a lengthy tutorial in terms of mechanics, since they are introduced gradually, but there is a lot to learn. Exploration is practically nonexistent before chapter 11, where you get to roam an open-world style locations and do some side-quests, all of which (and I do mean all) are just ""kill this monster"" tasks. It's pretty dull, but since combat is fun, I found it more or less acceptable. Sometimes these quests even open roads to hidden locations with more challenges and items. Speaking about challenges, there are some rather nasty enemies, which are kinda hard to deal with. Not to mention, that there are enemies with 16 million HP capable of one-shoting an inexperienced party.Some people say that FFXIII's story is confusing. I don't think it's true - the plot is quite straightforward, somewhat typical and predictable, but it gets the job done. Since the cutscenes are quite a spectacle and the dialogues are well voiced (at least in Japanese), I enjoyed the overall story as well. Especially I want to praise Lightning's and Fang's voice actresses. On the other hand, some characters do not match well with their voices until you get used to them. The characters themselves, by the way, are quite bland and rather uninteresting. They are typical for your run-of-the-mill Japanese anime/manga/VN. To give authors credit though, the way they explain the connection between seemingly unrelated bunch of people is rather neat.I would also like to praise the game's setting. The worlds of Cocoon and Pulse, Mass Effect-style technologies and fear of magic wielded by pseudo-gods fal'Cie and their human servants l'Cie - there are a lot of interesting concepts, and the lore in general is compelling to say the least. I found myself striving to defeat some difficult optional bosses just to get a new piece of said lore.The graphics. Even by default it's a nice-looking game, but with GeDoSaTo on it can be really stunning. Character models and lighting effects are especially good. Texture quality - not so much, but the game sure knows how to present itself and make it look good despite the lack of HD textures. And well, for a five year old game FFXIII is surely a looker. I've got a huge gallery of screenshots to prove that point.A couple of words about the music as well: it's really pretty and provides a fitting atmosphere. Sometimes I found it odd, when the music contained real vocals, but it was beautiful nonetheless. I think, I will get the soundtrack for the game, which I don't do often.Tl;drThis game's defining features (in my opinion) are as follows:Bad portLinearitySide content can be boringLots of CGI movie quality cutscenesFun combat systemAverage plotUninteresting charactersEnjoyable voice acting (JP)Compelling settingNice graphicsPerfect musicI do recommend the game despite it having some rather major problems. The combat is great and the story is decent. It is quite a fun experience and the price point is laughably low. I don't want to support the idea of such a bad port coming to PC, but I also can not stop myself from enjoying FFXIII and expecting it's sequel to come our way.			"

												Square Enix have created a fantastic Final Fantasy title that has left fans with mixed feelings, yet again.As someone that has played the game to completion on both PC and PS3, I find very little to complain about.New FF titles have always been about pushing the boundaries - this is apparent to us from long development times, sometimes wildly different art styles between consecutive titles, and also the stories behind the characters and gameplay. It's true that to some extent developers should be catering to the customer's needs, but at the same time we don't want a carbon copy of a game that came out three years ago. If you do want a flood of FFVII clones on the market then perhaps you should stick with FFVII.Thirteen exists on its own and does not require you to have played any other Final Fantasy games to get your head around it. The story starts at a mid-point of sorts, on Day 13. As you progress through the story you discover snippets of what happened on the earlier days, and is cleverly crafted so that some of the bigger questions are left unanswered for the majority of the story.The story centres on Lightning, an ex-soldier from an artificially created moon, Cocoon, orbiting (geostationary?) above the planet Pulse, and it starts in the thick of action and explosions and cutscenes, which can leave players feeling a bit bewildered. The take-home message? Most of the main characters are out to rescue Serah, Lightning's sister, who has been branded by a magical entity, and both Serah and the entity are enemies of Cocoon. The plot thickens as all the main characters are eventually branded in the same way, gaining the ability to wield magic, but also acquiring a doom-timer in the form of a task they must fulfil within a certain time period. The characters are true to form, behaving as we might expect given the situation, but also occasionally not as expected. This dichotomy of behaviour is one of the more intriguing aspects of the story, but far from the only one. I do not wish to give too much away.Insofar as performance on PC goes, I did have some framerate issues, but nothing more than that, and only at specific points in the game. Don't look away in disgust! Having said this, I don't think you'll find it any different on the consoles. I think it could have been optimised better for all the systems it got released on, so if you're thinking of getting it I recommend PC. I had no stuttering issues (as others have claimed) and I'm just running Windows 7 Prof. with a GTX590 card.More on the gameplay though. As expected, FF13 treats combat very differently from how other, previous titles did. Combat is real-time, but there is a cooldown after actions such as attacking, buffing or healing. I believe items are the only exception. So in a sense it is similar to the ATB (Active Time Battle) system from previous titles. But the similarities stop there. There are six roles to swap between during combat - Medic, Saboteur, Synergist, Commander, Ravager, and Sentinel. Each of these has its own speciality - medic for healing, sentinel for tanking and taking the big hits, commander for physical attacks, ravager for magical attacks, synergist for buffs and saboteur for debuffing or crippling the enemies. Oh, and if you really want to damage enemies, you're going to want to stagger them.It may seem like a lot to take in, but with a bit of practice you'll find it works pretty well. It's possible to customise your preset 'paradigms' as they're called, so that you can go from straight up assault to full defence at the flick of a button.FF13 is often criticised for its linearity and lack of side quests, but I value a good story more than how complex the game is laid out. If you need a break from grinding for experience towards role levels, HP, strength and magic, there is also Chocobo Treasure Hunting, unique monster hunts, and farming enemies for parts and gold so that you can upgrade and empower your Ultimate Weapons, of which there is an interesting selection to choose from , including various passive and hidden stats (which you will more than likely need a guide for!)The art is sometimes breathtaking, vast, and beautiful, but occasionally you might find it a bit monotonous. End game maps such as the Archylte Steppe and the Yaschas Massif are so large and indentical in almost every respect that I'll hazard most players tire of it sooner or later. And yet, the game also boasts some true fantasy imagery - Lake Bresha turned to crystal, walking under frozen waves and churning waters; the awe-inspiring Tesseracts and Orphan's Cradle, where the environment is ever-shifting, ever-changing all around (probably why there's a framerate drop here). I haven't even mentioned some of the gigantic bosses - both mechanical and organic, and even the fabled 'Summons' that have become so much a staple of the FF games. I find myself playing a large chunk of the soundtrack on an almost daily basis too, for there is some incredible work right there. Empowering, mysterious, emotional, it just fits so well with the scenarios you find yourself in that it's hard not to find yourself liking at least some of it.So what if it's a bit linear? I still enjoyed it, and definitely will again. I consider it 126+ hours well spent, and if you think you're up to trying it I can think of no other RPG I recommend quite as much as I do this one. Pick up a copy today.			"

Recommended for fans of the series // Strong game, but suffers some unfortunate shortcomings+ Absolutely stunning environmental designs and presentation; everything is meticulously crafted, and this really shows off the superior production value of the game+ Complex and engrossing narrative+ Generally likeable and well fleshed-out main cast; not the most memorable by Final Fantasy standards, but far from the weakest link+ Gorgeous and cinematic cutscenes; very prevalent, but not necessarily overbearing+ Crisp, aesthetically pleasing menu navigation+ Data logs are absolutely saturated with lore-friendly narratives that drastically enrich the story and game's universe+ Excellent voiceovers (with some exceptions; *cough cough Vanille cough cough*); mouths have even been reanimated to better sync with the English translation+ While the soundtrack is lackluster compared to the rest of the series (the crippling lack of Nobuo Oematsu on this project is glaringly apparent), the music is nevertheless strong in its own right, and fits the gameplay like a glove+ Combat system starts off very simply, but later reveals itself to be startlingly complex; however, learning curve is blessedly gradual and beginner-friendly+ Battle ratings are a welcome addition, and add, rather than detract, from the experience+ Paradigms and 'staggering' work seamlessly to make combat strategic and rewarding+ Late-game difficulty spike really shakes things up; very welcome after an increasingly stale performance from the middle chapters of the game+ Instead of focusing inordinately on one protagonist, the narrative bounces evenly between each of the six, and seeks to explore their relationships with each other+ Death is very forgiving, placing one back to just before the fatal confrontation; this heavily encourages experimentation- Too little development for antagonist characters; virtually all 'villains' are immediately forgettable, as with much of the support cast (ie. Snow's group NORA)- Poor optimization for PC; many, many issues trying to get the game to run properly, that often require invasive workarounds (the stuttering problem was truly debilitating)- Maps are unforgivably linear in nature; there is virtually no exploration until very late game, and even that is very limited in scope- Skill advancement, while very friendly to new players, is also horribly linear and boring- While most of the dialogue was excellent, it was interspersed with some noticeably cringe-worthy choices (the worst offender being Hope's 'Operation NORA' stint; it was bad enough to rival FFX's laughter scene)- Very little in the way of side-missions and activitiesLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												PC Port Update: Dec 11 2014, added resolution options including 1920x1080, shadow resolutions, AA, although any addressing of multithreading and underperformance issues according to some players (including myself) has proved unaffective.The game itself is pretty solid. It's not the bet FF game by far, but not the worst like many people say. There are some pretty meh ones out there besides FFXIII. FFXIII is criticized for being too linear. Well, it is (more linear than other FF titles). But like all FF games, once you reach a certain point, there's extra side content to be done like in all FF games. Unfortunately you are 100% restricted from any kind of side content until hitting Gran Pulse (20 hour mark). You could easily triple your playtime on side content, however. I do admit that the side content is a bit on the dry side, as it doesn't necessarily contribute to the lore of the FFXIII or expand on other aspects of its story.The story is decent, the characters are okay, the combat is just a tweaked version of the FFX-2 combat system but designed for you to only control one character. It's rewarding and everything should be at a standard that's good enough to keep you intrigued. If it doesn't, then it's just not for you really. But let me tell you, I enjoy and admire the hell out of this game. It keeps me entertained, and so I keep running down the long hallways they put in front of me to meet my next challenge. It's definitely not my favorite, but it's definitely not my least favorite. But as of now, the FFXIII games of the series are the best looking in the franchise, still have the great soundtracks you all love, and still feel like a FF game to me. I know a lot of people who love this game and would definitely agree to anyone giving it a try. Just don't raise your expectations too high.			"

												Finally got around to playing this game, been waiting for a PC release for a while and my friend kindly gifted it to me.I have a playtime of 60 hours, finished all the chapters and most of the sidequest content and I feel it's time to write a very short review covering my opinion of the game, and also the quality of the port to Steam.Firstly, the quality of the port to Steam: 9/10Overall, it's very good, the sound quality is perfect and the only flaw with the graphics is the lack of anti-aliasing in some aspects which can be fixed with 3rd party graphic applications (like AMD Catalyst).I experienced no crashes, no errors, no FPS issues. The only minor irritation was the fact that the game locks the mouse cursor to the center of the window and sometimes when you alt-tab it doesn't release the mouse cursor and you have to keep alt-tabbing between windows until it releases it.Controls are pretty comfortable, I have a PS3 controller but I actually preferred just using keyboard and mouse.The game itself: 9/10I loved the story and the music, the cinematics were amazing and the characters are likeable.The gameplay is casual-friendly, hardcore FF fans who like extremely difficult sidequests/puzzles may find themselves disappointed. Everything is pretty linear until Chapter 11 where you can finally get around to doing sidequest content.			"

												Update as of 4:12 PM PST: Fix is out by Durante.  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=618While this does not fix all  of the problems remaining, this is a huge first step! Was a little hessitant starting a new game because I wanted to play on the best possible settings, and now I can! Cheers everyone!Update as of 2:15 pm PST: Durante a well known modder who helped fix many of the issues in Dark Souls and Deadly Premonition is said to be working on a fix atm for all of us fans.  Although his tool is barebones, from what I have been reading, it seems that a fix to the resolution issues is on the way. Initially I wanted to do a write up about why PC gamers should give FF13 a chance, but I felt this was the more pressing issue to inform fellow fans and potential customers about.  -----------My Lightning body pillow is more realistic than this port. All jokes aside heres a rundown of what you can expect from the PC port of FF13.Games Resolution is locked at 720p, Up to 60 FPS (if you are lucky to even run it that stable,) 30 FPS cutscenes.  This isn’t a case where the consoles are keeping the PC port down, its the incompetence from Square Enix keeping the game down.    What makes this more disappointing is the sheer fact that SE was hush hush about the details regarding the port and only recently, as of last night they updated their minimum settings. They had weeks to let customers know, and yet instead of informing gamers, they waited until the last possible moment to reveal the games specs.The game is 50gigs to download, and is probably the largest game I have downloaded to date on Steam, on top of that I have had a nearly two hour wait after its game’s release time just to unpack all the files in order to start the game up.The xbox version is around 20gigs and Ps3 version is around 40gigs, yet early comparison pictures courtesy of bittercup from the neogaf forums show the stark differences between these versions.  (http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=133609256&postcount=3004) For being bloated in size, it does not make up for it in the looks department. If you own an Nvidia graphics card you can tweak a few settings here and there like forcing AA in to the game, but why should gamers have to do this? Why aren’t these bare minimum features already in the game? People are even suggesting ripping out the video files from the PS3 version and seeing if they can work in the PC port.  But even then why should it be left to consumers to tweak the settings in order to get the performance they want out of the game?  What about AMD users, what options do they have?On one hand I am disappointed - but on the other hand I am hopeful the community can mod this to the point where it is the preferred platform to play on.  To me Final Fantasy 13 is a great game that just got a lot of flak for its linearity in a time where most games were linear, and they still are even to this this day.  While this may not the best RPG ever made, many of the criticisms from the big gaming press in my opinion were unwarranted for FF13. I haven’t played FF 13 in many years after I beat it originally on the PS3.  I eagerly bought the PC version in hopes that it would be the definitive version to play, but I guess Square Enix was too busy pushing out a “definitive” version of Sleeping Dogs, a game that came out a couple years ago.  Not only did I purchase this port because I wanted to replay it, but to also show my support to SE that there are PC gamers like me that want these types of products out on our platform. My suggestion is wait for news from modders before purchasing this, lazy port jobs should not be rewarded.  That or just wait for a steam sale.  Thanks for reading and hopefully this gives you an idea of the state of the situation of FF13 on the PC's.			"

												Have you ever encountered a tedious/annoying sidequest in a Final Fantasy game?  And even though you didn't really ENJOY that portion of the game, you finished it anyway, because you wanted 100% completion.  And besides, the music is nice, and it's better than going outside?FF XIII.... is that.I'm not sure that I really had fun playing this game at any point.  It's the most experimental gameplay since FF2j.  It's not like other FF games where you can overlevel through grinding and sidequests and then faceroll everything.  Instead, combat is strategic: buffs and debuffs and paradigms matter, because 90% of the game is a low-level challenge playthrough.  This is cool in concept, but makes even trash mob battles take forever.  Also, the game is incredibly linear up until the end. Once they finally set you loose, you're stuck with a frustrating rotating map.Honestly, if you're a long time Final Fantasy fan, just buy it and play it.  Seriously... in your life you've probably fought 256 battles to un-curse the Cursed Shield, Mastered Knights of the Round, won the Excalibur II, and dodged 200 lightning bolts on the Thunder Plains.   If you did all that for Final Fantasy, then you can slog through this Hallway Simulator to hear some of the best FF music in years  and watch beautiful cutscenes that will get your Pulse racing.   So just play the game and l'Cie for yourself.			"

Update - 7/5/2015: I'm updating to remind everyone that this review is just my opinion. My opinion of the game is not an attack against the people who enjoy it. There is no need to defend yourself against me. If you have a differing opinion of the game, I encourage you to write a review of your own. I do NOT encourage you to leave nasty comments and/or personal attacks on this review (nor does the Steam SA). You're welcome to disagree with my opinion, but please be civil and decent.I wrote this review immediately after having finished FFXIII, and before reading anything about the sequel, or what anyone else thought of the game. Yes, this review is colorful and dramatic, but it's because it represents my gut reaction: utter dissatisfaction. I have re-read the review and don't see that it throws any unjustified punches or says anything inaccurate. Therefore, I am leaving it as is. Please, stop whining. It won't change my opinion. I have played every entry in the Final Fantasy series, and I can tell you right now - this game is not very good. I thought my mild disappointment with XII was the most I'd ever dislike a FF game, but boy was I wrong. XII is a masterpiece compared to XIII.That said, it's not a complete disaster. The battle system has some redeeming qualities. The game looks and sound amazing. Leveling up your characters in the Crystarium has that old MMO ""treadmill"" effect that gets you into this state where you just can't seem to put down the controller, no matter how awful the game is, or how frustrating it becomes. I'm not talking about ""man, this is a hard and I can't beat it, and it's frustrating"". I'm talking about frustration from just really, really poor design choices...First off, FFXIII is, hands down, the most linear RPG I have ever played. You will spend the first 30 hours of the game literally traveling in a straight line from one corridor to the next, with no ability to explore, or hit the world map (there isn't even a world map, btw - only game in the series without an explorable world map, ♥♥♥♥ing incredible).""Ok, so what will I be doing with my time as I travel in a straight line, you might ask? Well, you'll be fighting, of course, with Square's so-so Combat Synergy Battle System. And that's all you'll be doing. The same monsters, over and over. Over half the monsters in the game are just re-skinned versions of ones you fought 20 hours ago. Going into a fight, there's absolutely nothing to distinguish how hard it will be - not appearance, not context, nothing. There'sa 1 in 3 chance that what you're fighting will be:A) some trash mobs that you won't even have to switch paradigms for, and will obliterate in less than 30 seconds.B) a boss fight (this can often be predicted by context) or mini-boss fight (these often can't be predicted at all) that may or may not require you to switch paradigms, apply buffs or debuffs, or one of the basically 4 or 5 possible functional combinations (combat is not very deep).C) some trash mobs that, for some inexplicable reason, are harder than any creature or boss you've ever faced before and will wipe your party out because you didn't have that one particular paradigm slotted that allows you to win. Either you figure out/Google what the rotation is to beat the trash mob, or you go back and beat up on some less overpowered opponents until you have the CP to increase your stats so that the fight is now reasonable for the significance of the encounter.That's it. That's the whole game. At least 60 hours of that is what you have to look forward to. There are no mini-games. You can't explore. You can't find items, really. Everything is either dropped by mobs or found in chests, and then you sell or use other drops to upgrade those items. There are no side quests to speak of. No puzzles, no mysteries. Chests are laid out nice and neat right in your path as you trudge forward through the linear storyline. The most work you have to do to find a ""secret"" chest, is to turn right or left instead of following your waypoint. Walk into a little area just off the beaten path. Maybe fight a monster or two. That's your ""exploration"". There are side quests of sorts, in the form of C'ieth Stones, which give you ""marks"" that you must kill. They're not fun, as the gameplay basically consists of running from one side of the map to the other, fighting trash monsters, until you get to your mark and fight it. The only real value or drive in doing these is to get CP/items/5 stars for your achievement. Grinding, essentially. That's the whole game.You can't quest for ultimate weapons... but you can grind for them. Yeah! Just keep farming mobs so you can sell or acquire enough items for upgrades. You then sell the items you bought (in a menu you access from any save point) to buy other items that you use to increase your weapons stats until it levels up to the next form. You can do this twice, and you will have an ultimate weapon for your character (Upgrading is also performed in the aforementioned save point menu, btw). Now, repeat 5 more times and you have ultimate weapons for all your characters. Woohoo! Didn't that feel significant? No, it didn't.So, yeah, this sounds really bad. If you made it this far, you're probably thinking there has to be some redeeming quality. The story has to be good because it's Final Fantasy, right? The answer is no, it does not. It doesn't even have to make sense, or involve likable characters. Your party consists of the most one-dimensional, paper thin, saltine cast to grace a video game. How do we know it's bad? Not only will you not know what the characters what, or why they want it - neither will they! Yes, your characters motives seem to change every 5 minutes, and for no other reason than to move the story along. A character that was woefully depressed two cutscenes ago (which isn't very long, since cutscenes happen every 10 minutes or so), will suddenly be perfectly fine, and for no apparent reason other than ""well, I've just decided it's all ok."" Couple this with the traditionally cheesy writing of JRPGs, and the absurd and bizarre reactions to story events of some characters (I'm looking at you, Hope and Snow) and you've got a recipe for ""I don't give a damn about these pixelated golems""-itis. The game culminates in a ""magic"" ending. Why anything happens the way it does is never explained. We never learn anything concrete about the world, or why it is the way it is. Why characters do the things they do at the climax of the storyline remains a mystery...and everyone in the cast seems to be myseteriously fine with that.I'd say that this is the worst game in the mainstay FF series, if it weren't for the mess that was FFXIV. At least, before that game was launched, scrapped, and rebuilt into an actually pretty damn good MMO. This is certainly the worst entry in Square's iconic single-player RPG series... but I'm saying that having never played FFXIII-2, which I have no intention of doing. FFXIII makes me feel as if every time the designers were faced with a gameplay-shaping decision, they failed to ask themselves what would make the game more fun and engaging. If they did indeed ever ask themselves that question, the answer, 9 times out of 10, appears to have been ""screw it, throw in another cutscene or make Hope or Vanille cry or something"".I finished FFXIII out of a sense of duty. I was holding on to the hope that something interesting would happen, or the story would take a turn, or the game would open up and let me explore...but it never happened. It wasn't a completely miserable experience...but when I saw the ending, I really wished I had spent my time doing something else. Is this game worth $15? That's not even the question you should be asking. You should ask yourself, ""does this look like something I want to invest 60 hours of my life into""... and I would advise you that the answer should be a resounding, ""no"".			"

												FF13....yep.I played this game on the PS3. I think I spent a little over 10 hours on it. I hated every minute. Why? It was exactly what everyone said it was.Flash forward to just a little awhile ago, and I just completed a play-through of the PC version. I, well, I liked the majority of it. Why? It is exactly what everyone says it is.Confused? Yeah so am I. Hmm..It sounded clever in my head. *shrug*Apologies in advance. This review is going to echo nearly every other FF13 review out there. Everything you've heard is true, but not all of it is actually bad. In the end, everything is subjective. What doesn't work for you might work for others, vice versa, and all that good stuff.The plot to FF13 is pretty dang convoluted. This is mostly due to the fact that you're dropped into the game with hardly an idea of what's going on. All these made-up words are being thrown at you, and everyone sounds like an obnoxious jerk. This is completely understandable, since Lightning and Snow are two of the first characters you meet. Basically the story goes like this: become a l'cie, get sweet powers, run down several corridors, punch the space pope in his stupid face, and try to figure out how not to become a cie'th (crystal zombie). Once you understand the basics you can switch your brain off and watch the pretty cut-scenes.This game does take about 15 hours to reach its full potential. A good portion of the game is spent under some sort of limitation. Lightning and company split up more often than a Scooby Doo cartoon. This means two-person parties, and an overlong tutorial. This is the second-most draining part of the game, ESPECIALLY compared to prior Final Fantasy titles. I could be getting so much done if I was playing any other FF. I could play through FF1 twice, reach space in FF4, get involved in some major sidequest in FF7, and so on. The only FF title that compares in this regard is FF10. Even that game gave players a full-party before they left the first town (Zanarkand doesn't count because it's a city). Despite this, FF13 is still very much a game. This is due to the huge emphasis on combat. It's a fantastic battle-system, probably one of the best of its kind. If anything, the limited freedom forces the player to learn how to actually fight, since grinding for level-ups is a non-factor for those 15 hours. This makes for tons of opportunities to learn the ins and outs. Everything from when to switch paradigms, which enemies to focus on, and cutting out all of the in-efficiency (spending too much time healing, not staggering enemies fast enough, etc). There's a lot that goes into each battle, even in the 2-15 hour time-frame. The boss battles are superb. When you finally arrive at Gran Pulse, that's when the real game begins...eh. At first I was really excited to reach this portion of the game. I couldn't wait to explore a world and move in a direction besides forward. Honestly, while I appreciate what Square-enix was going for here, it could have been done better. The biggest annoyance is that there's just so much running around. The major side-quest involves cie'th stones. Find a cie'th stone, kill the monster it directs you to, and collect a reward of some sort. All this running around gets old, especially if you're not quite adept at dodging battles. Warp-points and Chocobos are available after enough progress is made, but I really could go for an arena or a list or something. However, if I could just choose what monsters I wanted to fight, wouldn't that make Gran Pulse just a bunch of filler to wander around in? Hmm....well it's pretty. At least there are a nice amount of character-specific scenes while exploring.Grind Pulse is also where the game starts to bury you in busy-work. Like any good J-RPG, the world is going to end in less than 10 hours, everyone is about to die, but what's stopping you from spending the next 30 hours making your party super strong? Aside from getting those all important stat bonuses through the Crystarium, you're also going to want to upgrade your gear. It's that moment where you realize that ""Hey! I can make my weapons really powerful!"" but you're flat broke. Trying to get cash is the #1 biggest problem I have with this game. Yes, I could use cheat-engine to give myself all the money I could ever need. But forcing the player to take shortcuts isn't good game design. Hell, nowadays game-developers are trying to sell us shortcuts. Buy my way to level 99? Why do that when I can just youtube the ending for free? The only legitimate (?) & logical(???) way to make good money is by killing giant turtles with Vanille's death spell. The amount of money necessary to max out a weapon's capabilities is FREAKIN ABSURD. Square-enix probably figured that if they didn't have all this nonsensical grinding, the game would be 5-10 hours shorter, making it less valuable in the eyes of consumers. Either that or they just really hate completionists. Is an extended vacation in Grind Pulse necessary? Not really. Sure battles will be more difficult, but that can make them more appealing. Despite my issues with this portion of the game, I appreciate its inclusion. In all fairness, this method of getting the strongest weapons is somewhat an improvement over FF10's. I mean hell, would you rather dodge 200 lightning bolts? Collect those godforsaken butterflies? Ride a chocobo and get those crazy balloons? Turtle-grinding gets zero points for imagination, but at least it's less hateful than soul-sucking, marriage-destroying, world-ending minigames from satan's party-hole. I actually grew to like the main cast of FF13. The ever-popular Sazh is naturally my favorite of the group, but everyone else comes into their own....eventually. The villains are throwaway trash however. I don't even blink when they're introduced and then unceremoniously discarded. Space Pope is pretty decent, but he's not even a factor for most of the game. I guess it's a side-effect when the first several hours are spent just trying to figure out what the hell is going on. There are a handful of other characters, like the tough mom, woman who wears a bikini to battle, some freedom fighters, a guy, and....yeesh. I can't remember any of these geeks.I shouldn't have to mention this, because you already know, but Square-enix did a crap job on the port. Durante and his Gedosato program bailed SE out, as FF13 looks really nice at 4K, downsampled, or whatever other high resolution you can force. The frame-rate is still horrendous. At least an update is scheduled for next month. It's too little too late in my case, but I can't complain too much. I just played through the game didn't I? Oh well.Speaking of...why didn't I quit this game? This has been bugging me ever since I finished my play-through. I went from hating FF13 to liking it. Both times I knew exactly what I was getting into. Maybe it was a change of attitude. Maybe I realized that the glass can be half-full (of corridors). FF13 definitely requires an investment. For a long-time FF fan like myself it was severely off-putting, but I stuck with it, and I'm kinda glad I did. The battle-system is fantastic, the music is excellent, the characters and story...have their moments. Overall this is a very solid entry.Getting $5 worth of card drops was nice too I suppose.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. But I didn't, lets list some pros and cons. Pros: +Beautiful locations and environments.+Good music, kind of a no brainer in a Final Fantasy game. Few memorable songs but no bad ones that I remember.+Interesting world and mythos.+The overall story is interesting and I wanted to see how it ended.+Combat system is fun.  For the first couple of hours.+60 fps.+1080p and several other graphical updates such as CSAA and better shadows using GeDoSaTo. Cons: -Pacing is at a snails pace which I can forgive if the story is actually moving along. But chapters 2-10 (game has 13 chapters) can be summed up as such: Main characters running from the police with no clear objective and regularly argue about what they should do so the party has an excuse to split up into groups of 2 or 3 every couple of hours..-Character motivation is pretty non exsistant for the most part so it's hard to know why characters do things when they do them.-Story is filled with plot convenience. Example:  In the last chapter most of the main cast turns into monsters but then they just randomly appear 1 minute later even though they talk about people not being able to turn back earlier in the game. The game doesn't even explain how they did it.-Native resolution locked at 720p.-No native graphics options.-Combat soon becomes a matter of only changing classes and mashing auto-attack.-You can only control one character in battle. If he/she dies it's game over. This is maybe the games worst sin, next to not being able to switch out characters during battle. The reason this is bad is because, well lets imagine this:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enemy is charging up a nuke. You start to buff up everone to take the hit.  The character you are controlling dies but your tank survives.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------But wait, the game forces you to control the character with the least health.Why doesn't the game let me switch control to the surviving members once the character I'm controlling dies?-Some characters are so annoying you will want to end your existence.  I'm looking at you Vanille.-Game is one big hallway with no exploration and treasure chests are just laying there in your path taking away all satisfaction of obtaining new items and weapons. 25 hours into the game you get one field to walk around in. What amazing things can you do here?Hunting quests, because you haven't been killing things the entire game or anything.-The game is so linear infact that there are no towns or physical shops to visit, all shopping is done via save points.-The weapon upgrade system is horrible. Getting new weapons is pointless because if you've been putting all your weapon upgrade items into one weapon you dont want to switch because it takes forever to fully upgrade a single weapon.-Leveling up system is bad. It's like the Final Fantasy X sphere grid but without the options to choose what new stats/abilities you get. Like the rest of the game this system is so linear it could have just been a normal level up system and the game would have lost nothing of value.Conclusion:Like I said in the beginning I really wanted to like this game because of the interesting locations, lore and music but ultimately the lackluster combat and story that gets worse every chapter holds it back a great deal. I will most likely get XIII-2 since I hear they fixed a lot of the linearity problems. But with the game as it is I just can't recommend it to anybody.TL;DR:  Wasted potential. Badly written story and bad combat in a interesting world with good soundtrack. Bad PC port but can be somewhat fixed via GeDoSaTo.			"

												I really only bought this game because I was curious about all the internet rage directed against it. I can see where it came from, honestly, so it's an odd game to review. You see, I bought it expecting to play for a couple hours, see that it was as bad as they say, and then chuckle as I turn it off, ready to move on. This didn't happen though, I ended up finishing this one. Why did I finish it? Well...Objectively speaking, this game checks off every item on the list of elements that draw the hate crowd: drastic changes to an established and venerable game series, confusing and poorly presented story, awkward 'romance' scenes, weird anime character archetypes (looking at you Vanille), and very linear gameplay with a streamlined battle system when compared to ealier games in the series. These problems really are present, and I can see how they annoyed people, especially uber fans who wanted this game to be just as good as they remembered the earlier games (bit of a loaded point there, I'll leave you to interpret it's meaning). Personally, I didn't really mind these problems as I wasn't expecting a masterpiece to begin with. I actually found all these elements entertaining in their own right, especially considering the concept of the story is pretty interesting if you can get past all the weird anime melodrama and the really horrid (at times) dialogue. (""Worst birthday ever!"" is exclaimed by a character who is supposed to be the practical level headed uber soldier.) In addition to the problems that were present in the original console version, the PC port is laughably inept. A game this old should not struggle to maintain 30 frames a second on a PC equipped with a GTX 980 and the surrounding hardware to support it. I've never had a problem adjusting to crap framerate, but if you're the type to get nauseated from the sight of inferior video display, steer clear of this game. So what did I like about it and why did I finish it? No reasons that were intentional on the part of the developers. As I said, the bad elements are very entertaining and worth playing if you find this kind of thing funny and not intolerable. The battle system starts out infuriatingly simple, but gets better after an excruciating 20 hours of tutorial-like handholding, during which my interest was only sustained by the train wreck of a plot unfolding. When the battle system does open up, however, it's actually fun to experiment with, where the point is to sort of pre-program the party make up and switch between these programs in order to react to changing battle conditions. Also, Lightning's character design is incredibly attractive so thats okay...I'm not obsessed or biasedI guessNot like I have her profile background or anything "

												What I once regarded as my least favorite game series by far, and one of my least favorite games ever, has somehow grown on me quite a bit given a lot more time. To get the negatives out of the way, the bulk of the game, especially the critical path, is extremely linear, sometimes even resembling series of interconnected hallways with battles scattered along the way. That said, there is a very rewarding wealth of late-game content awaiting those who can persevere. A huge number of optional side quests and expansive, wide-open areas, in stark contrast to the former half to two thirds of the game. However, as I found out, it is very much worth the wait. And the real core of the experience, and what drove me to keep going to the end (and then some), is the excellent combat system. The battle system is fairly unconventional for a FF game, while still drawing a lot of inspiration from the previous entries, giving a sense of familiarity to series fans, while also making it feel very fresh and different. This difference is something that you may love or hate. Yes, there is a lot of ""mash A to win"" in the combat here, but once the game finally allows you to experience all of what the combat system has to offer, you'll understand that the addition of an ""auto battle"" menu option in battle doesn't actually dumb down or simplify the tried and true Final Fantasy combat, but instead shifts the tactical focus to clever use of the ""paradigm shift"" mechanic at the right times to dole out the damage, buff/debuff, heal, etc. What this ultimately means is FFXIII offers as much tactical potential in its combat as the previous games in the series, while making it feel much faster-paced and intense. It is extremely unfortunate that the game forcibly holds your hand for nearly 10 hours before finally letting you really get an idea of what this combat can offer, and another 15-20 hours on top of that to really let you go nuts with it, but if you can stick it out, you will be rewarded greatly.Visually, the game is still incredible looking, regardless of the fact that it came out nearly 5 years ago. The music is excellent as well, almost across the board, as is usually the case with the Final Fantasy series. As for the story and characters, it's a mixed bag, and definitely something that will differ based on personal tastes. For me, I didn't find much substance in either. There are certainly some flashy moments here and there, but I mainly looked forward to getting back to combat any time a cutscene popped up. "

												Looking for a review that's not full of complaints about the game being 720p and actually tells you something about the game itself? Here you go.(Skip to the bottom to see a summary of my review, and the improvements/drawbacks of the PC version compared to the console versions.)Should you buy this game? If you can enjoy a game for the visuals, music, and innovative battle system, then look no further. This game is for you. The sound and music are great, and despite it being 720p (no longer an issue) it looks fantastic compared to the console versions (I played it first on the PS3). The cutscenes are beautifully rendered. The battle system is fluid and gets quite fun at higher levels once you understand how it works (it's MUCH more complex than it initially seems).You'll enjoy this game if you can look past the flaws it has--namely the confusing plot, a few cheesy characters (In the English version at least. I'm looking at you, Vanille and Hope), and extreme linearity (Corridor Simulator of the Year). That being said, I still think it's worth playing FFXIII if for no other reason than to prepare for the FAR SUPERIOR FF XIII-2, which will be coming to Steam in the following months is also available on Steam. That game fixes a lot of these issues and has a better plot in my opinion, but you'll need to be familiar with the story in this game in order to understand what's going on in XIII-2.Especially considering the price, this game is one of the best JRPGS you'll find on Steam (granted there aren't many...yet). But you have to go into it expecting the flaws I mentioned above. If you can look past them, you'll enjoy it. Final Fantasy XIII has never looked better, even at 720p. However, if you're looking for a plot that will move you, deep characters, or an open world to explore, this is probably not what you're looking for.Pros:+Fantastic visuals+Fantastic soundtrack+Interesting battle system (requires a fair bit of time to get used to)+Lightning is cool+Sazh is awesome+Good controller support. But you need to change the option in the settings to display Controller prompts rather than keyboard prompts.Cons:-What on earth is going on in the story? I still can't really tell you.-Too many hallways/corridors to run through during the first half, though it does open up a bit more after 20 hours. You may develop Claustrophobia before then, though.-Vanille and Hope. You'll see what I mean. Although they're far less cheesy if you use Japanese audio.Length: 40-50 hours depending on your speed and how much of the side stuff you complete.PC version improvements:+Higher frame rate than the console versions (60 fps)+Japanese audio! The US console versions did not include this feature.+Possibility of mods. Who knows, maybe someone can mod Vanille and Hope out of the game entirely.(This list will be updated if I discover more.)PC version drawbacks:-It's only 720p. This is a bit of a disappointment, and hopefully it will be patched or modded to run in higher resolutions. Though it still looks much better than console versions. Download GeDoSaTo to run it in higher resolutions.-The Esc button exits the game. This is beyond annoying. Mod please!(This list will be updated if I discover more.)Closing remarks: Buy this game if you have ANY desire AT ALL to see Final Fantasy XV or Kingdom Hearts III on Steam one day. Although I say that half-seriously, there is some truth to it. If this series sells well and Square Enix sees that there is enough demand for their console games on PC, it only makes sense that other previously console-exclusive games will follow.			"

												I wrote out a massive review and steam ate it, for now I will say that the game is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be and not nearly as good as others claim. In my view it was boringly average. I didn't enjoy the combat system and the story never really connected with me, which are two elements the game really is built upon.There is a lot of depth in the battle system but the game takes far too long teaching you how it works before it really gets fun. It isn't a 20 hour tutorial but expect the first 3-6 chapters (depending on how many jrpgs you have played) to be tutorials. The story has some cringeworth dialogue (Snow will never be likeable in my eyes) but the characters do change in interesting ways and there are alot of cool ideas here, I just feel like it was lost amongst many Terms and Names. It will take several chapters (for me about 6) before you really start to grasp what is going on.I would never go out of my way to suggest this game to someone, it really doesn't do a lot for me.If someone did come up to me saying they were intrigued by this game and wanted to know my opinion I would tell them to pick it up on a sale however since they may fall in love with it.Like FF X and FF VIII and FFXII, it is a love it or hate it type game. Just know that the first 6 hours can be really rough and painful, but those who stick with it will be rewarded with one of the most deceptivly unique battle systems in a video game. Never before has turn based gameplay felt so fast and intense.			"

												Unless you've somehow never heard of Final Fantasy before, chances are you've seen or heard about those immature rage-filled arguments between fans of the series over which game is the best, which is the worst, and the torrent of insults, allegations, and assumptions made about each person who disagrees with which of the Final Fantasy games are good or bad. I've seen -less- attempts to undermine someone's character and credibility in political campaigns.  Too many fans have been jackasses to one another about these games, often claiming certain entries in the series do nothing right, or that they have no flaws. It is my intention to inform users about FFXIII without ignoring its problems or overstating them, and to give my personal opinion on the game, which is not ""right"" or ""wrong"" because what makes each gamer enjoy a game or dislike a game differs from person to person. For example, John might prefer FFIV because the game has pre-determined character classes for each playable character, while another player named Greg might prefer FFI because you choose your character classes on your own. There are multiple legitimate arguments for -both- of these systems, and being completely put off by either of these games simply due to these systems is legitimate as well. However, neither of these two hypothetical players are ""wrong"" or deserving of being on the receiving end of jackassery.Space is really tight, so I've shortened the above as best I can while keeping its meaning, and will be presenting it in a Q&A fashion with common negatives brought up about the game as the questions. So, without further ado~Q. PC Port, good or bad? I've been hearing bad things...A. I'm naive when it comes to framerates. It looked and played great on my PC, which was close to the top of the line when Wolfenstein The New Order launched. Mouse/keyboard controls worked great, too, and can be freely remapped! You may want to read into reviews of gamers who are more tuned into framerates if that's really important to you. =)Q. I hear this game is like one big curving hall? That's just people exaggerating, right?A. It's not a bad descriptor. I want to be fair to this game, but you are funneled toward your objective the entire time except for one very large map 20-32 hours into the game. A couple of turns will briefly take you away from your objective to go grab an item, but you will be right back in the ""hall"" again soon enough. Also, there are no traditional towns/cities to visit and NPCs are rare. Items are all bought at save points from online shops, and I didn't buy -anything- until I was maybe 50 hours into the game. You could forget shops are even in the game because they're not necessary until post-game. However, despite the hallway issue, almost every environment is insanely gorgeous, with lots of soft electronic music featuring female vocals, violin, and piano. I loved it, and my senses were blissfully deceived into not caring about the ""hall""/shops/NPCs decision.Q. This is a JRPG. How much grinding do I have to do? A. There are no random battles. Enemies can all be seen in the distance. If you're just going to complete the storyline, kill almost every enemy encounter you spot, and you'll likely be maxed out much of the time. The leveling system is like FFX's sphere grid, except more is unlocked when you beat certain bosses, and it lacks much choice until about the time you finish the storyline. It didn't ruin the game for me or anything, but manually choosing upgrades seemed to lack purpose for most of the game. Back on topic of grinding, though, if you want to do the optional post-game stuff, you could spend far more time getting your stats maxed and getting rare drops. Trapezohedrons are necessary to start getting the best weapons, and despite spending hours trying to get just one, I never did. The post-game is many players' favorite part of FFXIII, but for me, it was a massive time suck without any pay-off because I was just unlucky with item drops despite following the advice of multiple walkthroughs on item farming. I'm glad I did it because I wanted to be thorough in my review, but I don't believe I will ever bother to do the post-game stuff again if I play through the game another time as it was a miserable experience for me that made me look back on the game less fondly. To get through the mind-numbing grind boredom, I had to Youtube and read to keep from quitting.Q. How are the characters?A. I liked most of them. A character named Hope is angry during the first 15 or so hours of the game, and he can make you hate him a -lot-. Unfortunately, his Magic stat is the best in the game, and he's the best Medic, so he'll probably end up on your team. =(  A character named Vanille is the stereotypical Japanese entertainment ""cute young girl,"" but I didn't really find her annoying most of the time. However, in combat, she makes sounds like she's having whiny intercourse, which may be a plus for some people, but it gets pretty old in my opinion. Each character is best at one particular role, and decent in others. Although you'll probably have a favorite all-purpose team, there are situations where it is advantageous to temporarily use different characters, so I liked that.Q. Some people say the storyline is amazing and some say it's the worst one ever written for a FF game. Which is it?A. If you don't overthink the plot, it's entertaining. However, if you start asking questions and applying logic to much of it, the storyline unravels quickly. A fellow on Youtube named Noah who goes by ""Spoony"" does a very hateful review of FFXIII, which I find to be excessively harsh, but he makes -some- valid points about the storyline which I can't argue with. The plot has some major issues, but I wouldn't call it terrible.Q. I hear the summons in this game aren't very useful? Really? They're amazing in virtually all the other FF games!A. The summons have incredibly specific uses to exploit certain things in the game, like knocking Adamantoises over for easy kills and preventing one enemy from curing itself of poison. I found summons useless for about 95% of fights. Each character gets exactly one summon (called an Eidolon). They are Transformers. No kidding. They look like robots or weird humanoids and transform with folding/sliding/rotating parts into a car, horse, etc. It's kinda awesome. That said, they really are useless most of the game, to the point that I feel they should have been left out in their current state, and better alternatives to the aforementioned exploits should have been offered instead.Q. I heard the game plays itself and you don't pick your attacks. Is that true?A. You control one character in your 3-person party, and can choose auto-battle for that character, or specific abilities, and can then manually pick each attack. Auto-battle basically tells the character to do the obvious thing the character should do. I'm fighting an ice monster. I've used a spell to ID it so my characters know it's weak to fire. If I switch my character to an attack magic job (ravager), of -course- I want to attack with fire, and that's what the game does. The game knows what my intentions are by clicking auto-battle. Making me select fire is pointless. If I want to inflict negative status effects, I'll manually change jobs to do so. I do not see any loss of agency, but I can understand that some players may feel deprived of that agency due to older entries making you manually choose everything. Also, prideful players might feel that playing a game with a button labeled ""auto-battle"" makes them look weak or won't enable them to brag about their victories, so if either of those are an issue for you, you may wish to pass on FFXIII.I have issues with FFXIII, but it's a feast for my eyes and ears which I had a blast with prior to the post-game, and would recommend it to fans of JRPGs who aren't put off by the issues I discussed.

												Very good game PROS-One of the most unique and amazing combat systems you will ever experience. Very exhilarating.-Many beautiful locations in the game. No stone was left unturned as far as visuals go.-Many different enemy npcs. Encounters rarely become repetitive.-Excellent pacing. There is like 5 hours worth of cutscenes in the game. Its all mixed very well with the gameplay.-Lots of crazy unexpected boss fights which require precise button mashing. Very intense. Much sweaty palms.-The music is great. Some stuff seemed a bit repetitve but the battle themes and boss fight themes were really good.  -Difficulty is just right. Not too hard and not too easy.-The last couple chapters in the game was really good. -Choice of Japanese or English audio. CONS-The story can be a bit vague at times. Some ingame datalog reading is required to get a better grip on things.-Some of the characters are kind of bad. But they turn out to be so useful in combat you will eventually like them.-Can't customize clothes on playbable characters. They're all dressed like a bunch of bums.-Lazy port with no video settings. (patched 2 months after release) I don't understand why there is so much hatred for this game. The Final Fantasy fanbase can be very repulsive sometimes for whatever reason. I guess this is one of those games people really love to hate. I found very little wrong with it. Its not perfect by any means but as far as quality goes this is probably the best 15 bucks you can spend on steam right now. The attention to detail and art design from Square Enix is just extraordinary. The whole experience is filthy rich from start to finish. Its one of very few modern day AAA Japanese games. So play it.9 out of 10			"

												The Final Fantasy fanbase is a bunch that cannot make up it’s mind. With each new installment, you have a faction of the fanbase who wants the old, classic ATB battle system back. Then you also have the faction that wants something new and edgy. Anytime Square-Enix delivers one or the other, the fanbase causes an uproar….wanting the other! With this in mind, know that with Final Fantasy XIII….you will either love it or hate it, depending on which faction you belong to. Final Fantasy XIII is a great game.It's fairly linear though, but that doesn't hinder it in a bad way. It actually brings the story to the forefront of the game experience. Final Fantasy X was exactly the same, but is praised by fans as being one of the best FF titles to date (very close to VII), while FFXIII got a lot of hate after it’s initial release. Why is FFXIII different?That's the thing: It's not!Final Fantasy XIII takes place in a society called Cocoon, which exists in a large sphere that hangs in the sky over the world of Pulse. The citizens live in constant fear of invasion from the surface after an attack centuries earlier cracked open the shell of their world, and rely entirely on the fal'Cie, godlike creatures that provide Cocoon with everything it needs to exist — food, weather...even light. While Cocoon's fal'Cie are revered as benevolent protectors, the fal'Cie of Pulse are feared and demonized, to the point that anyone who comes in contact with anything from Pulse is considered tainted. When a Pulse fal'Cie is discovered in their own society, a chain of events leads the government to purge an entire city of civilians, and leads six strangers to become l'Cie, servants of the Pulse fal'Cie who must complete their appointed task or suffer a fate worse than death.The story is fast-paced and filled with mysteries that unravel as the game progresses, and it's paced perfectly, with cutscenes popping up as you move through each area. The characters are also fantastic, each presenting themselves as a typical JRPG archetype in the beginning, but quickly showing much more depth. Furthermore, each character is tied to the story of the game; there are no incidental characters filling out your party, and likewise there is no main character. Final Fantasy XIII is about the overall group, and this is further emphasized by dividing them into separate groups on separate paths before they join together again for the second half.Final Fantasy XIII's weakest link is unfortunately the beginning. The first few hours of the game see keywords like Pulse, l'Cie, and fal'Cie thrown at you without any context or explanation to their meaning. The characters also lack any kind of development for the first few hours, and the result is a confusing plotline with uninteresting characters that leaves a terrible first impression.  The combat system is completely stripped of the depth is shows later on. The player barely needs to pay attention for these early battles, and coupled with some extremely linear level design, the first three hours are unquestionably a low-point for both the game and the series.And then Final Fantasy XIII really begins. The Crystarium, the game's answer to leveling up, becomes available, and likewise so does the Paradigm system, the meat and potatoes of Final Fantasy XIII's combat system. When this all becomes available, it becomes readily apparent why you've been spamming ""Auto-Battle"", and why you'll continue to spam it for the next fifty hours. The combat isn't about the nitty-gritty details of individual spells, it's about the overall strategy. Just as Final Fantasy XII gave you control through gambits, Final Fantasy XIII lets you play the general in the same way by rapidly changing between sets of classes in the heat of battle, altering tactics to suit the ever-changing situations that come up. The AI is extremely intelligent, and can select appropriate skills faster and with as much efficiency as most players, anyways.Each character has access to three primary classes, and the Paradigm system allows you to create customized class set-ups that you can switch between at any time during combat. If you're on the offensive, a Commando and two Ravagers can effectively decimate an enemy. If you're looking at a longer fight, a Saboteur/Synergist team can drastically increase your fighting power. Facing a powerful foe? Bring out a Sentinel and let them tank while the other two lay the hurt on. Each class has a unique and important purpose, and while most fights can be completed with different strategies, many of the boss fights require rather specific ones in order to be successful.The environments aren't the only amazing visuals Final Fantasy XIII boasts; the character/enemy models should not be sold short. The characters easily have some of the most realistic and believable facial expressions ever produced in a video game. Every emotion the characters experience is mirrored flawlessly on their face, and while the designs retain a hint of anime influence, they are still shockingly realistic.Of course, this realism would be marred without solid vocal support, and for the most part Final Fantasy XIII delivers it. While not quite approaching the level of quality seen in Final Fantasy XII, the vocal cast of XIII nonetheless perform admirably, and this in spite of the lengthy monologues each character performs on a regular basis, true to form for a JRPG. The only weak point in the vocals is Vanille, which in the early parts of the game is rather grating. To her credit, the performance improves dramatically.The musical score is also excellent. The main battle theme is similarly exciting and gets stuck in your head easily. While wandering dungeons, the music gets a bit more eclectic. Other tracks deviate from the usual, melodic Final Fantasy style and delve instead into techno and other styles.Like Final Fantasy XII before it, Final Fantasy XIII has unquestionably caused cause a rift between those who love it and those who don't. As long as you don't judge the game on its beginning, Final Fantasy XIII is a game worthy of the series, and a terrific game.

												This is the first Final Fantasy I have completed, I had FFX on the PS2 but got stuck at the blitzball tournament and never went back to it. FFXIII seems to be a divisive game for people, with a lot of fans of the old games hating the linearity of this one, and some or all of the characters in 13.Regarding the linearity, it is incredibly linear for most of the game, with you just running along straight paths fighting enemies. Once you get to chapter 11 it opens up and you can explore and run around in this massive field (you even get a chocobo to ride to get around faster), with these huge dinosaur turtle creatures and sh*t you can fight. This is a really cool area, but if you really don’t like the linearity of the game I wouldn’t recommend you buy it and persevere till you get to that part. There are 13 chapters in the game and that is the 11th, which is more than 30 hours through the game! You are close to the end at that point, I honestly wondered why they even had an open section at all, I was used to the linear paths.I don’t usually play turn based RPG’s so I have nothing to compare the combat system in this to, but it does a good job of easing you into it, at first it’s a cake walk, I had no issues for the first 10 hours. There are 6 main characters you get to play as, but in battles you can only equip 3, but at the beginning as the characters split up, you go between fighting with 3 equipped to only being able to use 2 at some points for story reasons. This gave me some trouble early on, with one or two boss fights, like most RPG’s grinding would make those encounters a lot easier.I had to use a guide to defeat some bosses later on, there really seemed to be only 1 or 2 methods that worked on them and if you don’t know what you’re doing you could be there hours without a guide, but most of the time I had no problem, though I did grind for a few hours to level my characters up (also with a guides help to find the best places to grind).There is a ton of secondary boss fight missions you can attempt once you get to chapter 11 (63 in total I think) so there is plenty here for you to do, I put in 70 hours at the time of writing this and I still have about 5 missions left to do. If you don’t feel like doing those then you should be able to complete the main story in 55 – 60 hours.I bought this game for the story more than the combat, and this is the other area people have a problem with. I liked the characters, but some people had issues with Lightning being stoic through the whole story, but the other 5 characters all have different personalities, and each of them has their own story and arc through the game, so even if you don’t like Lightning or find her boring, the story is always shifting between all 6. This is really an ensemble cast of characters, even though they heavily promoted Lightning in all the marketing/trailers and covers for the game. In the first game it's an ensemble anyway, in the second one you might only get to play as her sister, and in the third you may only get to play as lightning (though they do feature the other 5 characters in the story still).This should go without saying but the game looks visually amazing, and the architecture and creature design is unique to a Japanese mindset, so as a westerner I enjoyed it. There are many CGI cut scenes throughout, which I enjoyed because I got the game for the story, but if you only want gameplay and minimal story that could be an issue for you.The port has some issues, outside of combat I would get 60fps if I turned off the mini map, in combat it dropped to 30, I noticed it dropped as low as 24fps once or twice. I tried a few different methods to try and fix it and none of them worked. This wasn’t an issue for me because the game’s turn based, so the camera is in a semi fixed position when fighting, it didn’t really bother me when playing. NOTE: my pc is pretty good (I7,R9 290), if you have a mid or low range PC it might not run as well for you.If you found this review helpful then spin around in your chair, if you don’t have a chair that can spin then do what I do and drink heavily until the world starts to spin for you.

												I know many people hate this game. Į hated it at some point too, but in the end i fell in love with it. I love Final Fantasy series and FFXIII is no exception.Many people complain about it being a bad port. Yes there‘re some fps drops. It‘s either 60fps or 30fps usually. Lowest i‘ve seen was ~20fps. It‘s no matter what PC you have, fps will drop anyway. But it‘s not a big problem for me. The game still looks beautiful, you want to take screenshot after screenshot. And it plays well too. Considering the price i think the port is good. It costs less or the same as some short, small indie games. Yes it is a port of an old game, but you can‘t expect developers to redo everything and release it at the current price of 13€. I‘m thankful to SE and i hope to see FFXV on steam someday.Battle system has changed since the last Final fantasy games. The battle system In final fantasy XIII is faster and less boring. I‘m not saying the battle system was bad in previous games, but i really like this new faster system. Now you have paradigms which you need to change constanly in a fight. Maybe it looks not so fun at the start, but when you finally get to the chapter 11 where you can start hunting monsters it gets really interesting and fun. You need think of a strategies for different enemies. Buffs and debuffs means a lot in this game. You can‘t beat a strong enemy without them.People also complain about it being only corridors. Yes it is in a way, but as i remember previous FF games were linear too. This doesn‘t bother me. You run, you fight enemies to get stronger and get more money. Same as in other rpg‘s.Maybe the game is not very good as Final fantasy title, because there‘s barely anything left in common with the series, but as a jrpg it‘s good. I loved it and i recommend it to everyone who wants to play a beautifully looking game with a pretty good (but very frustrating story at times), fun battle system and interesting characters and of course awesome cut-scenes.

												I had this for PS3 and decided to rebuy it for PC since I no longer have a PS, and this was one of my favorites.I'm quite old now and have been playing the Final Fantasy series since the very first one was released in the late 80's (I bought it the first week it came out!).  I always have high expectations for a new FF game, more so then any other RPG.FF13 is a good game, and despite what other reviews say, it's far from bad.  Yes, there are parts where it drags out )Chapter 4 ugh), but for the most part it's an above average turn based RPG with graphics still on par with games released in 2014.  The cinematics (which make up more then half the game) are extremely well done, and still look great today.   My only gripe is that the PC port shipped at 720p and you need to download an addon to make it play at 1080.  It was very easy to install.  All in all, if you like RPG's and have $15 to spare, pick up FF13!			"

 It's kind of amazing how ungratefull some people are... Of course it's a direct port from consoles. But they made it. And its cheap like dirt. Some pixel indie games costs more.Years ago every console gamer played at 720p and it was ok! BUT now it's 2016!While playing with gamepad there's absolutely no problem with gameplayIt's a good tendency that some developers making ports for their games on PC even 3 years later from their release date on console. We should support them... not spit them in the face.The story is interesting, the characters are great and the game-play is neither too easy, nor too hard, just fun. I've played most of the games in the series, and this one isn't as bad as others say. It's really worth the price.Music is loyal to the FF charm, and the story make sense most of the time and the voice acting is amazing on either Jap or Eng.Also you will be playing a good amount of time ( I played for 45 Hours but i kinda rushed threw it at the start game)Oh and just a tip: DONT SKIP ENEMYS... The Game will punish you for that....*RECOMMENDED*			"

												After waiting for 8 years to play this game and reading all the mostly negative reviews.. I booted up this game and was expecting a discounted Final Fantasy with more bugs than an Elder Scrolls game with a side of convoluted story telling to rival the Kingdom Hearts series. I was surprisingly pleased, the graphics hold up even to some of todays AAA titles and the music is relaxing and immersive most of the time. Despite half the characters being obnoxious  and stereotypical, I really grew attatched to Lightning (the protagonist). Maybe I'm just glad to see a strong female lead who isn't crying  and needing to be saved half the time. The biggest ""flaw"" of this game is the way they convey the story. Half of the plot is told through 'datalogs', like an in-game encyclopedia. This game really is under appreciated and %90 of the negative reviews are because the game isn't 60 FPS or they saw a pixel out of place in a side character's shadow. If you don't mind reading and enjoy lengthy JRPGs, give this a shot.			"

												Although, I already spent >30h in playtime and will try to play it to the end I did not enjoy playing FF XIII.Don't get me wrong, it is technically well made, nice graphics, beatiful characters (though, it's nice graphics again), nice music. But that's it.Always the same fights, always the same animations, ridicoulusly linear levels which are only there to guide the player to the next fight. There is no level design at all, everything is just a ""straight"" tunnel. Fighting is extremely boring, pressing the same buttons again and again. You totally could stop caring what you do and start eating or doing other things. As long as you continue pressing the same buttoms you will probably win the fight. It's just stupid and boring (I know I already mentioned that it's boring, but it really is very boring).Unfortunately, this was the first part of the Final Fantasy series I played and it was not a nice one.

												I enjoyed Final Fantasy XIII. Admittedly, being a PC-exclusive gamer for the last decade or so, I haven't played too many JRPGs lately, and I was frankly thrilled to finally be able to play a modern Final Fantasy game on PC. Final Fantasy VI (SNES) is one of my favorite games of all time, and I've briefly played but never beat (rented back in the day) FF 7, 8 and 9. The game is as linear as they say, but I didn't really have a problem with it. I play Final Fantasy games primarily for the story and spectacle, and then the battles, and then very distantly the out-of-battle gameplay sections. FF13 performs strongly in the first two, so being pretty much completely linear for most of the game isn't really that big of a deal. I really enjoyed the story, and though some have complained that it's confusing or hard to follow, I found it easy enough to understand (though I did read all of the datalogs religiously, which definitely helps). Some stuff I really enjoyed are some new ""convenience features"" that basically remove most of the things I find annoying about JRPGs. Namely:-No random battles! You can see (and usually avoid) any enemy on the world map. -Your party is automatically healed and cured at the end of every battle (so you don't have to micromanage all that stuff yourself all the time)-If you die in battle, you can restart the battle immediately to try again, and it even starts you outside of battle so you can change your party/upgrades/paradigms or just run away. This even applies to boss battles!-No grinding - the game is somewhat challenging (though there's also an easy mode you can switch to at any time), but I never felt the need to stay in one area and grind experience before moving on. Grinding is boring and it's exclusion will not be missed.The battle system is really novel. You only control one character, and you have an ""auto-attack"" option (though you can still individually choose your attacks if you want). There are 6 different roles, and a combination of these roles is a paradigm. The main focus of battle is switching up your paradigms for the situation, sort of macro-managing the battle rather than micromanaging every single move. I found this quite an enjoyable change of pace from the same battle system that's been in FF for years.As an aside: yes, the port is horrible, and it's absolutely shameful that they'd lock such a beautiful game to 720p. Fortunately this is easily fixed with the program ""GeDoSaTo"" (created by legendary modder Durante, who also fixed Dark Souls 1). The framerate is weirdly inconsistent during battles (bouncing between 30 and 60, despite sitting at like 30% GPU load, and 10% CPU load) but it wasn't enough to put me off from playing the game.Overall I enjoyed my time spent with FF13. The game is absolutely gorgeous, especially at 1080p (I've taken several hundred screenshots during my playthrough), the story and characters are interesting (except Snow, ♥♥♥♥ that guy), and the battle system is fun and novel. My JRPG experience is admittedly a bit lacking, but I loved them back in the SNES days, and if FF13 is anything to go by, I still love them now.			"

												Final Fantasy XIII will take you on an adventure through a unique world with breathtaking graphics. FFXIII has an interesting, but complicated story. You will have access to detailed summaries of what's happened so far in the story and I recommend reading them if you ever forget or get confused with the story.FFXIII uses a unique (paradigm) combat system which is fun and easy to learn, but difficult to master.The PC version lets you use Japanese voices with English subtitles.

												If not for the terrible quality of the port, I'd say it's a mixed bag but overall I'd say it's worth getting if you're looking for a really long JRPG.The port is so terrible however, that I encourage everyone interested in this game, or SE's planned ports of FFXIII-2 and Lightning Returns to not get this game until SE improves the quality of this port and includes promises to improve the quality of future ports. At the very least;Resolution options, up to and including 1920x1080Rebindable keys, and don't have a key that just automatically quits the game without confirmation in fullscreen mode.Reduce the download size by not having every cutscene be downloaded twice. The install size is 58 GB because of this. Deleting the redundant files resuces it to 38 GB.Fix frame rate drops. Even users with very high end machines experience drops to ~30 FPS in moments.This is by no means an exhaustive list of the problems of the port, but without these fixes for FFXIII and future ports, I don't think I would be able to recomend any of these games to anyone.

												First time I tried this game I really didn't like it, even after investing 40+ hours into it. It's very different from other Final Fantasy games, which I found immensely disappointing, and that put me in a mood where I couldn't appreciate anything the game had to offer because none of it is what I was looking to get out of it. It also annoyed me that the game launched with some performance/graphics issues.So, why recommend it? I came back to this game a year later with a totally different set of expectations. Instead of treating this as a typical Final Fantasy game, and thus expecting things like towns, an overworld, the attack/magic/item combat, leveling, Cid, Biggs and Wedge references, etc. (none of which this game has), I chose to approach this as if it were an interactive visual novel with a light Final Fantasy flavor. With all the chatty cutscenes and linearity, that's exactly what it feels like, and if you come in expecting it then this game is actually quite satisfying. tl;dr: Very nice game if you're looking for a visual novel with a heavy focus on combat and some light Final Fantasy themes. Very bad game if you're looking for anything that resembles the usual Final Fantasy experience.			"

- 59GB download with nothing to justify it (Cutscenes are 720p, NOT 1080p).- Japanese voice pack could've been added as free DLC to help minimize file size of the main game.- I had to use a mod to change my resolution (Really?).- Stuttering, I personally didn't get tons of it but so far it's happened 2 or 3 times in certain locations.- No audio options at all.- ESC instantly quits the game with no warning. (If you're in windowed mode the quit warning actually appears, but why would you want to play in a 1280x720 window?)- Key bindings are awful (Use a controller).+ 60FPS.+ They added Japanese audio on EU/NA Steam packages for hardcore weeaboos.Hopefully we'll see more FF games on PC, and hopefully they pay attention to these issues on later ports and fix them.

												Final Fantasy XIII on PC is the best version of the game you can get your hands on. This game in my eyes, is an absolute masterpiece as well as the rest of the trilogy, being a near perfect game that takes me through one of the most incredible adventures I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. That being said, I will be looking through this game without my incredible love for the game and will analyze and talk about each part of the game. While this game may be the best game in the world for me, most players may see it being around an 8 out of 10.// Gameplay - Field //First I'd like to get into the gameplay of this game. Final Fantasy XIII, like most JRPGs and just about every other Final Fantasy game, is a linear journey for a majority of the game. The game has very little areas to branch off and explore into and has a straight path to follow making it so you'll never get lost. Many people hate on this game for this very reason but the thing is, almost every Final Fantasy game is just as linear as Final Fantasy XIII. Look at IV, VI, and VII... some of the most beloved games in the series. The games merely give you the illusion of an open world, but no matter what you do, you're thrown into a world map and given a linear path to follow. You must always go from Town A, to Town B, to Dungeon A, to Town C. The game will force you down the same path every single time. The difference in this game? They don't try to hide it under some pretty world map.// Gameplay - Combat //The combat in Final Fantasy XIII is completely in real time. When battles start, you will have control over your party leader while the other characters are controlled by good AI. I've never once really felt the need to take control over anyone else. You will have everyone set into a different class known as a paradigm. Before battle, you select up to six paradigms you'd like to go into combat with. For instance, one of your paradigms can include a COM, RAV, RAV which would have a damage dealer focused on slowing down the chain gauge and the casters building it up to eventually generate a stagger to severely weaken the opponent. From this point you can make the decision to keep building that gauge up for heavily increased damage up to 999.9% then switch to a full set of Commandos for absolute punishment that you may or may not have enhanced with a Synergist's Bravery and/or Faith.Combat in this game is very challenging as you get further in, and what starts off as a simple mashing of the confirm button with occasional Paradigm Shifts, becomes a deep and complex combat system where you will find yourself getting punished if you dare use the auto-battle. Many people complain about Auto-Battling, but the truth of the matter is that Final Fantasy XIII isn't the only game adding this in their games and those who find themselves using it will never beat the game and find themselves experiencing countless deaths, which occur if your party leader dies.Combat is strategic and wants you to think with a tactical viewpoint. Every enemy has weaknesses and ailments they are vulnurable, or resistant to. Your goal is to discover those weaknesses, and find a way to exploit them. Bosses will require a great deal of strategy later into the game and will stretch your understanding of the combat system to it's limits, especially the 64 mark missions available in the post-story gameplay.Monsters also don't award Exp or Gil in the traditional RPG sense. Instead they reward something known as CP or Crystogen Points. This can then be used to enhance your character's abilities down 6 massive trees. Each tree represents your paradigm and while you start off with a few at the beginning of the game, you eventually unlock access to all six. Every character has trees they are good at, or bad at and in no instances will you find yourself using Hope as a Commando, however the stat bonuses learned from the trees still make them worth going through once you've mastered the other roles. Every paradigm has a passive ability that stacks with the more of that role you have in combat. If you head in with three Commandos compared to one, you'll find your damage output across all characters MUCH higher. There are also Synthesized Abilities the game never brings up and keeps a shady secret. Essentially these are abilities that are created when you equip a certain combination of a weapon and accessories that belong in a set. Some of these bonuses can be very mild such as adding extra damage with specific elements, to giving you faster ATB recharging, making your attacks heal you, or even making you invincible to physical attacks or magical attacks! The game rewards those who like to play around with different builds and using these synthesized abilities can severely make the difference in some fights between life and death.... As for Gil.... it's the most valuable thing in the world and should NEVER be spent unless absolutely necessary as no monsters drop gil, it is a pain to find. The only way to obtain Gil in this game is to obtain an item that can be sold for a premium and sell it. These items PURELY exist to be the method to bring in Gil, you don't start seeing many of these until a decent bit into the game however... luckily you don't need to really buy anything from the shop for the beginning of the game as most items are easily won from battles.// Characters //The characters are incredible and have many various personalities and great background stories to each one. I instantly fell in love with these characters, every single one being great and interesting. The game has lots of character development, ESPECIALLY Chapter 7 in the story. Lightning is trying to deal with the fear of being alone and lashes out in anger, Hope tries to deal with losses in his life and revenge. Every character goes through so much, and at the end of their journey, they've become very interesting characters.// World //Final Fantasy XIII is a sci-fi game, taking place primarily on a large floating world known as Cocoon, which like the name suggests, is a hollow, artificially built world where everyone lives along the inside shell. Their technology is much more advanced thanks to the Fal'Cie, a race of machines with god-like power. The game has many terms you will learn as the game goes on and gives such a great immersive experience. The designs of the world, airships, airbikes, and much more are so interesting and the world itself is an absolute beauty, especially after reaching Chapter 11 where you're dropped off in the untamed wilderness of Gran Pulse, the lowerworld much more like our own in the manner that it's a planet and not an artificially made shell.// Mythos and Story //The trilogy heavily revolves around the Fabula Nova Crystallis Mythology, and while it isn't required, it is HEAVILY advised you go brush up on this mythos and possibly the official Novella Episode Zero before going into the game to have some knowledge of the backstory to this game. The game has two stories, the story of the gods, and the story of our party. And while this game focuses on the characters, the true story is the struggles and battles between these gods and truly knowing the mythos, opens up eyes as the game, instead of being a story of fugitives running from the government, becomes a story about our party and their influence with these gods and their battles. The story is deep, complex and the most incredible story I have ever found myself enjoying and while it is difficult to get into as many people don't even realize there is this mythology and backstory behind it, if you go in looking for it and wanting to learn more about this world, it won't disappoint you.Wonderful game that I would heavily recommend to anyone who enjoys a good story and wonderful music. Lacks many PC options players expect, but will be added in soon. Do yourself a favor if you enjoy stories, characters, and music and buy this game.			"

												Awesome game! Although it's a very linear game, it's still very enjoyable. At first you might think this game is just pressing x (auto-battle) constantly, win the battle, rinse, repeat, but just wait until you reach the part where the crystarium is unveiled. Basically after each battle you earn Crystogen Points and you use them to unlock abilities and stats on the Crystarium, which is a sort of FFX sphere grid. There are also 6 different roles, each of them having their own abilities, stats, and different magics. So for example you can assign one character the role of physical attacker, the other one might be a healer, and the last one might be a support character. Or maybe you want two attackers and one magic user! You choose their roles, and the beauty of it is that one character might have several roles in just one battle (especially the end-game content.)If you're a hardcore rpger, just wait till you get to the endgame content, hunting marks and achievements, I assure you, you will have a great time, especially those bosses where you just can't find the way or tactic to beat them, and then you finally realize which combination of roles to use. In my opinion this is a very rewarding game.Story-wise, I have to say that I really enjoyed the narrative and characters. Although there are a few lines that make you say ""WTF was that?"", I have to say that most of the script was pretty enjoyable.I remember playing it back in the day when it came out, so this was my second play-through, and I have to say that I enjoyed it as much as the first time. Got the ps3 platinum trophy back in the day, and 100% now!Finally, do I recommend this game?! YES YES! BUY IT NOW! Pros - Battle System (Very dynamic and action-paced, constantly changing roles)- Graphics- Voice acting (Both English and Japanese are great)- Music (Hamauzu did a great job)- Mark hunting is awesome! Especially the last ones Cons - Unstable fps :( (I recommend using Gedosato)- Moms are tough- Leona Lewis ending theme- Corny dialogue here and there			"

												Unpopular opinion; this is a great game with decent characters.Maybe I have a rather different view not being a Final Fantasy person (not played any others, though I have been exposed to bits and pieces over the years) and the game certainly doesn't try to hide its linearity like most RPGs do. But from a game design point of view it really isn't that much more linear than a lot of western heavy story focused RPGs (I'm looking at most BioWare RPGs here). I'd have preferred they at least *tried* to hide the fact and made it a bit more open but for the story they were telling it fits.Perhaps the FF tropes of characters (I hear that there has been an infestation of broody, aloof, emo protags) has gotten to the point that people are tired but, coming from a new persepctive, I didn't find Lightning grating. While the rest of the cast varied none struck me as awful (by the end, after characters arcs) as people like to rant about.Worth giving it a go if you like RPGs, especially if you aren't a hardcore FF / JRPG type.

												After hearing all the complaints about this game I really did not feel it was as bad as people are making it out to be. It may not be the most amazing Final Fantasy title but it's a solid JRPG with fantastic music as you would expect from Square Enix and an interesting take on the battle system. It may not be a strong entry point for people new to the Final Fantasy series though.			"

												Alright, let's start with the good things.+ Nice graphics+ Good combat with nice flow+ Option to choose weither to use english or japanese voice actors (thankfully, the english version is horrible).+ There's a beautiful cutscene at one point in the game when one of the characters cry.+ The end-game badasses are pretty hard.+ Achievements+ Trading cards+ Never crashedNow for what I believe are the bad things.- Corridors, the game is one really long corridor. It's not disguised as having options. You literally walk on corridor-like platforms in a straight line for almost the entire game.- You can't talk to people.- There is almost nothing to explore.- The vast majority of item drops are ""XP""-gain items that are sacrificed to level up equipment. Sounds good? It's not. There's like a hundred different ones, give or take most of them do the same as the next with a very minor difference. Could easily remove 90-95% of them from the game without it having an impact whatsoever.- An all-time-access shop (well, on save points but they're everywhere pretty much) that has EVERYTHING.- There's no cash, just item drops (remember the XP-gain items?) from monsters. Drop rates are very low and selling things give close to nothing unless you got a rare drop from one of the end-game monsters (who are harder than every other boss in the game). Still, you need that cash to get the end-game items from the shop.- Very few secrets to be found.---------------------------------I love the genre, both FF and JRPG but I can't recommend this game. It became decent in chapter 13 because after a very loooooong corridor I finally got to run around in a little park instead.All in all, if you're a must-have-em-all then go for it, when it's on a sale and you already got every other FF game while being ready for a huge disappointment.I give the game a 2 out of 5.

												The game overall is great, I wish we had more Final Fantasy games on Steam, but one major improvement that needs to happen is better optimization for your games. Port them better and give your players options and the money will follow. Think about the player experience first and as a result you as developers will be rewarded handsomely every time by the loyalty of your fans; provide us the service we expect from great developers like you. Looking forward to the future titles with the improvements listed below if you decide that this game doesn't deserve your attention!SUPPORT CUSTOM RESOLUTIONS!1080p support at a minimum! Some people have weird monitors with weird Aspect Ratios. This stuff is important!-This game needs to use multithreading (using more than a single CPU core), because that is the core issue behind the unstable framerate. That is the priority because even if they add 1080p without fixing this issue first, you will have 1080p with 30-60 frames skipping wherever they want anyway, like it is right now. Most people here at the bare minimum use a Quad-Core CPU, and thus would like to put it to full use, even Alan Wake which came out on PC a few years ago makes full use of all cores in multicore CPU's. The game is being bottlenecked by only utilizing a single core, so no matter how strong your graphic card may be, the game will struggle to run even on high-end machines. FULL SET OF GRAPHICS OPTIONS!Allow users to change Antialiasing, Anisotropic Filtering, V-sync, Shadow Resolution etc.-Better optimization for the game so that it can run better for different graphic cards (AMD, Nvidia). Some people run it perfectly fine without any issues, and some people can't run it at all due to unplayable frame rates and other graphical issues.LET USERS CHOOSE WHICH LANGUAGE THEY WANT TO DOWNLOAD!The Dual Audio support is a welcome feature, but you've nearly doubled the size of the download! 60GBs is no joke! I'd like to be able to right-click the game in my library, and have the option to uncheck Japanese Audio. Simple! Or have an optional DLC download for the people that want the extra option. For free of course. REPLACE THE CURRENT CUTSCENES WITH PS3 QUALITY CUTSCENES!!!When FFXIII was released on XBOX360, the cut scenes were downgraded to fit the smaller disk size. Why have you done the same here!? It will take up even more HDD space to have better quality cut scenes and some people might not like that, so create an option of an HD High Resolution Texture Pack DLC, another free DLC; giving your customers options is a good thing. ENABLE FORCE FEEDBACK FOR SUPPORTED GAMEPADSThe Vibration/Rumble on controllers seem to add a little more suspense to the gameplay and cutscenes, as you already know I'm sure; since the console versions supported it, why not here? Square, you need to fix these problems. I have some predictions about what's going to happen here. You're going to see articles on Kotaku, Polygon, GameSpot,‎ etc. about what a terrible port this is, and about how modder’s have to step in and fix a game for your customers again. I think you'd rather not have that? I'm not going to pretend that I know how easy or hard it is to fix these problems, but I doubt it's beyond your abilities.GameSpot has created a good video indicating the major issues as well: http://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiii-for-pc-has-basically-no-graphic/1100-6422856/If you would just dedicate a few extra work hours to fixing these problems, you could change the reviews on the store page from ""MOSTLY NEGATIVE"" to ""MOSTLY POSITIVE"". If you deliver on this it will pay off, I promise you.Many people who purchased this game will not purchase the sequels and many who are on the verge of purchasing this product; will not because of the reasons listed above. Please Square Enix, we all know you can make things right!			"

												Objectively - looking at the facts - this is one of the best FFs since FF7.  Let's look at 6 key areas that supposed fans of the FF series cared about until this game came out:1) Story - This game's story is convoluted and stupid.  So is FF10's.  In FF10 they tell you one story for 90% of the game and then the last 10% of the game they say, ""Nope!  There's an immortal wizard casting a spell to make everyone believe that this is what's happening!""  Great story, bro.  FF8's story is objectively bad, too.  You grew up with these people and you don't even remember them?  And I LOVE FF10 and FF8.  But story is not some hallmark of the FF franchise that had been good until this one came out.  The story is no worse than many of the highly regarded entries in this series.  In fact, I would argue that most FFs' stories, when you actually sit down and plot it all out, are pretty nonsensical, and 13's fares worse because it is more recent and subject to higher standards.2) Characters - This is completely subjective.  I find the characters in this game to not really hit any of the highs that we got in previous entries, and a few of the characters were worse than your average FF character.  While my opinion is that this game has worse characters than most of the FFs since 7, I'm also not going to ignore the Cait Siths, Quina's, and Rikkus that exist in other FF games.3) Graphics - The graphics in this game are sublime, and compared to its 2009 competitors is every bit as cutting edge as the best graphical games of the series (and possibly better).  IMO, only FF7 was more awe inspiring (graphically) for the time it came out, and looking back at it I sometimes scratch my head as to how I came to that opinion.  FF13, in 2017, is a game that makes you say, ""Holy...THIS game is from 2009?!""4) Music - Like characters, this is something that's extremely subjective.  To me, this soundtrack is up there with the series' best.  While the series' best soundtracks likely had more heavyweight classic tracks, they also were bogged down by quite a few forgettable tracks.  And this soundtrack is the first FF soundtrack that I recall listening to where it felt like one cohesive vision.5) Gameplay - This is the first FF that I am aware of where the term ""high level gameplay"" actually means anything.  Think about past entries - what is ""high level gameplay"" in FF7?  Setting up a couple of cute materia combinations?  What is ""high level gameplay"" in FF8?  Spamming your limit break?  In FF13, true masters of the combat system can accomplish things in seconds that even a seasoned FF player would take 10s of minutes.  Take one of the bosses in this game - Proud Clad II.  Most walkthrough videos on youtube beat this fight in about 7-8 minutes.  A world class player can beat that fight in 55 seconds.  And it's not just true for that fight - there is a huge skill gap between casual players (which includes most FF fans who bash this game) and people who actually understand the intracacies of the combat system.  And it's not just a matter of looking up the right paradigm deck.  You actually have to ""git gud"".6) Endgame / Side content - This has been extremely hit and miss throughout FF's history.  FF7 pretty much hit on all counts - great optional end game content, optional bosses and areas, etc.  FF8 was hit and miss.  FF9 I didn't finish.  FF10 was mostly a miss.  FF13's sidequests include a series of 64 ""missions"" (boss fights), most of which are easy but a solid 1/3 are pretty difficult.  The hardest of these missions (and there are several that I would include in this category) are up there with any of the hardest endgame/optional bosses in the FF series.  In addition, in order to obtain all of the ultimate weapons you will need to grind a series of optional superbosses.  This is like grinding Ruby Weapon - it's not mindless...one little mistake and these bosses will eat you alive.  There are 3 of these optional superbosses to choose from.  I thought this was extremely rewarding - maybe not as diverse as FF7's optional content, but certainly some of the better optional content in the FF series.On the whole, OBJECTIVELY, when you take the nostalgia glasses off, this is a game that is right at home in the FF series.  Be very wary of anybody who complains that this game is ""press X to win"" - instead of listening to them, feel bad for them.  It's like somebody who played through the first Mass Effect as a straight shooter without using any biotics or tech, or played through Bioshock with just gunplay (and no plasmids), and then complaining that the gameplay is boring.  Of course it's boring - you didn't bother to explore what was so interesting about it.			"

												When Final Fantasy XIII was announced and over the months it was spoiled, I was very excited by the prospect of having a large, expansive RPG set in the FF multiverse, after all, what could be better than getting to experience all the thrills of exploration, political intrigue and vast wealth of content its predecessor provided, but this time on next gen hardware, right?As further details emerged sooner to release, of the return of battle transitions/arenas and constricted, linear level design, I began to worry and it was this that ultimately saw me leaving off of pre-ordering or buying at release, waiting instead to see what the reviews had to say about it all.When I read the reviews, my heart sunk and such was my disappointment with the direction in which they had decided to take this iteration in the series, that I did not buy it. I decided instead that if I were to play this game, then it would have to be long after my disappointment had subsided and I could experience and judge the game on its own merits and flaws.Fast forward 6 years and here I am, doing just that, unfortunately to find that my apprehension was fully justified. In judging this game on the basis that it is an action RPG, it's difficult to know where to begin cataloging it's problems, because they are truly numerous :-Appalling level designI have never played a video game featuring such uninspired, dull, unimaginative, unimmersive, constricted and down right lazy level design as this. In order for an RPG to consume me, I have to be able to explore it, get lost in it and become a part of it, I have to be in awe of it; overwhelmed by it, in order to enjoy playing within it.Where are the towns and villages? Where are the quirky shops and their vendors? Where are the townsfolk, all with their own stories to tell about the world they live in, thus providing you with a deeper, more empathetic understanding of the world you're to spend 100s of hours in? Thus far in my play through there aren't any, not a shop, not a village, not a single individual anywhere that has anything to say about what's going on, who you are, who you've been, who you might become, war and peace, personal intrigue, nothing... Outside perhaps of the FMV cut-scenes.Complete lack of story questsThe only story quest this game has, is the main story, there is ""literally"" nothing else to do in this game, no other paths to follow, nothing to do in order to enjoy the process of leveling up to face more difficult adversaries, or get over a skill plateau along the main story path. When you hit a road block, the only thing you can do about it, is aimlessly wander around, often just back and forth between save points along the ""corridor"" you're in, going through pointless battle after pointless battle in order to earn experience points. I have never known a game; an RPG no less, so utterly devoid of content as this one.Dire leveling systemThe Crystarium system in itself, is not bad, it's a pretty much run of the mill RPG leveling system, it works, there's little more to say beyond that. But that's where the positives end :-This game insists on continually putting you into parties of 2 along the way, leaving you utterly unable to designate and commit roles for characters without potentially crippling your ability to overcome obstacles, the espers/eidolons can be particularly troublesome in this respect, but hey that's fine right? Just leave off the main story path for a while and wander off to find some other interesting, immersive quests to fulfill, in order to level up in preparation for the task ahead? Nope, see the previous paragraph, this game has no other content in it, there is nothing else to do, anywhere, ever!The area leveling is absurdly unbalanced, you can enter into and overcome an easy battle, only to move less than 10 seconds along and then be confronted by a roadblock enemy 5 levels above your party. This leaves you completely unable to gauge which conflicts to enter into and which to avoid anywhere in the game and irrespective of what level your party is at. The roadblock enemies in this game plunge you into horrendously long battles that aren't boss battles, provide you with absolutely no pay off when you win them and half the time are completely inconsequential, they seem to exist solely to frustrate the player, push them back and siphon off huge wads of time out of your existence for no reason than the drag the game out.When you come up against any of several dozen of these roadblocks throughout the game, all you can do is just run backwards and forwards along whichever ""corridor"" you're in, repeating battles you've already won several dozen times over to earn experience and level up in order to progress and you can forget out doing anything else, as I've been keen to point out in this review, there just isn't anything, there's nowhere to explore, nobody to talk to, no story quests to undertake, there aren't even more than 1 or 2 (that I've found so far @63 hours in) radiant quests and when an RPG actually makes you feel like you need MORE radiant quests in it, that's a sure sign that the publisher has really dropped the ball.Battle transition screensI'm a big fan of nostalgia, but in this day and age, expectations have evolved somewhat with regards to how much freedom players expect an RPG to provide them with. Transitions were necessary in the 80s and 90s, because the hardware those golden RPGs of old ran on, had technical limitations that recent hardware does not. These transitions: being locked into doing something the game insists you must do, whether you want to or not, are annoying and intrusive. They were best left in the past, where they could be gazed back upon fondly, along with random encounters and any other ""roadblock mechanic"" that the hardware of yesteryear rendered necessary.ConclusionsHow a VG publisher with an RPG heritage as rich as SE, could demonstrate such a dire lack of understanding of what makes an RPG enjoyable, memorable and rewarding is completely beyond reason.Do I have anything good to say about Final Fantasy XIII? Well yes, a few things, but each with a downside at least as significant :-The FMV cut-scenes are excellent, but unfortunately, they don't make a great RPG.The characters are stylish and ooze potential, but they don't have any history, they feel stateless and abstract from the world they live in.The paradigm system is cool, but with party selection being so heavily restricted throughout, you're never given the opportunity to cut loose with it, develop strategies with it and enjoy it. How can you possibly develop say an excellent Sentinel and Medic, when the game unconditionally dumps them both, into a two man team and forces you into an obligatory duel you can't win, owing to limited offense, this game punishes you at every opportunity for trying to forge your own destiny. Mercifully, there are no quick time sequences, but the game is so hell bent against enabling you to play with any sense of freedom or choice, that the absence of this annoying game mechanic, cannot really be appreciated anyway.Above all, its best quality as a game, is to serve as an almost perfect template and reference to VG studios and publishers forward from its release, of how NOT to make an RPG.They say ""let sleeping dogs lie..."" and with this in mind, I honestly I wish I hadn't bought it.

												Even though there is a huge amount of bad opinions for this game, I still decided to buy it, and play it. I finished it without getting all achievements because I'm sure I'll play the game again one day. Here are my thoughts on overall quality of Final Fantasy XIII:When I first started playing this game, I felt just the same confusion as with every other game in the series. I had no idea what it's all about, and I only knew that I'm controlling Lightning, and a black dude with a chicken is following me. Just like all FF titles before, FF13 revealed the plot much later, and assembled a gallery of very interesting characters. A couple of plot-holes here and there are something Final Fantasy players are already used to, so I can't say everything is perfect. If you have ever played (and liked) any of the Final Fantasy games' stories, you'll like this one as well.The graphics are awesome, and beautiful. The wide variety of monsters, enemies and bosses is great, and the main characters, as well as all others, are well designed and interesting.I've read a lot about stuttering and graphics-related problems online, but I had no such problems while playing in 1080p maxed out.Music is not as spectacular as a FF-fan would expect, but it's still not bad. It just seems a little... poor.On the upside, voice acting is great, so we can easily forget about weird and awkward scenes like the HAHAHAHA scene form Final Fantasy X!If you like using a controller, you'll hate the game in the first couple of hours. It doesn't support many controllers, so the mappings are a little weird, but you can easily get used to them. A big con is that the game didn't any re-mapping options. It's okay, but I can imagine many players get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥as hell because of this.So, to come to the conclusion:Final Fantasy XIII is a wonderful game, with lots of gameplay, missions, interesting characters, mediocre music, and bad gamepad-controls. Whoever said it's a bad game, or a bad port should stick to Call of Duty, because this is no game for them.Personally, I liked it, and I'll most definitely play it again.My score: 8.7/10			"

												I've always been a fan of the Final Fantasy Series and I believe that FFXIII didn't disappoint me in the slightest.The story was slightly confusing to me in the beginning because I was hearing about all of this terminology and factions that I couldn't differentiate between but, eventually, I managed to sort out who the good guys were and who the ""bad guys"" were, AKA everyone else. I found the story to be a mix of lots of action, sprinkles of romance, and about a cup of sadness. I did get frustrated at some points because, in the beginning, it feels like the story isn't progressing at all, but eventually you will realize that a lot was going on in the beginning.The soundtracks were absolutely amazing. Take away about 10 hours from my play time and that's the time I spent staring at the cutscene that plays once you enter the game and the music that plays. Sometimes I just had to stop and listen to the music and realize around 2 hours later that I hadn't done a single thing.As expected, the characters and the world itself were very beautiful and awesome. Lightning is now my #1 female FF character. I think the characters, appearance wise,  speak for themselves. It's the world that I want to talk about. As I progressed through the game I would just stop and stare at some of the scenery and try and line my camera up just right for the screenshot. Especially when you reach chapter 12 and get to the plains. That giant that you can see past the mountains makes this game 10x better. You won't be disappointed with the graphics in this game. (I just spam Lightning's One Man Army attack because I think it's cool :3)I would recommed getting this game 10/10Join this group if you are a Final Fantasy Fan FFEnthusiasts "

												As a long-term Final Fantasy fan (my favourite games in the series being 6 and 10) I could easily see the design flaws of FF13, but still managed to get quite obsessed with it (as you can see from my play time).Like so many others I initially disliked the linear nature of the game, but could eventually see past it because I realized what the developers were trying to accomplish. The linear structure keeps the game very focused and story-driven, and I enjoyed many of the cutscenes scattered throughout the game. The pacing of this game is quite good imo. Usually just when you were starting to get bored with the constant forward-running and fighting, there was a beautiful cutscene to move the story forward. The graphics, in a word: GORGEOUS, even though this is already a 5-year-old game.The story itself is a mixed bag, though. The Fabula Nova Crystallis lore is interesting and detailed, and the plot of FF13 explores it quite thoroughly, especially in the well-written datalog entries. Even still, the dialogue in this game is often bad or so-so, with poorly hidden exposition every once in a while, characters explaining self-evident facts, and being all-around jerks. I cannot count how many times I facepalmed during Snow's ""Self-proclaimed hero"" -rants. Some of this has to do with the voice acting (which is generally good, though), but a lot of the writing is a bit clumsy and not very clever. On a broader level, the plot of the game was intense and interesting.The thing that kept me going, though, was the intense, strategic, increasingly rewarding and (imo) absolutely fantastic battle system of FF13. I cannot stress this enough. Without a battle system as good as this, I doubt I would have become so hooked on this game. Characters have different roles to fullfill in battle (physical attacker, mage, medic and so on) and you can freely combine these in different battle paradigms. The ""paradigm shift"" system, which requires the player to change the roles of each character in your party according to different situations in battle, is pretty much the most intense and fun battle system in the Final Fantasy series, if you take your time to master it. Different characters have different specialities in battle, and combining those specialities in an effective way is the main challenge of this game. Final Fantasy 13 is HARD, especially near the end, and requires you to really explore the battle system and master it to take down some really tough foes (with millions and millions of hit points). Finally taking down an especially tough enemy that you have tried to kill many times before with various different accessory/paradigm setups is an intensely rewarding experience.Weapon/accessory upgrading is also a nice touch. Hunting the ""Treasure hunter"" -trophy, which requires you to hold every weapon and accessory available in the game, is tough and most of my gaming hours consist of trying to achieve this trophy...I have seen some complaints about the optimizing of this game, but it runs very smoothly with only a few fps drops here and there with my 2,6 ghz, 8 gb ram laptop with a Nvidia Geforce 710M card. No complaints there.To sum it up, if you can look past some of the obvious design flaws, this game is very rewarding, challenging and fun.Score: 80/100			"

												Generally looks better than the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions: good. Resolution locked to 720p: bad. No graphics options whatsoever: terrible. Uses Bink video as the video codec: inexcusable. The game is a FIFTY GIGABYTE DOWNLOAD, which is just insane, and most of that is probably the badly-encoded cutscenes (for god's sake, SqEnix, use x264). The most annoying issue, however, is the severe frame-skipping, audio and video stuttering, and slowdown. This isn't a problem with the average frame-rate; it's a problem with the game freezing for split-seconds, stuttering and dropping frames constantly. For a game that's supposed to be as cinematic as this one is, it makes it almost unplayable. Once Square Enix sorts the technical issues out, I will review the game itself. For now, though, it's not worth buying; my system exceeds the recommended specifications for this game, so I should not be having the issues that I am. A terrible, terrible port.			"

Update [11 Nov @ 12am GMT+7]+ Graphics, it was actually released in 2009. Even now it's still gorgeous to look at.+ Soundtracks, as expected from FF series. Oh, man, how I love Kimi ga Iru Kara.+ Gameplay, if you love turn-based JRPG kind of game, you will love it so much that you have fun with every combat and every turn you take.+ Characters, Square Enix has always designed their Final Fantasy series' characters in a good pace, and Lightning in FFXIII is oh-so-♥♥♥♥ing-beautifully-handsome, admit it! I hate Snow so much that I can't bare with him+ Combats, if you are patient enough not to skip all tutorials, they all teach you how to do each combat in battle mode really well. You will get to understand how to do all combats easier and have much more fun if you get used to them as soon as possible.+/- Story, as you know, it's very linear, so it's quite boring sometimes and... Square Enix used to do better than this, so yeah...+/- Voiceover/Storate, dealing with country zones might annoy some people who want both international and Japanese, but then again it comes with 60GB which is way too heavy. I have no problem with it since I love playing Japanese game with only original Japanese language. (And I'd rather stay with 30GB)+/- ESC Key, it's not very good User eXperience to design ESC key as a sudden quit out of the game without any confirmation (this will not happen when you play in windowed mode), but if you get used to it then it's ok, I think.- Options/Settings, not good option design to configure, such as graphics/video quality, audio, keyboard/controller settings and it should be full controller support soon since it is ported from PS3/XBOX360 for God's sake.- Resolutions, locked resolution only at 1280x720p, seriously?- Lagging Issues, I found many cutscenes/scenes/battle mode while playing is quite lagged. Low frame rate when more objects appear on a screen. Even more lagging problems when SHIFT-TAB to access any guides/screenshots/etc. - Crash, the game crashed from time to time while I was playingsI still stand my ground and DO recommend the game. I genuinely understand those who didn't recommend since I still feel dissapointed even now. I personally think it's not the game's fault, but the port itself. So...Recommend: if you're a fan or never played FFXIII before, because you don't own PS3/XBOX360. Let's give it a try, if you do want to play. :)Not Recommend: if you're not into the series or already own PS3/XBOX360, then play it on PS3/XBOX360 instead or wait for the port to get updated and have better improvement.It's Final Fantasy, anyway. Just play it if you're a fan of the series. For now, we might have to deal with the way it is. (To be honest, I'm also dissapointed by this.) From my perspective, this FFXIII's PC version needs to be improved very soon. I'm looking forward to the patch updates.			"

												I played this game on PS3 a while back. The PC port is the definitive version to play...Keep in mind there's no Exclusive Fullscreen (it plays on a borderless window) so adjust your Gsync settings.Vsync is always on, unless it's overridden in the NVIDIA control panel to adaptive. There are frame pacing issues, the game locks itself to 30 fps at random moments... Weird...			"

Final Fantasy XIII reviewOh boy, here we go: Final. Fantasy. X. I. I. I. Ahem. Originally released back in 2009, this was the first entry of Square's juggernaut franchise on the PS3 and Xbox 360. This was also one of the most (if not the most) controversial title; fans and critics were heavily divided. The game itself spawned two direct sequels, FFXIII-2 and Lightning Returns, as part of the ""Nova Crystallis"" series. Honestly, I'm still conflicted about this game but let's get into the details:Story:This is easily the game's weakest point. It's a colossal mess of unnecessary jargon and convoluted narration. Seriously, get ready to face a barrage of terms such as cie, fal'cie, l'cie, ci'eth, and etc. The characters try their hardest to explain everything but it just falls flat. The gist of the story is that a group of people becomes ""tainted"" and labeled as ""enemies of the state"" so now they must elude capture while overturning the status quo by taking down storm troopers, a guy who looks like the pope, a Gundam Wing reject, and a giant Picasso painting? Um, yeah.The main playable characters are okay.  Nobody stands out as being super annoying or unlikable, but nobody stands out as being well developed with deep personalities either. Everyone is just kind of bland. They are there to move the story along and that's pretty much it.Gameplay:If the story is the weakest part of this game, then the gameplay is the second weakest. There is one saving grace that I will get to shortly. Anyway, the game is 90% corridors and hallways. If you're claustrophobic I highly recommend you stay away from playing this. You go from point A to point B  and are interrupted by cutscenes at various checkpoints. You can also expect boss fights and the such. Treasure chests are plainly in view and you'll never get lost. The game is almost entirely devoid of puzzles. Sounds like boring and lazy dungeon design? Well, it is.The saving grace for this game is the battle system. Square implemented an interesting and engaging battle system that takes the classic ATB system and morphs it into something refreshing. Your ATB gauge fills up and the total ""length"" determines the number of actions you can take. For example, I can choose to ""Attack"" use ""Flamestrike"" and then follow it up with three casts of ""Ruin"". There is no MP in this game; all actions are limited based on how many commands you input in the ATB bar. The stronger the attack, the more space it will require.Furthermore, there are the paradigm and stagger mechanics as well. Paradigms allow you to quickly switch the roles of your characters. There are six roles: Commando, Ravager, Medic, Sentinel, Saboteur, and Synergist. I'm not going to go over what each one does, but you do need to understand when and how to use each of these roles to get through the tougher fights. This also plays into the ""stagger mechanism"". Every enemy has a ""chain gauge"" and you fill this up by attacking it. Once it reaches its limit the enemy will ""stagger"" and for a limited amount of time your attacks will do massive amounts of damage. This is absolutely key because most bosses and regular enemies have very healthy life pools. In fact, if you don't quickly learn how to balance staggering enemies and keeping your characters alive, you will be defeated in many boss fights.Indeed, the battle system is both refreshing and challenging. At first things will be easy, but by the later chapters the difficulty ramps up and even normal mobs can wipe you with ease if you're not paying attention. This makes the game engaging to play and overcoming a tough boss very satisfying.Graphics and Sound:Another plus for this game are the graphics. Despite this being a seven year old game, it looks quite nice. Square clearly spared no expense in this department. The character models and facial expressions are very well done along with enemy design and special effects. The only issue is the background environments, but that's mostly because of the boring design (all the corridors and hallways kind of blend in) and not technical faults.The music is very ""meh"". Nobuo Uematsu's scores are no where to be found and there wasn't anything memorable. (I believe Uematsu's final work for Square was in FFXII). I mean the music is not terrible by any means but it just doesn't do the game justice, especially a flagship FF title. The voice acting ranges from average to above-average so no real complaints there. I just wish the characters were actually interesting though.Final Thoughts:Come for the battle system and pretty graphics and try not to get bogged down by everything else. If you can get over the abysmal story and dungeon design then you'll enjoy this game for sure. And if you're into achievement hunting look up a guide for ""Treasure Hunter"". It's notoriously grindy :)			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Square Enix Publishers: Square Enix Initial release: Oct 2014Genre: JRPG #Worth/NotWorth: #MissedOpportunityButStillEnjoyable * REVISED *I wrote a “mixed” review of this game a while back that through repeated consideration and recently going back to play other Final Fantasy games I realized that my complaints regarding it's linearity were and are unwarranted. I do however wish that Square Enix had broken away somewhat from this formulaic approach. I absolutely loved the battle system, it's so fluid and dynamic. It's one of the best I've ever dealt with.The revised old review follows belowExposition, Concurrence and SummationThis game is linear... really linear, almost literally the entire game is in a hallway. Connected by more hallways. This is true while it does open up in the late game, the VERY late game but that area still feels like filler material. Mechanics :The battle system is extremely chaotic at first glance. It's essentially a meter management sim. However it sure feels good when you manage those meters well. The battle system is almost completely automated, you have 6 characters and 6 roles they could play. Quick summation of each role  Commando – Builds chains, physical attacks Ravager – aids in chain building, stagger meter drains faster than COM, uses magic  Sentinel – the consummate tank, aggro machine  Synergist – Provides + stat buffs Saboteur – not intuitively named, gives target – stat debuffs  Medic – support healer, self explanatory You take either two or three of these roles depending on where you are at in the narrative. And form Paradigms or strategies (up to six) Essentially you control the leader of the pack while the other party members fulfill their role they have been assigned in the current paradigm. Effectively you as the leader switch paradigms to best fit the situation at hand. With most battles objective to get the enemy stagger meter all the way up, allowing their turns to be interrupted and take more damage. All battles essentially go on like this for the duration of the game. (Building chains essentially is the stagger meter, as in when the meter drops to zero you must restart “the chain” to get the enemy staggered once again)There are a few exceptions such as the gestalt Eidolon battles. Which have you perform the same sorts of tactics under a timer. THE DOOM TIMER. Spooky. You end the battle by getting the gestalt meter to the top and pushing a button. A sort of manifestation of consciousness as I understand. Which leads me to the other part of battles which is known as TP or technical points. You can summon your Eidolon or do other moves unlocked through the various roles. Which in my experience were only useful in the end game. The Summons however where almost completely useless. A sort of fan service if I may borrow the term. The game does open up. In Chapter 9, you gain the ability to select your party and assign them any role. However it seems slightly counter productive to have your characters spec down a completely different path then what you've been doing for the past 20+ hours. In Chapter 11, the infamous open world comes to fruition. Sort of. You're no longer traversing an extremely linear actual hallway. You now have open fields to explore. You do have the option to take side missions but they are just crystal way-points. There is some loose narrative in that you are fulfilling the focus of a l'cie turned Cei'th but what it really feels like is monster hunting to disguise level grinding. All that being said, they are not all easy fights. I had to adopt new strategies rather quickly to survive. The game is in fact rather easy until you are suddenly dropped into the wild fields of chapter 11 leading you into ten's possibly triple digits (if you're a completionist) of additional hours of fighting enemy after enemy. It can be a bit grind-y sure. But in this genre that is too be expected. It's just missing that special something. There isn't any HUB world. No replenishing stock with your favorite vendor and establishing a rapport after a long grind of killing beasts in the forests. Just inanimate kiosks that bring you goods should you ever need to actually purchase something. And that's another issue. Other-worldly precious Gil is almost a total non factor. Complete let down. The story is fine. It's nothing to write home about. Lightning is a cool character. I like her better than Liara T'Soni (same voice actor which is a strange comparison to bring up to be honest) Although some obvious character tropes drag on a little long in my opinion. THE GISTAfter long arduous thinking and comparisons to previous Final Fantasy games I grew up with as a kid. This is MORE of that, with a really really great battle system on top of it and my immediate gut and visceral reaction to the linearity may have been preemptive likely an expectation of something markedly different then what is to be expected from an established genre. The game didn't change, I did.Follow my curation for more "

												I played and loved many Final Fantasy games and I really wanted to like this game. But I can't.This is too stretched out, At the end I was simply trying to get from one destination marker to the other while trying to skip combats as much as possible. Why? Because:Combat is either boring or completely unfair. There are endless amount of fights you just tap auto-battle and see it resolve by itself. And there are those fights that seem a bit more challenging -you switch paradigms and do some healing and buffing/debuffing but then the monster suddenly gets 4 attacks in a row and wipes your entire party.I really dislike this odd real-time-action/turnbased mix. If it's turn based, it should have some indications on who gets to act when. If it's action, then there should be free and fast ways to pick an attack type and execute it, not by a means of some menus where you waste time by picking the right abilities. It feels like this is the worst of both worlds - tbs without possibility to plan ahead and action without possibility to enjoy an action type combat. There is too little control over what is going on.I played until Chapter 11 and then a bit more. After that I decided to just watch the remaining cutscenes on Youtube - this is how bad the stuff between cutscenes is.The visuals were neat. The music was ok. I kinda liked the story. The worldbuilding was nice. As for the characters - idk, a bit lacking imo. "

												As a long-time Final Fantasy fan, I've played and completed nearly every game from 1 to X. When the games, in my opinion, tanked from X-2 onwards, I avoided all of the following sequels. However, in an attempt to actually play something instead of just criticise it from afar, I ended up finishing 13 in a matter of a few weeks.""Final Hallway 13"", named as such because 80% of the game is walking through linear corridors is such a deviation from what I'm used to in final fantasy that it might as well be a Devil May Cry spin-off. You spend most of the game holding forwards without being able to explore more than the infrequent branching hallway that leads to a time consuming enemy and lackluster loot. In my opinion, this is the game's worst problem and why it doesn't feel like a Final Fantasy game.The battles are a little more interesting - as you progress, you get the ability to switch 'paradigms' which are basically sets of classes/jobs you assign your party. As jobs were the reason I prefer FF5 over FF6, this kept me going through the tedious stretch of a corridor that makes up the first 10 chapters of the 13 chapter game. There are six jobs/roles you get access to from various stages of the game:Commando - more attack powerRavager - 'stagger' opponents fasterMedic - heal/remove ailmentsSentinel - draw aggro while defending/counteringSynergist - buff teammatesSaboteur - debuff opponentsOnce you understand what all of these do, you can construct sets of paradigms to deal with different opponents and use them effectively. A medic, synergist and a saboteur are good to start off a battle - buff, debuff and heal while waiting for all the buffs, then switch to two ravagers and a commando to build up the stagger meter. Once the enemy is staggered, switch to two commandos and a ravager or three commandos and blast it back to hell with crazy attack power. Once you need healing, switch to a healing paradigm (three medics, or two medics and a sentinel) to get you ready for the next round of staggering.A lot of people see this as a negative part of the game, but I actually welcome it - it's not just mashing A to win like a lot of the critics say (even though that sums up pretty much every final fantasy game), you actually have to pay attention to the battle and switch to the necessary paradigm and you just feel more involved with the combat.When you finally win the battle, you get a certain amount of EXP (named 'Crystarium Points', or 'CP' in FF13) which is stored for you to spend whenever you're ready to spend them. There are no levels for your character, instead you level up the various roles and unlock abilities within them. This adds a lot of depth to the levelling system and allows you to focus characters to specific roles.When you reach Chapter 11, you finally go out into the big open world to do missions (64 of them!) and grind until you're able to beat the chapter's somewhat difficult boss. It's recommended to not leave this chapter until you have maxed out all of your primary roles, as you can't return until Chapter 13 and you're going to need the grinding to be able to keep up with the upcoming boss battles. It was only at this chapter that the game felt like a real final fantasy, and I started having a lot of fun and I actually spent half of my hours on this game grinding and doing missions in the open world.I'm not going to give any spoilers for the plot, but after you finish the game you get a 'post-game' which allows you to continue grinding and finishing off any missions you didn't do in Chapter 11, but by that point (for me anyway) I found it pointless to continue grinding.The characters are fairly generic JRPG characters, although I did get quite into the plot and I found myself playing the game just to watch the cutscenes and see what happens, which is the opposite of what you want in this type of game. You have Lightning, Snow, Hope, Sazh, Vanille and a character which is revealed later in the game (no spoilers!).While the characters were lazy rehashes of old final fantasy characters, I did find myself invested in their (rather shallow) backstories in what appeared to be a serious case of stockholm syndrome.In summary, it's a good game that's worth trying - but not a good Final Fantasy. If you don't like linear hallways, this game may not be for you. However, if you like decent stories and can wait for a great part of the game to open up, this game is worth trying.			"

												I don't mind the idea of linear levels because you can pack the content closer together than in an open world game. In theory that is. However these levels are devoid of any reason to do more than move from point a to b while fighting a few enemy types over and over again. It really feels lacking in comparision to all the previous FF games overall.			"

												Definitely one of the best games in my life. Though I finished the game but I still play it. Final Fantasy XIII is a JRPG type game where character development matters more. You need to fight against many enemies to gain a so called Crystarium points. There are 6 characters in the game and you can choose which 3 characters would you take to battle. Beating enemies will give all characters the same Crystarium points. The story is very linear until you reach chapter 11. At chapter 11 you will get to Gran Pulse that is sorrunded with many Cie'th Stones that grant you side mission. There are a total of 60 side missions. Their difficulty is from E-A. Once you defeat Orphan (the final and not the hardest boss) you will grant access to Crystarium level 5 where you can max out all your characters and face Vercigentorix (the toughest boss in the game). The battle system is a paradigm system. There are a total of 6 paradigms: Commando, Ravager, Sentinel, Synergist, Saboteur and Medic roles. You can create 6 different paradigms. During the battle you need to switch between paradigms by using the TAB button on your keyboard. Once you are used to it it can be quite a fun. Mouse is supported in the game for camera control. Game audio is available in English and Japanese. Among the Final Fantasy XIII series I would rate this game as 10/9.			"

												I've beaten the game on ps3 and 360, only played about 14 hours so far on steam. Final Hallway XIII gets a bad rap. Yes, it is a linear RPG that made the unfortunate choice of putting the first section of the game literally ""on rails"" (a railroad), and it is absolutely true that it takes upwards of 20-30 hours before you get to the open world sections. People tend to forget that the most beloved ""open world"" final fantasies only felt open world: you could go to your choice of 2 or 3 new areas or backtrack, not travel wherever you wanted. This mis-remembrance is really the source of most of the game's hate, in several areas.First, the aforementioned linearity. Second, unlikable characters (apart from 9, and now 15, I believe this is true of ALL final fantasy titles).Third, ""oversimplified combat."" This is the one that irks me the most. People complain that the paradigm system encourages you to ""just mash x"" with no strategy. These people must have not progressed very far in the game, because managing sentinel and healer roles while preventing your stagger bar from depleting with damage classes is a difficult balance to strike. As for ""mashing x,"" this is what you do in every. turn. based. rpg. ever. You cycle up the attack command or whatever skill you're spamming, and mash x as fast as you can. the only difference here is that you can use libra or fight the same enemy type repeatedly to have your characters learn what spell is the best. How does this change the traditional RPG experience?Instead of scrolling through lightning and blizzard to get to fire, the character learns that fire is most effective and auto ques it for you, which you push X to confirm.Don't believe the hate. It's an engaging and beautiful (graphical fidelity still holds up today) game that gets you 50+ hours of gameplay for around 20 bucks.			"

												Let's get this out of the way - There are 2 camps of people that either love the game or hate it and they seem to be quite even in population. You might end up on either one of them and I am personaly on the ""I like this"" no scratch that ""I FREAKING LOVE THIS GAME"" side. Now than;If you are here for a classic ARPG experience (as in: open world, many towns, bunch of NPCs with all sorts of cool or less cool side quests) you are not going to find that here BUT WAIT, DON'T LEAVE YET. The fact that this game is different doesn't mean it's bad.You are not going to find yourself running around through he whole world of Final Fantasy XIII like in previous games, in fact it's ~80% linear experience, you will have to wait a while before the game opens up for you. Where the game opens up is in Chapter 11, you will get to explore pretty big area(s) with challanging content, you will get to form your own team and strategize alot during tough battles in side quests (if you choose to do them and honestly, you should do at least some of them or you are not going to be able to progress in chapter 12 IMO).But getting to Chapter 11 will take you 20-30 hours (depending on your play style) and the first 10 chapters is just ""hold A to win"" type of gameplay. But the story will keep pushing you forward! And my oh my, if you like well written stories you might like this one. It's a bit confusing at the begining, you have no idea who you are and who the people you meet are. You don't know what you are doing here and what's happening, but keep on going and you will uncover everything. Don't forget to read logs often because in these you'll find even more information that will help clear things up for you. And really check the logs often, because logs about people you meet often change, you don't want to miss out.And just when you think you know everything, the game still has secrets for you prepared. All in all the story is really strong part of this game, if you find that you don't like it, just keep on going, maybe you'll like it more once you know more.The characters have strong personalities and they go through alot, I got really invisted in most of them and while some may seem bad, I feel that they are like that for a reason.Since I mentioned the combat already. It's rather simplistic at the begining, you just choose auto-battle, your character is aoutomaticly going to choose what's best to do and it's going to do just that. You are controlling just 1 character all the time while the party have maximum of 3 characters in it. You can't switch to other character to do anything with them, you are pretty much forced to play as the leader all the time. But don't worry, the AI is great, they are not messing up at all. You can choose not to ""aouto-battle"" and attack however you want by lining up abilities to the queue. If that's what you want to do, just switch the battle in options to slow as you want to have some time to choose how you want to attack. All the characters can have 3 out of 6 different roles (later on all of them, but they are generaly good only in the main 3) and you can switch roles during battle at any time but only to previously created presets (there are 7 presets available that you can modify however you want). So if your starting stance is - Commander, ravanger, ravanger you can switch to Commander, Sentinel, Medic at any time if you have this kind of preset created. And your companions will behave differently in battle. This strategic gameplay makes it not so simplistic anymore and is quite fun to play with. Once you get to chapter 11 it's all just great!You will find all sorts of accessories and weapons through the game, they might not look powerful and you are not going to find much better stuff. While your characters are not leveling like in classic RPG game, you can level up your weapons and accessories with items you find after battles. Make your research with weapons. Each character can get many different weapons but they all have similiar starting statistics. But if you level them up to maximum level, they differ alot! You don't want to end up leveling a weapon the whole game only to find out it's the weakest of them all too late.While your characters aren't leveling up, they gain Crystarium Points (or CP) after each battle and with that you can improove them in their roles. It's nothing complex, there's no massive tree where you could mess up your character, it's all straight forward. And you will unlock all abilities here too. All the magic comes from Crystarium, so you are not going to be buying magic or anything like that.The game looks amazing! Just great, it's the best looking Final Fantasy game released ATM. I still remember when I've been playing FF VIII many years ago thinking how cool it would be if the game looked like the cutscenes... Well this is even better and I felt like it's a dream coming true. There are many cutscenes that just blew me away with the ammount of creativity in them, the game just looks wonderful.The game even sounds great! What do you expect? It's final fantasy after all. If there's somethign that never change it's the music. I found myself denying faster travel through the locations of Chapter 11 just so I can listen to the wonderfull music there.Did I tell you how great the story is? I am not spoiling anything here, you should just enjoy it for yourself! I personaly found the story of Final Fantasy XII weak, but on the other hand I prefered the gameplay there more. Here it's wonderful story with weaker gameplay (but with rich elements as I wrote above). I was touched, I was scared, I was happy and sad. The emotions are there and they are not going to go away untill you are back in the main menu after the ending credits.Now for the main reason you might hate this game. The freaking port. Yeah... it's not great, it's lazy as hell. For reference. I have GTX 780 (MSI OC Gaming edition) and Intel Core i5-4440 3.1GHz. Running at 1080p with maxed out graphical settings (there's not alot of them mind you, shadow resolution, filtering, resolution... And that's about it I believe) the game ran great for the most part (60fps) but I've been dealing with heavy stuttering. That is happening if you don't have USB controller pluged in to your PC. The game is aparently looking for the controller which is causing the stutter. You can fix that by disabling all """"HID-Compliant Devices"" in ""Device Manager"". More info here -> http://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/2it9rz/stuttering_in_ff_xiii_pc_try_this_worked_for_me/THAT you should not have to do no matter what, one big BOO for you Square Enix.But that's not all, in certain areas the game would drop to 30 fps for no bloody reason. Narrow Corridor? suddenly 30 fps. It doesn't make the game not playable but it's frustrating. For me, there were only 2 areas in the game where it dropped below 30fps but only for a few seconds, nothing to really complain about but it makes you wonder ""why the hell?"".Other than that the game ran great on my machine. And I don't think it's getting any better even if you have 10 times better PC than me, aparently the game utilizes only 1 GPU core or whatever (I am not good at this stuff, that's only what I heard on the internet) so it can only get worst if you do not meet recommended requirements. Also aparently on AMD cards it's quite bad, can't comment on that personaly tho.I still heavily recommend this game! It's bloody cheap for what it has to offer. I mean come on 13€? Yeah I can forgive you the bad port for this price, I would still love to see it running better tho. So even if you are not sure if you'd like this game, it's not going to cost you much to just try it out. It offers many hours of gameplay and I enjoyed every single minnute of this game. Now I don't know what to do, complete all achievement or play XIII-2? Hmm... Anyway. JUST BLOODY BUY IT ALREADY.			"

												 Mom dies in front of her kid, friend of kid says, ""aw, it's too much, isn't it"" then giggles and runs off.That's the writing in a nutshell.  That being said, graphics are always good, which is the main selling point of FF series, however, combat is extremely dumbed down to the point where you only control one character per combat.  It's like they took most of the strategy out of turn based combat.  I used to love past FF games, but this is just watching a movie while you're constantly trying to skip the combat to get to the next scene.  That's how boring combat is.			"

												Definitely enjoyed. This is a game for people who are deeply into storyline and less so freedom as a player. You're very much playing through a beautiful story instead of crafting one yourself. If you like free roam, don't get this game. If you like amazing storylines with great animation and beautifully crafted scenes, this game is for you.			"

												After putting more then 60 hours into the game, I finally completed the main story. There is still plenty left to do after the main story is completed, but I don't think I have the energy to put more hours into it just yet. I did complete this game many years ago on Ps3 but been feeling an itch to play a Final Fantasy game since FFXV is being delayed, so decided to purchase this on Steam and complete it.For those who haven't played it yet, but have played other Final Fantasy games - the rumours are true, the game is very linear. The infamous YouTube video of ""Final Hallway XIII - JonTron"" or maybe, better known as: ""THE GAMES PLAYING ITSELF, JON!"" is rather true. A lot of the game is running in one direction and pressing 'Auto-battle' in a fight. But if you can get past this, the game has a lot to offer. A deep story, that sometimes is a little confusing but still great. Character development to the point you can feel a connection and perhaps even an emotion towards them during some scenes. And large content, this game is filled with side quests (from Chapter 11) and achievements, and plenty more to do after the game is completed. I would highly reccomend this game, it definitely keeps you occupied.Overall, it isn't the best Final Fantasy game ever made, so don't jump into expecting it to be that good, but also don't believe some of the people on here saying it's the worst Final Fantasy, because that's just a blatant lie. If you can get around the horrible port by using some guides online, you can expect pretty solid 30fps throughout the game, with 60fps here and there, which is nice.I give it a strong 8/10, definitely worth a play if you haven't yet!

												I hated this game...not everything, but most of it.  Let me first start with the positives.Pros:Battle System - The battlesystem is more action-oriented than previous incarnations of Final Fantasy series.  While I prefer the old-fashion ATB style Final Fantasies, I think the Paradigm battle system does make the fight sequences less of a drag and keeps my blood pressure slightly elevated.  The Paradigm system simplifies and streamlines the commands of the party and keeps the fights engaging.Graphics - As of this writing, Final Fantasy 13 is nearly 7 years old since worldwide release.  The performance enhancement provided by the PC port gives the game an extended lifetime as far as visuals go.  Oddly enough, the FMV suffers the most and looks grainy compared to the smoother in-game graphics with the port.  There's no denying Final Fantasy 13 is a gorgeous game.PC Port - I was concerned that the porting of this game from the console would result in many bugs and glitches that would hamper my enjoyment of the game.  Surprisingly, there were few bugs that I found distracting.  This is a terrific port as far as PC ports goes.  As such, bugs and glitches did not hamper my enjoyment of the game...the enjoyment hampering was the result of a multitude of other issues which I'll discuss next.Cons:Story - Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥..the story is convoluted!  Even until the very end, the story didn't straighten itself out much.  So the basic premise (from what I understand), is that the floating world of Cocoon (which is essentially a moon with a big hole on its side) and the larger planet, Gran Pulse are at odds with each other.  The deity-like entities, called Fal Cie, appear to be warring with each other...though it is never made clear why they're not buddies.  Although the Fal Cie do have tremendous powers, they are limited in the manners they able to wield said powers.  Just think of a dragcar attempting to go down a 25mph residential neighbohood.  In other words, they're powerful beings that are trapped in their respective worlds.  The Fal Cie can, however, directly influence humans.  Once such way is to give human's a ""focus""...aka task.  Upon completing their focus, they are awarded immortality by being converted to a crystalline form.  If they fail their task, they are then turned into these miserable, mindless creatures called Cieth.  This is the Fal Cie's way of getting around their limitations.  The Fal Cie are limited in what they can influence, but humans have no such limitations.  Humans can do anything they want.  The Fal Cie realizes this and exploits human freedom of choice to enact their own agendas against the other's world.  In comes Lighting, Snow, Sazh, Hope, Fang, and Vanille.  The main plot revolves around the six of them as they try to figure out what their focuses are and how to complete it.  The game explores several themes, but the biggest recurring theme is free will vs. destiny as they try reconcile their own interests, the interest of the people of Cocoon, and the interests of the Fal Cies.  So that's the overall, broadstroke gist of the it all.  Like I said, I hate the story.  I found it hard to connect with the characters.  The voice acting didn't make it easy (I think Sazh was the best voice-acting in the bunch).  I thought the motivations of the antagonists were really esoteric and not very compelling.  I didn't feel the comraderies and bond between the characters...and that's not for a lack of trying on the writer's part.  The characters have their own set of baggages and there was plenty of story built-in to cement those relationships as they resolve their problems together....but it was never quite convincing or compelling to me.  Most of the time, I found the characters were just down-right annoying.  Worst of all, the story was confusing to me...and just when I thought I had some of it straightened out, a new plot twist was tossed in to make it more muddled!  After about the 10th hour of the game, I just didn't care anymore and rushed the rest of the game to finish it.  I've played every single Final Fantasy game (except part 15), and I have to say...this is one of the ♥♥♥♥♥iest story for me.  I liked part 9, as far as story and characters go, the most...just to give you a sense of where I'm coming from.Character progression - The character progression is kinda crappy.  To make your characters more powerful, Final Fantasy 13 gives you the Crystallarium system.  You collect CP when dispatching monsters and then, in turn, you use the CP to move along this grid to reach the next status, spell, or itemization upgrade.  The system is not very deep, and doesn't provide much in the way of variability of your characters.  It's simple, just collect a lot of CP and apply it to the Crystallarium grid.  There some choices that the player has to make when using CP on the grid...do you apply your points to the Commander grid or the Ravager or Medic grid?  There are some forks in the grid, but it's not a big deal because if you earn enough CP, you can get the skill or stats of either fork.  There's no real consequences for picking one path over another because nothing gets locked out.  They may as well have just stuck to the ol' tried and true 'gain xp points to level up', because this system has about the same amount of depth.  It's very linear and not fun to play with. Exploration - Or rather...lack thereof!  The game is reputed to be an RPG corridor...I now understand why.  There's no real exploration in the game.  There are no towns or dungeons...or even NPC to talk to!  The game is very linear and plays as if it were on rails.  The options are few and obstensibly, the outcomes are the same.  The closest the game comes to an open world is at chapter 11 where you finally make it to the world of Gran Pulse....or a small section of it I should say.  On Gran Pulse, you can pick up missions from these Cieth Stones (people who have turned to Cieth and then subsequently to stones.  These Cieth Stones asks that you complete their focuses for them.  The missions are fairly simple...find monster X...and then kill monster X.  There are various rewards for completing the missions including items, weapons, and weapon upgrade materials....but ultimately, by the point in the game, I didn't want to do any of them if it required backtracking.  As I mentioned earlier, I just wanted to be done with the game by hour 10.Overall Feel of the game - I might have been fine with the game if were called something else other than Final Fantasy.  For me, FF13 didn't feel like a Final Fantasy game.  The world, although beautiful, did not feel alive and interactive to me.  The signature icons of Final Fantasies made appearances, but none of them in the manner they appeared in other FF games.  The Chocobos were just a part of the Sazh's plotline as he resolved his issues with Vanille and his son.  The Moogles didn't really make an appearance, but instead is a part of a menu on the save selection options.  Some of the creatures were familiar...like the Behemoths and flan....but most of the creatures were reskins (how many sabretooth tiger skins can there be?!?!).  Although, I must admit the Adamantoise was pretty cool.  Lets see...oh yeah, the equipment management was really shaved down...but I think that's been the trend since FFX, I think.  There was no vehicle travel...going from A to B was all on foot.  The world isn't too big, so travel time isn't much of an issue...it just doesn't feel right.  Even FFX had an airship at the end where you can land at preselection destinations.  No such thing in FF13.  The game's feel was too much of a departure from what I knew and love of the Final Fantasy series.  As such, it's hard to recommend this game to fans of the series....but at the same time, if you're a true Final Fantasy fan like I am, you'll suffer through this game like I did.I will rate this game a 4/10.

												Just beat it, here are a few thoughts.MechanicsI enjoy the battle style, and how battles begin, I enjoyed the movements and just worked really well.Graphics & SoundsDear lord, I LOVE the music in this game ""Most FF games I love the music"", the graphics are beautiful, I've taken so many screenshots of just beautiful cinematics over my 30ish hours of playing.GameplayWell.. I enjoy the story and how the game itself plays, my only issue is, it feels like just 1 long hallway aside from when you're on Gran Pulse and get those side missions, I mean any time I saw on my minimap a secondary way to run, I'd automatically know there was an item sphere thing there.Upgrading weapons, while the idea itself is neat... it all ends with the same result, i.e. Lightning's Omega weapon. So that was somewhat of a let down for me.OverallWelp, I enjoyed it, not as much as previous Final Fantasy titles I've played, however if you enjoy being told a story and beautiful music and graphics I suggest you give it a shot, this was more of like watching a movie than playing a game in my opinion.If you want something with actual choices, being able to stroll off and do your own thing, etc. then try something else.

												A very pretty game with good music, likeable characters, and an interesting storyline. Combat is also engagingly innovative for about 30 hours.Unfortunately it suffers from terrible writing, incredibly linear (nearly nonexistent) level design, and awful pacing issues. It is, essentially, a 50 hour walk down a relatively boring but nice looking and occasionally emotionally satisfying hallway - and the hallway gets significantly more boring and difficult around the 25-30 hour mark.I enjoyed parts of this game, but it was just too underwhelming for me to recommend. It suffers from being an oppressive slog for the latter half of the game. Unless you're a die hard Final Fantasy fan or really want to play a more modern (is it even?) JRPG and can get it for sale, I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												I won't pass judgement on the actual game yet, but the port is horrendous. No sound options, limited video options, runs like absolute garbage on a 6700k/GTX970, with very low CPU and GPU utilization. It's not even that it's crazy demanding and the hardware can't handle it, it's just a poorly optimized, bloated console port. I suppose it's better than nothing, but this sort of attitude will only lead to other ports like this. Square Enix needs to be praised for bringing the Final Fantasy games to PC, but they also need to be heaviliy criticized for half-assing it. I guess if you're ok with highly inconsistent framerates, the complete lack of audio sliders and a very, VERY limited options menu, give it a go. It's certainly better than what you're gonna get on the previous gen consoles (PS3;Xbox360), it does look really, really good for a relatively older title and it's also cheaper than a lot of the old FF games on Steam. This is probably the most cautious recommendation I'm ever gonna give to a game (not that anyone cares).			"

												----------------------------------------------------------------------Updated Review----------------------------------------------------------------------If like me this is your first time playing FFXIII, I would definately recommend this game.  It has an interesting combat system and awesome cut scenes, with lots of character development.  Well worth the price.  If however you have previously played this game on the consoles I would not recommend this game.  After all it is the exact same game you have already played.  There are no graphical improvements, no added quests, items, weapons, etc..  With only a slight increase in framerate & achievements thrown into the mix.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Review--------------------------------------------------------------------------.I definately recommend this game.  It may be linear, but the combat is fun and fairly complex.  The story is pretty good, Each of the characters in your party has their own history and motivation.  The cinematics and world are beautifully rendered.  This is my first time playing ffxiii but so far I am thoroughly enjoying the game.  As ports go, I jave played far worse.A lot of people have been saying negative things about the game, honestly I don't agree with some of those comments:1. The game is a massive 60Gb (When I first pre-ordered the game it was actually 30GB, but it only had English audio which upset a lot of fans, who then made a huge issue about it, even going so far as to start a petition to get SE to add Japanese audio to the game, which they then did, doubling the size of the game, so is it really SE's fault for the massive size when all thet were doing was listening to the fans?)2. Game locked at 720p (There's already an unofficial patch that unlocks 1080p)3. The only difference between the pc version and the ps3 version was increased framerate (What did you expect the game is only $16)4. They say don't buy the game so that SE has to make better next time (Seeing as one of the reasons the released FFxiii on pc was to see if it will be viable to release future ff games on pc, this means if only a few people buy ffxiii we will most likely see very few ff games coming to pc, this would mean no ffxv on pc)So far my game has run smoothly with no lag.  My pc specs: Windows 7 64 bitQuad core 2.6 Ghz4 GB RamGeforce GT 430So if you want a fun fantasy jrpg for only $16 and you want to increase the chance of more final fantasy games coming to pc buy this game.

												Final Fatnasy XIII is a great game, while I'll admit the PC port isn't great it doesn't really take away from the experience. Characters of the game are enjoyable and leave a good impression, the soundtrack is awesome and memorable. Overall the   sotry telling i phenomenal but can get melodramatic at times if you're not accustomed to Jrpg's and their type of story telling. I think this game is a good purchase and i would recommend it to everyone who wants a good rpg with a great story :D.			"

												A lot of people are getting bent out of shape over the glaring lack of graphical options, and rightfully so, however, for £11, I'd say this game is definitely worth it. Couple of things you should take note of before purchase:- You'll probably have a better experience if you have a Controller- Do not expect an open world experience like you did in FF3-9 + 12 it's definitely more like 10- Graphics issues can be fixed with a quick google 'Durantes FFXIII fix' "

												It is the worst FF part I ever played.Open world starts in chapter 11 after 40 hours of gameplay.In those 40 hours you wander around in super linear surroundings with a movie clips literally every 3-5 minutes!The first 15 hours I thought that this was just the introduction. So you keep on playing. After 20ish hours you realize that this crap actually is the main story. By that time you dont want to give it away.Buying and Upgrading system is completely useless. Savepoints/shops are everywhere and you cannot buy anything useful anyway. There never comes a feeling up like: NIce I reached a city and maybe it has some new weapons for me.The time I reached the open world I felt more frustrated and overwhelmed because I expected the end to be more linear after 40 hours.Never buy this game. Don't let you get tricked by the graphics... This game is the perfect example that games are more than just graphics.			"

												I didn't want to write a review before 100%ing it to fully understand the shortcomings of this game. Now that I finally have, I can talk about it somewhat fairly. The truth is that there's so much wrong with this game that it's hard to recommend it to just anyone.I enjoyed the combat system. The faster paced paradigm shift system (similar FFX-2's ATB/dressphere system) was a refreshing take on the turn based combat that FF12's didn't really provide. Shift canceling/ATB canceling also provided a lot more depth into what may look like simple combat mechanics. The story was acceptable but had major pacing issues with the first 10 chapters feeling overextended, while the last 3 chapters were much more enjoyable and interesting, yet shorter. What really stands out in the game however, are the visuals. Everything from the prologue to the end is a gorgeous vista of sci-fi fantasy, with a decadent high-tech society clashing against a beautiful yet raw planetscape. Eden in particular stood out for me, with it's beautiful architecture and sci fi-esque atmosphere.However, the infamous graphical issues, the random crashes that occur and the ESC key essentially being a one button Alt+F4 are major issues in this game. It's depressing to see a fan-made fix that was made in one day is still the only option to fix this heavily broken game. Squenix recently patched, and I was hoping for some official fixes, but all we got was a simple pop-up change to ask if you really wanted to quit the game when you hit ESC. Not even an ingame message but for me it distorts the current game screen and freezes it. Only by Alt-Tabbing do I see an off screen dialog window box asking me whether I really want to exit the game. I knew Japanese pc ports had a terrible history, but this one is almost as bad as the Dark Souls port (at least we didn't need GFWL). Technical issues aside, the pacing is terrible, you don't actually get to use the full combat system for the first half of the game. Sidequests are replaced by what is essentially hunts from FF12, the Crystarium system of leveling is extremely shallow with the bare minimum of choice. Animations are often clunky and slow for the kind of fast paced combat the game uses. These are some of the most obvious probelms you'll encounter.Overall, it isn't a terrible game. However, it's got so much wrong with it'll be hard to finish or enjoy, even for the seasoned RPG fanatic. It's a definite oddity in the consistency we've seen in the FF series. While it did have some very good areas, it's crippled of it's potential. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless they had the tenacity to see it through, and even then they might regret it. "

												While i do understand the criticisms of regarding FF13 series and its deviation from the usual JRPG formula that FF series is known for, I do not understand the hate everyone seems to have for the actual story. During my xbox 360 days, i only bought used games and these titles (FF13) are probably one of the few non-multiplayer i bought at retail; and that was after playing it for 3 hours from gamefly. Loved the series storytelling from beginning to end. May not be for everyone, especially for hardcore FF fanboys, but definitely not a trash series.﻿Game Mechs: 6/10 - i do prefer the old formula - Open World vs. Linear (all 3 FF13 games) - time-based gameplay on a J-RPG (Lightning Returns) they should fire the retard that suggested this... seriously...Port Quality: 1/10 - first 2 games in this series were lazily ported, and the fact that they know its a poor port, yet did not even attempt to offer an official fix is a slight show of Square being full of themselves. They are lucky they can mooch off the name of their franchise to keep their business running, but I wonder sometimes until when can they keep doing this until everyone from their fanbase is completely fed up.Game OST: 8/10 - may not be for everyone, but loved it regardless. Have the Soundtrack of all 3 series in my iPhone.Visuals and Graphics: 9/10- decent gameplay visuals- and as to be expected from the newer generation of FFs the cinematics are beautiful- very anime based which is somewhat of a + in my booksGameplay: 5/10- Auto-battle needs to go. playing J-RPG is a homage to pen-and-paper RPG that need some degree of thinking and planning to sucessfully finish. This feature shi.ts on the concept and is a pathetic marketing tool designed to hand-hold casual players to reel them in longer. Square should recognize the fact that FF has always been successful all this time as a niche market and made them what they are today. There is no need to upset your current fan-base just to reel in a quick buck from people that will just buy your game and play for 1-5 hours. Casuals will always be casual. They can attempt to adjust or they can leave as simple as that.- Needs to be more populated. FF will always be a ""grind-game"" true RPGs in general are like that. Might be a good idea to populate your explorable areas more or scale the rewards as the player levels increase to alleviate the grind. The game does neither. Story: 10/10- One of the game's few saving graces. Despite bombing important aspects of the game. This is the main reason why I feel compelled to recommend the game despite its shortcomings. If you can get over the slightly annoying game mechs/linearity/and its garbage port quality. Watching the story unfold while you are playing is more than enough reward for the sacrifice you made. Can't remember any other game that made me cry so much for kicks. It's no Shakespeare, that's true and it does have plot holes littered around the series, but it gets the job done regardless. With each character having their own sense of purpose that moves you while your playing. I've never seen such a cliche premise (save the princess/save the world) told in such a complex mind-fu.ck kind of way.			"

												Nice: -Awesome graphics and cut scenes -The combat system is really great especially fighting a boss that makes you shift between paradigms every second trying to stay alive while keeping up stagger while buffing/debuffing, Button-mashingly Palm-sweatingly Micro-managingly INTENSE! -Good music-Nice scenery. How nice? It-makes-you-wanna-print-screen-nice. -Good lore-It has a DATALOG that you can access in the game menu that lets you read and review certain events that got you confused. Also has information and details of the in-game lore. And of course, the information of your enemies or a Beastiary.-Giant CactuarNot Nice:-Only one type of side quest-I dont like their weapon system. It takes forever to fully upgrade them. -Too very super linear, no towns. You buy stuff at save points.-The story is kinda average-Smelly Chocobos :(At first, I was having problems using my Keyboard to play the game as when you press ESC key (in which my instinct always tells me to do that when making cancels), making a pop-up that confirms if you want to exit the game, which is really frustrating. Then I tried plugging in my USB controller which made the problem go away. If it wasn't for Sahz Katzroy, my gameplay would have been a really dull experience.			"

												In 10 hours worth of play, I feel like the game had nothing to grab me. Any tactical component the combat may have had was lost with the inclusion of an Auto button that chose pretty much the best attacks for me. Story wasn't anything interesting, and the world was basically a single linear path I followed with no deviation. It all looked pretty, and there's nothing necessarily 'wrong' with the game, it just didn't open up quick enough into something interesting.Edit: I'm at 40+ hours of play, nothing really changed. Still a linear path. It offers me a crafting upgrade system of sorts, but bottlenecks me with insane item and gil requirements. It offers me semi-customisation with the crystarium, but bottlenecks me with exorbitant costs for a single sphere. 11 chapters in and it gives me a Missions System, where I can take missions to hunt various monsters. 11 chapters in? Seriously?			"

												Let's see have seen alot of whining about this release, but nothing have to do with the actual gameplay. And that should be what matters, sure the game doesn't have 1080p atm so what? you don't think modders are working with this now? at least they didn't forget about 60FPS. Yes the game is locked at 720p is that bad? kinda but does that give this game a thumb down? no, do the game got graphic options? no not in-game but you can force things like AF and AA through Nvidia control panel or the equelant for AMD. So about the actual game? is it good? yes it's very good actually as good as the PS3 release. Why? because it's the same game. Are the controlls any good? yes they are actually very good i have tried this game with both gamepad and mouse and keyboard and you know what? the controlls are amazing. Final Fantasy XIII isn't just a game you merely enjoy. You fall in love with it. It's gorgeous worlds have you stopping to admire them in complete awe, while a graceful soundtrack massages your brain. Final Fantasy XIII is an amazing game. With an engrossing story and a thrilling new battle system, this is one title you can't afford to miss as an RPG fan. However, though it succeeds on the most important fronts, there are some notable areas where the game could have been better. The linear level design is a fairly large stumbling block, and if you are used to open-world games, it can make the entire experience feel a little claustrophobic.  i give the game 8/10 it's a very great game, it's not perfect but very close.

												The PC Port is atrocious as of now. Not only did they not bother making localization files optional downloads (Steam supports selective downloading of localization files), and have you thus install 60 gigabytes (49gb download) onto your machine, but they also failed to provide any sort of graphical options beyond Windowed/Fullscreen modes. No VSync, no Anti-Aliasing. Additionally, the game's internal renderer is locked to 720p, and the game won't output anything but 720p. Fullscreen on an 1080p screen will thus either stretch/scale accordingly, or add black bars.They have also failed to add audio options. There are no volume sliders at all.On the Gameplay front, there's enough been said already. The game is excruciatingly linear, and chock-full of cutscenes. For comparison: If you played Final Fantasy X and considered it too linear due to the lack of global world map and directly connected areas, you'll hate XIII. It takes a good 15-20 hours of corridor walking to reach the point where it opens up a little bit. There is little to nothing to distract you from narrow corridors.The combat system is shoving the Auto-Battle command down your throat right from the start. The command selects attacks and abilities based on dynamically calculated algorithms. Especially early on, where the characters are limited to one job, with one or two commands(!), the game turns into a simple ""Press A to do stuff"" simulator. The tactical element from previous Final Fantasy titles is almost completely lost as a result, as the game almost turns the player into a passive observer.On top of this, the game attempts to ""rate"" the player's combat performance from 1 to 5 stars, based on how long it took them to win a battle. The rating affects the item drops, but even then a 5 star rating will not guarantee even common drops. I'd also like to point out that the target time, especially early on, is very generous, almost giving double the time you actually need to finish a battle with a 5 star rating.Lastly, battles are completely isolated from one another. Where in previous FF titles you had to watch your HP carefully, and would take damage and negative status effects into the following battles, XIII instead heals the party to full health after a win. Wave-based engagements like seen in Final Fantasy X (most notably the tutorial section teaching you to pick targets wisely, or the Bevelle Marriage scene) do not stress you beyond the current, very short battle.As for the story I will just say it is very, very convoluted and throws technobabble at the player for lack of better writing. The characters contradict each other and themselves at every turn, and make you shake your head in disbelief. At least the Japanese Audio will make their voices bearable, though.Be prepared to read up on a lot of the game's terminology and background via the in-game Datalog to fully grasp the game's reasoning. Still, do not expect things to make complete sense.Graphically, it still looks quite nice, with pretty effects being thrown around. The vast amount of pre-rendered cutscenes (18, if I count the game's video files) look gorgeous, even if the contents aren't making for a good story. If you enjoy eyecandy, you will get it, even though the resolution lock and lack of options are a big failure on Square Enix's part.Overall, the pricetag reflects the game's quality. The mechanics and exploration are half-baked and too automated and controlled to satisfy an old franchise fan like me. The port is dreadful, and I would not recommend buying it until they at least offer a patch to add some basic settings for graphics and audio. If you can't wait, though, please don't expect it to be up there with the franchise's gems and fan-favorites. It ""innovated"" on all the wrong areas, and neglected its core vision as well as the franchise's strongest point: Storytelling and Character Development. As such, XIII is a lukewarm JRPG at best, and a below-average corridor crawler at worst.			"

												No Video/Audio Settings. Locked at 720pLess than 10 Rebindable keys (you can rebind the less useful commands) . Also Pressing ESC will Close the program instantly if play in Fullscreen. (fixed 22/10/2014)~20Gb of Pre-Rendered Cinematics. (Out of 26Gb Total)The In-Game FPS Mostly at 60 with a drop here and there when moving through the area.Pretty art Styles. The Graphics and Cinematics are pretty and shiny. It's a shame that they're only presented in 1280*720 resolution. Also The UI in the Combat are placed poorly and unnecessary big, it block half of the pretty combat moves most of the time.Combat system is typical Final Fantasy where you Select Actions and Targets and Watch them run.The Paradigm Shift allow your characters to switch roles during battle is pretty interesting.Your Characters only equip Weapon and Accessories. Can be quite boring at time, Since you'll be just Tapping A or Spacebar for Hours while moving throught the area and fight meaningless fights.The Story is pretty Long. But that might be just because there are cutscene very so often. sometime the game just let you run through a path between cutscenes.Conclusion:An Emulation of Final Fantasy XIII. Playing this game is like watching some pretty movies(in 720p) while occationally tapping fingers.(i got bored and stop playing)Get it If you like pretty CG and havn't already played it on other platform.Don't get your hopes up though.

Its a really fun game that I played a ton of on my ps3, but I don't own one of those anymore but I thought it would work here.

I love the characters, the voice acting and the story. The combat is good in my eyes and is enjoyable, although I didn't like how there was little freedom in the game till much later on. Once you get far you have more freedom, but I still enjoyed the linear path up till then, seeing the characters go their own ways and develop. An absolutely amazing game for screenshots, and with the amount of hours it takes to complete you will get tons of great shots. For Final Fantasy lovers its another great game, I mean for those who love the franchise overall and not just the old games. It is also a great game for rpg lovers. Worth it at full price but it does go on sale now and then.			"

Posted: April 12, 2015
												Until now I've never quit playing a Final Fantasy game in the entire franchise's history. I don't even hold the earlier series in nostalgic sacredness like so many. FF7 was not my favorite. I loved 3(6) as much as the core fans, but I loved 5 and even 12 especially. Wasn't a huge fan of 10, but 10-2 was a blast. I played 11 online for well over a year on my PS2 and even though it wasn't a ""real' FF game made no difference to me. It something different yet familiar and I enjoyed it in it's time. Point is I've experienced the series and have my own personal expectations when it comes to ups and downs. Being ""new"" doesn't sway me from critiquing a game so hard. I'm not mad because this game wasn't 7.5 or 6 HD.  I'm mad because this game was the first FF game I've refused to finish due to sheer stupidity on the games behalf. I've heard it was bad, but really assumed people were just not accepting a few things and that I'd find some kind of joy in playing it. Sadly, I owe all of these people an apology.The game had some amazing ideas but it played out through the most time consuming nonsensical game flow I've ever seen. Final Fantasy games are usually top quality JRPG games, but this felt like something some B-label released on the  Vita as a niche experiment for marketing. Someone made a video game that 'They"" wanted to play but they forgot about other people, and that's more than fantastic in the terms of selfish design. You should create experiences that mirror your own wants and needs, but you don't ruin a successful franchise to do it. The combat was actually a GOOD idea. Shifting into jobs and allowing other abilities to be used on the fly was forward thinking , but it's actually backwards in design. Monsters that have 89 million health so that you will consider the stagger meter at all times sounds tactical, but it's actually in-line with the rest of the game's thinking when it comes to cramming you down a corridor and forcing you to play a very specific way. Most of the fights boiled down to ""create a few sets and find the right rotation"" and once you did. It just became this treadmill of working your way through the same enemies over and over to get to the next key event. ""But that's Final Fantasy!"". Actually you'd be correct, but it's not as fun when you aren't dynamically creating CHARACTERS you feel confident in. You are more or less just leveling jobs. Since the system is based on time = reward and the mobs have so much health,  you eventually get to the point where you don't want to fight a group of mobs forever so you begin to forsake the tanky roles and get more risky with damage and the debuffer types. Hey so the system works right? No. I don't design a character I enjoy. I design a placeholder full of jobs that I leveled up to compliment other placeholder jobs. Then I put someone else in my party and I have to rearrange all of those sets again.  The fact that characters are kinda like Transformers in their abilities is cool, but to be honest it's just dumb to constantly rotate someone to cast Faith or Protect. You didn't stop a character from having the ability to be able to use a lot of skills from other jobs. You just put this weird gated system in that made it a puzzle game to get to the the spell you need. The game would have been 892949% better had I just picked which spells to give someone and limited the usage of them much like the older games, but ALSO a step towards something new and different reflected. You tried to reinvent the wheel here, but you put square wheels on an otherwise drivable car.Combined with the grindy ""level up equipment"" that's introduced some 15 hours into the game, and it's also nearly impossible make use of until AFTER the game opens up, Characters are only reflected in the cutscenes. Their abilities should actually define them. In the past we've had super memorable characters like Terra and Vivi that were a product of their abilties. Not placed on the screen as a mindless attitude between coming up with stupid combos of things for them to do whilst you fight on to the next cutscene. The game's image is saying Lightining is basically a Commando that runs around shoving her sword up everything's butt. In the actual GAME though she's great at casting spells and healing people, which is quite a contradiction to shoving a sword up someone's butt. Not to mention training her in said jobs was a pointlessly gated system of absolutely no-choice whatsoever. Hold the button, level the things up on this pretty screen. Beat a boss? You can do it some more!That said I hated this game. I really wanted to finish the story and give XIII-2 a chance since I already own it. I took a blind guess at how this game would end and a leap of faith into the interwebs. Wikipedia told me I was absoultely right in guessing the outcome because it's pretty to assume that every single established cliche would come into fruition (spoiler alert: it does!), so no I don't need to play this garbage for 30 more hours to feel satisfied nor justify my opinion that this is without a doubt one of the worst JRPG games I've ever played in the history of video games. It pains me to say that. This is a person that has done speedrun after speedrun of Final Fantasy 1 on the NES and tried crazy things like all White Mage parties. It's sad that the 1980's gave this level of flexibility and fun factor when it came to interacting with the game's mechanics and character choice. There is none of that here.  Pretty cutscenes cannot outweigh terrible game mechanics. Final verdict:3/10.This game is a corridor of linear failure that will annoy you if you expect to play an actual video game that tests something... anything... other than patience towards tedium and monotony. And this comes from a person that loves grindy JRPGS. (for Lolth's sake I played Marvel Heroes for almost 400 hours and that game is terribly grindy and admittingly boring! I couldn't stand to even finish this one)			"

												I know many people don't really like this installment to the FF franchise, but I quite liked it. Sure, it was quite linear but the graphics were pretty and the storyline was decent enough.  I liked the battle system as it really simplified everything for me (unfortunately, I get confused with battling a lot). I also liked that you could see the monsters roaming, which lets you avoid them, if you so wish, thus saving a lot of time.			"

												I'd like to start my review with the positive parts about the game.The story seems interesting but falls a bit flat.The graphics are great and it runs smooth even on older pcs.The characters are okay. Matter of taste. I find them not too bad.The controlls are alright in general but a bit sticky sometimes.But the overwhelmingly bad part what makes this game not even worth the 6,49€ on saleis the combat. Never in my life have I experienced a more boring combat than in FFXIII.Granted you don't have to use the auto-combat but there is literally no benefit for it if you don't.Put a healer, a sentinel and a pure dps in your team and click away.It doesn't matter what you do, just press enter. You won't die. You will always win.The only reason to play this game longer than for 10 minutes is if the story truly is capturing you.I honestly tried. But I just couldn't keep going. I genuinely almost fell asleep during combat.I cannot stress enough just how incredibly♥♥♥♥♥♥and boring this game is, solely because of the combat system.Difficulty changes nothing but numbers. Fights take even longer. So why bother.Don't buy this game. Seriously don't. It's not worth your money. "

												I feel in love with all the characters in this game.  I think because the story is so long, and that you have to invest so much time into completing it, that you really feel attached with the characters.  The end is very heartbreaking, a mixed of joy, and sadness. Overall , if you are a true final fantasy fantasy fan, then you probly know that this game is gone. If not, i will just tell you, its a GOOD game.  And if you ever have diffuclty in beating a monster/boss in any FF game, the number one rule of FF is that your gonna spend some time farming   ^-^9/10eNjoy ^-^            miss you Vanille and Fang <3			"

												Before I list the pros and cons, I'm still going to recommend you play this game, for the sequels if nothing else.Pros:Stellar soundtrack as you would expect from Square EnixDecent graphicsAmazing cutscenesLots of lore in the datalogYou can pick which language you want the dub inCons:Fight system is not based on picking what attack to use, but what skillset your character themselves has to pick fromUnlikable charactersQuestionable character decisions and motivationsDifficulty spikes. Really massive difficulty spikes are a real problem in this gameTo truly understand the story you HAVE to trawl through all the lore in the datalogsGets really grindy after you get to PulseIt's still not open world after you get to Pulse you just have slightly more choice to what order you do things in			"

												Hmm ... I'm not very far in, and I usually don't write reviews this early, but here I felt I should because I'm really taken aback. So far this has absolutely nothing to do with any FF games I've played in the past - VI, VII, X and X-2, which I all liked in their own way. But this installment of the series here seems to be just a linear ""press A to win"" corridor runner. Though it still plays like a real long tutorial, if I don't make use of the ""press A to win"" mechanics (auto battle), the battles feel confusingly chaotic. And while there seems to be a certain (albeit small) promise to the story, the characters are extremely unlikeable and behave more than cringeworthy. Lightning is the best of the bunch, but even she is just a cardboard cutout. I fear I probably will stop loss and drop this even though I recently bought all three of them ...Edit: After yet another set of corridors and boring monsters, I decided to uninstall. I'm sad that a once great series has stooped so low.			"

												This is what an upcoming Final Fantasy game should be aiming to be in the future. It may not be your game if you are looking for a truly classic RPG full of decissions and deep character development and stuff like that but don't get me wrong, this game is outstanding and when you hear Final Fantasy you always get the best OST, art style, graphics, FMVs, characters and general design.Final Fantasy XIII makes it easier for newcomers to the series and focus on letting the player enjoy the game as much as possible with easy gameplay and many cutscenes that will make your jaw drop. If you are a Final Fantasy veteran, you may find the game too streamlined but hopefully it won't be too boring for you to enjoy what this game has to offer.As any other Final Fantasy game, expect more than 30-40 hours of main story and some extra content in the form of bosses, secrets or missions.

DISCLAIMER: I own the ASIA version of this game, which means I have played with Japanese audio and English subtitles.ReviewEven with its linear design, this game is quite enjoyable. Especially for me as it is my first ever Final Fantasy game. At the first part, it’s all fun and games. Most of the time, you just have to click the auto-battle and eventually, enemies will die. As I progress through, it really gets harder and harder. I had to bring out tons of different guides from the internet on how to upgrade efficiently, I had to search the internet for the best combinations and which weapon fits each character perfectly. In the last chapter, I ended up turning down the difficulty from normal mode to easy mode because enemies just became a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥The good part is definitely not at the start, which is probably the reason a person will just stop playing. You can clearly see this from the average playtime of the users over here[steamspy.com].  ProsGame Length – One of the things you can expect from any Final Fantasy game is how long it takes to finish the story alone. For whatever price you got this game, you will surely get your money’s worth. Characters – I think they are all amazingly done; they will definitely grow on you. They should… Given how long this game is.Skill system – Upon reaching a certain chapter, all characters can build up any class types. But ofcourse, different characters excel at different classes.Cutscenes – This is already given, you can always expect that Square Enix will leave you in awe.NeutralPlot – I believe that there is not a single game on the franchise wherein the storyline is bad. I think it all comes down to which one is better. XIII may not be ranked as the top ones, but it is still great. Battle System – It’s a kind of battle system that you either love it or hate it. The game uses Command Synergy Battle, you can learn more about that in this site[finalfantasy.wikia.com]. Basically, you only control 1 character while the other two will fight automatically. And an ATB gauge which is utilized for your commands. Region Locking – Apparently, if you live in Asia or atleast bought this game from Asia, you are bound to only have Japanese audio and English/Chinese/English subtitles. I understand that Japanese audio is the original, and nothing beats the original. But it wouldn’t hurt to have an option, right? Meanwhile those who don’t live in Asia will have both English and Japanese audio. The only downside of this, is that you will be downloading around 26gb more than those who live in Asia. ConsBad Optimization – It’s like they forgot that they are porting this game to PC. The game has very limited graphic options, four options to be exact: Screen Settings (Full-Screen or Windowed), Resolution, Shadow Resolution and Anti-aliasing (MSAA). Top those with a 30 FPS lock in-game and a 60 FPS lock on some cutscenes. Very Linear Gameplay – It says linear as one of its genre in the store page, but I did not expect a tutorial for about 40 hours wherein three guys walk a corridor and eventually get a taste of some side quests.

												I've finally decided to play this game years after its release and it was a lot better than I was expecting after hearing it get dumped on over the last 8 years.The story is pretty average for a JRPG (in that bad writing, bad dialogue, but kinda charming type of way that most JRPS have). The characters were ok and I actually liked Lighting and Sazh, the only character I really disliked was Hope as I generally hate children characters and surprisingly Vanille grow on me from hate to indifference. Snow was also a♥♥♥♥♥♥character but not so bad that I hated him.I actually liked the combat more than most final fantasy games as it had me actually thinking a little more than your standard final fantasy game. Now, the game play was extremely linear and I can understand why people would dislike it. However, if you take a step back nearly all JRPS are linear games placed in an open worlds that are mostly empty, this game just gets rid of the empty world that I would normally ignore so I didn't have too many issues with it.Overall it's a pretty decent Final Fantasy game (nowhere near as good as 6 but still above average).Actual game aside, this port is full of technical issues and has horrible frame rate drops. The reason I don't play consoles is mostly due to the 30fps standard that most game have and this game hurt my head at times during the frame rate issues. If you cannot deal with 30fps or inconsistent frame rates do not buy this game.			"

												Final Fantasy XIII has been a hot button issue for many fans of the series, and of RPGs in general.  It cuts a few of the archetypal role-playing elements, while adding little to make up for it.  It's linear, you're gonna be dealing with pre-made parties, tutorials, and little customization for about %70 of the main game.  Regardless of all that, I really enjoyed Final Fantasy XIII.  The combat is simple, yet fun and rewarding.  The game looks great, and the music and SFX are top notch, and even though the story and cast are a bit mediocre, it's still very much worth a play.Now, the big elephant in the room...Being locked at 720p isn't what most of us were hoping for, even if they did allow for 60fps.  I understand a lot of gamers are gonna be disappointed by this, but for me, Square Enix has delivered a product worth a buy from me.  The price is low, I have not experienced any bugs or glitches, and this could possibly open up a future of more Final Fantasy games on PC.Overall, good game, but not what a lot of people wanted out of a main Final Fantasy title, and a mediocre PC port at a low price point.

												Having a lot of hours and run throughs in the game, I would recommend this for anyone looking to play this Final Fantasy Game. Just not on this platform. Xbox go for it, Play Station go for it. The PC wasn't the original intention for this game to be played on. Most of the time I run it with around 30 fps. Whenever I get into a battle it drops frames and it's a lot more enjoyable with a controller. Though you could just connect a controller to your computer to play it. The story is really enjoyable although it is really linear which you just have to get used to. The next two Final Fantasy XIII's are not as linear as this one. The music is also really enjoyable with most other Final Fantasy Games. If you are going to finish this I would highly reccomend finishing the next two titles in the XIII Series. It's kind of funny cause all of the XIII games are considered three parts of one game but just sold seperately. Overall I would highly reccomend this game			"

I'm 41 hours in it and still didn't finish it. This game has 13 chapters which are all amazing. The gameplay is just as you would expect it to be from a Final Fantasy game. The only issue really is the problem with the definition which can be easely fixed with the GeDoSaTo. In summary.

												Honestly I dunno why people call this the best FF game in its time, it's linear, the variety of monsters are lacking, summons are the most useless things I have ever seen, the story is so contraversal, the characters are so boring that they needed to make 2 more games to give them more time to develope themselve eg: Hope not becoming a crybaby and ends up being a leader to a great cause, there is not a single village, town, city or even a single farm where you can relax and talk to people to get some history or backstory in things. This wasn't even a game, this was a long movie that requires you to press 1 button repeatedly and then another button to switch roles for heals and buffs, I didn't feel that I was doing anything and just letting the game for me, oh and also AI's is the worse idea for a FF game, there have been so many moments when I needed an Ai to do something or help the character I am controlling and it just screws me over, I hate AI's controlling my characters, I'd pretty much prefer to control all my characters like the good old FF days (FF 1-10-2) and last thing the side quests are the most boring side quests I have ever done, ""Go kill that thing"" ""Great here's some mediocre items for your troubles"" ""Now kill that thing"" and it is the same thing over and over again. People that claim ""Don't worry, the game is linear now but once you are 50% done then you go to an open world."" No, no you people lie, that is not an open world, it looks like an open world but it's not, it's just a really big outdoor room that gives you the illusion of an open world, I don't see how people find this to be the best FF that surpassed 7, it doesn't it just doesn't.

												Square did right by attempting to remove the garbage filler from JRPGs, such as persistent health, MP, having to actually choose every battle command, having to control everyone, etc. It's really nice to see a company trying to fix outdated ideas. Unfortunately they took out so much that there isn't really a game left. It's just hallways, interspersed with rote battles and mind-numbing cut scenes. There's no exploration either, but sometimes the hallway you're in branches and allows you to fight some more enemies in exchange for a treasure chest. The characters are dull tropes and the dialogue is worse than a 4Kids dub. Even the leveling up system feels like it was pared down: it's like FFX's Sphere Grid, but lacking any kind of significant branching. I'm about 14 hours in, and the game is still feeding me a steady drip of new battle mechanics, each more tedious than the last; unfortunately, new mechanics don't make the game more fun or interesting, because battles are still essentially just blocks of time where you mash A for a while. I mean, sometimes the game throws you a single stronger enemy and you need to switch between preset battle styles, but in practice it feels more tedious than exciting or interesting. Battles aren't the only thing that's repetitive: the dialogue gets repeated and rephrased a lot too, so I frequently found myself watching two dimensional characters think out loud at each other over and over. Of the ~14 hours I've played, I think about half of it has been just watching cut scenes. Some of the sequences are so long there are (sometimes multiple) save points in the middle. Some of the sequences are so long that my Steam Link shuts off because it hasn't received any inputs in a long time.I want to like this game, and I feel like if I kept at it, by the time I got to the end the battles could be legitimately interesting. But I also feel like it'll still be dripping me new ideas right up to the final boss. I've kind of been playing this in the hopes that at some point, they say, ""OK, tutorial over!"" but, again, I'm at 14 hours and so far the game has only treated me like a moron and I'm just kind of tired of doing the same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over to advance characters that I can't force myself to pay attention to.

												As a 2nd playthrough of this game as i played it on PlayStation on it's original release back in 2010, I have really come to appreciate Final Fantasy XIII.Final Fantasy XIII is the 13th main entry in the Final Fantasy Series, and was realeased for PS3 and Xbox 360 in Japan in 2009. It follows the story of Lighting and her comrads who are branded enemies of Coccon, there own home planet.  Together, they overcome their troubles and help save Coccon from eniemes and it's corrupt politics.Pros- Battle/Combat system is great, I believe it was done nicely and is a great transition from its previous iterations.- Great Music; the orchestrated music fits in beautifully throughout the game. - Some Lovable and relatable characters; But some people might find the main protagnist, Lighting to be boring. - Provides hours of gameplay and end-game side quests. - Graphics, Art Style and CGI Cutscenes are beautiful, they blew me away when i first played the game.Cons - Grinding. I mean, heaps of Grinding. The Boss fights in this game can be extremeley difficult if you do not level up and upgrade your characters correctly through the game. - Confusing Story. The story is completely all over the place, as there is too much happening all at once and is to much to understand. It took me 2 playthroughs to understand the game's story fully. - Not too well optimised on PC, and lack of graphics options.Other than that, I believe Final Fantasy XIII is a pretty solid entry in the Final Fantasy Series, but I do not recommend it if you are new to the Franchise and want to start off with this game, I'd rather recomend Final Fantasy 10 if you are a newcomer.

												Final Fantasy 13 is the most recent installment in the series to be released for PC.While a controversial game, for many reasons such as it's inability to disguise a mainly linear game and 20-hour long tutorial it also holds ground with a deep combat system that's easy to learn, lifetime to master.The games follows 6 humans turned into l'Cie, servants of fal'Cie(gods of sorts) to do their bidding and destroy Cocoon. The story picks up immediately into a conflict and throws you straight into action, albeit you mash your mouse button for a while before things get interesting.Provided you beat the gruelling tutorial-hallway, you are rewarded with an extensive world to explore freely with numerous sidequests and great scenery to accompany it.PROS[] Great Soundtrack[] Massive end-game[] Fantastic storyline[] Very deep combat systemCONS[] Linear for a fair amount of time[] A few main characters are pains in the butt[] Squeenix limited it to 720p for some reasonAll in all, I'd say if you are willing to try a game that has a bit of a slow start, you are rewarded with a great storyline, a deep combat system and a fantastic story!8/10 Great game.

												For the past year I avoided this game like a plague, seeing that most reviews were either bad or ridiculously bad. Finally after giving it the pass for so many times (it's summer sales anyway), I finally bought this copy and gave it a try.I'm a total idiot. I've just realised:1.  I've missed this game all for naught for the past 2 years.2.  Whomever wrote all those junk review, do you even FF?  Linear? Boring? Really? 3.  I'm not going to take reviews seriously anymore.  Especially on FF titles.On the bright side, I have you *********s to thank for, since I have the whole trilogy to binge through this year!Update 25 July 2016:The first 10 chapters is akin to an interactive story, where you're guided through the background story and character development.  The pace is slower than previous FF titles, but it also paces the player into gradually learning the game's system.  You will notice that there are more and more things to fiddle with as you progress into the game.  It won't take long before you find yourself into the routine of building up stats, leveling up weapons, running from point A to point B, and tapping the 'ok' button through every battle.  You will hate it if:You're looking for more challenge and control over the story line from Chapters 1 - 10.  However, you will still get to develop your characters and weapons.  Boss fights are surprisingly challenging.  You will like it if:You're here for the JRPG element of FF series - particularly the storyline.  You will realise that considerable effort has been invested into this aspect, at the risk of oversimplifying interaction at the player's part.  Nevertheless, I enjoy sitting back with a 6-pack of ice-cold beer after a hard day's work, hitting the same button while looking at the battle scenes. Doesn't tax the brain too much but gives just the right amount of entertainment. Oh and did I mention that sight seeing it great too, it's like Skyrim except you don't get to jump off the cliff.You will find a significant change of experience on Chapter 11, where you are presented with a sizeable 'open' map, and the freedom to complete missions at will.  Will update my impression again once I clock more hours into the game.A must-know before you decide NOT to buy:A lot of critics (starting the raging bitter ones) compare FFXIII with other FF titles. This is probably what stopped a lot of genuine buyers from buying this title, myself included. While most arguments are valid, being judged as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ compared to other FF titles doesn't make it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ compared to all other games available on Steam.  If you're into JRPG and don't hate FF games in general, chances are you're happier buying and playing this than some other random title on Steam.Tl;dr1. FFXIII is not bad enough to give it a pass - still better than a lot of other games2. Not a great choice if you're in for a challenge from the onset3. Great choice if you're in for a relaxing, therapeutic story-telling jrpg experience "

												This is my first JRPG and I liked it. It was different from any other games I've played. Its combat system is quite different. In western RPGs such as Witcher 3, battle is real time. You can explore and then get into a battle with someone and then fight and win and go back to exploring, or can even run away in the middle of a fight and go back to exploration seamlessly. But in this game, you explore and then when you get into a fight with someone, you enter the battle mode, which is totally different from exploration. You can't run away in the middle of a battle. It will go on until the fight ends. Exploration in this game is very limited. It has been called a corridor simulator for good reasons, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. Some of the environments are quite beautiful, but it's mostly look-but-don't-touch. Battle is somewhat turn based, but not exactly. In turned based games or game modes you wait for your turn. But instead of waiting for your turn, in the battles of this game, you wait for something called your ATB meter to fill up. When it fills up, you can fight, which consumes your meter. So again you wait for it to fill up and then fight. That's a very simplistic explanation because the battle system of this game has quite a bit of depth to it and I really enjoyed it. It was refreshing. When it comes to role-playing, the thing that stands out most from western RPGs is that you can play multiple roles at the same time. And you can change between those roles within an on going battle. For example one offensive role is called Commando and you do mostly physical damage with it. But then if you developed your character as a medic, you can switch to that role mid battle and you can heal yourself and your allies and once done, you can switch back to Commando. I was enjoying the game till Chapter 11. But Chapter 12 and Chapter 13 were dull and frustrating. There is no story progressoin. They filled the last two chapters of the game with bosses. Even some other enemies were so tough they felt like bosses. It kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. But don't get me wrong, I am still glad I played it because up to Chapter 11 the game is quite fun. The final story progression is after the final boss battle. So they could have removed chapter 12 and chapter 13 completely, and just put the final boss battle at the end of chapter 11. It would have been a much better game. I am glad I finished it and I recommend it. It's a lot of fun.			"

												This is the worst port I have ever seen. No graphics settings? Really? It says locked to 60fps, why am I getting ~20 on a rig that runs BF4 on ultra at 60? Seriously Square Enix, after Tomb Raider and Deus Ex: HR failing to even launch on my PC due to reasons unbeknownst to me due to your god-awful customer service, I'm never buying a game from you again. This is really sad.			"

												THE GAME:What I once regarded as my least favorite Final Fantasy game by far, and one of my least favorite games ever, has somehow grown on me quite a bit given a lot more time. To get the negatives out of the way, the bulk of the game, especially the critical path, is extremely linear, sometimes even resembling series of interconnected hallways with battles scattered along the way. That said, there is a very rewarding wealth of late-game content awaiting those who can persevere. A huge number of optional side quests and expansive, wide-open areas, in stark contrast to the former half to two thirds of the game. However, as I found out, it is very much worth the wait. And the real core of the experience, and what drove me to keep going to the end (and then some), is the excellent combat system. The battle system is fairly unconventional for a FF game, while still drawing a lot of inspiration from the previous entries, giving a sense of familiarity to series fans, while also making it feel very fresh and different. This difference is something that you may love or hate. Yes, there is a lot of ""mash A to win"" in the combat here, but once the game finally allows you to experience all of what the combat system has to offer, you'll understand that the addition of an ""auto battle"" menu option in battle doesn't actually dumb down or simplify the tried and true Final Fantasy combat, but instead shifts the tactical focus to clever use of the ""paradigm shift"" mechanic at the right times to dole out the damage, buff/debuff, heal, etc. What this ultimately means is FFXIII offers as much tactical potential in its combat as the previous games in the series, while making it feel much faster-paced and intense. It is extremely unfortunate that the game forcibly holds your hand for nearly 10 hours before finally letting you really get an idea of what this combat can offer, and another 15-20 hours on top of that to really let you go nuts with it, but if you can stick it out, you will be rewarded greatly.Visually, the game is still incredible looking, regardless of the fact that it came out nearly 5 years ago. The music is excellent as well, almost across the board, as is usually the case with the Final Fantasy series. As for the story and characters, it's a mixed bag, and definitely something that will differ based on personal tastes. For me, I didn't find much substance in either. There are certainly some flashy moments here and there, but I mainly looked forward to getting back to combat any time a cutscene popped up.THE PORT:Now, just like the game is a bit of a mixed bag, the same goes for this PC port. It's pretty obvious that there wasn't a ton of effert put into sprucing the game up for it's PC debut: a complete lack of graphical options, resolution that is locked to 1280x720, plenty of performance issues varying from user to user, and a MASSIVE download size weighing in at about 50 gigabytes. It's far from a polished release, for sure. That being said, it's also a relatively inexpensive release, at a regular $15 at the time of this writing, and for that price and the amount of time I've been able to put into it so far, I can look past the few crashes and occasional framerate hiccups (or chokes, at times), and be pretty happy with the purchase. And if they manage to patch the game up and improve performance, then all the better.TLDR:The game has an amazing combat system hidden under a soso story and HOURS of linear, handholding gameplay, but the wait is well worth it. The PC port is also pretty iffy, but if you can look past the performance flaws, you'll have a good time with it for the price.			"

												Lets take a minute to consider this, ignoring the port, ignoring how awfully Square Enix botched the Job on the PC version and lets take a look the game for a second and ask ourselves a single question: Is Final Fantasy XIII bad?NO IT'S NOT! I don't understand the hate towards this game, i understand that it has awful flaws. The cosntant tunnel runs being the main gripe, but gameplay wise is it bad? No! the combat system is actually interesting, the issue with it is that it isn't fully realized, they had an idea but they didn't fully execute a team wide combat system for some reason, but despite that its still a very fun and interesting combat system. As for the story, it isn't as conveluted as most people might think, the main problem here is that the names of the ""Deities"" are largely similar to what the Human Drones and ""Branded"" humans are, but despite that the backstory is actually quite unqiue! I love the world buliding, the locations, the general universe and its all quite exciting if you think about it. The main downfall storywise is the likability of the characters; Snow is overly passionate, Hope is all a bit too whiney at the beginning before gaining his Edulon, Vanille always seems like an awkward mix of Postitive and Depressed. but I feel like most of the issue here is fixed through the Japanese Voice Acting, because they deliver the lines much more genuinely than the English counterparts that go full ham and not enough ability to tone it down! Besides what I see as the worst game in the Franchise - Final Fantasy VIII - comparitively its so much better, but I still see hoards of people give VIII a glowing score beause ♥♥♥♥ing nostalgia! but its not much different to Final Fantasy X as a game now is it? I mean they're similar yet they both are hold in different acclaim and I think there is a reason.Endless Corridors. Check. A plotline involving the destruction of a civilization through the transformation into said destructive force (Ragnarok and SIN). Check.  Character with a Shadey past and Moody demeanor (Lightning/Auron). Check. Token happy Ethnic guy with troubled past (Sazh/Wakka). Check. Scared healer needing the support of everyone who finds their feet (Yuna/Hope). Check. Its scary how similar the two games and I think thats partially the reason. but I feel like the main hate of this game is beacuse Square are realizing Final Fantasy is the same game year after year, and they've wanted to change that since XII/Kingdom Hearts. So this was the first step in an entirely new direction. They want to keep the old souls happy, so they made Bravely Default, but they've come to realise that Final Fantasy can't be the same game anymore, they want it to be more of a cinematic experience. Final Fantasy XV looks like the prime example of that.edit: The PC version suffered from awful porting with no graphics options. They somehow vamped up the graphics so much that when it turned it on after the update I literally♥♥♥♥♥♥myself after seeing the difference. it looks so. much. ♥♥♥♥ing. better. than. the. console. counterparts.Literally 8/10 right now.Square enix are seeing the PC market as a serious money maker and they seem to care right now. this is only a good thing			"

												Having being very familiar with the PS3 version of FINAL FANTASY XIII, I feel pretty confident to write this review for the Steam version, thus why my playtime may not seem that high.(And judging by some of your comments, I am aware that there are some graphical issues currently surrounding the port)FINAL FANTASY XIII is not a bad game. Honestly, it’s not. Not as bad as everyone says anyway. As far as story goes, it’s pretty much the same old Final Fantasy formula. A group of unsuspecting heroes must travel to the farthest reaches of the world in order to destroy an ancient evil which hangs the very fate of the world in the balance. However, FINAL FANTASY XIII (referred to as FF XIII from now on) has probably one of the most convoluted narratives I have ever come across, which needed three games in order to straighten out (and even then they didn’t do all that great a job.) FF XIII is an epic adventure, and is successful in managing to make its self interesting and is sure to hook your attention for the 40-50 hours you will be spending there. However, the game does take a while to get off. Things start to get interesting around hours 10-20, where the pacing begins to move the game more steadily. The story is told from the perspectives of our new playable heroes; Lighting, Snow, Hope, Sazh, Fang and Vanille. These characters have been subject to a lot of criticism, which is understandable because most of them are extremely unlikable and far too whacky for their own good. They fit well in to the story however, and that’s probably the only thing that makes them bearable.  The gameplay is probably one of the better aspects of the game, as the new Paradigm System is a huge improvement on previous Final Fantasy battle systems. It allows complete customisation of the battle field and characters, as the new level-up system allows you to level up certain aspects of your characters. As far as a Final Fantasy game goes, this really does break the chain and dares to be different. As the first FF game to grace the 7th console generation, it tried to be something new and I think it succeeded in doing so. It is a very enjoyable game, despite its many flaws – and is easily the best game in the FINAL FANTASY XIII trilogy. It’s whacky, it’s new and it’s different. But sadly, I think it can only be enjoyed fully by a fan of the series. If you are looking to join the Final Fantasy universe, do not start with this one. Try out FINAL FANTASY VII, and see how you feel from there.All in all, FINAL FANTASY XIII does not deserve the criticism it gets. It’s not the best Final Fantasy, nor is it the worst. If you decide to give this game a bash, then you DON’T need to play FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 and Lighting Returns to get the full story. They essentially tarnish the narrative in FF XIII, so only get in to the trilogy if you are ready for a commitment. + Great battle system, one of the best that the series has to offer+ Story is told in an interesting way. Characters interact well with each other and the narrative + Level up system- Convoluted narrative. Made worse by unnecessary sequels- Poor pacing. Game takes  a while to kick off- Bad port- Over powered bosses. What else did you expect? It’s Final Fantasy 8/10			"

												Beautiful graphics and music. The story is quite confusing at first, you will need 50-60 hours to complete a very linear story. During this time the fights are pretty easy. The end game is a huge sandbox map. The fights are much more difficult and challenging. If you want to max all the characters and weapons and finish all Cie'th (additional) missions with a 5 star rating you'll need 150-200 hours.The negative thing about the game is that sometimes fps drops for a few seconds, but it's not a big deal.

												A streamlined jRPG that emphasizes plot and stylish combat over the tedium of towns and most of the micro-management. About the only thing left on the latter front is the weapons upgrading, which you can take if you're into it, use a guide to get it out of the way or, so I hear, ignore entirely.Speaking of plot, it can be a little convoluted and certainly is a lot to take in at first but not to worry, everything will be explained eventually. Often slated for very linear game progression, this game design decision at the very least does its best to help you follow the story instead of having you search for it. Still, there's secrets and the occasional time and place for grinding and side quests if you so choose.The semi-automatic battle system, aside from being where it's at, takes a little while to get used to. Instead of might-as-well-be-action-game real-time gameplay and the contemplatetiveness of a full-on turn based system, you get an interesting mix of both. First you take your time and plan ahead before battle setting up team formations and then during one, you're fully engaged managing them letting your team play out their assigned roles while reserving the right to more direct control of your party leader.Audiovisually, the game's got that Squeenix Seal of Quality stamped on it, although some locale and feral creature designs are a bit too gaudy for my liking. Voice acting, for the most part, is alright. Same goes for the characters portrayed but fortunately you can bench the ones you like the least later in the game. Still I wish the entire entourage was visible while travelling, not just the selected battle team.Technically the game has a some performance issues which can be mostly dealt with guides. With that done, the game plays beautifully with a controller and streams flawlessy to your TV over the Steam Link.Some helpful links:http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIIIhttp://www.beforeiplay.com/index.php?title=Final_Fantasy_13 "

I LOVE Final Fantasy XIII, I am an ardent defender of the game itself. This port however doesn't do it justice. Game has been patched, but the patch is pretty much a joke. It essentially just does was GeDoSaTo did. And ended up creating a few more problems in the process like FMVs now stutteringList of issues currently remainingLow volume. The game currently has about 20dBfs worth of headroom until it hits the noise ceiling of -0.0dBfsNo volume slider. People could balance the audio to their taste or turn off thingsPoor performance during battle and FMVsMicrostuttering when playing above 30FPS.Let's look at this graph http://u.cubeupload.com/MrBonk/ae5Untitled1.jpgThe top line is Framerate and the bottom is frame time.This sample was taken over the course of 60seconds of gameplay in and out of battles with a polling rate of 16ms (a game running at 60FPS SHOULD spit out frames every ~16.67ms or so. When it doesn't, the result is microstuttering or what is commonly known now as ""Frame pacing issues"")(Ignore the drops down to 0 as that is normal with a fast polling rate)  You will want to notice however, the lines between those gaps. This should be a flat line like this http://u.cubeupload.com/MrBonk/wcap.jpg So in battle, the game is constantly spiking frames upwards of 33ms. Causing the game to stutter and drop frames.  No stable framerate caps available. See the above. Need 30FPS,60FPS and unlocked frame caps. You can stabilize performance by using a 30FPS cap and 1/2 refresh rate Vsync. But that doesn't do anything for 60FPS.Sub-par low resolution ultra compressed Bink FMVs60GB DL FOR THE ABOVE VIDEOS. Because game includes both JPN and ENG FMVs instead of smartly offering different versions to download or as free DLCYou'd think they'd have a clue already since their Europe/NA branch is so prolific on PC as it is.Square Enix should offer several builds to downloadlower quality FMVs - Englishlower quality FMVs - JapanesePS3 quality FMVs - EnglishPS3 quality FMVs - JapaneseWith some proper effort, SE could've killed this port. They could've even improved issues stemming from the in-Engine FMVs being moved to Real time, thus saving a ton of file space.These are supposed to be AAA first party games (Whole XIII series) and they can't get it right, and obviously they didn't do any proper research or give the port the budget and time it deserved and NEEDED			"

http://steamcommunity.com/app/292120/discussions/0/613938693093404302/DISAPPOINTING: Final Fantasy XIII is a bad port - Play it on the PS3 if you got the console to boot.Clearly this is a straight port of the Xbox 360 version and not the PS3 version, and not even a better one at that.720p resolution looks damn bad on my 1080p monitor. I was expecting 1080p 60fps since this damn game is 4 years old! That's a granny game in terms of gaming lifespan!The framerate issue is terrible. On my G55VW with a GTX660M, it runs an average of 24 - 28 fps (it hits 40fps at times but come-on, should have locked it to 30fps instead). It even drops to a mere 18fps. You gotta be kidding me!There are no Graphical Settings to tweak to make the game run smoother at least.This is just terrible. I've played it on the PS3 before and I wanted to dip into the story once more. I wish Steam has a refund policy in place.			"

Even if it's this cheap the game simply doesn't work properly and that's really unacceptable for me, so I hope Square Enix will learn a lesson after this game and bring FFXV and others to Steam.			"

Not everyone has a controller, or wish to play with one so until they fixes this issue it's unplayable. As if that wasn't bad enough this game also forces 720p, the game actually looked better on PS3 which had a 1080p setting.I really hope they patch these issues because I was really excited to play it before today and found out it was just another poorly coded port.

												Like many others have said - this game is extremely linear. If you've ever played any of the other FF games and enjoyed all the side quests and mini games, then you're probably going to dislike this game. Half the ""game"" is cut scenes, while the other half is you drudging along the designated path and battling monsters while listening to the characters whine about why you're taking too long to move forward. If you played FF7 and you thought Cloud was a whiny little b****, then do yourself a favor and skip all the cut scenes (seriously, you'll want to strangle Hope every time he opens his mouth).The battle system makes it too easy to win. Don't get me wrong, I've had my fair share of dying (stupid wyverns), but the way the battle system is designed lets you do auto-moves for the rest of your party so you just have to worry about what attack/spell your character is going to do. You can switch between these auto-execute commands (have all your party members heal, attack, support, or a mix) with a few keystrokes, and sometimes it's necessary to be quick. The screen will start to get a red haze around the edges when you or a party member is low on health, which is nice because I forget about my party members a lot of the time because I'm not really controlling them.In order to get the full story (I was about 15 hours in before I realized) you have to read the journals/data logs that update after every cut scene, and even then it's still not clear what's going on. What the hell ARE the fal'Cie? WTF is Cocoon? And why do Pulse and Cocoon fal'Cie hate each other (if that's the right question to even be asking)? Don't judge my opinion as harshly as I'm judging this game because I haven't finished it yet, I think I'm almost done, thank god. Someone mentioned that this game isn't for keyboard and mouse, but this was only the second contemporary game I've ever played on the computer (I played Myst, Journeyman, and Wolfenstein way back in the day on Windows 98), and I was able to play just fine. The graphics are nice and there's beautiful countryside to be seen, if only it were an open world....By now you should get my point - if you're a FF fan, I would recommend skipping this game in the series. My friend cried out in agony when I told him I was playing it. He said he would never buy it based on reviews from when it came out. I see why.TLDR: If you want a simple, linear, and confusing af RPG with pretty colors, this game is for you. If you are a diehard FF fan (and if you are you'll probably play this game anyways, or already have), move along to FF 14.			"

												People are not recommending the title because of some issues: - Lack of graphical options - Game locked on 720p - Big♥♥♥♥♥download (~50GB)This review is to rate the game itself, to give people clues about if they will enjoy the game or not. About the three issues listed above, there are the solutions: - Use GeDoSaTo - Use GeDoSaTo - Sorry, the game is really big, no solution for this oneIf you want to know how good is the game, continue reading, if you just care about the problems, they're over, you can ignore the rest.First of all, the game is GORGEOUS! It is surrealistic like most titles of the series, the story is a little complicated, but well written. Most characters will captivate you, even the ones who lack a little depth(I'm looking at you, Snow). The plot twists are not monumental, but they will hold your interest. Everything looks done with attention to details. If you like to think about the characters and the events, you will like this game.The game is VERY (I mean, like REALLY) linear. There is no open world to explore (exceptions in some chapters) and there is not much to do besides the main quest. I did not find this too bad, the main quest is good enough to make the game worth it.The combat system brings something new to the series and, personally, I enjoyed that. It sometimes gives more action than Final Fantasy XII system. You cannot control your teamates actions, only the party leader's. The AI is relatively good (there is no much left for the AI to do, since you will select their role) and there is the paradigm shift mechanic, which allow you to change the roles of your team to adapt to different situations in battle. Those roles change a lot of things, from the damage you deal and receive to the actions/skills available and battle support. The stagger bar on enemies and characters brings a new aproach to damage dealing, sometimes is prefreable to do less damage in order to prepare a more efficient offensive.The music and dialogs are nicely implemented, you can feel that the characters have life. The music ambientation and placing is perfect and will atract you even more to the game. The only thing I can blame in this section is the dialogs text. Although they're mostly interesting and full of emotion, some lines don't feel ""natural"", like ""no one would say this""(I'm looking to you again, Snow!).Overall, I enjoyed the game a lot, I played it on Xbox and now I want to play it again on PC. I hope the sequels come to PC as well.Rating: 9/10			"

I'm enjoying it so far with no bugs.Here is the link to download his fix.http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=618I can recommend the game if you really wanted to play this game, like me. However, it was not cool of Square Enix to tell us that the game only ran at 720p AFTER the game released. I'm hoping that they patch it up to make it official, maybe even improve the performance and add some settings like AA and AF. At the moment, it's not worth the hassle getting the game to run in 1080p with a third party program, and the controls are abysmal, ESC to close the game? What is this? A unity game? Five Nights at Freddy's? ESC should open the menu, like every other game.Great game. Really, really, REALLY bad port.			"

												I pre-downloaded this. I was excited.Finally got onto the game and there was no graphic settings whatsoever. Just locked there. My face "":<"".Hopefully this could be sorted and they could add something to the game? I don't want this pro computer just to play it those types of graphics, cooommmee onnn, I know a ton of people would agree with me on that.I love Final Fantasy, but I want to enjoy the game as much as I can possibly can. (Hopefully in Ultra) ^^But right now, no. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless they don't mind the graphics!Come on Square Enix + Steam! Make us proud and add those SETTINGS!			"

												-----OPINION ALERT - PROS AND CONS ARE BELOW-----I love this game. The music, story and characters are all expertly woven together throughout the story flawlessly. Whilst people would argue differently over the characters, they often fail to realise that a character you hate is just as good as a character you love in terms of, well, their CHARACTER. It is the reason we all wanted Geoffrey dead in Game of Thrones, because he was such a good CHARACTER.If you have not played any Final Fantasy game before this is a fantastic game to begin with. The best, I would argue. Not that this is the games only redeeming factor, nor is it diminished by any of the other games. If you are someone who is looking to step into this series and see what all the commotion is about, then this is the game for you. Should you like it, continue on through to play the coming sequels to this Trilogy that will be released over the next year or so. Should you not, put the game down and walk away, you lose nothing but a few hours of your time, if that. You are only denying yourself the chance to experience what I think to be an absolutely outstanding game if you shape your decisions off of the vocal hatred witnessed often for this title.This review is made for the people looking to test the water in our critically acclaimed Final Fantasy but are unsure of where to start. Do not look to this game and be discouraged by a vocal minority that spout various criticisms and compare it to their beloved Final Fantasy '#'. This game has a much larger fanbase that love the game than the ones who adamantly put it down at every turn. The fact that they do so in both the reviews and forums of a game they don't own speaks volumes as I'm sure you can imagine.Okay, opinions aside now I'll list you a couple of quickfire Pros and Cons.PROS:.Story Rich.Beautiful Soundtrack.Beautiful Graphics.Beautiful and Varied Scenery.Constant Character Development.Wide variety of Character customization in the forms of Weapons and Equipment and a unique levelling system..Plethora of challenging Endgame contentCONS:.Considered linear initially.Characters can be unrelatable at times, if you don't take the time to read the Data Logs..Starts off slowly.Difficult, though this can be made considerably easier by grinding			"

												Ever since I first played a bit of this game on a friend's console, I've been waiting for the PC port I knew was going to come out. The game looked gourgeous on the PS3 and I couldn't wait to see how good it would look on a PC, running at 60 FPS and at a 1080p resolution. The day of release came and I anxiously booted it up, only to become frustrated. The first window the game opens before running has only two options: Windowed/Fullscreen selection and Audio Language selection. I figured the graphics options would be inside the game itself, so I got in and looked for them. I found nothing, because there are NO GRAPHICS CONFIGURATIONS in this game. You can't change the resolution to 1080p, it's locked to 720p. You can't turn Vsync on or off, and I think it's ON by default, causing very annoying slowdowns since the game isn't optimized at all.After a liittle more than an hour playing it, the game seems to be good, especially to me since I'm a Final Fantasy fan, but  Square Enix making the PC users play the game under these conditions is just disrespectful. My recommendation will stay at NO until they decide to correct their mistake.			"

												It's an extremely bad port. Locked at 1280x720 resolution, no graphics settings, absolutely gigantic download (60 GB + 120 GB required for install), and badly optimized so framerate jumps all over the place and stutters a lot. The FMV cutscenes and audio are also supposedly lower quality than the PS3 version.I know it's not right to judge the game entirely technically, but since this is a port of an old game released YEARS AGO and the only selling point was for people to play it on PC with enhanced graphics and all, well...it does not deliver that at all. You might as well play the console version for a better experience.Thank god there's at least a way to mod higher resolutions in, but really, Square should've fixed that themselves. It's outrageous to release any kind of PC game without offering any graphics options whatsoever and it just shows that they paid no attention whatsoever into this port. Even the instant esc-button closing the game feels super cheap like this was a test build and they couldn't be bothered to create a proper menu for it.I'm all for more games being ported to PC but this minimum effort kind of release is not the right way to do it at all. I can't support it. I'm only playing it because I missed the PS3 release which I might as well have played instead.			"

												I've been playing this game for about a week (Non-stop) until the game is over.So I have decided to make a review abou this game.So,first thing i just wanna say that this game is absalutely amazing! I can assure you that Square-enix took one step in the right direction.In Final Fantasy XIII you will find everything a game should have: -Great story -well-developed-compelling characters -stunning enviroments/landscapes-one of the best musical scores of the series-entertaining battle system -and DIFFICULTY.To those who haven't play this game I really recommend you to try this one!And before that,I just want to remind you that this game is a turn based strategy.If you don't like TBS game.Then i strongly recommend do not ever buy this game.BUT if u like it,then BUY it. I can guarentee that u won't regret after buying this game.

												Final Fantasy XIII is the most finely polished turd I have ever played. My score is tethering just on the edge between Recommended and Not Recommended.  But thanks to the production values I can’t deny I had a reasonably good time with the game. Nobody was phoning it in during the production of this game. The problem is, every design decision in the game from the combat system, exploration and level design were shaped around the story. They’re all there to support it. Unfortunately it’s no exaggeration to call the story a complete mess.It takes about 20 hours before you can answer the simple question: “What is this game about?”. It’s not like nothing happens before that point, but it has a laser focus on the characters, without explaining anything about the world it takes place in or what’s going on. This section of the game was the best, even though it was confusing. It did at least contain drama. It had glimmers of brilliance here, like a character driven to suicidal despair in a way which felt believable. In scene after scene it tried to be touching, and felt earnest. I liked that.In the second half of the game this all fades away. Focus is shifted from the character to the “plot”. Things start to happen, it’s going somewhere. But all the characters freeze in development. Everyone in the cast had multiple layers of issues in the first half. They were all maintaining a facade, with deep regrets over how their lives had turned out. Things which in a good story would be dealt with in a satisfactory way before the end. Instead they’re all dropped. Other things take center stage, and the story starts to feel hollow. I remember the writers of Stargate SG-1 referred to certain episodes as “plot driven” or “character driven”. The plot driven episodes were always boring pieces of crap. This is how the second half of Final Fantasy XIII feels. Things happen on screen, but it's so vapid I start to question what I'm doing with my life. Not the kind of experience I'm looking for in a game.The shoe really drops at what was clearly intended to be the emotional low point at the end of the second act. The place you visit, the meaning it should have for the characters just doesn’t exist in the script. The environment, the enemies, and the music do their best to create a feeling of loss. The writing here is simply a disaster. It doesn’t acknowledge the scene before you. Characters are as cheerful as ever, when they should be screaming at the sky. It should have been the scene the game had been building up to the entire game. The payoff for everything that had gone before. Instead there’s nothing. Just the vague intent of what they were aiming for based on the work everyone else on the team put in for the environment.Playing it I got the impression everyone involved believed they were making the best Final Fantasy ever. The designs, the music, the level of technical expertize are on the highest possible level. It’s a game where it feels like the negative response came as a genuine surprise to the developers. On paper, every element they’ve included in the game are the ingredients of a classic. Did they realize the wreck they were making?The game deserved better than this. It’s possible they noticed the problems midway through production. But when you notice too late, there’s nothing you can do. You have to do it right from the start. Changing course is incredibly expensive, both in time and money. Whoever was responsible for saying that the script was “good enough” did it too soon. A single critical component ruined the entire game. I pray they don’t make the same mistake with Final Fantasy XV.			"

												Optimization:-------------Very average:+ On pc (amd fx8350 4.0GHz, Asus GeForce GTX 660 DirectCU II OC 2GB, 32gb RAM, SSD) quite stable, rarerly feels any    lags, about stable 50-60fps all the time- On laptop msi GL62 6QD (i7-6700HQ 2.6-3.5GHz, GTX950 2GB, 8GB DDR4 RAM, HDD) mostly 50-60fps but sometimes   drop  to 30-40fps, battles 30fps+ but it is not really a problemBattle system:--------------+ Interesting combat system+ Battle Roles systems - each character have its own role in party (main and later sub)+ Paradigms Shifts systems to easy chnage role in battle+ Stagger system to deal massive damage to hard enemies- Very weird using summons- Battle reward depending on finished time (its hard to have 5 star at boss, or elite mobs / group of mobs)- Time to kill mobs/boss dependend on equipment (better items lower time - almost all game struggle to get 5 stars)- Very hard and time consuming preemptive strike which is almost always needed for 5 star- Very unbalanced battles difficulty (all kind of battles, mob/boss/eidolon)- Battles with hard enemies very dependend on buffs/debuffs withch are quite short duration (it can start to get boring)- In my opinion way to much grinding for very low benefits- Only 3 character stats (HP, STR, MAG) and nothing moreStory:------+ Quite interesting story although it's sometimes very messy- For most of game constantly changing characters- Terribly linear story, almost no subquestsMusic & Graphics:-----------------+ Like almost always in FF music is great+ Very good graphic in game+ Stunning Cutscenes- Sometimes too low FOV and camera loosingOther features:---------------- Except one map almost claustrophobic areas- Almost deadly linear game- Almost all game is rushing and than in one/two chapters staying and farming CP and money/materials for equipment      which is in my opinion terribly stupid- All/almost all sidequests only available in one chapterConclusion:-----------In my opinion very average Final Fantasy, mostly because of linear story, small areas, no real sidequests, clock ticking in battles, all time buffing/debuffing. I highly advice to use some trainer or other program if you want have fun and pleasure (like using trainer option to always Stealth which very helps in geting 5 stars). I won't say I regret spending money on this game, but I surerly expected something more from Final Fantasy.			"

												Currently; Not recommended. Terrible port emulation. Forced 720p on non-generic 1080p+ monitors. Uses old low quality xBox 360 sound files, not those from the updated higher quality PS3 version of the game. No graphics controlability. All in all, a lazy port with no thought other than getting money quick from a game that was only recently quite popular, passed the era of such plausability for lazy coding and game design.			"

												For the game itself you can check any review out there: you'll read about good graphics, decent soundtrack, love-or-hate battle system, confusing story, some bad characters and so on.This PC version is just a straight up port with no room for customization at all. No graphics settings available (none at all), locked resolution (it's 720p and it won't go up), no sound settings, just a poor controller setup menu.It does run at 60fps at field navigation and battles, but cutscenes (including those with the in game engine) are locked at 30fps.I'm very dissapointed, the game takes 40-something GB on my HDD and the CGI cutscenes aren't crystal clear as the ps3 version, wich could output them at 1080p while running the game itself at 720p upscaled with a nice and crisp 1080p-native user interface (text, menus, HUD).EDIT:Dec. 2014*Forgot to mention: Dual audio (ENG/JAP) The game got updated, and now you have the following additional options:Resolution: windowed 720p & 1080p - fullscreen 'anything'Shadow resolution: 512x512, 1024x1024, 2048x2048, 4096x4096, 8192x8192MSAA: x2 up to 16xUnresolved issues: Every in game cutscene is *recorded* (720p@30fps) unlike the console versions, and add hugely to the size to this game. CGI cutscenes have the same quality as the latter, wich is dissapointing coming from the 1080p lossless quality of CGI scenes found on the ps3 version. The game is poorly optimized, and for those who wish and can afford to have a steady 60fps experience need to force triple buffering and vsync on their graphic cards settings.			"

Pros-Nice decent graphics-Simple battle system-Characters' design seems pretty nice-Nice and beautiful soundtracks-Nice actors and actresses voiceThe one thing that I real like about FF13 is the movie film. I can see that game designers put effort on it. Cons-Some chapters are boring-If you try FF13 as your first FF then you'll get confuse at first but be patience and you'll get it if you continue to play.-It might have freezing issue which depends on your pc settings.-Although it has nice decent graphics but the edges are little bit blurry.

												Something in me urged to write this review,  A blinding light. Hailed as the worst thing that humanity has ever made ever, Final Fantasy XIII really is just a long tutorial, one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ metal gear solid 3 stairs long (even longer). It's true, the first 20-30 hours of the game you can just sit back and press the 'a' or 'x' button and win every battle, It plays itself.  But there's something left to be desired from this game, a meat hidden before a pack of nails. Now you might think that you don't care about the gameplay, you're just here for the story. That's great and all except for ♥♥♥♥ing Hope. It's probably the reason why I can't remember any of the story now, because I was so focused on him, The story involves something being crystal and saving someone. I honestly don't know what kept me going, maybe it's the long hallway intriguing world and loveable character Sazh. Once you reach Gran Pulse, the game transforms. Somehow, I dare say, it became fun. The combat now has more depth and the freedom you get is fresh and exciting. The sidequest and the monsters, especially riding chocobos felt great. Everything became fun, you can also switch characters and not choose Hope. Or choose him, his character developed later on and he's kinda useful.To truly understand Final Fantasy XIII we need to question every game design that had been made. The long, giant hallways is really just a satire and metaphor for every game that exist. If you really, really think about it, Mario is just a long 2d hallway. The only difference between them is that FF13 lets you move in every direction. GTA V, praised for its open world, is also a long giant hallway, the difference is the size of the hallway is massive in that game, so you don't feel like you're in a hallway. It's all just an illusion. Why do we have to play games if it's all just a massive hallway? This game critisize on the very idea of playing games itself, it showed a bold and blatant real hallway, not a metaphorical one.  We all live in a giant hallway.  "

												Just finished the game, here are my thoughts:Story 4/10I would have expected way more than this.  Especially by a game which bears the names Final and Fantasy in it. Often the actions of the characters seem unclear. The history of Cocoon and Pulse, the fal'Cie and l'Cie lack explaining. There is some kind of logbook (the Datalog) which goes more into detail and I would have wished these stories were told by the characters and not by some dull loading screen und page of textCharacters (5/10)There are 6 main characters, with close to opposite personalities. Their behavior doesn't change much and after a while their actions and speeches get quiet predictable. Lightning: Grumpycat the personSnow: Mr. Big TalksVanile: imagine the most annoyingly happy anime character you can think of. Hope: Mr ""I-blame-you-for-being-responsible-for-the-death-of-my-mom...well-lets-be-BFFs""Fang: kind of cool character, but lacks emotionsSahz: My favorite (although I didn't like his chocobo). The most interesting character development of the 6Combat System 3/10-it sucks-You only control one of three characters in fight. The other two are controlled by bots. You can put them in certain roles (healer, dps, support, tank) and they act accordingly-you've got an action skills bar (called ATB gauge), which fills up over time. Abilities cost a certain amounts of energy, allowing you to cast up to 5 spells in a row-instead of choosing spells wisely or controlling other characters you just spam the most efficient spell of one of you characters up to 5 times-(DE-)BUFFING IS OVERPOWERED!  That needs some explaining I think.There are three type of damage increasing mechanics in FF XIII. First and second are Buffs and Debuffs. They're applied by your characters onto each other and the enemies. The Buffs are all single target, meaning you will cast each spell 3 times. There are four dmg-increasing buffs (haste +magic +str +elemental dmg) and three dmg-increasing debuffs (-magic/phys resist -elemental resist). There are also four buffs and three debuffs which reduce incoming dmg.to win fights later in the game often need all/most of the buffs. So your usual playstyle is (de-)buffing with two characters while the third one is keeping your party alive, then switch all three to dps.The third way of increasing your dmg is staggering. To put it simple, the more often you hit an enemy, the more dmg it will take. After reaching a certain amount of dmg they become staggered, increasing their dmg taken again. How is this overpowered? Staggering can stack up to 1000% each (de-)buff increases you dmg by roundabout 50% per buff. They increase each other multiplicative. So there's 1 * 1000% * 150%^4 =~ 5000%. This means you will deal 50 times more dmg. My attacks were capped at 99999, regular trash mobs have around 500k - 1M hp and I attack 5x in a row. At this point everything except bosses just evaporates before you, once you reach that point in the fight. But to get that far, you have to go the long way of casting dozens of buffs. Without buffs you've got a mob of 500k HP and your attacks deal about 3-5k dmg each...have fun.-the AI is just plain stupid. Lots of enemy attacks are area based, hitting your entire team when they're close together. And since you can’t control other characters and not even move your main char, especially your squishy casters tend to cuddle during fights and get brutally beaten to death...except when they don't and move /get knocked away from each other. There's no way of controlling their behavior. Have fun remaining calm, after you lost three fights in a row because your team is too stupid to move away from each other.-you lose the fight the moment you main character passes out. You cannot phoenix down him/her. You can only resurrect other members of your party...Leveling System 5/10Remember the great FF X leveling board and enjoyed building your tanking Yuna? Well FF XIII system is kind of like that, but worse. You still have points to spend. But instead of spending them on a FF X -like board, you can spend each character's points on one of the characters role-paths. Each character has three roles (out of six) available to him/her and you get so many skillpoints, that you can master all three. There is no chance of varying anything. Snow will never be a healer and Hope's just to weak to become the tank...Open World 2/10There is none. Enjoy your hallway simulatorGraphics 8/10Neat looking graphics, nice cutsceensTL;DRIt's not worth the time. You should just play FF 7-10 another time.			"

												FINAL FANTASY XIII is a turn-based RPG that tells the story of 6 individuals, who are branded enemies of Cocoon, being hunted and chased down by a corrupt government. They run away for the most part and eventually had enough and decided to challenge their fate.FF13 brings a whole new feel to the ATB system from previous games. You only play as one character out of a battle party of 3. This leader decides on the paradigm (or strategy) that everybody employs. Per exemple, I can set my leader to attack physically while team member #2 heals and tem member #3 debuffs the enemy. It's important to learn how to switch paradigms mid combat to adjust to the situation. You mostly sit back and react to any change while the Auto-Battle does it work. Having a strategy is important because of the new Staggering system. To put it simple, a magic user attacking the enemy fills its stagger bar while a physical attacker prevents the bar from depleting rapidly. Once that bar is full, the enemy becomes weak and for a set amount of time, you can deal a lot of damage.Other new mechanics is a Crystarium system that takes care of leveling up your stats. It's really similar to the FFX Sphere Grid. Unlike FFX, grinding is really limited in FFXIII and decisions like leveling up as a healer or as a physical attacker are not as important as they look. The game is really linear making sure that the next enemy (visible on the map, no random encounters) is always a little bit stronger. This is more to see if you understand the mechanics properly than if you are strong enough. Weapon upgrades are shallow and uninteresting. You spend money on components to upgrade your weapon for better attack power. It never seems to do that much of a difference and it's only relevant comes the aftergame. The ultimate weapons are simply a fully upgraded weapon.The point of FFXIII new and odd design is to put emphasis on its story and it's a good one. It's linear because you are being chased down (you're not going to explore and grind in these situations). The game features many skippable tutorials that are really helpful but sometime a little redundant. Ironically, it's emphasis on strategy is putting a line of enemy between cutscenes and mashing Auto-Battle until a harder enemy or a boss shows up. Eidolons (or summons) are a pain to battle against or with (and are never necessary). The story starts out as a confusing mess as it's throwing you unknown names and terms left and right but it quickly settles down to explain them little by little.The game only features one big sidequest near the end of the game and it's an amazing one. This is where you finally understand the point of an extensible Crystarium and weapons and accessories upgrades. It's basically a 64 bosses you got to beat and get a perfect rating on. This comes with some superbosses. This is to really test out the complex combat system that doesn't reach half its potential during the story.The cast is enjoyable with many characters having little to no experince in combat. They feel a lot more real than the other games. They all go through their personnal feelings of hope and despair. Each have a reason to fight. The game does a great job to somehow connect them all together. Production is amazing. Graphics are astonishing. Voice acting is great. Music fits well but isn't the best in the series. Cool battle themes though (regular, bosses, eidolons, etc.).+Story-oriented game (around 50 hours long).+Great cast.+Superb production (voice acting, graphics, music, art)+Fun customizable paradigm system.+Amazing and long end-game sidequest that makes you feel as you truly mastered the game (extra 20 to 40 hours of content).+Good price (for a story).~Confusing story at first, it's lore is a good but complicated one.~Story makes the game linear which is okay but might throw people off.~Too many accessories, most of them really situational and useless without good upgrading (Poison resist, Fire resist, etc)-Combat against regular enemies are really boring. (Auto-battle mashing).-Poor weapon upgrade system.-Eidolons are a pain to battle and to use.-Obvious treasure chests (every dead-end that branch off your linear path).You'll either love it or hate FINAL FANTASY XIII. Those looking for deep and fun combat are only really going to get satisfied at the end-game sidequest where everything opens up (after many, many hours of story...). Those looking for a good story will easily be able to bear the combat as long as they enjoy the story. I enjoyed my time with FFXIII and I do recommend it but at your own risk. Wait for a sale.			"

Before you read this do know that English is not my native language, also this is my opinion on this game so not everyone may agree with my way of thinking. As last also keep in mind I am writing this review with only a few hours into the game. thanks in advance;First of all I am new to the Final Fantasy series. This summer sale (2015) I bought FF3, 4 and 13. I played 3 for like 7 hours by the time I am writing this and started 13 today.(Without spoilers)----------Story----------The game introduces you with a cutscenes which are beautifully made by the way. My first reaction was ""It looks epic"". It tells about the usual good vs evil but with a twist. The story really submerges you into the FF world, the athmosphere, music, sound, everything helps with making you feel submerged. The game has 6 main characters which all have their own story. FF does a great job on combining them so they all have their own and their shared story.The cut scenes are a welcoming thing. I am actually excited when one appears. Normally I feel like skipping but with this game its like watching a movie.----------Combat----------The combat is just like (from what I know) the other FF games: Turn based.Only everything continues simultaneously, so in other words: If you dont tell your character which attacks to use the character will get attacked but wont attack unless you tell it too. You control one character per battle and the others in your party will auto-attack based on what attacking scheme you use.Fighting schemes decide which classes what characters use.For example you can have a scheme where you would have one Attacker, tank and a medic. If you would control the character who is the attacker the tank will try to take the hits and obviously the medic will try to heal.You can switch schemes at any time in a battle and I recommend you do so.The battle begins as you walk towards an enemy and they notice you, But you can also try to sneak up from behind to try and land a sneak attack. With a sneak attack the enemies stagger bar is already filled so when you hit an attack the enemy will be staggered and take extra damage.Now what is staggering? When you chain up attacks on a specific target their stagger bar will be filled and when it's full your next attack will stagger it so the enemy will take more damage and be stunned for the first hit.You fight with a max of 3 people from what I have seen till now.----------Customization----------Is pretty basic, A skill tree based on the classes so for example: Char 1 -> Choose which of the classes you want to upgrade the skills of.-> Upgrade skill -> Earn more xp with battles ^I am pretty happy with the skill system, its basic but it works good. Feel comfortable and not weird.You can customize what kind of weapons your characters have and what kind of boosters etc. By the time I am writing this it is not that important in the game yet.Pros: ->Looks good->Good story->Great atmosphere->Option between Japanese or English audio->Beautiful world->Great combat ->Keyboard feels comfy to use tooCons:->Not a lot of settings to choose from->Combat might feel repetitive for someBoth:->Lots of grindingTL:DR;I recommend this game, makes me feel part of the world, but lots of grinding. 8.5/10			"

It's still playable, but by no means enjoyable.Other than that it's highly linear in terms of progression and combat. You run from corridor to corridor in order to more or less auto-resolve your battles.

NO SETTINGS AT ALL. 720p resolution is the only resolution, no graphic settings, 30 fps lock in the cutscenes, and 60fps during gameplay and it's not even able to get that for a lot of people already. I might give the game a bit of slack if these issues are fixed soon, but I'm throughly disappointed. This is beyond the ♥♥♥♥ing pale. As lazy as it gets. I'm glad that I can play it sure, but I'm very disheartened that they care so little for PC gamers to just port the game directly from the console with no actual settings.

												It is really a pure ""port"", but is it a good port? No it isn't.Releasing for PC after 5 years, there are no graphics options and obviously lack of optimization can be seen throughout the game with studderings. The game is locked at 720p and it doesnt impact on me that heavily, but those who are using 1080P or above will be angered by this intolerable 720p lock.Luckily, there is a mod that could up scale the resolution, but the function should be built-in in game and shouldn't require a 3rd party software for this.As of today, 9th October 2014. FF XIII can be ignored by now until updates, or will there be updates to address the issues, until then, do not, I say again ""DO NOT"" purchase the game as it's current state, there are more polishing needed to be done for this port that was orignally a ""hope"" for PC gamers.

Posted: October 17, 2014
												Several years after its original release on the PS3, Steam users finally have another Final Fantasy title to add to their libraries!  Being a long time fan of RPGs, I was overjoyed yet somewhat cautious to buy this game, as reviews were generally mixed.  Upon completing the main story, I can say that while many of the issues raised by Final Fantasy fans (linearity, character development) are legitimate, for the most part Final Fantasy 13 is a decent RPG.  This is in large part due to the game's fairly interesting story, excellent character/monster design, innovative combat system, and of course beautiful CGI.       That is the TL:DR version of my review.  I would definitely recommend this title to anyone that enjoys RPGs, even if as a Final Fantasy game it is not one of Square Enix's best titles to date.       Now if you're a long time Final Fantasy fan or would like to read a more detailed analysis, read on for the pros and cons!PROS- The overall storyline is fairly well-written and creative, even if it falters at times due to a lack of interesting characters or confusing developments.  Right off the bat the game places you in a conflict between the high-tech, futuristic world of Cocoon and the lower, more primordial world of Pulse.  You are Lightning and you start your journey in Cocoon as a soldier turned rebel.  Eventually you make your way to Pulse, meeting new friends and enemies as you uncover your destiny.  This is primarily a battle of good vs. evil but also a story of friendship, love, and personal growth.- Character design, world design, and monster design, are a treat to look at.  The first thing that drew me to this game were the cool-looking characters and the awesome cut scenes.  If this sounds like you, you will not be disappointed.  Square Enix artists and design crew did a fantastic job on this game's aesthetics, especially with the cut scenes, which are cutting edge and a pleasure to watch.- The soundtrack for this game is good.  Compared to previous installments, I would say the soundtrack is much more subtle and subdued.  I am a big fan of Lightning's theme and the introduction theme, although they are not quite on par with some of the legendary sound tracks of the past, like ""To Zanarkand""  and ""Suteki Da Ne"" from Final Fantasy X or ""Melodies of Life"" from Final Fantasy IX.- The leveling system (called the Crystarium) is simple and customizeable.  If you remember the Sphere Grid in Final Fantasy X, this will seem very intuitive.  There are six roles available: Commando(offensive fighter), Ravager (offensive mage), Medic (healer), Synergist (buff expert), Saboteur (debuff expert), and Sentinel (tank).   Initially you can choose to invest your experience points (called Command Points in this game) in one of two roles per character but later you unlock the ability to teach ANY character ANY role.  This offers a lot of freedom for the player to evolve each character as he/she sees fit.   Generally speaking, however, as you progress you will learn that each character is naturally inclined toward one or two of the six roles.- Fluid and dynamic combat system with some strategic depth.  This game introduces the new Paradigm combat system, which is essentially a streamlined version of the Final Fantasy XII system.  Similar to the combat system in Final Fantasy XII, you only directly control one of the up to three members in your party while the AI controls the others.  The AI behaves according to what role each character currently has.  For example if the character Hope is assigned the Medic role, he will heal wounded characters and remove debuffs from those afflicted with status changes like Poison.  These roles can be switched IN REAL TIME during any battle by shifting Paradigms, which are set configurations of roles for your active party members.What all this complexity means is that the Paradigm system brings a key strategic element to every battle that makes boss fights and normal monster fights interesting and fun.  Each enemy and boss typically have specific weaknesses to certain elements or are susceptible to certain debuffs.   Furthermore, Final Fantasy XIII's monsters/bosses are often powerful and require strategy to defeat.  Therefore, in order to secure victory in battle the player must adapt and exploit enemies' weaknesses by using the appropriate Paradigm.  The player is rewarded for quick and efficient Paradigm useage by a high rating at the end of every battle, which translates into higher drop rates of rare items.  The net effect is that the Paradigm system creates a dynamic, rewarding, and most importantly fun combat experience that makes each encounter with a new enemy a unique and satisfying challenge. CONS- Character development and individual storylines are somewhat dull, regrettably.   In Final Fantasy VII Cloud's mysterious past and his conflict with the evil Sephiroth drove the story.  In Final Fantasy X the story of Tidus and his tie to the antagonist Sin or Yuna's pilgrimage and her noble spirit were quite compelling and memorable.   In this game, we have Lightning who is a no-nonsense soldier with very little tolerance for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Very little is told about her mysterious past.  The friends you meet are actually more interesting, albeit slightly.  Sazh and Hope, two of the characters who join you early on, do have unique and compelling personalities to be fair.  However, many of the other characters you meet lack depth or simply boring.  As a result, the individual character storylines of Final Fantasy XIII are largely forgettable.- Level/world design and storyline is extremely linear.  First of all this game completely does away with the overworld.  You do not have the ability to wander around and explore new and secret levels/dungeons.  You generally have one path to take, making the game feel like one long dungeon.   Limiting freedom and exploration generally hurts my gaming experience; in my opinion, more choices equals more fun.  Sadly, in Final Fantasy 13 there simply aren't many choices that actually affect the story.- Combat system AI can feel very restrictive.  Due to the fact that the game controls 2/3 of your party in every battle, the player never truly has full control over the party's behavior.  Also the AI handles certain roles rather poorly, especially any character with the Medic role (the AI will overheal other characters or prioritize spells poorly).- Lastly, there are some annoying port issues (such as stuttering, loss of frames, etc.) that Square Enix did not seem to catch before release.  Thankfully, a recent patch has fixed most of these issues and there are now adjustable graphics settings.Overall, as the successor to Final Fantasy XII, this game doesn't quite live up to its potential.  The beautiful graphics and innovative combat system have progressed nicely but the character development and sound tracks are painfully lacking.  As a result, I would say that this is one of my least memorable Final Fantasy games in the series despite it being a decent RPG in its own right.For seasoned veterans this game may be disappointing in some ways but there are definitely many bright spots like the exciting new combat system, impressive graphics, and overall interesting storyline.  For $16, I would recommend at least one playthrough for any fan of the RPG genre.FINAL RATING: 7.5/10, good but not great			"

												::10/22/2014 UPDATE::So approximately a week and a half after the game launches, Square Enix has quietly introduced a patch. What does it fix? We now get a confirmation that we want to close the game when we press escape in full screen.Excuse me if I'm too overwhelmed to edit anything else about my review just yet. (Less cynically: at least it's SOMETHING and the patch notes say they're working on other stuff. I'll be holding my breath until I pass out from lack of oxygen. Stay tuned, and, as always... Please look forward to it.)Original review:Locked 720p resolutionESC key is a shortcut for Alt+F4 in full screen modeLiterally no graphics configuration options (whoops, I mean, you can choose full screen or windowed)Best 60 GB I ever spent 10/10 would fellate Squeenix again::10/10/2014 EDIT::60 GB is stupid. The ""reason"" this game is 60 GB supposedly is because fans clamored for Japanese languages. To maintain everyone's super deep lip sync immersion, this means that the Japenese language pack doesn't just consist of extra audio files, but slightly tweaked versions of every pre-rendered cutscene. So the game installs two versions of every cutscene on your computer. And no, the Japanese pack is not optional. Why not do as Dynasty Warriors 8 did and make the Japanese language pack free optional DLC? I'm not the only one who isn't going to play with Japanese voices (though I know many are). Perhaps they could even offer two separate downloads, a 30GB English install and a 30GB Japanese install. (I don't see the need for having both installed at the same time, since I figure most people would play through the game using one or the other language.)Locked 720p is stupid. Note that this isn't CAPPED 720p, it's LOCKED 720p. There are literally no resoultion options. The game touts 60 FPS but many people experience stuttering and inconsistent framerames (myself included). Some people have suggested certain workarounds revolving configuring video drivers, with mixed results. Some say it works, some report it doesn't. (I'm in the ""it doesn't do anything"" boat.) And before the mindless white knighting fanboys tell me to upgrade my toaster hurr durr (in the same breath they tell me to stop being an entitled PC master race elitst for wanting resolution changes), my specs are:Time of this report: 10/10/2014, 01:58:56Operating System: Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit (6.3, Build 9600) (9600.winblue_gdr.140723-2018)Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4930K CPU @ 3.40GHz (12 CPUs), ~3.4GHzMemory: 32768MB RAMDirectX Version: DirectX 11GPU: 2x NVidia GeForce GTX 780 3GB VRAM in SLIThe inconsistent performance is happening for people across the board regardless of their specs.Once you get past all of that, the game runs and you can play it. So that's a thing. It hasn't crashed on me. But it should be mentioned there are several reports of people who can't launch the game, can't get full screen working, have the game crashing after loading the launcher, and other similar problems.BUT HEY AT LEAST IT'S ONLY $16 LOL WHAT DID YOU EXPECT??????I dunno, maybe a port like The Last Remnant which has all the standard configuration options, and even went above and beyond the call of duty by adding extra content and features that make the PC version even better than the console versions for $6 less than what the same company is asking for Final Fantasy XIII?Lastly, yes, there is a pre-alpha community developed mod headed by Durante (of the DSFix and DPFix fame) that lets you tool around with resolutions but also reportedly breaks menus and has other graphical glitches and such (hence: pre-alpha). Also it has no impact on performance (FPS dips, etc) problems. Forgive me for being old fashioned but I kind of think it falls to the devs to offer these kinds of basic functionalities, not modders.			"

												You should buy this game if you think you would enjoy a game where you do this:* Run in a straight line.* Watch a cutscene.* Run in a straight line some more.* Fight a painfully easy battle with no real strategy.* Run in a straight line some more.* Watch a cutscene.* Fight a battle where you push one button the whole time.* Continue running in a straight line.* Watch another cutscene.* Etc.This was the whole gameplay after 7+ hours until I finally gave up and started watching reviews to see if it would change.  And no, it doesn't change.  Read some reviews online if you don't believe me.  This is literally nothing more than an interactive movie where you run down a pre-programmed hallway, fight battles by pushing a single button over and over again and watch things unfold without your input and without any choices from you.Do not waste your money.

												Horrible port...The only reason it is even playable is because of durante...Square should be doing this themselves. 1080p is a given, framerate drops are not okay, especially on a computer such as mine that can run games such as Thief or Metro Last Light on max settings 60 fps. Almost throughout im stuck at 30fps or lower with a lot of stuttering. This is a huge downer Square...This should NOT be happening from the likes of you. I TRUSTED YOU.			"

												I would love to tell you I enjoyed my time with the game. I would, if it were actually playable for me. This is the first game that gave me a migraine from the constant stuttering going on. Keep in mind the hardware requirements for this game are laughably low, and even on my aging machine I exceed them. However the gameplay is a consistent stuttering mess and sucks all joy from the experience.The day before release, I had a great feeling of joy that this would be a decent port. After all, Square (or someone) sprang the announcement of Japanese audio on us. Unfortunately that's about the only thing they did right for this game. You have no graphical options beyond windowed and fullscreen mode. No way to change the resoultion, which is locked at 720P. No way to actually exit the game (but escape instantly shuts the game down). But you get that Japanese audio track, right?As it stands, I'm not even disappointed with Square. This is only reinforcing the idea that they have no idea how to treat PC gamers, just like most Japanese developers. Very few deliver quality ports, and Square isn't one of the few. Unless there is some major patching of this game in the coming weeks, I'll not be buying the rest of the series.I guess you do get what you pay for.			"

												I am a fan of this game. But this port?!?!?!? OMG, I cannot recommend it at present. There is no customizability for the controls that are apparently hardcoded as defaults. This includes the extremely disappointing decision to cause the 'ESC' key to quit the game (in full screen mode without warning, in windowed mode with a confirmation dialog).  What program in this new century doesn't allow for players to pick which keys on their keyboard do things? FFXIII apparently.  Until the graphics resolution and keyboard control features are fixed, the game is pretty much unplayable for me, as I tend to hit the 'ESC' key often to skip movies, or enter a game menu (IN LIKE EVERY OTHER GAME ON THE PLANET!!!!!!).The game itself is fine, and the graphics issues for me aren't as serious as others have made them out to be, but the lack of customizability is a deal breaker for me. And so, at present I must not recommend the game. This review will change if a patch to this serious problem resolves the issue.			"

												The primary issue with FF13 is that it is a horrible port.PC gamers have some basic expectations when it comes to their games.  Being able to tweak graphic settings and change the resolution are one of them.  To release a game in 2014 with no graphic settings of any kind and a fixed resolution of 720p is inexcuseable.  I'm not sure who is more at fault, Square Enix for half-a**ing the port or Steam for not informing buyers of this fact.Having never played the console version and only spending an hour in this port, it is difficult to give a fair review of the game itself.  I will be trying it again when (or if) a graphic/resolution fix is released.  At present, avoid this game til the issues are fixed (whether by modders or Square Enix).			"

												First of all:I'm playing this series since the snes era, and I'm a big fan of it. However as you may guess, I got too old to hype a game just because it's called Final Fantasy and Square is behind it. That means, what you will read might be pretty accurate. Well it will be up to you to decide that of course.Final Fantasy - Only in name?Definetly not. How can I say that? Well.. Back then when Final Fantasy V and VI came out on SNES .. do you remember that? You could make decisiont which affected the gameplay and the story a bit. That was awesome. Deep character designs, well developed world and etc. After that Final Fantasy VII came out. You could still make choices but they made LESS impact on the story. However there were mostly improvements like the materia system, side stories and so on. That was obviosly a step ahead technicaly too. The story was better or worse than the previous ones, depending on your taste. Personally (as most of the players) I liked that pretty much. Than Final Fantasy VIII and IX came, and they weren't improved much likely rethinked compared to Final Fantasy VII. They were VERY good games and honestly..why should they change anything if it worked? They couldn't improve the side quests, secrets, mini games more, because of the hardware, so they just revamped the things and it worked.Now time jump, and everything begins here... Final Fantasy X. Definetly a good Final Fantasy, however already lacking the depth in side quests. (Blitzball was awesome thou.) The story telling went into the ""movie style"", mostly because the character had voice acting. That was ok and we all knew that they have to keep up with trend and technic. Final Fantasy XII... I think that was a ""we don't know which way to go"" game, since it was pretty much like the MMO version but in offline mode, with better story. Not bad, not good..and not because you couldn't enjoy it but it was a totally revamped thing. The atmosphere was ok.Final Fantasy XIII Is what we got here. They went back to Final Fantasy X because I think they felt that this is better than the FFXII mmo style, and ""improved"" that. This is a success. More movie like, faster, more action based but...lacks the things what was still in Final Fantasy X. While there was still some ""game"" elements, like story development while you play, the feeling that you are respoinsible at least a bit for the things and so on, Final Fantasy XIII is more like a movie. You wont feel that you are making the choices, you won't feel that you are responsible for anything, you won't feel that your characters developed cause of you (more precisly, you wont get this illusion like in the older games), and you wont be sad when you finish the game cause your journey ends.That's because we are in 2014 (or 2010 when the game was released) and the trend is the movie style gameplay. It's not as bad as you think, it's definetly a Final Fantasy, just not a game but a movie with many interractions. Shall I play this if I want to play a J-RPG?Definetly, comapred to the J-RPGs on pc, this one is one of the best. Even if it's not good compared to the old Final Fantasy titles, It is pretty good compared to other J-RPGs nowadays. However if Tales Of Vesperia and others will come to PC once, I think I will have to take this back... :PHm..ok, but should I buy this for 13€?If you like J-RPG and Final Fantasy, I think this is pretty much a good price. The port is cheap and lacks many things, but let's be honest: Who the hell plays games like this without controller? Pros:-Nice design. -Final Fantasy feeling-Actually pretty good combat system-FangCons:-Bad characters. Not just because you can't feel anything special about them, but most of them actually ANNOYING!-Too movie like, too linear-No mini games. WUT?! -Without controller it's masochism-Poor port.-Hope (Haha, you will definetly know why if you play the game. Tbh I would write Vanille and Snow here too)Why thumbs up then?Even with this many flaw, even with the annoying characters I still played for hours and couldn't stop. That means: as a game I can recommend that.I hope this will be help some of you. :)Cheers!			"

												Final Fantasy XIII reminds me of the South Park episode where we meet the Marklar aliens.  Replace every noun in FFXIII with Marklar and you would not be any more lost as to what is going on or why.  There is an entire encyclopedia that opens up as you play the game, but it only opens up when it feels like it.  I would figure having all the information ahead of time and studying said encyclopedia would allow the player a better understanding about the story from the start.  Then again, if I wanted to read a story about another world and people saving the day, I'd read a book, not play a game.I made it 16 hours in and I'm still on rails, following character stories that I am barely starting to understand about characters that I really don't care about.  You jump from one group to the next with no real reason and lacking context of their world or situation.  I found it very difficult to connect to them in any way.  At least beyond the ideas of, Snow is an idiot, Hope is a cry-baby, Lightning is a robot, Vanille makes the most annoying sounds, and Sazh is what you would expect of people trying to be PC about a character.  My favorite character so far, is the chocobo chick that lives in Sazh's hair.  That little guy is more expressive than any of the other characters, and that's just out of his 20 minutes of screen time.While times change, so do games and everything else.  Final Fatnasy XIII is less fantasy and more sci-fi.  Albeit 1970's, B-rated, acid trip sci-fi.  Horrible storytelling, un-relatable characters, constant tutorials, game mechanics that play the game for you, an unnecessarily convoluted leveling system(one that puts the sphere grid of FF-X to shame), and a world so lost in itself it requires a dictionary and encyclopedia to understand.  If you're new to the FF series, you might like it, especially if you are into sci-fi.  If you are one of the ""old school"" FF players, that loved anything 7 or under, you should skip it, the series is dead.  Oh, and motorcycle twins Shiva summons.  Yes, Shiva are twin sisters with wheels for hair that wrap their legs around each other and become a motorcycle for a character to ride around on.Final Score:Marklar/10			"

												It's so hard to say what I think of this game, I wish I'd played it when I was younger, so the nostalgia at least would have pulled me through. I picked it up because a friend of mine played it when they were younger, and it happened to be on sale. I look at this and know it's a game I would have loved when I was 14.The gameplay is boring as hell, so don't even think about buying it on that front. The story would 100% appeal to an angsty teenager, but pretty much no one else. I really wanted to like the characters, especially the main protagonist, a woman named Lightning, but it's pretty hard. The story is pointlessly complex and yet the characters are far too simple. Things keep happening and there's constantly a million new names of places and factions and things thrown at you and yet, you never see another facet to any of the characters. It's trying to be deep but it's just.... angsty.I finished the game, not because I was enjoying it, but if I'd already invested so much time into it, I was damn well going to see it to the end. I bought this game and its two direct sequels (XIII-2 and Lightning Returns) for about £11, even that is too much. I would advise you not put yourself in the situation of needing to drag yourself to the end of this drawn out mess of a game.			"

												TL;DR DO NOT BUY Final Fantasy XIII on steam. It is the worst port to PC I have ever seen in my life, and I dearly hope to never see one such as this again.So Final Fantasy XIII was released on PC today, and ooooh boy this does not bode well for future Square Enix releases on PC if this is the way they're gonna do it.In the almost 7 hours that have passed since I started the download of the game, till I started writing this, I have maybe been able to play for 15 minutes. The very first BIG problem that we get is that the game is a staggering 49,4 GB download (hue hue big). Oh and while we're at it, the game itself does not just take up 49,4 GB of your harddrive, no actually it takes up 58 GB, yep 58 (that's a LOT). ""Well Watch Dogs was also a 50 GB download and that turned out fine right?"" Yes and no, but that is unimportantAnd so we can be led into the next problem, because what are those 58 GB? Surely that must mean 4k textures and super HD shaders and so on right? Not at all. When you launch it you get a fancy launcher where you can toggle Windowed Mode and the spoken language in the game. There is no video options. What. So. Ever. In this game. It is locked at 720p and there ain't♥♥♥♥♥♥you can do about it. In 20♥♥♥♥ing14 we have to look to modders for our games to be proper 1080p REALLY?!""But if it's not HD textures and all that then what are those 58 GB?"" Well funny you should ask. 39,7 GB of those are naught but prerendered cinematics. Yep, if you go into the FFXIII folder in your steamapps, you'll find a small folder called ""Movie"" and there lies most of your now taken harddrive space. So we are left with a 20 GB 720p game. But enough about that.You enter the game and what are the first thing you realize? No proper mouse control. Okay that has been seen many times. You move the curser by scrolling the mouse wheel, or you use the keyboard, not the worst thing to happen but well take it as it comes. You enter the options menu to check if there is a resolution option somewhere, which of course there isn't, and then proceed to check your controls. There are pseudo rebindable keys, however you are only able to change 6 inputs. Nothing about how you move, look or interact with the world can you touch. Disappointed you proceed to press escape, because you are used to PC gaming, where that is the go-to button for getting back to the previous menu. What happened? Did the game just crash? Nope, it simply closed. For some inexplicable reaason, the escape key COMPLETELY closes the game, and it is only if you play in windowed mode, that you get a prompt that say ""Are you sure you wish to exit the game?"" Oh you're certainly asking for it that's for sure.I highly recommend that you use a controller for this game, because this is an even more barebones port from the consoles than FFVII and VIII. At least those games had proper key remapping, as well as the ability to play in 1080p. This port was made by people who had no idea what the hell they were doing. It is an insult to not only the PC, but especially to the game itself. FFXIII might not be the most loved game in the FF series, but you cannot deny how well it did on the PS3 and 360. One would think that Squeenix's move towards PC ports of their older games, might be proof of what they said a while back about maybe moving towards PC gaming with their main series, however if they do not get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together, I can guarantee that they will see no sales on PC in the future. I am already forseeing far fewer sales of FFXIII-2 and Lightning Returns, not just because they have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t stories, but also because the port of XIII is SO bad, that it is probably not worth it. We can only hope that if Squeenix decide to bring FFXV to PC, they do it properly. Maybe they should talk to some of their western collegues about how to do a PC port. I would recommend Ubisoft, Blizzard or BioWare for starters. I think we can already see the solid 0 out of 10 scores streaming onto MetaCritic. And I would almost say that theyare in their every right to be that.This game has NO right to fill 58 GB. Essentially you are simply running a PS3 emulator on your PC, and even then I'd say that emulating the original PS3 disc would probably be better, because then you could most likely get proper 1080p fullscreen. We can only hope that they will patch this game, or that the modders work fast, because right now, I can only say ""Do not buy""			"

												Chances are that you've probably played this game before, either on the 360 or PS3.. Since that is more than likely the case, I'm not going to use this review in an attempt to sway your opinion on the game, as most of you have already came to the conclusion of how you feel about the games on-rails progression, questionable plot, and moslty hands-off battle system (and this is coming from someone who actually enjoys the game!)I'll just simply say that the PC release is a very shoddy port on Square's part... Luckily, the PC Master race has rallied together and God Durante has delivered to us the goods. Look into his app named 'GeDoSaTo', give it a whirl, and have fun! The game will still, more than likely, give you plenty of technical issues, but atleast most of the major concerns are fixed.I'm still going to give the base game a negative review, mainly because I would like to send a message to Square about how they should handle the PC ports of the next two XIII games.. I mean, c'mon Square! The Final Fantasy franchise really deserves better than this!			"

												It has one of the most confusing and lacking explanation stories. I literally was as lost as get it gets in the beginning. Also It's a very linear game, there's almost no exploration and it's a rookie mistake taking exploration from any RPG. Everyone that likes RPGs know that exploration is one of the most glorious thing in RPGs; Simply put, It's one of the two most important backbone features in an RPG, the other one is turned-based combat.However, I liked the gameplay (the combats, though... the gameplay outside of combat is underwhelming). There are many features that I haven't seen before in RPGs. Well, I'm not really used to RPGs that aren't turn based, so...In addition, the game doesn't let you customize the graphics or resolution. If you want to play at 1080p, you'll need a mod. The developers did a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥job.In a nut shell, It's a fun game. It's not the best Final Fantasy or anything, but still fun. Don't expect much from it.			"

												There's a considerable amount of reviews criticising the plot line and the characters of Final Finatasy XIII but as far as I can tell it's really unjustified.  I'm a fan of more serious games and haven't been able to play certain games like Final Fantasy X-2 because of just how cringe-worthy everything was.  FFXIII is a solid game with a great cast of voice actors, characters, and phenomenal gameplay with a really interesting plot that's reminiscent of FFX.Having said that, locking the graphics at 720p was plain stupid and I can only hope with the next Final Fantasy on Steam they will realize exactly what the consumer base of PC gaming actually wants in a game.  One of the biggest highlights of PC gaming are modifcations and maximizing the graphics potential and I can't fathom why Square Enix would intentionally straddle us with settings that are so outdated.

												Edit: there is a plugin that can change resolutions and the guy is also working on other optimization options---->    http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=618#comments Thanks SQUARE ENIX  I played this title on the playstation 3 but never finished it and now I get to play the game exactly how It was in 2009 same resolution, and none of those pesky optimization options that are all the rage these days. This game has essentially turned my gaming PC into a last generation console.			"

												A poorly recieved final fantasy entry amongst most fans, and whilst the game does have plenty of flaws, gran pulse was a truly enjoyable experience. It makes the rest of the game worthwhile. Had the whole game been designed like that, we would have had a great game as a whole. Battle system isn't to my liking compared to other installments, relying on terrible ai to spread out and not die to aoe never goes well, but not a dealbreaker. Characters are all pretty good to me besides hope, another thing I disagree with compared to most it seems. And japanese VA option dramatically improves it. Not exceptional, but not as bad as people make out either, worth a playthrough - just be prepared to endure a lack of freedom until gran pulse.			"

												This is the worst Final Fantasy game I could have ever imagined!No open world game design whatsoever, and a handholding battle system that is pathetic to say the least.Linear progression, follow the path fight the baddies, don't die of boredom along the way, the storyline could have actually been important but after so much boring strait line level deign, I couldn't really keep my attention to it as much as I would have like.If you haven't played any of the old Final Fantasy titles than maybe, but I seriously doubt it, you might defend this steaming pile of crap. The battle system is for morons who can't keep track of multiple characters abilities and create your own synergistic strategies. I'm so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that I couldn't at least play the battles in a way that is actually fun, mostly just coasted through. which is so damn boring! All the great Final Fantasy titles had a hard to master battle system.I give this game a (Negative 1 Star) I think it actually destroyed a star from another title!			"

												If I could get the game to run that would be awesome. Shame that I can't because apparently this wasn't tested on nVidia machinesI can't get past the tutorial because I keep pressing ESC to open the menu, and ESC instantly closes the game no matter where you are, and can not be changed from the options.Since there have been 0 patches since launch I'm expecting none of these issues to be fixed.EDIT: It looks like a ninja update happened? It now asks for confirmation when trying to quit using ESC or Alt+F4, and runs on my nVidia laptop now. I still don't recommend this bad port of an average game.			"

												If you are looking for the old FF feel, as in VII and VIII, well too bad it's not here. I am glad that FF took a bit of a leap to do something new, but people hate change. If you are one of those players don't play/buy this game.Yes the game has issues but so does every game EVER.The game is very linear, gives you one straight line with no exploration to talk about until you get to a certain point, thats about 10hours into the game. The Graphics is really beautiful, but some people have issues with fps drops and stuttering on the game.I really am enjoying the Battle System, the way you have to shift your paradigms to fit to your strategy, this also tries to make the game harder in a sense as you have to select ""medic"" to get someone to use a healing spell. The most fights is really boring at times as you have 10sec of a fight and then 5meters later another 10sec of the same type of fight but for the boss fights you really have to know when to swap your paradigm and this makes it interesting.The storyline is confusing at first but they kinda try and explain it to you, with flashbacks. Some characters are really irritating and some you really learn to like. (But thats how the real life is, you don't always like everyone)The upgrading of your gear could have been done differently, it's a bit boring and you don't always know what to do. The same with the leveling up of your crystarium, also they only get you to upgrade to a point every time, but this stops you from becoming overpowering.As a last note:This game is fun to play, really spoon feeds you most of the game, and the fights become bland and tedious as they are short and almost always the same. The game does not have any real exploration features and might make this a boring game for some as you only have one option, moving the way the corridor is leading you to. SE really tried to do something different they didn't make a flop neither was it a masterpiece but this is still a game worth playing if you can get past the 10hour tutorial.			"

												In it's current state, it is a poor port. I have a GTX 970 and this 4 year old game stutters and drops well below 60 fps constantly. The game also doesn't have any graphics options.The game itself is fine. Having completed it on the Xbox, it is a good game with some huge flaws. The game has great combat, some good characters and an interesting world. No other JRPG combat comes close to how fun this combat is. It uses  an active time battle system where actions can only be perfomed when a meter is filled. The main goal isn't to select the right attack (by looking at things like weaknesses), the game does that automatically. Your goal is to look at the current situation in the battle and set the state of your party to work with that situation. For example, if one of your part members is low, you need to switch to a state which allows a party member to heal. Switching between these states is fast and the most important part of the battle. This is why the game is set to autobattle by default and is what you should stick with. The problem with the game is the linearity. You are constanly walking down a path fighting enemies. There are no branches or side activities. There is no option to go back to older areas which would be a problem if there was anything else to do.The game also insults the players intelligence by having the game introduce gameplay concepts incredibly slowly. Where the game could spend 15-20 minutes explaining and allowing the player to try something, it spends 1-2 hours doing so. This leads to the game not unlocking the full potential of the great combat system for several hours (around 15 if I recall). This slow tutorial combined with the lack of side activities means that after the novelty of the new mechanic or idea is gone, you still have to slog through a good hour of gameplay before you get to anything interestingThe characters are good but are let down by some poor voice acting. It's not just the voice but some of the delivery and animations make some scenes in the game incredible cheesy. The slow pacing of the game also hurts characters because the time between story sections is so long that characters don't seem to grow or change until much later.Without the graphical issues, I would give this a 3/5. It's definitely worth trying and it's a game I love despite the flaws but it's not a good purchase until the problems are fixed.			"

												My first 10 minutes playing final fantasy XIIIStarted with barely being able to listen to what was happening in the game. This is the first game i had any problems in that regard.Then for some reason i started having these odd lag spikes when not even fighting.Then i pressed Y and the game crashed.Also i launched the game again and it started taking screenshots. I have over 4000 screenshots because the game decided to take them...I wish i could get my money back.FYI, i'm not a hater or anything, i been a fan of final fantasy games since final fantasy 7, but this was a huge disapointment. I lose all respect for companies that launch games just to win a quick buck.Added this after playing the game for about 20 hours:So i have been playing FFXIII for over 20 hours and i have come to the comclusion this game is pretty good!Firstly, how was i able to play it? I used a mod, link below.http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=618This guy pretty much saves the game. If only Square Enix bothered as much.Anyway back to the game.The story isn't as good  as other FF stories, but it's not bad. The characters are cool and you don't get that feeling of ""why do i have to play with this guy?"" anymore.The combat system is very good. Takes the classic combat system you  had in the previous games and makes it better and more user friendly.The Eidolons tho... i don't know how they did it, but they managed to make them both cool and awkward. One secod you're like ""what the hell is this?"" the next you're ""oh wow, this is so cool!""This is a good game and it's fun to play. What else can you ask for?Changed my review to recomended, thanks to a mod.			"

												I loved FF XIII on PS3, and was excited to hear that it was coming to PC. Buyers beware, this is not the same experience you get on consoles. Especially when compared to other poor ports, this one fails miserably. On a new, high-end computer, this game stutters. Players will need to tweak their GPU due to it underclocking in order to improve performance. The game's maximum resolution is 720p, rahter 1080p. There are numerous glitches and graphics errors that should have been readily apparent before release. This will be the first game I attempt to get a refund for from Steam, it's that bad.			"

												This is a disgusting halfassed port.Locked to 720p, even the pc versions of FFVII and VIII at least had resolution options.No graphic options to speak of apart from Fullscreen on or off.Horribly compressed cutscenes.Pressing the Esc key exits the game completely as if you had pressed alt+f4.Hardly reaches the advertised 60fps on a machine significantly beyond the reccomended specs.If they fix these things I will try again and change this review depending on the outcome, till then I'm finding it real hard to support one of my former favorite developers.Edit #1: I found out that if you go into nvidia manage 3d settings and set the gpu to prefer ""maximum performance"" it stops underclocking your gpu and runs it at a better framerate.

												Update: A patch came that basically integrates everything Durante did (including the bugs)... This is rather ridiculous...Converted my PC into a last gen XBOX360 console 0/10FYI - PS3 is completely 1080p (yes, even the movies), so it must be superior to my gaming machine...So, what's wrong with this release?- Locked at 720p (need to use external modding tools to get higher resolutions... seriously?)- Movies are in WORSE quality than the PS3 (which plays them in fully glorious 1080p)- Insanely large download size due to Japanese audio added (SquareEnix, there is such a thing called DLC, use it!)- Game may be fun, but I'm waiting for fixes so I'm not playing it... SquareEnix, I appreciate the effort, but if this is how you treat PC gamers then don't bother. If the PS3 can do 1080p and have superior movies a proper PC port should support 4K, not 720p (At the least make an optional - High Quality movie/game pack DLC).Get your act together, patch this game to be all it can be on a PC and I'll change my review to be gameplay based.Edit: As a comment mentions, the PS3 is upscaled to 1080p, for PC they didn't even bother with that...

												So is this yet another terrible PC port from Square Enix? Yes. Yes it is. If you have a controller and want to play it as if it were the console version (which, it being a Square Enix port of a Square Enix-made console game, I was expecting), it - well, it works. Alt-Tab even works without crashing the game! And there's even an option to start it windowed! So other than accidentally closing the game thanks to Escape quitting the game without confirmation, I haven't had any real issues.But seriously, a fixed resolution game? Closing without asking for confirmation? In 2014?! Are you kidding?!!And that's ignoring that it's still FFXIII, so any issue you had with the original is, of course, still here.Edit: Oh, hey, it DOES ask if you want to quit the game when you hit escape. Only if you're playing in windowed mode.			"

												DO NOT BUY!!! GET THE PS3 VERSION INSTEAD!!! trust me! there is a reason! Read my review! and you'll see why.This is a HUGE!!!! Disapointment >:( i'm actually REALLY ANGRY about this towards Steam and Suarenix! locked at 720p... thats all i have to say. Sure there is a Mod to increase Resolution but because the game only comes with the 720p cutscenes, it looks totally UGLY in the cutscenes, even if you Mod the game to a higher Resolution than 720p X( It still looks disgusting! I origiinally got this game on the Xbox 360. 3 discs, 1080p, 720p cutscenes. Than traded it for the PS3 version. 1 Disc because it was a Blu-Ray disc, 1080p, 1080p Cutscenes! it looked GORGOUS! i was hoping they would have used the PS3 Cutscenes but instead they used the crappy Xbox 360 Cutscenes. Huge Disapointment for me. since this game is so beautiful, u don't want to see not one nasty pixel, but instead, u do :(As for the game itself, i played it allready on the PS3 and it's actually a great game :) Sure it isn't the best finally fantasy game ever, but as a game in general, i liked it :D It's got Beautiful Environments, an awesome combat system and a decent story :) but some of the Charecters are a little annoying, it's kinda linear compared to past Final Fantasy games, and like i said earlier, the story is good but the way it's told is a little confusing O.o.... so watch out for that.Overall, if u REALLY want this game, GET THE PS3 VERSION INSTEAD!!! This is a game that deserves to be played in it's full High Resolution Glory that for some crazy reason, only Blu-Ray can provide. Have Fun ;)			"

												More important than a review here are some common issues that you will have with this game.If you experiencing an appcrash when running this game add a DEP exception for the executable that crashes(ffxiiiimg.exe or something similar; you will find it in the ""c:/program files(x86)/steam/steamapps/common/final fantasy xiii"" directory buried somewhere several folders deep.)If you are having issues with your monitor showing a huge black box around the game and overscan isnt fixing the issue and happen to have an AMD GPU you need to open Catalyst Control Center and disable ITC processing and force the desktop display resolution to 720P(HDTV) at 60hz and then manually set the scaling options to the overscan that gets the desktop as close to the edge of the screen as you can and apply the settings. You can then revert to your regular desktop resolution. The next time you run the game it will display correctly but it WILL look like butt. It will just look less like butt than it would have before. I have no idea how to fix it on NVidia GPUs but I assume the procedure will be similar.For the review I will say the game doesn't run at 60 FPS it is clearly running at about half that. You can tell as soon as the first video plays after starting a new game. I just spent 3 hours trying to get the game working correctly and I have not yet actually played more than the first couple of minutes. I will update my review accordingly as I make progress. I just wanted to be sure I posted some fixes for the game so noone else has to spend 3 hours fixing the issues like I just did.Update 1After playing about 15 minutes I noticed the game consisted of alternating between holding forward on the analog stick and mashing the A button and I often found myself looking for other things to do. So as an experiment I created a video in which I play the game and simultaniously perform other tasks like making tea, reading a book, and watching firefly on netflix.

The game plays like an endless cutscene. The battles are shallow and rarely require any intervention. There are moments when it releases control of the characters back to you just for you to walk 10 feet before it initiates another cutscene. The story isn't explained and the characters talk as if they expect you to know everything already. The characters are played out overused cliched archetypes with the depth of a shot glass. I feel like this game tarnishes Sakaguchi's legacy and drags it through the mud in a very unforgiveable way.			"

Thanks Square Enix for♥♥♥♥♥♥us off.I had plan to buy 13-2 and Lighthing Returns, but I won't buy those. I know what will happen with those games either.Must be same with 13(damn 720p!!! my monitor is 1440p!!!).I don't have any hope for FF15 now. I never seen good games which had long long development times.e.g. Duke Nukem Forever.I bet Square Enix will give us another big s.h.i.t.			"

												Only buy Final Fantasy 13 if you're in absolute love with the franschise and want to keep your streak of completing them all going.------Simply put, this is a hollow shell of what a Final Fantasy game is. Compared to the Playstation 1-2 classics (FFVII, FFVIII, FFX, etc.), this will be the least intersting, challenging and interactive sequel of its time. For starters, this is a completely linear story, no exploration, no interaction with people, no shops, no towns, no side quests. While I typically don't mind being on a rail of an expansive story, the narration is by far the worst ever told where so many terms are comfortably used without properly introducing the player what the hell it all means; thankfully they included a datalog to explain all the necessary, but apparently too trivial to incorporate in real-time, information. Final Fantasy XIII intentionally skimps out on a lot of details to reveal a bunch of cheap ""twists"" that you have an inkling is going to happen or something of that sort as you play through.The biggest gaffe to the game is the strategy, or lack of. It's so bad that I am actually writing a proper review for this game. Final Fantasy XIII does away with all sort of customization both in leveling as it is a shadow version of Final Fantasy X's sphere grid and equipment consists of an Accessory Slot and Weapon Slot with no real way to improve them besides chucking found items and boosting their stats. It's not very complex, elaborate or even that cool. For the majority of the game, the weapons hardly vary and pretty much offer better stat of your two stats: Magic/Strength (Magic/Physical). Since there are no shops in-game, you do all your purchasing through randomly placed books that let you buy items, save and upgrade your weapons, no real interface, customization or aesthetics, just menus and menus.Let's not forget that you only control one character at a time. You don't control all three in battle, you control one and switch ""roles"" of all three when you want to be more aggressive, support/healing or more defensive/disruption (slow, haste, protect, etc.). It's a very unique system, but limiting in strategy and even more limiting in how to approach foes. To add, you don't get to control any three characters for the majority of the game, so you're individually leveling different characters and their stories throughout most of the plot. Their leveling is slow and some roles (such as the Sentinel Role or Saboteur) gets only one ability or two abilities. It's cumbersome, slow and hinders the entire pace of the battle for what they thought was an innovative system.Everything that made Final Fantasy itself is gone: No Blitzball or Triple Triad minigame, no collectible Guardian Forces, nothing. Eidolons are the equivalent, but they're awkward, lifeless and there are very few of them. You summon them, they can do a limited amount of attacks and then they vanished. There is no real grandiose spectacle of their attacks that I would consider on par with the other games and certainly not as memorable. The characters are also the most disliked people in the entire series. Without a clear antagonist highlighted or underlined for the majority of the game, you turn your hate towards the main characters who are very shallow in backstory and mostly hypocritical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, I'll summarize it for you without any real spoilers (most of these are the premise of the game):*play with Japanese audio and save your ears from the over-Americanizing of the characters, trust me.Lightning: Emo ♥♥♥♥♥ who changed her name to be cool. Loves her sister, though they never show a moment when that was. Suppose to be cold-hearted and tactical, comes off as a lifeless ♥♥♥♥♥ who needs to experience high-school again.Vanille: Pedophile Thermometer.  She's 19 but you're never quite sure. Her mannerisms and constant narration that surrounds around a shrouded ""dark past"" is perhaps the most cliche situation ever. Agatha Christie couldn't even use this character. She is the summation of every dramatic asian show you've watched and went ""oh brother"". Your eyes will roll like a locomotive as soon as you hear her speak and then listen to what she says, does and is so blatantly bothered with (but keeps up a happy appearance).Snow: Obnoxious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. He is every ""that friend"" who is Tidus from Final Fantasy X with a pretend naivete to everyone he uses for his way. He's not selfish or an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, on the contrary, he comes off as overliked, obnoxious to the point that you want to puke at his ""for family, for glory"" schtick. His motivation in this game is cliche, a romeo & juliet kind of deal.Fang: There's really nothing to say about her. She's more of a plot tool than anything else.Hope: The worst of the worst. Don't believe anything this ♥♥♥♥er says or does. He's a massive little♥♥♥♥♥♥and a whiny one at that. His emotions and views towards people change almost instantly and what he says about his family is contradicted by the series of events that actually occur. For 14 years old, he stills calls his mother ""mommy"" and continues to ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan even when he has chance to talk about it. In every sense, he's that kid in the corner that you know has anger and frustration problems, but is too much of a massive tool to mention it; he just lets it fester and makes everyone around him miserable.This game is melodramtic. They try to make it seem like the worlds are tearing themselves apart and try to promote moralities, but in truth, every one involved is melodramatic, exaggerating and disliked. Beautiful music (though not as memorable), beautiful cutscenes (too many though) and beautiful world. Everything else can go to hell and should be promptly talked down whenever mentioned. I didn't even get to talk about the lack of options and controls in the PC Version of this game: it's not even 1080p.			"

												You exit the game when you press ESC key in fullscreen mode, not even a dialog box poped up. The game is poorly ported, hopefully they will improve the performence. Before then, don't purchase it, you will be disapointed.			"

												This is a laughable port of a laughable Final Fantasy game. There were actually more video settings available at launch for Dark Souls than there are for this bad boy...Figures, a Japanese studio doesn't give a rat's♥♥♥♥♥about PC ports.Story ranges from kinda decent to an utter mess. Graphics are locked at 720p with no customizable settings (sans GeDoSaTo). Music is uninspired at best. Gameplay is linear, with a combat system that nearly plays itself. File size of the game is not justified by the resolution of the cutscenes or gameplay (surprise, 720p). I did not have high expectations for Final Fantasy XIII. In fact, I had incredibly low expectations for this port. Somehow, Square Enix managed to deliver this game below my already low expectations. Bravo.			"

												Horribly ported. Regreting my purchase.FF13 to me was an amazing game when it was first released. Due to hardware limitations, I forgave the simple polygons and reduced textures. It was a great game as it was on PS3 and 360.However, This is just plain horrible. Playing on a locked 720p resolutions with no changes to the graphics is extremely disappointing. The gameplay was there, however, as I do like playing adventure games with my 360 controller, all of the button icons has been replaced with keyboard key icons. REALLY SQUARE? The simple things that they could've fixed was not even addressed. At times I have to guess what I should press. If I havent played this 4 years ago, I would be so lost. Huge lack of development and porting. It feels like I'm playing on a very confused 360 that has been overclocked and wants to be a PC. If square has the ability to bring patches and fix their product, you should wait it out before buying this game. This is exactly how the game looked 4 years ago. It was OK then, EMBARASSING now.

												I probably shouldn't be too surprised about this.  Leave it to Squenix to half-bake something for the PC.  The've done it with a fair number of their other PC games.  FFXI as well as FFXIV both come to mind, and they were even intended for the PC.  There's no quit option, you basically just save your game and then press ESC which just closes the game without asking or anything.  Resolution is locked to 720p, which would have been fine 10 years ago.  Nothing like basically losing half the screen on my 16:10 monitor to giant black bars on the top and bottom.  There is a 3rd party fix for it (just like there was for FFXI), but unfortunately it makes the menus unreadable for me.  Maybe I'll be able to get them to work properly with the 3rd party tool, maybe not.  In the unlikely event that Squenix gets their head out of the ground and fixes these issues, I would more than likely change this to a recommended game, but as it is you should avoid it.As somebody who hasn't owned a console since the PS2, I was actually looking forward to finally getting to play this game.  I guess from now on the takeaway is going to be wait and see and not pre-order older but well recieved games - especially from Squenix.edit: Looks like they've heard our complaints and will be adding custom resolutions shortly in December.  Supposedly they fixed the ""ESC"" instantly closes the game issue recently.  I will check on it again after the custom resolutions are added, hopefully changing the review to a thumbs up at that point.			"

												Well as we all expected it's a terrible port, there is Japanese & English audio, but the FPS is capped at 30 during cutscenes and 60 during gameplay, and the resolution is set to 720p with no options to changeThere are no graphical settings to change either - it's basically a ps3 game on PC - Hurray!

												This review is only focused on the gameplay and plot. Won't be taking in consideration of the 720p and nonsense like that (I am just glad to be able to play FF on PC again).But even without taking considerations of the fact that it is a horrible port; the game is still pretty bad. You have a bunch of very ridiculous and annoying characters this time around. Lightning is a cloud wannabe (ok this is still tolerable actually) , Afro (forgot his name) is the voice of reason and then there is a lady with a sari; Fang; these 3 here are the 'normal' ones.  The abnormals ones include constantly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic high pitched Vanille, you-killed-my-mother-but-I-am-too-shy-to-talk-about it Hope (he is also incredibly emo) and 10-year-old-hero-wannabe-in-adult's-body Snow.  I just don't know where to start. This not how you do character progression godanggit! I don't care if they have a tragic history, a hidden agenda or 'it's get better at the end' but this is not how you tell a character's story! Read more books before you write out horrid character development like this for heaven sake! Even if a character has a hidden agenda or tragic history; they are much better way to flesh them out and make them interesting! Go watch GoT or something and learn a thing or 2. GAH.Game is so damn linear that it nearly felt like I am playing a cutscene (actually I felt like I am playing a VERY LONG tutorial). You don't have access to the world until you are about to fight the last boss. I will give a little bit credit in the setting of the game being interesting. But jargons are too overused that the gamer felt lost in the game setting. Certain stuffs that are important to the plot is not being explained until later in the game. I really hate to pause the game and wiki all the jargons they are speaking just to know what the ♥♥♥♥ they are talking about. Very poor writing here once again.It's very easy to feel disconnected the game and it's difficult to immerse into the story of the game. You will feel like you are a third party watching everything that is happening instead of being involved with the events in the game. Combat is so-so. It is quite fun with all the stance juggling and stuff but it can get VERY repetitive. Then again most RPGs ARE repetitive in nature so I will not hold this agaisnt XIII (see? I am reasonable and lenient! I try my very best to actually love this game).Felt bad giving such a hard review on this game despite buying the game to encourage more JRPGs being released on PC. But having played JRPGs like Shadow Hearts 2, Terranigma, Last Story, Pandora Tower and Xenoblade Chronicles; this game is just outright ridiculous. Perhaps my expectations were too high.For JRPGs  fan out there who love FF; I would recommend this game if you are a die hard fan. If you are not; I will definitely ask you to stay away from it and not waste your time. My only hope in finishing this is because I heard the next instalment is much better (and I hope this is true).			"

												No resolution options and locked at 720pFrame drops to 30 on a very fast PC in combat and the game can't maintain 60fps outside combat either but hoovers around 55 so there is terrible ammount of screen tearing with adaptive vsync.i7 2600k 4.5Ghz, GTX 780Ti SLI, 16Gb ram.Really bad port here.

												If you already have this game on ps3 or xbox360... do not waste your money on this. I mean the game is the same and all, so there is that. But what about PC optimisations and extra tweaks that are kind of standard for PC gaming that enhances gameplay you ask? Nope. Not going to find it here. This does not even meet bare minimum requirements for me to see this as a half way decent port. But if the 60 fps is the only thing you are aiming for. Go for it!Personally if you want a good PC JRPG i would highly recommend The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky FC instead and to top it off... it's actually a good game too. "

Departing Worlds Holding hands closely together with another. Grasping desperately for the help we so often want, towards the silent comfort of another right beside us, with hearts seeking purpose, seeking the answer to the conflict within our heart and mind. Only for it to be violently ripped away, lost beyond the focuses of our reach. Anger, confusion, despair become a tumultuous mess within the captivity of the cage we withhold from others. Until you feel, in the distance blooms a shiny new haven, a future worth fighting for. Releasing the ties that bind you.Confused? Haha, as was I. When I started my play through this game I was met with great confusion because I asked myself:“Would I enjoy this game?”And again it occurred once more when I saw Square were going to port FFXIII onto pc. I was a bit overwhelmed, but decided to give it a chance.The HopeMy expectations/hope when I first started playing this game was somewhat like this:“Man, hope the story doesn’t disappoint.”“Wonder how many hours I’ll put into this.”“Wonder if I can grind a lot.”And so on... My thoughts were primarily on such topics regarding this game. And I can say with confidence,  IT DOESN’T DISSAPOINT . For one, I expected myself to be lost in direction like any other standard rpg, but I wasn’t. I was held by the hand throughout the game, which was cool in a way, because it offered a different experience from “Here have a shot.” yes there were times of great freedom, but throughout most of the time I felt someone was guiding me through my adventure in Cocoon(The game world). From that moment on I knew this game would be different from previous Square games. And you know what. It was!My previous thoughts of what An RPG should be were shattered as I was continually held by the hand each time through this game, and this is not to say it was irritating or annoying or I had a great dislike for. No, I realized FFXIII was a game ported to the west with different approaches to the genre of RPG’s. And with such a different approach came with it change. And that change my friends are the traditional view we often associate with previous games from Square. I was happy and intrigued at this new direction Square was trying to achieve, with a different way of structuring the battle instead of turn based combat (granted it still is turn based combat) and yet, they brought a new change:I.	How battles are fought.II.	Traditional premise of our sense of direction.III.	Storytelling like an epic novel.IV.	Powerful resonating themes of the Soul.The New WarFor me, I’m rowing my boat of enjoyment throughout the game! Beginning-middle-end. I absolutely enjoyed playing FFXIII, because it offered a different approach to traditional battles I was so accustomed to. Yes there was still a time to wait, but this time I could switch roles and tactics while keeping an eye onto the real time battle ahead. It gets even more complicated when you have to consider additional values of possible danger, when multiple enemies of the same type show up against you, or when diverse groups of enemies coordinate your downfall. These roles were flexible; you could be the leader, or a mage, or a shield, de-buffer, buffer, medic, etc. It matters solely on your matter of play style. I couldn’t grind in an area to become overpowered and just steamroll my enemies to death with button smashing auto-battle forever, I had to play it cool, safe, smart, and etc. Because this game strays away from my expectations of grinding in a spot then move on, it wanted me to move on, to move to the next area, and see the new cut-scene to unfold the shroud covering the story-line. This is why I didn’t want to grind so much in an area, because then I would miss previous information from the cut-scene because I was grinding so hard, that it becomes just a dissolving thought, gone into the wind. There was one good thing to come from not grinding, and that was it kept enemies challenging to me, since I was weak! As such, this new direction in how battles are fought gave it a plus in my book for now. Even maps were changed! Going for linearity which is baffling since this is a jrpg. Nevertheless I welcomed this new concept into a jrpg because it’s as if the game wants me to move on, to keep going, and not stay bogged down into an area. Yes, I could’ve grinded, but I wanted to see more of the story unfold, hence why I kept on moving. Convergent Crossroads Hmmm, Story-Time... It’s hard to express to someone in simple terms but here’s the gist. 6 Unfortunate souls are intertwined, through unlikely circumstances, in a race against time to save their world; loved ones, and themselves. Each character is unique concerning their own background and relationship with one another, they all share a common curse of loss and a race against time, and yet they must somehow work together to save the world they live in. It’s an arduous and monument us task, daunting for some, and yet for this group it’s difficult to even work together, let alone without their differences clashing with one another. But, somehow, someway they must confront the coming darkness ahead. Like a book, the game is mainly told through a series of cut scenes and log entries stored within your catalog. If you enjoy reading + playing games, then it should come to no surprise how much you’ll read and read again and again. It doesn’t imo diminish the overall combination of it within the game. But, rather rewards the player who hungers for more background knowledge and punishes the unworthy with just a dialogue to follow only. It’s also worth noting because I kept on progressing, more data entries would pop-up than grinding for some hours at the same old boring spot.Crystal Clear At the end of the day; after defeating the final boss, seeing the final cut scene, seeing the credits. I felt strangely content at the work I managed. Exploring the beautiful landscapes and areas coupled with the right atmospheric/unique music to set the tone and setting of the place traveled. A unique set of individuals struggling to defy fate’s chains and an epic story to grab hold of you from start to finish. Hate is easy, and yet to forgive is harder to do so, because we cling onto the memories of the joyous past that gives us meaning, hope, and the will struggling through. No matter the danger, no matter the horrors that face the lies that erupt from masks. All the remains from which, you struggle against time itself and the destiny of fate’s clockwork. We dream, we pray, and wish for miracles, and promises to become  Heroes .The Path of Heroes begins with?

												Very good game, totally don't understand the extremely negative reviews.  Overall it was a really fun game that I definitely enjoyed, the battle system especially was fast and fun and provided a lot of strategy where you had to customize and switch up your style to defeat certain bosses.This game definitely has problems however, mostly in terms of the story and the leveling up system.  I really enjoyed the leveling system towards the end of the game where it opened up and offered more customization, but the criticisms that it essentially was an automatic function that gave you a false sense of choices in the beginning half of the game are valid.  The weapon upgrading system also was not explained and presented well, but besides not exactly knowing what was going on you can do it and really have no problem, though later game weapons were made useless as it makes more sense to just continue to level whatever weapons you started to level in the beginning.In terms of the story, this is where the game really falls short, but the linearity was NOT the problem IMO.  I don't mind linearity because it allows a compelling story to be told, though this game could have done a better job disguising it (kindof like how FFX did).  The main problem with the story was the way it was told.  Upon researching further into the story I found that really crucial and important backstory wasn't explained or addressed in the game, not in the cinematics or the datalogs (I read every single datalog), and therefore motivations and plot points weren't understood, and you had to essentially say ""oh well I guess this is what is happening, just because"" and accept the premise the game was giving you if you were going to continue to enjoy the story (which I did and therefore was able to continue to enjoy it).  It also falls into the trap I've been noticing in FF recently where the rules of the universe aren't clearly defined, and then the story breaks those rules without offering any explanation.  What happens then is that main points of the story don't really make sense, and since they lead to other threads and main points further in the story, it makes it really hard to follow as the foundation the story rests on isn't stable.  Contrary to what a lot of reviewers say the story isn't convoluted at all, it really isn't even all that complex.  If that were the case I would have enjoyed it, what it really was was just told in a convoluted manner (the 13 days of flashbacks that are broken up into about 20 different segments that are revealed out of order at different times throughout the game) and main aspects of the story don't make sense, you essentially just have to accept them as such and not think about it too much.When researching into the story and its further backstory what is being told here is actually quite compelling, I just wish the game did a better job of explaining all of this in-game, datalogs included (most of this stuff wasn't explained in them either).  Also the ending pretty much uses a deus ex machina that doesn't really make sense, and it was one of the only FF endings that didn't have me tearing up or really eliciting strong emotions and feels, which is a real downside.  The other extreme negative was that there were quite a few sections that were essentially just padding, filler to grind out levels or so the game could reach its 40-45 hour playtime length, that really added nothing to the story and that I just wanted to get through.Overall however this was a really fun game that I really very much enjoyed, besides the filler levels, the poor execution of the story and the sub-par ending, I genuinely thought multiple times throughout my play time ""Man, I don't get why everyone hates on this game it is actually really good!""There is a lot to enjoy here, the battle system is great and strategic, towards the second half the leveling up system worked really well and you really felt like you were becoming strong as hell when you make it through the final stages and onto the final boss, and there were genuinely great moments in the story that really captivated me.  It just sucks that this wasn't even better realized as it definitely had the potential to be, but my appreciation for the story only increased as I further research into all of its details.I'd give this game a solid 6.5/10 (for reference I gave FFXV an 8/10)			"

Please patch this game or at least offer a refund (not likely) as it isn't playable.			"

												Still great graphics with GeDoSaTo, really gorgeous environments, decent English dub (better than the Japanese for my taste) and a good story, for Final Fantasy standards at least. Contrary to what you may have heard, one you can understand without looking into the in-game codex, if you have any attention span at all.The real misstep the game makes is the glacial gameplay pacing. It is too busy telling its story and showing off its creative environments to have you stop and smell the roses for a bit. For the first 20 hours you run through linear corridors towards the next cutscene. Final Fantasy X had the same structure for the first half of the game, but it gave you a village or town to explore here and there and NPCs to talk to. Even if that was just an illusion of freedom and the game was just tapping its foot for you to get back on the railroad, it did a good job to make the leash feel not as tight as it is here.Same issue with the combat system, it starts out barebones (and in the first 2 hours completely pointless because you don't have a progression system yet) and boring and only slowly grows more complex, engaging and challenging.Then suddenly you're over 20 hours in and the game shrugs its shoulders and dumps you in a vast open field full with tough enemies and multiple ways to go. Exploration! Adventure! Optional bosses! It's too bad many players never made it this far. And while the game generally nails atmosphere in most places, some of the character drama is very overwrought, melodramatic and tedious, especially Hope's little arc. So I can't blame anyone for giving up out of exasperation. Still, I do think the game is underrated and suffered from people parroting the opinions of others who also haven't really played it - I was guilty of that as well for a long time.			"

												pros- excellent soundtrack, superb graphics, great chartacters, great character development, intense deep story(will give u those goosebumps), fun/flasy battle system (can be starategic with paridigm shifts}, and breathtaking environments.cons- Too linear, making it hard to connect with the world and its citzens. Story can be hard to understand if u dont read/go through datalog,auto-battle feature is annoying at times, cant really control ur other characters, party leader dies? game over, meh post-content and hunts, can only really explore and experience one area (Gran pulse) therefore making it the other environments in the game a wasted opportunity, meaning it doesnt have that true final fantasy feel where u stumble across town meeting the citizens and visting shops, its just too linear in the worst way possible (Not a bad thing for me makes it like an interactive movie}Conculsion: Despite the cons which isnt really a big deal for me, the game still delivers in the most important aspects of final fantasy game/jrpg that  it has a superb soundtrack,characters,story-telling and a fun and somewhat strategic atb battle system.

												I actually dropped this game when it finally opened up, 20 hours in. ""Why,"" you ask, ""why would you do that? Why would you stop playing when it's the part that everyone claims that it gets better because it opens up?""Because the game does a very good job of being a hallway simulator for those twenty hours, and it was too much to take in at once when that no longer existed. I was too comfortable with it being linear. So you then think, ""well, where is my next clear cut goal?"" I don't like this conditioning, and I don't really drop games at all, so FF13 gets this special exception.ALSO 60 GB OF CG CUTSCENES			"

												So linear, it's almost on rails, this is completely different from previous Final Fantasy games. Everything is extremely cinematic, and the quality of the graphics are top notch. It's essentially an interactive movie, of sorts. The combat is always easy, so long as you take the 5 minutes to learn the new combat system, and character progression is, in all honesty, pretty well non-existent. The characters themselves, however, are all interesting and voiced by some pretty well known actors. The story so far (as the story continues through 5 or so more games) is written well enough, and seems intrueging. All in all, worth buying for less than 20 dollars.			"

												Currently unenjoyable, Square Enix somehow ♥♥♥♥ed up with the framerate, since the game originally only supported 30 fps on console and they tried to be fancy by upgrading to 60 fps for the pc release. The result is permanent fps stutter, even if your pc can - in theory - easily handle the game.Game also only supports 720p so far and has no graphics settings.Atleast they gave us the japanese voices, that's the only positive think so far, because japanese is amazing.Edit : apparently having a controller plugged into one of your usb slots fixes the fps issues, weird. still a pretty bad port as of now. hoping that square delivers some fixes.

Posted: October 11, 2014
												Update:With no word from Square Enix about a possibe patch, and no comments on the games performance, i can no longer recommend the purchase. I honestly thought these problems would be patched by now, however it is becoming clear that Square Enix TRULY doesn't care about the PC as a platform for gaming.  If they leave the game like this, don't buy it, just ""get it from somewhere else"" *wink, wink* it's what they deserve.---------------------------Additional Findings----------------------------------Updated:October 11th, 2014 @ 5:30 PMPlaytime:~5 hours So I am about 5 hours into the game at the time of writing this update. Throughout my additional 4 hours of playtime I have noticed a couple of things. The lag is not going away further in game so get used to it. I have noticed the lag to be Somewhat Consistent throughout each of the levels so far (and SOME of the battles have no lag at all). More visually impressive environments and levels seem to have little affect on the performance, the game just always seems to lag and stutter consistently (most likely due to how the ""texture and lighting"" Load Subsystems are put together, but that is just a guess).  Dont worry it really is playable in my opinion, I am a Gamer who considers framerate to be one of the most important factors to consider when playing a game, and bad framerates have kept me from enjoying many different games. Dead Rising 3, Assassins Creed 3, and GTA 4 (one of my all-time favorite games) are all examples of games whose experiences were negatively affected by poor performance. 5 hours into the game and I can say one thing for sure, this game DEFINITELY has poor performance. In my opinion this is the biggest (and really the only) serious problem this port has. So far at least.The Controls are tight (at least when using a gamepad) and the resolution really doesn't bother me. I downloaded Durante's fix to upscale the resolutions to 1080p bilinearly and I ended up scaling back down to 1280x720 with AA forced on. (in my opinion upscaling to 1080p made the game look great, but made the HUD extremely pixelated and ugly). The game honestly looks just as brilliant in 1280x720 as it does in 1080p (aside form the minor aliasing which can be fixed with Durante's update). The voiceover Audio quality is stellar, in both Japanese and English, and you can freely switch back and forth between japanese and english audio during your playthrough (no need to start a new game to change language settings, however language is changed out-of-game, so you will need to quit and restart if you want to hear the other voice-overs). The same could be said about the quality of the music. It's as amazing and beautiful as it ever was, and you already know that if your'e a fan of any FF game. I still haven't experienced any of the crashing or Glitching that others have claimed to experience, however i am only 5 hours or so into the game. I am still thouroughly enjoying my laggy, stuttery, Adventure through FFXIII. But here's to hoping that Square Enix is working on a Patch to improve performance, i suppose we will have to wait and see (fingers crossed). If you can muscle through some lag and can entertain yourself during the LONG download then i still recommend picking it up for its $15.99 asking price. I am still taking notes on what I am experiencing and will continue to update these impressions as I progress.------------------------FIRST MPRESSIONS--------------------------Keep in mind that Everything that Follows is my personal opinion: I personally feel that most of the Negative reviews on here are slightly exaggerated, I understand the dissapointment that the community is feeling,  but It really isnt all THAT bad. Yes It's true, this IS a terrible port, Square Enix should have done a MUCH better job. However If you're someone who loved FFXIII (like me) then it really shouldnt bother you too much. If you have always wanted to play FFXIII on your PC then this version is still worth the $15.99 asking price (in my opinion). keep in mind It DOES lag and stutter quite a bit but it's not TOO noticeable in battles. It mainly lags when you are running around the world and orientating the camera. The cutscenes look great (in my opinion) and dont stutter at all for the most part. Throughout the game you probably won't see TOO much aliasing except for when you are in-game, the cutscenes tend to look quite smooth comparitively. I have seen many people complain about the controls, but in my experience; if you use an Xbox One/Xbox 360 Controller and change the in-game button prompts to use ""gamepad prompts"" instead of ""Keyboard prompts"" in the Title screens' settings menu, then you really shouldn't have any noticeable trouble with the controls. Now onto the screen resolution problems. This game has NO resolution settings (the only option you get is to run the game in either windowed or fullscreen), however this doesn't matter too much if you happen to have a 16:9 display. I am playing on a 50"" LCD TV at 1776x1000 and I don't see hardly any problems (aside from the aforementioned minor aliasing in-game). However if you are a person whose display is a 16:10 ratio, i can't say for sure that you won't have problems with the games resolution (I have heard that a modder has made a fix for the resolution problems). I haven't experienced ANY of the crashing or glitches that have been described and i found that using a microsoft gamepad fixes the ""instantly quits when you hit escape"" problem.The real down-side to this port is the fact that nothing seems compressed, having to download 49.4 GBs of data for a game that came out on the XBOX 360 and PS3 is kind of ridiculous. ESPECIALLY when you realize that there are no higher resolution textures then there were in the original game (which WOULD make up for the size of the game if they WERE there, which they are NOT).  I believe most of the extra space is due to the fact that languages for the games audio and text are not region locked to what country you downloaded it in. What do i mean by this? Well, Everybody who downloads the game has to download Both Japanese and English audio files as well as different languages for all the text in the game: German, Italian, Spanish, and French ON TOP of having english and Japanese. Being able to decide on either Japanese or English audio is actually a really welcomed addition, however the amount of data that decision ended up adding to the game kind of ruined its practicality. Now you might have read this review and concluded that this game is not worth buying, and in many ways that is probably true; however, if you have got some free time for a long download and plenty of space on your hard drive, Then I sincerely do recommend this game for the $15.99 asking price, It's still beautiful and it's still FFXIII on my PC. Which i never thought would happen. I am only an hour or so into the game and these are only my first impressions, i will continue to update this review If more problems appear down the road.

												The game itself is amazing. It's a bold deviation from the norm in the Final Fantasy series, and I commend them for that. Unfortunately, for someone who has played the original version on Playstation 3 for hours on end, I can't bring myself to reccommend this version to anyone. This is an insult to us Final Fantasy fans.FINAL FANTASY XIII PC is whittled with bugs, crashes, and graphical glitches. Not to mention the annoying frame skipping despite them unlocking the framerate from 30 to 60 fps. It is also locked at a measly 720p, which for those of you with 1366x768 monitors shouldn't be that noticeable. However my monitor is at 1920x1080, and the image gets blown way up, making details look fuzzy. Now, normally, this wouldn't be much of an issue for me. I don't really care about resolution as long as the game is playable. But what's annoying is the constant pauses and frame skips that the game does, cutscene or not. I have an NVIDIA GTX Titan Black Edition + Intel Core i7 Extreme OC @4.8 GHz combo (In other words, FAR superior to the reccommended requirements) so I should not be getting frame skips on any game whatsoever, much less this one. There are zero (count them) ZERO graphical options to lower or raise the quality of any part of the game to increase or lessen the load on your PC. The movement in this version is a tad wonky as well, making your character jerk from animation to animation whenever you move. Some npc's will randomly disappear and the mouse controlled camera is... something left to be desired. Top that with the numerous crashes, for 60 GB and 15 bucks, this is not worth your time.There aren't many positive points, but one that I would consider a plus is the Japanese voiceovers. I watch anime regularly, and listening to the cast speak in their native language is rather refreshing for me. Another plus is someone is already working on a patch for this game to get 1080p and hopefully fix some of the bugs and frameskips. So I would wait until a patch comes out to address these issues before buying this game. The game itself is amazing, as I've said before. But this version... I'm sorely disappointed in Square-Enix. They're far better than this. Yet it seems they've gotten lazy lately.			"

												Don't pick this game up unless you are a big FF fan boy like some of us here. It's honestly a horrible port. Still plays as good as the 360/ps3 versions (if you have a modern card GTX 550 or equivalent you will occasionally drop below 30fps, but for maybe half of a second) so if you haven't played it and wanted to play it and don't have a PS3 you could get this.If you have a PS3 you might as well pick it up on there instead, used. It will be about as good.People have said the keybindings are bad, I don't think so. It's more down to what you prefer, but beyond that it's a really bad port and you shouldn't buy it unless you really really like final fantasy.			"

												I'm a loyal Final Fantasy fan and this is my thought about FFXIII. I played FFIII,V,VI,VII,VIII,IX(Best),X(LOVE),X-2,XII and by far FFXIII is the worst one.I'm not going deep on details tho.I don't like the idea about having one eidolon per character, I would love to have various eidolons to used as I see fit on the fight. The combat system is a real-time combat with the auto-battle system which is unqiue, but also bring the boredom to the game. ""Start battle ....auto...auto...2 minutes later..auto..win! 4 stars."" I like the old idea about bought,finding,crafting,etc. a new weapons instead of upgrading weapons which the only gave us like 5-6 ? kinds of weapon per character.There is no Gil ( money ) drop from the enemy, you have to sell ""Chips"" and they only drop from specific type of enemy.... seriously ? Storyline....I have no idea after spending 30 hrs+ and the name Fal'Cie , Cie'th , l'cie , Pulse l'Cie , Sanctum l'Cie , Orience l'Cie. Who came up with this name!?I would like to love the idea about bring in a new system to Final Fantasy franchise. But i hate to say that Final Fantasy XIII is a disgrace when compare to the others in the series.			"

												I'm genuinely curious at this point if Square Enix is just completely incompetent at porting games to PC, doesn't care, or just flat out hates PC gamers.It absolutely boggles the mind how they can release such an atrocious port of a console game and not give even the most BASIC options. First of all the game is locked at 720p, there's no graphics options at all, the visual quality is noticeably worse than the xbox or PS3 versions, and there's no volume setting at all. That is absolutely ridiculous, this is now at least the second time a volume setting has been completely omitted from a SE port, and it's completely inexcusable.At first when I was playing I noticed some poor performance with FPS drops being regular occurences, and chalked it up to myself not having the best hardware, but apparently (and while some of it may still be my PC) a lot of other users are experiencing FPS drops on excellent rigs as well, so SE screwed the pooch on optimization as well.As far as I'm aware half the keybindings as well aren't changeable, with the most annoyingly omnipresent one being the escape key. Press it once, no matter where you are or what you're doing in game will immediately close the game without giving a popup confirmation. How this button stayed as it is without anyone saying anything during the porting process confuses and saddens me.All these technical issues alone are enough to make me recommend everyone to stay away from this game, and that's not even going in to any of the ""gameplay"". I played this game for about 45ish hours on xbox before giving up and leaving the game unfinished, which is why I bought it on PC, to finally finish the game. However the litany of technical issues might make me give up long before I can finish the game.On to the ""gameplay""; the game is a long series of hallways for about 20-30 hours, at which point you get a tiny bit of freedom to run around a somewhat open world and do a series of missions where you go to a certain place and kill a certain enemy. The combat system is very lackluster, giving the impression of gameplay for any onlookers without actually having any gameplay really save changing paradigms mid fight, the rest of your time is spent mashing the space bar to do auto battle as quickly as possible. You only ever have to control one character, the other one or two in your party will control themselves based upon which paradigm they're in. The gameplay is extremely tedious, you don't even get the ability to switch paradigms until about 2 hours in, and you feel like you're in a tutorial for about 15-20 hours of the game, which is slow pacing at best, and maddeningly infuriating at worst.The story is a typical Final Fantasy affair, our main characters are all citizens of Cocoon when they are slated to be killed by the Purge, a massacre of civilians under the guise of exile, just due to the fact that they were near contact with a fal'Cie. Very little is explained about anything in this particular universe really, what exactly a fal'Cie is or does never really gets explained, and there are tons of glaring plotholes littered throughout the story that are just completely glossed over, which is to be expected from a Final Fantasy game but this one in particular really hits the ground running with the confusion it gives and never really stops.TL;DRDon't buy the game on PC. I would recommend not buying it at all but if you want to play it I would highly recommend playing it on Xbox 360 or PS3. Both give much better graphics quality and better stability.			"

												For €13, this is easily worth your money. Yes, the game is linear as can be, especially the first 25 hours and yes, the difficulty spikes are plain silly. However, the story is amazing and the world is a sight to behold. It's looking fantastic in 1080p and bar some areas the 60fps holds up easily (i5 / gtx 1070).			"

												---UPDATED-- 17DEC14[REDACTED] Is as if the developers had very little understanding of how computer games are meant to be designed.

Seems if I want to play this I must do it on my PS3 else risk tossing my keyboard through my monitor like a ninja star. And to people who think these issues are petty, go fly a kite. PC games have standards (mostly) and proper I/O (input/output) of devices is essential. [/redacted]Square has fixed most of what was wrong above. Escape, even in full screen mode now has a prompt rather than a seizure to desktop, my controller now works properly, and there is even a choice in display resolution with other glittery options. The game is actually quite lovely. The comment below about he boring gameplay is still accurate, however credit is deserved for Square actually listening and fixing their game.The story was very unappealing to me. Lightning was a very bland character with the personality of an ATM, Sachz is annoying with very poorly executed physical comedy, and the rest of the characters fall into the same as Lightning or is the standard spunky go get 'em character common in many anime stories or annoying white knight nuisances.  I don't really remember any of them fondly or at all and I just played the game, yet I can recall Jade Empire support characters and even Final Fantasy 3/6 sub characters without issue. These digi people are just that boring. I should add that I've played this game entirely on PS3.			"

												NOTE: I was one of the lucky few that was able torun this game with no game breaking problems. Howeverthis is still a poor port and though I am currently playing it.this port is not acceptable in any way.A game released 4 years ago, being re-released in 2014without enhancements like 1080p resolutions and stable frame rate,is bad enough on its own. However nothing we have not seen before.But when a game such as this from a big namegaming company in the industry, releases a product without even thebasic of the basic's in terms of PC configuration settings, is just a disgrace.The incompitence shown here in the release of this product out weighsanything good that can be said about the game in question. This is unacceptable,and in more extreme cases a clear window of the inner workings of this company.Fans and programmers alike are currently fixing this game and perhaps in timea more stable release may be available, due to these kind of people. However,I can not recommend this game to even the most loyal of final fantasy fans.Stray away, till at least the community fixes the company's incompitence orthe developers in question fix it them selves. You will be glad you did.			"

												Even when the game has no video options and only 720p, I've played the games for 4 hours and watch evey cutscences and i must say there're alot of mistake in the translation progress. Some subtitles have completely different meaning from what the character say. Like before Snow kiss Sarh when they watch fireworks, the right meaning of Snow's words is: ""Let's watch the fireworks together next year."" not some ""all for us..."". Final Fantasy 13 focus on story and cut scence so right translate is very important. Fail translation make the scence fail too. And this PC version have less cut scences than on other platform. Sorry for my bad English.			"

												This is probably one of the worst ports ever. I love FF and have played almost every single one so this is not coming from someone who hates the series. I can run BF4, Titanfall, Crysis 3 and all the other graphic intensive games at 60 fps no problem. But apparently my computer struggles to play this game at 30. I have a GPU monitor and its using on average about 3%..... its also capped at 720p which is rediculous. And now I went to fire it up and everything is played at about 50% speed and the loading screens take about 10 minutes to get through. If this was any other game I would demand a refund because this is just plain awful. Wouldnt recommend or ever purchase if I had the choice again			"

												Good game bad port.Really good production value. The amount of effort they put into the artistic aspect in this game is simply jaw-dropping. This is one of the most beautiful game I have ever played, the graphic designs and music alone are enough incentives for me to finish the whole game (which takes tens of hours). The battle system is also the high point of the game which emphasize on pre-battle planning. I was fascinated by the simple yet deep battle system, so I took the time to grind like crazy and grabbed all the achievement post-game. For your reference, it takes at least 100 hours to 100% this game.Personally I do not have much problem with a game being linear. Also it will open up in chapter 11 and become semi-open world. The change from linear to semi-open world is a bit overwhelming for me at first, I somehow liked it being linear.Story is not bad but it feels cheesy at times. I liked the lore and the confusing mythology. Although the English localization/ translation is decent, I am not happy that US version doesnt have Japanese text and subtitles.Oh, I liked Lightening, and those awkward Ane-Shota stiuations with Hope. My only compain on Lightening is that she is way too skinny for an Onee-san type of character, if her body build is more like Fang it will be perfect. Hope is annoying as fuxK for a few chapters, but he gets much better later not unlike a lot of those anime characters.On the technical side, this game is a pretty bad port, because of the inconsistent framerate caused by horrible optimization. But at least the framerate never droped below 30 for me on 4k with 2K shadow resolution, and stayed at 60 during cutscene and most of the explorations. So I kinda get used to it. The next port FFXIII-2 has even more severe performance issues.It is either hate it or like it situation here, it has to do with personal taste. If you like a linear game with beautiful graphic and music, good battle system, do not mind framerate drop too much, after go through a few dull tutorial chapters, it will become a pleasant experience. Considering the price, and the production value of this game, it is not a bad deal, and you can always grab it when it is on sell for a few bucks. However if you are looking for open world experience, choice and consequences, look elsewhere.			"

												First things first: it's a bad port. There are very few options and it doesn't run well. Compared to, say, the Valkyria Chronicles pc port it's embarrassing. Kb/m controls are glitchy. We had to make threads on steam and wait months just to get above 720p resolution and graphical options, which are still very limited. That's how bad a port this is.Now, the game itself. It looks very good. The cutscenes look amazing, the story is kind of interesting, and, if it's the sort of thing you look for in a game, the female characters are done very well imo, except for Vanille, she's kind of annoying. The battle system takes a while to get the hang of but when you do, it's quite good. Until then, you will be just spamming the A button. The story focuses on a group of unlucky individuals who have been cursed - 'l'cie' (some of the names in this game are silly, and it throws a bunch of nouns at you  immediately which you won't understand) They struggle with their fate - which for me is one of the more interesting parts of the story. A good part of the game is just them coming together as a group, and figuring out their destiny, which makes the dynamic of the group strong and interesting.The game is very linear. This wouldn't be a problem if the game wasn't so repetitive. There is nothing to do besides walk forwards, fight, cutscene. The game desperately needed some variation, some more puzzle solving, or something. It's too long, too. Be prepared to walk, battle, cutscene for 100 hours+. There are no towns, and very little people to actually interact with in the world, which makes me question why this is even a game at all, and not a film/tv series/ anime. When the game finally opens up all you get are quests, go here kill this monster, but at this point the thought of doing any more battles felt like such a chore I skipped most of them. The upgrade system is a complete gamble and you end up wasting so much money through being inefficient at what's essentially a guessing game. The crystarium levelling system is a perfect metaphor for the game: looks flashy, but in fact is very linear with few branching paths. I am seriously failing to understand what the logic behind some of these design decisions were, unless they thought 'It's final fantasy, we can do no wrong.' Well, they did wrong. I remember the devs talking about streamlining the game to make it more accessible. Well, that was a bad idea, because nobody who doesn't already play total grindfests will want to spend more than a few hours playing this.I tried to enjoy this game, I really did. I tried to persevere through the repetition to find out what happens in the end. But it's just too much. They should have made this game 15-20 hours, cut most of the flashy yet ultimately linear and boring levels and told a much tighter, more varied story through more than just the cutscenes. It feels like a bunch of grinding attached to an admittedly very stylish and good looking collection of cut-scenes which tell an interesting story. It's just a shame that the actual game couldn't have been better.			"

												ok, this review will probably be pretty crappy since it's my first attempt at doing a serious review..with Final Fantasy XIII, you either love it or despise it. Personally, i love the story, characters and etc (and i think the battle system's pretty neat too). I really dont understand the hate for Lightning and her lack of emotion, i mean, Cloud wasnt the very ""emotional"" type too. Anywayyyy... some of these wont be the same for everyone) in my opinion---> (MAJOR REVIEW UPDATE 12/04/15 : i got a really good computer a month ago and tried out this game again :) I've completed it in a week and am probably going to play it again soon! Square Enix patched this a while ago so pretty much all the problems and Cons are gone! I LOVE THIS GAME)Pros: +great story         +pretty good decent characters         +graphics good for it's time and today         +good battle system         +must-buy for the majority of final fantasy fans! :)Cons: -FPS lock (mines especially, it's going at 15-20 fps :/)          -the dreaded ESC button           -my resolution was put down to a level which deemed the game unplayable a few days ago          -(update) the game now crashes on startup          -the ungodly 60gb download o-osorry, this review is probably the worst you've seen but hey  at least i gave it a try :/ thanks for reading if you did.I'm giving this game a thumbs up despite all the problems I'm getting because i think FFXIII is simply an awesome game :)8/10			"

												I'm just installing the game and i will maybe update the review, but i have to clarify just three points that best describe this port:1) Year 20142) 720p 3) No grapchis options and BAD optimizationFrom SQUARE ENIX....i wasn't expecting that! I'm done.Fortunately there are some ppl doing a great mod for downsapling --> http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/ and actually i'm playing at 1080p.UPDATE:The game is interesting but BORING after 10/15 hours of PRESS A, PRESS A, PRESS A...The combat system (between turn base/action) is nice but not good for a 30+ hrs game. Otherwise there are nice customizations in terms of speels/equipments. The style and the overall game is quite good.BUT PLAY IT ONLY AFTER DURANTE'S MOD APPLIED, with 4k downsapling and other graphical enanchements.			"

												I checked it out since I was curious to see what the Final Fantasy series looked like these days, having stopped at the SNES era. I was also curious to see if the bad reviews were founded: I thought that at worst it would a nice ""autopilot"" pass-time, something to go through without torturing my brain too much for when I'm tired.... Unfortunately, the negative reviews were founded. I mean, the graphics are great and I was genuinely intrigued to see how the story would end, but that about ends the positive points. The game as a whole is a linear borefest with a combat system that invites you to spam a single button, except for the occasional super-hard fight. The combat and crafting mechanics are intentionally obscured, and the ""paradigm shift"" mechanic didn't strike me as very fun. Give me back my turn-based FF combat please.Even the much-touted ""part when it opens up and becomes real Final Fantasy"" i.e. chapter 11 consists of a green plain with some scattered generic fetch quests. And then the game becomes a corridor again. I distinctly remember having an impression of epic freedom while I roamed the world in an airship in SNES Final Fantasy RPGs, not so in this game.If only the story was well-delivered. Unfortunately most of the time the party has no clue of where they are going or why, and the characters are not very interesting. In the end I made it to chapter 11 to see if it would get better, and then I was so bored that I decided to watch the rest of the cutscenes on Youtube. I'm glad I did. The end cinematic is pretty cool but not worth slogging through the whole game.There are two sequels, XIII-2 and XIII-3, but honestly I'm not even interested in watching their stories. I'll go play some actual good classic JRPGs I missed or watch a real movie instead.			"

												Here is the problem with this game: it is not nearly the ♥♥♥♥♥how you may have heard, but it is still busted on every damn level, and there is no reason to play it when its sequels improve on its flaws massively. That's it. That's the short review: skip to XIII-2 and never look back, the story doesn't mean a damn. If you absolutely, positively must catch up prior to XIII-2, watch the video Square released prior to Lightning Returns that summed up the entire plot to date in a 16-bit style in about 6 minutes. It's more coherent than this entire game.Alright, let's just break this down some, because that deserves explanation.The battle engine is DECENT, but you're going to be stuck with a highly-gimped version of the combat system for HALF THE GAME. I mean, I know the early chapters are shorter than the later ones? But you don't unlock ""everyone has all their job roles"" (and no, this isn't FFV-style jobs, it's ""you fit into this style of skill when in that class"", no variance, no ability carryover, only stat gains) until CHAPTER TEN OF THIRTEEN. Even with my lopsided playtime, that's still over a third through the game before you can finally use all of its functions.The port's got issues. I just upgraded this machine under half a year ago from scratch, a solid setup, and even then there's still weird frame chugging. God willing they'll patch that up some when Lightning Returns drops (there was an engine update on XIII-2's release that was... questionably helpful), but expect hitching. More than a few areas still look gorgeous, though, props there.Yes, it is about as linear as you've heard. There is basically a single chunk of game where you aren't on one-way-briefly-branching paths, and that one is just a huge open field, which is a middle-finger in that there's kiiiiiind of fast-travel, but you have to complete a sidequest to open each point. And go to one of them to warp to the others. And you can only hold one sidequest at once. So it's miserable to get around is what I'm saying. I guess there's post-game stuff to do there too, but heck if I really want to do more of this for completion's sake now that I'm done when I have XIII-2 in my library to actually enjoy.Finally, there's the story. This story is hot trash. The finale is unquestionably one of the dumbest things I've ever seen in JRPGs, and I want you to really, really ponder what that implies. It's not even funny dumb, either, because I'd be marking this as a positive if so. It's ""none of this makes any sense and it's all random BS at this point"". The tale goes that this game's development was such a trainwreck that all the cutscenes were done far before the game, meaning that rather than scrap those scenes, they had to write around already-animated footage? I can believe it. Characters ""die"" only to reappear an hour later nonsensically, people flip personalities on a dime all the way to endgame, and I still can't quite understand what the relationship between a few characters was because it's ENTIRELY ALIEN AND UNIQUE TO EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE GAME.I am literally telling you to skip this and play its sequels if you want anything to do with this story, and you will be better off for it. 100% sincere here. The soundtrack is decent (and I mean DECENT, not amazing or anything), and that's about the best praise I can give this that doesn't have the qualifier ""...but the sequels did it better so you don't need to stick your hand into the rough edges of this title"".

												Just finished the game few minutes ago with all achievements and my first though is a good game but not exceptionnal like usual Final Fantasy. The gameplay is a little bit to casual, just controlling one character with auto-select attack/spell/etc is a bit surprising and the moment when you have to choose it manually for change really the issue of a battle is too rare.Second, the first half of the game is a ""one-way"", linear game, this point could be great if the story was as much as great than the previous FF, I think it s one or two degrees down compare to pieces of art like FFVI/VII/VIII/X.Third, some characters i could never apreciate because they are too cliche for me. I don't feel that in usual FF; i think mainly to Hope and Vanille. Fortunately, Lightning and Fang are badass as hell.Many points were excellent, when you reach Gran Pulse, it s the moment the game take is full potential, little ""open-wolrd"" and many additionnal quests and contents to do that looks like more than a traditional FF. I am satisfied by the final climax I really want to play the next episodes. The few I played in XIII-2 looks more mature and appreciable.			"

Summary:	 [/b]Gameplay: ®®®®®®/10Graphics: 720p Armpits/10Story: Moms are tough/10Audio: Moms are tough/11Features: -/-[/b]I have not bought or played a core Final Fantasy game since the highly appraised FINAL FANTASY® XII was released in 2006 (ignoring a dabble into IZJS only last year). I knew what to expect from FINAL FANTASY® XIII over listening to repeated complaints from a cancerous online gaming community regarding its linearity over the years, but there's always that major gulf in hearing and experiencing. To put it in perspective, FINAL FANTASY® XIII is more linear than Super Mario Brothers ® 3. Infact, to call Super Mario Brothers ® 3 in terms of its representative platforming genre linear is quite the injustice as there are many tactile and descretive choices, plus discoveries a player can make in terms of journey to reach the final stage. Playing Final Fantasy ® XIII last night on the other hand I couldn't help but compare the storytelling mechanics to the drearily tacked on singleplayer campaign of Battlefield ® Bad Company 2, infact this is probably Final Fantasy ® XIII's closest cousin. You will be presented by cutscene after cutscene, and during exploration (pressing forward on the controller) your party members will constantly teleport ahead of you and enact out a scripted scene akin to walking past other kids roleplaying in the playground during a typical lunchtime in primary school. The result is quite irksome and distracting, as your primary focus is wrestling with the camera trying to visually locate stray treasure chests (spheres) dotted to the left and right of paths.Linearity is not so much a bad thing in games that focus on a rich narritive experience, except that Final Fantasy ® XIII repeatedly shows that it is shameless about its stripped game design. This wouldn't be a problem at all if it did offer a half decent narritive experience (or compelling scenario), or less cringeworthy character interactions to begin with. I did not even mention the Crystarium system yet. Its basically how you 'level up' your characters in terms of stat boosting and is an algamation of the acclaimed Sphere Grid (Final Fantasy ® X) and Job Board (Final Fantasy ® XII) counterparts, except that each ""Grid"" (or Crystal!) is about 12 nodes long, and there is no detriment of choice in which stats or skills to take since you will eventually fill them all in anyway.Crystarium is a dumb name for Line Grid.Console Port-wise, this is the Xbox 360 version except you can choose between Japanese and English voice acting on start up and downscaled 4k 1080p graphics thanks to an unnofficial graphics patch made by GeDeSato (a very talented modder from Neogaf) that appeared SIX HOURS after the official Steam release. So to fully reap the benefits of buying this game for the PC you need to fish around the forums for a patch link.All in all, I doubt more than 2 people will read this wall of text this far down. I'm a lonely unmarried guy who enjoys experimenting with Duplo on his Nephew, raking fallen autumn leaves into piles, appreciates the upside of well rendered polygonal armpits, and carving donkey statues.

												I enjoyed this game, however I can't exactly say it was good. It has every element that makes up a good story driven RPG. The characters, on paper, are compelling. The story, on paper, is interesting. The character development, on paper, is interesting and the combat is really fun. The game is gorgeous and the world, on paper, is interesting.The problem is that nearly every element of the game is mishandled from minute one.The characters are held back by atrocious dialog and awful voice direction (Although for the most part the voice acting is good).The story is held back by awful pacing and a habit of extreme repetition as if the game doesn't trust you to understand it (and keep this idea in mind, the game not trusting its players - I'll get back to that in a bit).The character development harkens back to the excellent systems of Final Fantasy 10, then manages to mishandle them in every possible way. It recreates the sphere grid, but with multiple classes per character; however each class is essentially one path with little branching and additional classes aren't unlocked later in the game; this turns the system into effectively grinding for miniscule stat increases between new ability unlocks. Item upgrades are very similar; grinding monster parts or gil to throw xp at them for miniscule stat gains. Again, the game fails to trust the player to make any in-depth decisions with their characters.Combat, on the other hand, is very interesting and fun. Battles play in typical Final Fantasy fashion of pseudo-turn based with menus, however everything is much faster and the ability to switch classes on the fly (in the middle of a turn even!) makes for some fast paced and entertaining battles.Again, though, there are problems. Final Fantasy 13 seems afraid to give you too many options early: not letting you even customize your party until nearly 15 hours in and limiting you to 2 characters at a time for much of the game, making early battles both less interesting visually and from a tactical standpoint. Not being able to switch character control in combat (your party lead is directly controlled, other members AI controlled) is also a problem, but less of one than it sounds - the AI does a good enough job of picking the right actions (based on your knowledge of the enemy to boot). Combat also becomes very repetative against some of the simpler enemies.But now, for the gorilla in the room: This game is linear. It's linear as ♥♥♥♥. The phrase ""corridor simulator"" comes to mind. Square Enix creates a very interesting and potentially detailed setting, then renders you completely unable to actually explore or interact with it. Even when the game world opens up, you're still very limited in what you can actually do. Almost as if SE couldn't trust the player to figure out what to do if the game was more open.And therein lies the game's largest fault; it doesn't trust the player to be able to do anything on their own. SE doesn't trust you to figure out the story, find your way in the world, figure out the battle system, or develop your characters without leading you on the nose for hours and hours.In spite of all of this, I enjoyed the game. Combat is really, legitimately fun 90% of the time; despite all the flak the characters get from fans I enjoyed most of them (I stand by most of the criticism with the characters boiling down to awful dialog and direction); and the story is legitimately interesting until the later chapters (there's a bit of a deus ex machina at the end). I still recognize its faults though; there's bad game design right left and center here.Some words on the PC port: it ran great, framerate wise. Controlled fine with M+KB and controller. The resolution locking is incredibly stupid but you can at least toss a hack on to set it to whatever you want. The escape key quitting the game is so hilariously stupid I can't even get mad about it; it's just funny. Had some minor FPS drops entering new areas and a crash here and there, but nothing major.The pricetag is right on this one. At $16 you could do a lot worse provided you can look past this game's faults. Throwing a recommend here; with the caveat that if you can't see past the game's flaws you should just avoid it.			"

												First off, the game is a terrible port. Locked at 720p, runs like♥♥♥♥♥on my 870m (and a lot of other Nvidia cards), and it's 50GB. And almost all of that is from the movie files (Japanese and English forced download). There's some fan fixes in the work, one specifically from Durante, but it's pretty rough as of this moment.Now, as for the game... Awful story, it's pure garbage. Almost ALL of the information you need to follow the story is told to you in the game's codec. You need to read paragraph after paragraph of information as you explore and are given bits at a time. Now you might say. ""But Damuel, what about Dark Souls? It doesn't spoon feed you the story and you would be lost without a lot of reading!"". Well here's the difference. Final Fantasy gives you practically a NOVELs worth of information, and the game shoves story references down your throat left and right that will leave you absolutely confused without reading. And it's not like there's any thought, it's just that you're basically given a book that you need to have to even remotely follow along.But how about the characters? Oh boy, Lightning is my waifu, so pretty. Shame she's an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ for no reason, and the supporting cast isn't much better. You have Snow, your typical do-gooder, he's absent for a good portion of the game, but he's somewhat likable if perhaps a bit too generic of a ""hero"" type character. You have Hope, a whiny child who constantly is afraid of things and silently spits on everyone else. You have Vanille, an annoying tween girl who has been overly sexualized both in game and in the stacks of rule 34 online, possibly the most annoying character of all time in FF. Bad VO, bad script, terrible fighter, and just nothing redeeming. The two remaining characters barely have an appearance but they're decent. Sazh is amusing and an alright supporting character but he's barely ever seen. Fang is just super generic strong female character, nothing special.The visuals were nice for its time but they're♥♥♥♥♥now. Everything is super jagged and the animations are stiff. It's not HORRIBLE, but it would have been nice to get some HD textures at least for the PC release. The CGI is nice though.Combat system is garbage. The only practical way to fight is to use the autobattle, otherwise things take too long. Basically push A/X to win. Shifting is okay but gets VERY tiresome at times. It's basically the game's class system and you need to switch classes constantly mid fight. At times it gets frustrating to switch back and forth between every other attack. Personally I liked the old fashioned turn based fighting of the pre FF12 games. The game is SUPER linear. A lot of the FF games are but this one takes it to the next level. The TUTORIAL is over 10 hours long. You can't change your party members (Yes, even if visually you have a crew of 5 people with you, you're forced to play with the three the game wants you to play with) or pick what classes they use until the 'tutorial' is over. What a horrible design choice.That all being said... The game IS Final Fantasy. It has pretty CGI, the story is decent if you don't mind a TON of reading, and most of the issues gameplay wise are in comparison to the previous games. It's still a very solid JRPG for 15 bucks, though I wouldn't pay more than 10 these days for it. The game clocks in at around 20-30 hours depending on how much you're willing to grind.Edit: I guess I should mention, the game gets A LOT better after the 'tutorial'. But it will take most people between 10-20 hours to actually get through it. And that's unacceptable. There's a good game underneath all the garbage, but we shouldn't have to play through for 10 HOURS to get to the fun stuff. The characters are more likable, the game is less linear, there's side content, and you can FINALLY play with the people you want (besides a few fights). It almost turns into a true final fantasy game.			"

												Because i have been a hardcore fan of the series since the early 90s, it pains me to say that this game is another nail in the franchise's coffin. Sure, the game is looking good and the music is really good but other than that, it is an insult to one of the best series of my childhood. The World is too linear and generic compared to the past games with the majority of the game having you swept by the story along a fixed path while taking away all the options for exploration. The battle system is a joke, letting you go through 90% of the game by simply pressing ""auto-battle"" and occasionaly switching to a different paradigm when the situation calls for it. You have no control over your team mates other than making them change their roles in a battle.In short the game looks awesome but is in fact crap. "

												Possibly the most qualfied reccomendation ever. Final Fantasy XIII is a game I hated on console, and I don't really like it on PC. The story and characters are absolute wank, it's linear to a fault, and the combat system takes about a year to open up. But I have come to appreciate the deep and strategic combat. Once you get over the disappointment of the necessity of the Auto-Battle function, there's a lot to enjoy here. Plus, it looks great, and the music is awesome. If you're not into the combat, don't touch it with a ten foot pole. But if you are, it's worth it for a tenner.			"

												So back when I tried this game on PS3 I gave up after 7.5 hours. On Steam I'm 24 hours deep at the time of writing this and I'm loving it! I think a huge part of that, for me, is the Japanese audio. I actually like the characters this time around! It's still a giant tunnel for over 20 hours, but I find the story compelling enough that I don't care about the lack of options until halfway through the game. The game functions well with a controller, but I think you need KB&M to actually exit the game. I'm using a Steam Controller so I have the ESC and mouse clicks set to Mode Shift. I'm sure there are other solutions too, so just FYI. "

												DOES SQUARE HAVE THE COURAGE TO FACE ITS CUSTOMERS?[Edit: I just can't recommend this game in its current state.]If you were expecting this to be the definitive version of FFXIII, be prepared to be let down. What we've got here, at launch, is a title that is locked to 720p at 16:9 ratio with screen tearing and frame rate issues for a large portion of customers. This is a port of the 360 XBox edition, which used a poor quality video encoder, resulting in the lowest quality cutscenes of any version available.Sure it's cheap, but that is no excuse to not offer even the basics. Those who hoped to play this game on their PC will be disappointed. That said, quite a few have said it runs just fine, in spite of 30fps battle limits and 60fps otherwise.If SE takes the community seriously we need to see some real improvements by way of patches. Some have been promised, but overall we're not happy yet ... we'll see what they choose to do. Consequently, spend your money on something else that is properly supported by its developers.			"

												This review comes from someone whose last Final Fantasy game was FF9, which was the last one made for playstation 1. From there I never bothered to buy another console and stuck to full PC gaming. I was happy to see that they had ported many of the non-MMO final fantasy games to PC a decade later.I decided to give FF13 a try to see what I've been missing and to get back a piece of the quality gaming that I so dearly recall from my childhood days. However, I was mostly disappointed with the game because with every part of the game that I liked, there was another part that related to it that was a pain in a sense. For example, the combat system has some complexities and you'll find yourself interacting with different formations regularly and taking active control almost constantly - especially towards the end game. However, you get through nearly 3/4 of the game before this actually happens. I kid you not that you will be wondering if the gameplay mechanics the team worked on will actually be relevant becuase the majority of the game is so *easy* that you can just afk/click and breeze through everything. Once you get to the open world area this completely changes and you'll be getting stomped until you level up but the game is in 'tutorial mode' for farrrr too long. It's one thing to introduce players to new mechanics in the first hour or two of gameplay. It's another to make most of the freaking game so simple that people like myself actually lose interest in playing for days because it's too easy.The game has 3 phases. Without spoiling too much: there's the introduction phase where you discover the characters and are put on a linear track storyline. There's the 'open world' phase where you level up for the final boss and then there's the final area itself. I don't mind the linear storylines as much as others but the open world area was what I imagine to be a throwback to the old FF open world areas where you explore and fight what's in your path. However, by the time you get that it gets to be extremely mundane very quickly. The battles will last 10 minutes each and are against the same types of enemies up until the ending credits as they occupy the end zone as well...so once you get to a point where you can take on a behemoth you've won the game.The storyline itself is also so-so. I havn't played FF10+ or many JRPG's but this story feels much more anime/JRPG than what I'm used to. Perhaps it's my age or difference in taste but I felt the older series (FF3/7/8/9) didn't depend on long cinematics to tell the story but were rather driven by the gameplay and battles themselves. It was disappointing that many of the storyline battles that I did get to fight were so bland and easy that they didn't feel epic at all. The exception being the end fight.Overall I think the game is worth a purchase but I think that anyone that is looking to experience a Final Fantasy similar in quality/style to the ones that they played on their old PS1 will be in for a shock. The game is enjoyable in ways and admittedly I will be buying XIII-2 and Lightning Returns but I'm hoping that many of the complaints I felt were valid here are addressed.			"

												Let me start this off with a warning for anyone who decides to play this game - use the Japanese dialog. The English VA will probably really hurt your experience with this game. Something about it just kind of ruins your ability to develop any sort of involvement with the characters.Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised by this game. It has several innovations that solved things I don't like about lots of JRPGs. One of my favorite features was being able to retry when you lose a battle and being sent to a few seconds before you encountered the enemy, leaving you with the ability to walk away and go do something else or just try again. I've had too many frustrating moments in other JRPGs when I lost a battle only to be sent back to one of the too-sparse save points or losing progress because I hadn't been obsessively saving every few minutes. I also enjoyed the battle system. In addition to being real time, which adds to the excitement of the battles for me, the paradigm system has some things I liked about it over other JRPG battle systems. Instead of having to pick every command for every character for every battle, you can instruct your characters what to do (heal, build stagger meter, do damage, tank, buff, or debuff) and leave it to them to handle the details. Then the gameplay loop in the battles becomes analyzing the situation and switching paradigms to suit it.I also liked the absence of random battles. Just being able to see the enemies you might bump into makes things a lot less frustrating and annoying compared to walking along and suddenly having everything freeze and being thrust into a battle.I liked the story and overall flow of gameplay from the start until about 40 hours in. Then it really started to go downhill for me. It just felt like it was dragging on. Maybe if it was the only game I had to play I would be fine with it, but I found myself wishing it would just be over. It just started to feel like corridor after corridor with little interesting plot development. I've heard people complain that the entirety of the game is just corridors with cutscenes between them, but I honestly enjoyed the earlier parts of the game. Stuff happens, you are still getting the hang of the battle system, you're looking forward to what's going to happen next, and the pace seems fine. After 40 hours I started to just get bored of the whole thing - it didn't ""change it up"" enough to retain my interest, and the battle system just wasn't enough to keep me entertained.As someone who isn't a big fan of JRPGs, I weakly reccomend this. I had a lot of fun with it at first but it started to feel like a chore or job towards the end. To be fair, I start to feel this way with most JRPGs. There's something about a lot of JRPGs, particularly their battle systems, that just makes them start to lose their fun after awhile for me, especially compared to more fast paced and action oriented games. I think it's mainly due to the fast-paced feedback loop those games usually have when compared to JRPGs.And if you do play it, as stated earlier, I recommend choosing Japanese voice acting. Not because it's always better to play games in the language they were written in, but because it means you won't have to listen to the annoying English VA. I suspect that some people who said they hated the characters or found some of them to be annoying or didn't like the story might've felt that way because of the English VA and would've liked those things a bit more had they switched.

												Not your classical FF game, but the story is nice and interesting. The gameplay is ok, can be really challenging or really easy depending on how much you grind. It is mostly linear, but I didn't feel the need for more exploration. Game runs good, but as any FF PC port, it's not without its fair share of problems.			"

												First of all, I own both limited editions on ps3 and xbox360 since release back in December 17, 2009.With a story that would be considered ""nothing special"", FFXII shines with its fast-paced combat and challenging difficulty. Although it introduces many changes to the series, it provides a good amount of things to explore providing hours of fun. And since the pc update from December 11, this port is perfect. 60fps. 1080p up to 8k resolution. Many options to change any customization. 10/10			"

												Final Fantasy XIII is an abomination pretending to be an awful lot of things, and failing to be any of them quite badly.  It pretends its a role-playing game, yet has no aspects of role-playing in it (and barely any aspects of gaming in it, for that matter).  Even by the more loose definition of a JRPG, it's not a JRPG.  You don't gain levels, you add points to a perfectly-linear path ala FFX's Sphere Grid, only with even fewer actual choices.  It just turns ""leveling"" into a chore you take care of every few minutes by holding down a button and watching numbers go up.  The combat does everything it can to take the player out of the equation, while also punishing the player for trying to play the game at all by sabotaging any sort of attempt at taking control with split-second irredeemable reversals of fortune.  FF13 also pretends it has a story, but it does not; there is no consistency in its plot, and new elements introduced regularly contradict those that have already been established.  FF13 pretends to have progression, but all it has is endless hallways for you to walk down in a singular direction forevermore.I've heard tell that FF13 ""gets better"" around the 20- to 30-hour mark.  I would argue that you could spend those 20 to 30 hours playing much better games instead.  I certainly decided to do as much after wasting 16 hours in the vain hope of reaching this promised ""better"" game.  I want my 16 hours back, and I advise you to find better uses for your time than FF13 as well.			"

												If you're not sure about buying this game and you're tired of reading comments such as ""corridor simulator"", I will try to help you out.I recommend this game, even when I wasn't much into it at first. Anyways, it manages to catch you somehow, somewhen. The story is pretty good (in my opinion), as usual in this series. Kind of dystopian. The characters are also great, even if the conversations can be sometimes a bit awkward. But if you're used to watching japanese series you won't be bothered by that at all.About the fighting system, I was reticent but it's got its own style and it innovates. It's much more tactical, of course you can just press A and die of boredom but you can make battles much more interesting. It's up to you. Also, there are some cool challenges in this game, specially that stupid giant green thing (you will know what I'm talking about when time comes).I've played some other FF games and I think this is not the worst, as some other say. It has a lot of good new things and if you're willing to try something new, go ahead. If you keep thinking that old is always better, don't even try and go play FFVII one more time.			"

												English is not my first language so beware, I also suck at writing reviews. You will see.Personally i really enjoyed this game i have played other ff games (X, VIII, XII).Like in any other FF game, it's open world expect for this one. At chapter 11 you finally have an open world which i was waiting for. I't really didn't matter to me that it was linear and straight forward.The combat in the beginning is a bit too easy expect some eidolons.  I had some problems with Shiva, Odin.The story was a bit lackluster but they did explained it later on. Alot of people seem to have some fps drops, I had no fps drops whatsoeverSo i really like the game i am not done with it but i almost finished the game itself.I can understand why people don't like this game, it's something you haven't seen in a while different combat,....Apparently this game has 2 sequels, I haven't played them yet i probably won't ever cause it seems not very interesting for me That's it, if you stick along this far you probably are bored and have to do something with your life. You should have already left this cause there are better reviews about this game.If you are a FF Fan just buy it it's really not that bad			"

												VIsually this game is a masterpiece. As usual Square Enix does a great job there. As for gameplay it's pretty reptitive. You can choose to select the abilities you want to use or just press auto battle and let the game play itself. The strategy is pretty much just rinse and repeat for every boss. I had a hard time liking any of the characters in this game, the only character I really liked enough to care about was Sazh. To make this short, if you like pretty animations and graphical effects then this game does its job there. The story is okay but the gameplay is meh at best. I personally enjoyed this game for what it is.			"

Posted: October 15, 2014
												Wow, where to begin.Final fantasy games seemed to hit a specific trope and stick with it once they started coming to ""next gen"" consoles. When FF7 was released on PSX, we found characters up against a seemingly herculean enemy. And so it goes up until at least FF13-3. This game is no different and seems as though the story of FF games just keep getting recycled iteration after another. Branded by ""gods"" known as Fal'Cie, our group of heroes struggle to cope with what it means to be ""branded"". Apart from the obvious insinuations to humanity and what it means to be a conscious animal, the story unfolds in typical Japanese fashion, where the key to getting out of the existential nihilist framework our heroes have been suddenly thrown into is to courageously fight. And fight they do! Too bad the combat system within which our heroes are controlled is abysmal.For starters, this game mirrors FF12 in that characters are given a set of behavior conditions and the AI acts them out. This game, unfortunately, has truncated that concept and instead of ""conditions"", characters now have ""roles"" and customization comes in the form of paradigms where the user gets to mix and match roles and instead of setting the conditions upon which certain behavior is expressed, the best action is chosen by the AI. Sometimes that doesn't really work out too well. As an example, I was fighting a boss and had set a paradigm with a ""saboteur"". The role sounds exactly like the name; de-buffing enemies. My brilliant character, however, when faced with an enemy with 4 buffs, including haste, took it upon herself to continue to cast ""slow"" instead of ""dispel"". Casting slow will not actually slow the enemy in this game, it will remove haste. Slow will need to be caste twice, in that particular situation, to actually slow the character. Here's the problem: dispel has a 100% success rate, while ""slow"" on the other has a base success rate of 30%. The omniscient AI chose to caste slow TWICE instead of just casting dispel. I have no word (beyond the ones I've just used of course).Another absolute blunder is the stipulation that whenever a user controlled character (the leader) dies, the game is over, even though other characters have the ability to revive dead characters. I don't mind the artificial difficulty this addition brings if it were implemented a little better, but unfortunately, as the game progress and the user is faced with stronger and smarter enemies (oh yes, enemies can and will ""coordinate attacks against a single person""), success starts to hinge more and more on luck until battles start dropping more points with which to level up. So there's a period of about 18 hours (or the first 10 chapters) where success is based on luck because enemies will attack a user controlled character and kill that person. A single enemy has the potential to deal 50% damage in one attack string, so 2 enemies can KO a character within 10 seconds of the start of a battle. Huh? Further, when one is trying to heal, in those clutch situation where actual seconds can work against you, characters take the time to turn and face the character they want to cast a spell on before actually casting the spell even though every spell in the game has homing properties. Oh my jesus.This actually takes a few seconds to complete because characters who aren't physically offensive will stay behind all other characters. Which brings up mobility. Characters move around the battlefield on their own and sometimes walk into AOE spells that they would normally be out of range for if they just stopped moving. Some enemies will cast spells on characters in the back row but if no command is input by the user, the ""leader"" will just start to walk backwards. What? The ATB also hilariously stops when the character is grounded (collapses or is collapsed to the floor). It's an active tme battle, why does it stop? Another wonderful addition is the characters themselves. The voice acting is atrocious. The character development is hilarious and the causes and conditions that would seem to cause character introspection actually do the reverse. Moral certainty is questioned not when a slew of people start dying around this one specific character, but when one little boy questions the intentions of his actions. Are you serious? Part of the reason this game fails so miserably at being an RPG is because none of the characters are relatable. I couldn't find a single character to relate to expect in a few instances where the story stopped being a children’s bedtime story and got ""real"". These characters are killing so many people and animals that they don't even stop to reflect. Independent of whether or not it was in self-defense, they have done things which one could define as ""traumatic"", yet they continue on as if nothing actually occurred, until, suddenly, they can't continue because ""it caught up with them"". The story doesn't really explain why or how because we aren't told what's going in the character's head. One stage a character is fine, then, suddenly, the character isn't but nothing in the external environment has changed. Ok, so what happened? RPG's are about story, so tell us the story.Aside from all that, this is still an RPG with lots of side missions (that occur towards the end of the game) and one can still have fun. For me, I had to let go of the idea that this was a game released by a company that used to be much beloved who came up with a much beloved series. This is just an RPG game that will kill some time as newer games are released and it works as such. In that regard, the game is fine as a distraction, but nothing more. As a FF game, and a game with any kind of depth, it sucks.			"

												The story is a bit weird and complicated, and the plot well.. the plot too. It's quite a depressing storyline and frankly, the uppity-haha-lighter moments that every FF has, are hard to find. Some cringeworthy characters are tossed in the mix, special shoutout to mr. Estheim. I don't want to spoil anything, but this kid has some serious issues, and the others let him get away with it bigtime. Really, his issues are solved for all the wrong reasons. Because of this, whenever I could, he wasn't selected for my battle party.. I am pointing out that Hope Estheim (among others) is a believable annoying character. One you would like to have a seat and talk to, and he starts screaming in your face and it's all your fault and you have to calm him but you can't and the only thing that calms him is to play along with the lie he's been telling himself (BAD MOVE SNOW! Now he thinks he's right, you a-hole). Phew. As for the game(play), it's a Final Fantasy alright! I've played FF5 and up, and it belongs amongst the FF series. The game is for most of the story fixed on a path (as in, no free roam), which deviates from most previous FF's, although in all fairness you couldn't just go freeroaming in most other FF's. The gameplay unlocks very slow, I believe it was chapter 11 of 13 total, where you get to pick your own battle team and set up your preferences. It was chapter 11 that made me realize I actually was playing a Final Fantasy game, broad maps, lots and lots of side dishes, and monsters that snuff you out in seconds. Chocobo's finally make an entrance, and you get an introduction to one of the cooler features: Missions. To be able to wield the best equipment and beat the biggest monsters there is a lot (let me emphasize: A LOT) of grinding involved, which I like. This is on par with other FF's, the endboss of the game is laughable compared to some optional quests (missions) bosses. Next to powering yourself up (crystarium level up system, meh), you get an Eidolon per character. I barely used them at all, they change into vehicles once dismissed and that was something I found stupid (they have legs, some can fly for gods sake, no need for a vehicle). I really miss Ifrit too, although he probably is happy Square didn't turn him in a motorboat or bicycle or trike or whatever. The meat of the game is the grinding part for all equipment (Treasure Hunter trophy isn't for the lazy to obtain, and this is how it should be, some easy trophies and some you have to work for) and the missions. The missions (64 in total) are ranged from easypeasy to how the hell am I going to beat this guy, and the difficulty exceeds the endboss' by far. Which is good, you only unlock the complete power up grid AFTER beating the game and you choose to 'git gud' and go for the mini-bosses and trophies, or choose to be satisfied and quit playing. If you choose to quit, you're missing out on some of the finer battles of the game, as well as the bigger hits and stronger teams (999.999 damage is fun to dish out). So, it's slowwww going, annoying characters (yea every FF has those), weird plot, kind of a serious approach (I actually wouldn't let young kids near this game because of the heavy themes without lighter moments), for endgame there's a good deal of grinding and farming involved and reoccuring FF characters are missing (Wedge, Biggs, Ifrit, etc). Still, I like and I don't know why :).			"

												Final Fantasy XIII isn't all that cool, I guess.You play as Lightning, someone who totally didn't give herself that nickname. Lightning picks up a black guy and embarks on a mission to save her sister who got herself into trouble and, much like my sister, makes it everyone else problem. Unfortunately Lightning is infected with the same cool tattoo problem as her sister and has to do some sort of mission not explained by the big stupid statue that gave her the tattoo and wants her to do said mission in the first place. And so begins the adventure of Not Cloud and her stupid friends who all suck down the world's longest corridor. I think my biggest gripe with FFXIII is that it doesn't really feel like an RPG. Like they wanted to make an action game but last second decided to screw everything up even further. Most of your game is spent in a place called Cocoon, which is a floating continent over a place called Gran Pulse, which is supposedly a hell on...Er. Pulse. Cocoon is actually a pretty neat place with it's own societies, cultures, and customs. The problem is you don't really explore any of these features. Remember how in older Final Fantasy games you would journey from place to place, usually on an over world if you were playing one of the older games? You could find towns, dungeons, and other areas that have absolutely nothing to do with the game, like if you just followed the main story you wouldn't even visit any of these places. So you would discover new areas, meet new people, learn new things, and maybe even find a side quest along the way?FFXIII doesn't have that, it has none of that wonder and mystery that other Final Fantasy settings had before it. Instead, for most of the game you just kind of follow a long corridor that leads you from one cut scene to the other. It's like being stuck at the world's slowest  DMV. And at the rare times when you are around other people they usually just make off-hand comments as you pass them. Even when you end up in a city or something  Like when Sazh and Vanille ended up on Nautilus  you still end up just following a trail until a cut scene plays and the story continues. The most glaring problem with all of this is that there is actual lore and back story to Cocoon and Gran Pulse, the problem is that its just shoved into your datalog as the game progresses. It just tells you that things are happening and there's stuff going on, but you usually don't get to see it for yourself. I don't know if they were trying to appeal to a wider audience or something, but even a wider audience would find all of this bland and boring. The characters are also a big flaw. The only character I actually ended up liking is Sazh, and even then he was just the Old Black Dad character with a bird in his hair. Lightning is about as bland as she looks, and her hostile lone wolf personality she had early in the game almost made me want to turn the game off. She has outbursts and other actual character developments, but they end up being more like moody teenage pouting than character progression. It'd be cute if she could stop trying to be the tough girl for one minute. Snow is like the kid who ate paste in school. Who always calls himself and his friends “heroes” while constantly ♥♥♥♥ing up on a scale that would make an 80's cartoon villain blush. For instance he tries to punch the same character in the face three times, and each and every one of these times he gets knocked on his♥♥♥♥♥with the same move. Three. It's like routine. Hope goes from a whiny baby to an angsty teenager, to a anime protagonist in the time span of about six hours, I can't really say anything bad about his later personality. Fang is Australian and the only reason Vanille seems to exist is to heal my party and make mouth noises. I don't mean talking she just kind of grunts and giggles a lot. Combat feels like a kick in the nuts followed by a bill you have to pay for being kicked in the nuts. You have three options to choose from as well as the paradigm shift, which is a fancy way of saying class change. Instead of having the usual “Attack-Magic-Skills/summons-Item” system like other games you instead have Attack, Attack but this time you get to pick your attack, skill, and item. Auto-battle is the first option, where the game chooses what you use to attack the enemy. Command is where you actually get to pick your attacks, skills has things such as Quake, summon, revive, etc, and items are items. The fighting happens in real time, with your characters attacking when all of their action bars filled or when you press a button to attack with what bars you already filled up. Your best bet is to fill your enemies stagger bar and then break it, the higher percentage the more damage the enemy takes while staggered to that percent. Paradigm shifts come into play when you need something to get the job done. Commandos hit enemies with a folding chair so their stagger meter doesn't deteriorate as fast, they also do the most damage when the enemy is staggered. Ravagers use magic to fill up the stagger meter faster as well as do damage, medics heal, syngerists buff, and saboteurs debuff enemies. You mixed these together to get better results, like 3 ravagers burn through enemies in no time, three medics make sure that nobody flat out dies, and commandos just kind of mug people. This all sounds complicated but it really isn't. Basically you paradigm shift to maintain the stagger, shift to do damage, shift to heal, shift to play basketball, etc. The shifting itself is also kind of stupid, because a little cutscene plays the first time you do it where it has to take a few seconds to show each character change classes. In this time you cant issue commands but the enemy can attack you. So it's kind of stupid when an enemy burns through your HP, you shift to your healing paradigm, but your party takes the time to pose and lose even more HP during. I've actually die because of this. It doesn't help that you only control your main party leader and you just have to hope that your other characters cooperate. Their competent for the most part, but a good number of times I've lost party members or flat out died because my healers refused to heal me and I couldn't handle healing 3 members at the same time. It's also so damn boring. There's no real strategy to it, you just use Libra to find the enemy's weakness and then burn through his health with said weakness. If they have no weakness or all magic damage is halved then you can just fill their stagger anyway, only now it takes longer. There's some variety though, like you can cancel out your attacks and change them mid action if you have to. But that variety is like the dollar menu at a McDonald's.It all looks different but you know its all still made out of homeless people. Should you play Final Fantasy XIII: The Lightninganing? Instead of answering this question, I'm just going to list off a bunch of JRPGs that I liked that came out on the same console generation as Final Fantasy XIII did. Tales of Vesperia.Ni No Kuni: the wrath of the White Witch. Star Ocean, just pick one.The World Ends with You.Valkyria Chronicles.Lost OdysseyXenoblade Chronicles Nier.The Last Remnant. Splinter Cell: Chaos TheoryFire Emblem Awakening.Resonance of FateWhite Knight Chronicles3D Dot Heroand Tales of Xillia.Final Fantasy XIII is 40 hours I will never get back. Mostly because I want to finish games before I review them. It's not abysmal but it's not okay either. If you need to play a Fabula Nova Crystallis game, then just play Type-0. It's better and has a better story. The only way Squreenix can redeem FFXIII is if Lightning becomes my girlfriend. FFXIII gets 4 people saying “Destiny” out of 10.What do you mean theres two more games? The curator is a curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation "

												Great storyline, characters, and gameplay. Would've liked more free roam like in Chapter 11 with the GranPulse missions, a bit too much linear gameplay for my liking. Amazing soundtracks and cinematics, this game is just very aesthetically pleasing. The port was the only real problem, could have definitely been better, but it didn't bother me too much. Playing with a keyboard and mouse was really awkward, so I switched to XBOX 360 controller, and that made the experience a whole lot more enjoyable. The game was ~60GB, which is pretty absurd, but it includes voiceovers in English and Japanese, CG cutscenes, etc. FFXIII was well worth the money. I bought it on sale, but I would've been glad to pay full price for it.			"

												I bought FFXIII several years ago initially, and I got a few hours in then gave up. Once it hit PC, I bought it day one, and the issues persist....I felt like I had to 'force' myself through the game.It is beautiful and the story is decent, but I find most of the characters boring, or frustrating and whiny.Also, as MANY other people have mentioned, the game is way too linear. As an FF game, you expect it to open up at some point, not just one hallway that leads to another that leads to another different looking hallway...The combat mode is also quite boring for me:I am not a fan of controlling one character, and I found Paradigm shifting really, REALLY, boring... I was actually just shifting to offensive paradigms, then looking at something else, and checking back here and there for when I needed to switch to Medic and back...Not my favorite... By far.That said, I hope SE brings more games to PC, and I'll keep supporting them, hoping for more great games in the futre!			"

												Okay. This is DISAPPOINTING. First off, this is totally a LAME port over to PC with unfriendly settings down to the very crucial aspect of all: Graphic options. Just when you thought you have a fancy graphics card to show off and tweak about the settings for it, you can't actually find in anywhere of the game for setting up any freaking 3D performance option.  Worst still, i am using an older graphic card with smaller monitor resolution of 1440x900 (AMD RADEON HD6670), the game appear horrendously surrounded with BIG black borders (in FULL mode). Thus, making the viewable window 50% smaller. Though you are getting niffty graphics as such, but what's the point of showing it in a smaller viewable area with HUGE black border around it? And the fact is, you CAN'T change the bloody resolution to fix this! How cruel is that?Well, putting that aside, there's another BIG problem: Pressing ESC quits the game. Period. Yea. not even a single notification asking you whether is it a confirmed exit? At a point when i was happily into the game and I accidentally pressed ESC thinking that i was jumping out of the menu selection, it totally quited the game for god sake! There goes my game progress! Good job Square Enix for ruining my Final Fantasy moment in PC. This is supposed to be a PC friendly game (that's the point of having a FF in PC rite?) and not just a lame copy-paste port over rite? How could such a big fault in user experience be 'thoughfully' implemented? Apart from that, an even most annoying problem is that, you can't change the voiceover of the game. Yes. It's stuck with Japanese. And the point is, if you didnt turn ON the subtitle, you can't even understand a bit of what they are saying!  Couldn't you make our life easier just by doing great ENGLISH voiceover like what you did with other Final Fantasy port over?! Well, it's a BIG letdown and I can't even start my game with such horrendous first impression. Totally SPOILT my appetite to continue.  To Square Enix, please get it right before you rush it out to the market, it will definitely turn ppl away. I am one of them. And thank you for spoiling my Final Fantasy experience with this!			"

												1280 x 720 fixed resolution, no audio settings, no video settings. A carbon copy of the xbox 360 game, recompiled to play on a PC. It's worth the 15 dollars I spent on it, but if I'd known it would be such a bad port I would not have bought it. I also won't buy any more Square Enix ports until I see their reviews. It's fun, but disappointing in the grand scheme. Do not recommend in its current state.			"

												I have a fairly beefy PC, so my experience may be different than many who complain about the port.  I do get occasional drops in FPS, but it's only momentarily.  This port is completely playable - don't let the negative reviews complaining about performance disuade you.  Game is very entertaining and reminds me of the old FF games I used to play.  Entertaining story so far, I just, unfortunately, hate the voicework for Vanille.			"

												Okay. Let's face it: you've heard quite a bit about this game. ""There's nothing to explore."", ""The characters are garbage."", ""You can just hit 'auto', and it'll play itself.""That's... well, that's pretty much true... if you don't play long enough.From the surface, Final Fantasy XIII looks pretty shabby. And as someone who is playing all the way through for the first time? I'm not really lying when I say that around 20 hours in, I was dragging pretty hard. I stepped away from the game for a while, because it really was ONE hallway after ANOTHER hallway.But if you have the patience to labor through around 25 hours... the game starts to give you more freedom, less cutscenes, and quite a bit to do.After (your mileage may vary) 18 hours or so, the game quits holding your hand, and you can now assign classes to all six of your characters (it's also, conveniently, the first time all 6 characters are in the same room as one another... how's that for building up backstory?). After around another 7 or so hours (YMMV... grinded quite a bit in that 7 hours), you also get to the part of the game that most people are thinking of when they say they like this game: Chapter 11.The game is divided into 13 chapters (Final Fantasy 13... makes sense), and the ""half way point"" of the game is roughly when you beat chapter 9. So when you get a little bit past halfway through the game, you make it to Chapter 11, where you're just plopped into a huge open world to explore. Not only is there main story, but there's roughly 65 (or so... don't know exactly know how many, as this is where I'm at right now in my playthrough) side missions. These range from ""go 20 steps behind you and kill the glowing blue pile of plasma"" to ""go across the gigantic field, head to this optional area, and beat the insanely hard boss at the end"". Your reward? Anything from items, to weapons, to even a double-xp item that makes post-game much, MUCH easier.In this open world, everything goes. When you first start an encounter, you have no idea if you'll survive, or not, as the multiple enemies running around in this open world can be pretty low leveled, or some of the hardest enemies in the game (as believe it or not, story bosses aren't the hardest enemies). This makes it somewhat annoying, but considering a ""game over"" screen kicks you right back to the second before you bumped into an enemy (and gives you around 3 seconds of i-frames to allow you to decide if you want to give it another go or not), you don't lose much if you die. It makes it a low-risk, high-reward game, but considering how long some of these tough battles can be, I don't blame the devs for not wanting to cause too much rage.The game itself has aged extremely well, considering it's initial release (HUGE props to the devs for bringing this game to PC 4.5 years later. it took them awhile, but PC finally got it). The cutscenes still hold their own with a lot of current-age video games. And the gameplay visuals themselves are pretty stunning until you get to the open-world stage, and can actually see the render distance and horizon textures start to show their age. The game doesn't suddenly look horrible, or anything, you can just tell that it's a port of an older console game.-------------------------------Verdict: I recommend... to some people.-------------------------------For those who want to explore more Final Fantasy after playing FFXV, I say ""go for it"". The rest of the series is fantastic, and a lot of the stories in these games are iconic (looking at Final Fantasy IV, VII, and X as the most highly regarded). If you've never played Final Fantasy, this isn't a bad place to start, considering it's availability on pretty much everything but the PS4 (it's no longer on PS Now, I believe).But go in knowing that this part of the series isn't perfect, and Final Fantasy XIII, XIII-2, and Lightning Returns have really divided the fanbase. These games are great, but only if you have the patience to really see the games in their entirety, and not everyone is willing to do that. That, and these 3 games changed too much in some die-hards' opinions, leaving a bad taste in the mouth of the community for everyone involved. Those who praise the game are annoyed by the haters, and those who hate the game are annoyed by those who like it. It's a lose/lose situation.Those who want to explore this game thinking it's like Final Fantasy XV... I don't recommend this game. It's completely different. And Final Fantasy I - XII aren't going to scratch that itch, either. Final Fantasy XV's combat revolutionized the series, and was a major turning point, even from the kind-of-almost-but-not-really related Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn MMO. The over-the-top fast-action from XV isn't here. So if you want more the WORLD of Final Fantasy, check it out. Just don't think it's going to play like XV.			"

Posted: February 3, 2015
												First off, let me start by saying I have no experence with the console ports of this game. That being said, this game is VERY poorly optimized for PCs. Even on my Higher-end PC (i7-5930k, 16 gb ddr4, nvidia gtx 770) I can barely keep this game at a consistant 60 FPS, and that is excusing all the times it would drop BELOW 20 near the end game sections. The most stable way I found to play this game was to go into the Nvidia control pannel and enable tripple buffering, but it would still have issues. All of this asside, Let's get into the actual aspects of the game.Being a fan of JRPGS, this was one of those games my friends would always tell me I need to try. For many years I thought this game would be utter garbage because of all the hate it had recieved, but my friends assured me it was an awesome game. So as soon as I saw it was getting a PC release, I thought now would be a good time to go ahead and give it a try. Was this game as good as i've been told?My first impressions of this game were very mixed, the combat was super easy and required no skill and the game felt like it was just guiding me down one long hallway for hours, and hours. And that is where we see the first problem with this game. Right off the bat this game treats you like you're an unintelligent player who has never played a rpg. Do you get the freedom to explore? no. Do you get to custumize you're skills for what YOU want to be? nope. Insted, you're guided and told what to do to the point where it really feels like you're not doing anything at all. Because of this, it took me a very long time to even get past the first 10 chapters of the game. But my friends kept assuring me to keep playing. After forcing myself to keep going and playing even when I found NO FUN in it what-so-ever, the game finally took me off my leash. Chapter 11 and on is where this game really shines, and let me tell you, it shines bright. The combat get's fleshed out and requires you to not just keep pressing A until the enemy is dead. Now you actually have to start making the correct decks in order to win and know when to switch to them. Chapter 11 should have been the whole game. Hell, Chapter 11-on is long enough to be a game on it's own (It'll take you around 15 hours if you want to just blow through it), But it's not. Insted, they put a 20 hour long TUTORIAL (if anyone argues and says its anything more, you're just wrong). People who argue and say the first ten chapters are to really get you into the story are wrong. The story is so simply for the most part that they could have easily fit it into 3 or 4 chapters and the players would not be as burned out before you get to grand pulse (chapter 11). And that's another thing, the story is a little too simple for my taste, towards the end I did have a little bit of the feels for some of them, but for the most part, I wasn't really engaged. The reason the game is so good in chapter 11 is it turns in to a tradition RPG, but with just the right amount of a modern twist filled with side-quests, exploration, and customizable battle mechanics. You gain the freedom to do what you want and only move on when you feel you want to continue. The combat feels really fluid and engaging. Because of the set up of the mechanics, the combat feels more energetic and exciting. it's a really unique experence that you just need to try for yourself.Just to wrap up, The game wasn't BAD, it just has some MAJOR problems in it's design that REALLY hold it back. I know for a fact that thes flaws are the reason so many people gave up on the game and just auto-matically brushed it off as a bad game. I've heard 13-2 fixed a lot of the issues and i'm looking forward to play through it.Now if I could only rate the game based on chapter 11 and on, I would give it a 9/10But as a whole, it's nothing better than a 6/10Play this game if you have the patients to get through 10 chapters (20 hours) of mediocre gameplay to get to the amazingly sweet end game (15-20 hours). It's kind of like a Tootsie-Pop.			"

												I love  the FF games and although this is not anywhere near my favourite when it was released on console i was looking forward to giving it a full playthough when it came to PC as i never got around to completing it.I WILL NOT BE COMPLETING IT ON PC.My main issue is the resolution setting. I understood that this was going to be a direct console port but sadly i wasnt expecting it to havethe thick black boarder surround that it currently does. (On my monitor its around 2-3inches the whole way around)This makes the game pretty much unplayable as its too much of a distraction. This is then not helped by the lag and screen ripping. My rig can play Battlefield 4, Crysis, Mordor etc all on Ultra hitting a solid 60fps at 1080p and to be honest im not one for the whole FPS arguement, but FF13 shouldnt have been an issue and yet there is lag every 2-3 minutes (especially when ""roaming"") and the ripping effect doesnt help much to this.Please fix Square. I would love for you to bring more Final Fantasys to the PC but not if your are going to do lazy ports like this.			"

												So, I haven't seriously played a Final Fantasy game since 10-2. Played 11 for a few months and 12 for a short time. I thought that 13 would be a good way to get back into the series, especially since it's now on Steam and I haven't had a console for a long time.The graphics in the game (as you'd expect from a modern Final Fantasy game) are breathtaking. All you have to do is look at the screenshots above and imagine those in motion. The visuals aren't a problem one bit. However, the graphical STABILITY is. Even after the patch in December that added ""graphics options"" it still doesn't even run at a stable 30 fps. Combat often dropped down below 20 for me. I know, a lot of people think 30 is ""unplayable"", but this isn't a fast-paced fps. It's not smooth, but it is easily playable.The size of the game on my drive is the biggest reason I nearly didn't buy this. 60 gig? WTF are they loading? Turns out, they didn't do 1 video stream and 2 audio streams. That 60 gig is because you are forced to download both English and Japanese cutscenes whether you want both or not.Combat is mostly fast-paced semi-real-time action. You control only one character (and it takes at least 20 hours into the game before you're allowed to change your combat party) while the other two are controlled by the computer based on the roles you give them. This works out reasonably well since you only need to focus on the actions of one character, though you still have to babysit the other two. Early game combat doesn't really prepare you for later on. Early combat is basically 'press Auto combat to win'. This lasts for 20+ hours. Occasionally there's a boss where you need to use a little bit of strategy.My biggest gripes with the game are the extreme linearity and the horrific grind-fest the game turns into. Once you get to Gran Pulse it looks like the game opens up! I was so excited! Big open areas with monsters for me to fight or avoid as I saw fit. Five minutes later I'm being railroaded through canyons and narrow walkways again.This is also about where it turns into a grind-fest. Shortly before getting to Gran Pulse it unlocks all the roles for each character. You might be thinking that it allows for more variety and customization, which it does, if you're willing to pay a hefty cost for. The first skill in one of the three 'secondary' roles costs 3000 cp (or whatever the points are called) while the final one in the first tier costs 48000. In contrast, the skills for the main roles top off at 8000 for tier 3.This isn't even mentioning weapon upgrading which is probably just as bad if not worse. Each character has what appears to be only about a dozen weapons. You have 4 basic ones which you upgrade and transform into the second level weapons which you upgrade and transform into their final version. For example, I was using the Axis Blade for Lightning. It would take about 23000 points to upgrade it fully. It's secondary form takes 367000, and the final form takes 1.6 million. Doesn't sound too bad until you realize that most upgrade items give less than 100 points each. Even with the multipliers it still would take a hell of a long time.So anyway, my verdict on FF13: Ruined a decent movie by trying to make it a game.			"

												Final Fantasy XIII was never a strong entry with it's confusing plot that treats you like a moron for not knowing what's going on unless you dive into the uninspired journal entries that have you passively reading rather than getting engaged in the game.Naturally with a PC port, one would expect some level of usability, some visual improvements to take advantage of the platform, among other things. Sadly, this doesn't happen. Final Fantasy XIII is a joke. It sits at an unchanging 1280x720 resolution and is capped to 60FPS.There are no video options outside of ""Fullscreen or Windowed"", and the controls are not only touchy but unusable on the keyboard as well.  Performance also seems to have some really strange quirks involved as any reading or writing to disk instantly causes pre-rendered scenes to stutter, though they seem to be sped up to keep up with the 60FPS target. In-game, performance stutters pretty badly, even in combat which is pretty absurd.Aesthetically the game does okay, but considering that my monitor is 2560x1440, having it limited to less than half of the available resolution when other recent games not only look great but perform great at that above-1080 standard, it's disheartening to see this kind of result.50GB to download and install, locked to 1280x720 at 60FPS with strange side effects, dodgey keyboard and mouse input, already on top of a story that I want to finish but feel less than thrilled about in the first place.At least it's cheap?

												There's not much to say about this game that you probably have not heard before, but here goes.First, the story is weak. I have tried multiple times (on different platforms) to get into this game and I cannot. I suffered through 20+ hours on the PS3 to finally give up. I will say that I have definitely played games with far worse stories, but there is no motivating factor to keep me going.Second, I hate the characters. I can overlook poor stories if the characters are good. Unfortunately, I also found the characters to be very bland. Outside of Lightning, the cast was forgettable.The gameplay was alright once I got used to it so no points off there. I will cut it off there and give it a 4/10.			"

(so it blocks your views on other stuffs like web or whatever)Controls - It's fixed, you only can change few buttons if you play with keyboard so you have to suit to it or get a controller!Gameplay - It's too linear or close as it only is in a fixed map for most of the time. (old FF games allow you to go everywhere or lost in the quest when you are done with introducton)Cutscenes - They are awesome for me, some people might feel it reduces the gameplay.My advice:Wait for discount + all audio options to be available to both region copies then only you buy it ~			"

												Here's something you have to realize about this game: Yes, it sparked debate and controversy and a fair bit of backlash from fans. Now, most of this was warranted, yes. Nomura and Square Enix took some risks with Final Fantasy XIII and some were better recieved than others. For example, Linearity. The linear nature of this game was the cause of a lotof backlash. And, frankly, it  is  really linear. In fact, a fair bit of the first twelve chapters will be spent walking down a pretty, dressed up corridor. That's undeniable. Once you get to Gran Pulse, however, the game world really opens up, and it becomes much better in that respect. Another source of backlash was a mediocre story and shallow, unlikeable characters. This isn't easily fixed, was never fixed, and returning characters continued to be unlikeable throughout the FFXIII series (which in itself was another issue.) But  there is also a lot to love about this game. For one, the Paradigm Battle System is one of my personal favorite battle systems of all time. It's fast, fluid, and the range of Paradigms makes combat feel fresh each time. Keep in mind that this system didn't really shine in the grindier fights or the standard enemy fights. This sytem  really  shined during the big boss battles. Another great thing about this game was the music. Christ, the music of FFXIII is some of the best in the series, if not in all of gaming. Nobuo Uematsu knows how to make music and certainly knows how to convey emotion through his orchestra. And, I mean, c'mon. Sazh. How could you not love Sazh. Plus, this game's environments, while restrictive, were (and still are) absolutely stunning. This is a very pretty game, even six years later.  Can't wait for the 1080p patch or inevitable mod. One last high note is the lack of port issues, at least as far as I've gotten, which is only to the Pulse fal'Cie. Unlike previous ports, this one seems to have no issues, aside from the inability to play in fullscreen, though that could be an issue on my end. In all, while this game has some flaws, and has been exaggerated as one of the worst Final Fantasy games of all time, it still deserves your time and money, because despite what some say, it's a brilliant game.

												I've read a few reviews and frankly I am surprised this has gotten any possitive feed back at all. I cannot see what anyone would possibly see in such a terrible game... I have various reasons for disliking it, cheif among them that I am a Final Fantasy fan since NES and this is just simply put, a boring game. Although I've only played a bit of this game I can say simply that there is very little to offer here. The battle system is rediculously boring. You can get by the entire game just pushing X. You have control over only one of your character in the party as well which takes away from the game. Your ""members"" in the party are basically NPC's that add AI support. If you just choose the ""auto-battle"" option it will generally apply the skill or ability best suited to the situation and layout of enemies. That is like doing someones homework for them. Sure its easy and quick but you won't get a damn thing out of it. I prefer a game where you actually have to think for yourself...Also, the dialog is very very poorly written. For example, in the beginning of the game, Snow Villiers gets support from some citizens that want to help fight. They don't want to sit back and do nothing, alright, I get that. But there is a mother who gets up to recieve a gun and fight, and when she does her son says, ""Mom, wait!"" and all she says is that it will be ok. And when she gets her gun all she says is moms are tough and gives her son an unconcerned look.... what parent, knowing they might die or live doesnt so much as say goodbye to their kid? It completely took away from the impact of her death later because of how poorly written that entire scene was. Like... normally stuff like that would get me choked up, like in Mass Effect 3 when Shepard sees a transport carrying a kid she failed to save explode. That actually made me cry because of how it was written, it makes a big difference. Also, this game is so poorly compressed it's a joke. Just shy of 60 gigs is a rediculous amount for an MMORPG, why the hell is a 1p game that large? Coming from someone who plays only PC games, this title is not pretty enough to warrent such a large game file. Why is it so big? *shrug* The only thing I can say that countradicts the bad things I've heard about this game is that the story really isnt as confusing to me as it seems to have been for many people... and I barely got through the beginning of the game. The premise reminded me of a FF7 rip off the way the world was made. And the fact that Lightning is an ex-""soldier"" who appears to be against the government now. If you are planning to buy this game, DON'T! It isa waste of money for a boring, easy game with terrible writting. I didn't get into the game long enough to really get into any of the characters either, but I can say they are all very unimpresive. None but the black man witha chocobo in his fro even stand out in my mind... and I hated that character. I hope this prevents someone from wasting their time with this FF. It's sad but Final Fantasy is all but dead in my opinion. It seems that ever since they changed from square soft to square enix, they have just been failing in the game market.			"

												So, this game surprised me. After all the bad things I heard about it, I decided to give it a shot nonetheless. During the first 10 hours of the game, I actually HAD fun. The combat, repetitive at it is, was actually fun and the story was interesting. But then things went wrong somehow. So, I came to this point of the game where I'm being repeatedly throw into fights with annoying and unforgiving enemies. Literally, I was fighting like 6 enemies at the same time and, as much as I like to win, winning these fights just makes me wonder if I should be doing something else with my time. Then the story... Jesus Christ, this game actually had an interesting story. Then, it seems like the writers decided to start making no sense at all. I mean, I can forgive a bad story if the gameplay is really good. Unfortunately, FFXIII fails to deliver. I only bought this to actually promote more Final Fantasy games in the PC but if this trend of FF games continue to come out, I'll have to say goodbye to this franchise. This is not a good Final Fantasy game. Hell, this is not even a good game at all. I'll just finish this game (or at least try to) to make myself feel that I got my money's worth back. But damn, not doing so well in that regard so far. Careful if you wanna buy this game. Make sure you actually know its limits.			"

												I'm not gonna complain about computer compatability, I think those reviews are useless. I want to know about the game. So here it is.What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? It looks pretty, but the combat gets boring pretty fast. It's more linear in a bad way then the rest of the final fantasy games, and the story isn't as engaging, It's fun enough to play for a little bit, but as I sit on chapter nine, i just can't find myself wanting to continue to play the game. Unless the Final fantasy titles start getting back to thier roots, I think this game makes me not want to play any that might be released after. I just can't keep playing this like I could Final fantasies 1-9.			"

												First, my specs:Windows 7 Home Premium (x64)Intel i3-2120 processor @ 3.30 GHz8 GBs of RAMNVIDIA GeForce GTX550TiNow let's compare that to the recommended set-up provided by Square-Enix:Windows Vista/7/8 Intel Core 2 Quad (2.66 GHz)/AMD Phenom II X4 (2.8 GHz) processor 1 GB RAM NVIDIA Geforce GTX 460/ATI Radeon HD 5870 Despite the fact that I exceed the recommended requirements by a wide margin, this game still struggles to maintain a consistent framerate with or without the Durante fix. The audio also skips every now and then, mostly during visually intense sequences. Further tweaking would be for naught, as the tweaks I've made had little to no influence on the game's performance. I'm not the only one experiencing such issues either--plenty of people with much more powerful hardware are experiencing similar problems. As such, I can confidently attribute this game's erratic performance to poor optimization on the part of Square-Enix.In it's current state, I cannot recommend the PC version of Final Fantasy XIII. While it's perfectly playable (controls are decent on either joypad or keyboard and mouse, despite their respective lack of rumble and sensitivity settings; it's also more fun than the naysayers will have you believe), it's full of audio/visual stuttering, takes up a massive amount of hard drive space, and is locked to 720p by default. If you can put up with the poor performance of this port, do yourself a favor and wait to pick it up when it inevitably goes on sale.Hopefully Square-Enix learns from the poor reception of this port and decides to put more effort into their XIII-2 and Lightning Returns ports.

												Game is far from perfect and is suffering from some issues like the linearity, a pretty mediocre/bland story and some characters being needlessly annoying among some other minor ones. And with the port to PC: The lack of any graphical options.Outside of those issues, the game is still very much enjoyable. Spectacular vistas combined with a great soundtrack, a very enjoyable battle system and fun gameplay results in a game that you will sink quite a few hours in. Along with the low price, it's a great purchase.Here's to hoping future games in this series won't suffer from bad porting decisions.			"

												NOTE: This review is coming from a pretty much non-gamer guy/ dont' care much about Final Fantasy/ Small-time RPG fan/ bought the game because the characters looked hot. I'm not a 'review' guy, so the format and everything is going to be casual. I intend to create this review for people that are like me. (check out the note section above.) I will be mainly aiming at the negatives to help you guys decide easier.- Honestly, I'm not into aliens and robots AT ALL.  This game unfortunately has an extremely 'Robots everywhere' theme, but it's my thing, if you like robots and stuff like that, this might not be your issue. - Before getting the game, I've heard a lot about the combat system. After I played it myself, I really enjoyed the combat system a lot. I did actually clap in front of my monitor 10 times for the game. I think this game gave me the best first impressions ever, even with all the robots and other childish♥♥♥♥♥shit, I really liked the game. - The graphics are great, but this port has quite some fps issue, I do mind a bit, but nothing unplayable. - Recommend playing with controller, comfy couch, good food, and a nice household. xx THINGS I DON""T LIKE xx (Extremely personal preferences.)- The robot-super-japanese-fantasy theme.- Map design is quite lazy in my eyes. It reminds me a lot of Phantasy Star on PSP(most boring game I've ever played), the maps are really boring. It's like walking in a straightline, with some robots waiting for you to fight them.- Not many customizations. (Maybe it's FF's thing, this is my first Final Fantasy.)- The combat system, as much as I really love it, gets mundane after a while. .................................Final Thoughts:I LOVEEEEE THIS GAME, despite all the things I don't like as mentioned above, the gameplay really did justify everything, and made me quite emotionally invested in this game. I love it, but the decision is yours... "

												I played FF7 to death... twice! It was a really great game and while time constraints resulted in having to restart several months after my innital attempt, the game stood up to a second run through...... Final Fantasy XIII doesn't even make a first run. The combat is too repetative, the monsters are not inspiring, and gone is the turned based stratagy game, replaced instead with a combat design where the NPCs choose thier own attacks based upon their combat stance.  It's fun for a while but the combat seems removed and I'm spending most of my time watching the stats bar and switching between modes rather than enjoying the game.I've deleted FFXIII from my list and although I would very much like to enjoy a final fantasy game again, for now I'm going to place it in the box labelled ""Must do better"", and take another look at where things have gotten to in another decade.

												It's a decent, if lacking port. Personally, I've enjoyed it thus far, but I'd really like for some more graphics options. If you're a stickler for that stuff, wait for a patch (that might not come). If you want to enjoy yourself, keep an open mind, and pick this up. Give it a chance. Even if the first 25 hours are a hallway, it's the most beautiful hallway you've ever seen. There's plenty of posts online that read into the symbolism of the linear progression, and you can take those as you will, but the game remains a soid experience mechanically.			"

												If you are lagging/stuttering on the cut scenes, try connecting a game pad controller. IDK why it removes the stuttering for me. I just found this solution  here I'm using my PS3 as a controller for this game. Just downloaded MotionJoy DS3 tool something to emulate the Xbox game pad.Well this MAY BE the SAME reason about the fps.Nicolas Guérin said that part of the decision to lock the framerate had to do with giving the game a ""cinematic gloss,"" which was already hard enough to emulate at 30 frames per second. ""I don't think it was a good idea because you don't gain that much from 60 fps and it doesn't look like the real thing. It's a bit like The Hobbit movie, it looked really weird.""Alex Amancio, says that 60 frames per second is excellent for first-person shooters, but not all that great for action adventure titles. He added that 30 frames per second ""feels better"" and allows the developer to ""push the limits of everything to the maximum.(Talking about AC Unity) Source  [www.gamespot.com]I don't really care about the graphics. Just wanted to be a part of my steam game/s collection.Anyway I have played this before on my PS3 like 2 years ago and I guess I just wanted to try it here in PC.These are the specs of my PC.CPU: AMD Phenom II X4 BE 3.0ghzGPU: ASUS GeForce® GTX 650 Ti RAM: G.SKILL Ripjaws Series 8GB (1333mhz)Its a bit old and low-end these days, but can still run the game smoothly.

												Let me open my review by stating that I am a big fan of this game. Yes, you read that right, I'm a big fan, but I'm not recommending the game. I've played around 100 hours on PS3, and I've reached Gran Pulse at the time of this review, and have spent about 20 hours on this version at the time of writing.The combat system is fast-paced and cinematic, and requires good strategy to do well. I've never been a person for story, so I can't comment on that. The game is a good length for the price you pay.However...This game is quite possibly the worst port I have ever played.Let me mention all the problems that come to mind right now:-Locked to 720p-Awful framerates, despite me having far higher specifications than recommended.-Pressing ESC immediately forcequits the game without a prompt. (There is a prompt if you're playing windowed)-Absolutely no graphical options at all.-You're forced to download the Japanese voices, whether you want to use them or not. This adds a lot to the size of the game and makes it take far longer to download than it should.-Graphical glitches in cutscenes: In one cutscene, Vanille's hair didn't render at all, and Sazh was invisible. Odin completely failed to render in the Eidolon fight, too. I was fighting against an invisible Odin.-The HUD is the most framerate intensive part of the game. When I disabled it, my framerate shot up. Unfortunately, playing battles without the HUD is kinda....impossible....That's all I can think of right now. I think the game is great, but it is definitely not worth the asking price right now for how awful a port it is. Wait until Square fixes the port. (I really hope they're actually going to try fix this...thing).If you must play the game, I highly recommend you go check out Durante's fix with GeDoSaTo. It fixes the resolution issue, at the very least. None of the other framerate fixes have made a difference to me, so I can't recommend any of those.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go back to playing this awful port. Or maybe I won't. I really don't have any desire to play at 15 FPS anymore.			"

												Loved this game, but it has issues that might clash with those who are big into classic Final Fantasy RPGs. The game is extremly linear, but that is common in more modern RPGs. The story however is epic. It is one of the best stories of a Final Fantasy game since FFVII. They did change the way battles are done, to real time from turn based which is a mixed bag in my eyes. It is a different element, but it has down sides also. One is that you have a main hero, who if dies you who team dies. I also feel this game made Eidolons kinda worthless, which is one of the main aspects of the game and me main gripe.Pros:-Beautiful story-Beautiful Graphics-Interesting characters as usual-Real time battles make the game feel fresh and more fast paced.-Decent length story, much longer if you do all the optional missions.Cons:-Eidolons feel like they have less purpose as I can beat the game using them only once or twice often not even using them on main bosses.-Real time battles can be frustrating and harder to use tact and you have less control over the characters and only control the role of them in predesignated paradigms. The only character which you have specific control over is your party leader (which is hard give specific commands as the battle is real time)- Unlike in games like FFVII if your party leader dies you lose the battle. Whereas in other FF gams I have played if the party leader died you could ressurect him/her.-very linear-instead of finding your ultimate weapon you ""craft"" it. This was painstakingly LONG and rediculous.-You can ""upgrade weapons"" also, which is odd since your old weapons can literally be made better than end game weapons powerwise. In a way it feels more like the weapons are less about dmg, than their abilities.All in all I like the series, but it has many pluses and minuses. Most of the minuses are either things I have gotten used to with other modern RPGs doing the same or they are outweighed by the pluses. I would say my main gripes are the Eidolons being so weak and the weapon powerup system making end game weapons that are not ultimate weapons feel like they are weaker than upgraded tier 1 weapons.

												This game is worth your time if you are a JRPG fan, but it is far from perfect.As nearly everyone else has said, the game is VERY linear. There is no level design to speak of. The locales are more or less hallways through some interesting backdrops. That being said, the story and combat are good enough that the world can be ignored.The combat in this game is some of the most fun I've had with an RPG. The paradigm system encourages tinkering to find the right way to approach each battle. Most RPGs with tinkering and a huge amount of menu navigation I find tedious, but FF13 strikes the right balance between 'in depth' and 'easily approachable'. The tinkering feels like a puzzle, where you are looking for the right pieces, and it's rewarding when you breeze through a boss that was kicking your butt after some party adjustments.The story is good and the characters are all unique and interesting. They get thrown together unwillingly and butt heads often in the begining. Throughout the game, their backstories and motiviations are revealed, and they slowly come together as a team. You come to like all of their unique personalities. If you ever get lost in the story there is a datalog that recaps everything which is very useful.The PC port is kind of crappy, but give it a shot. Took me about 50 hours to beat.			"

												a long awaited port from a PC gamer (and JRPG lover) like me!not yet finished this game (still on Chapter 11), but i can definitely say it's a good game! :)beautiful FMVs, a brave heroine, a good story.things i dislike are:1. from the 1st chapter till 10th (if i'm not mistaken), you can't really control your party, the party leader and member are fixed member, that's weird for me.2. also, there's no sense of RPG freedom till chapter 11! it's a bit long for me to wait. all the chapters before it, have a specific path with no side missions etc.3. a little bit confused with many of the words used, i.e. c'ieth, l'cie, fal'cie, pulse, gran pulse, cocoon,sanctum, vestige, sometimes i need to take a step back to digest it all. stupid me, lolbut again, still a very good RPG from Square Enix!

												Let me start off, first and foremost, that there are control bugs in this game that, based on a google search, multiple people have that grind your gears quite a bit: sometimes randomly your mouse will stop working, or the 'w' (moving forward, going upward in selection menus) will be turned on non-stop without you actually touching it, causing you to unplug and replug and unplug and replug and unplug etcetc your mouse- and keyboard port for quite a while before it knocks it the♥♥♥♥♥off. I do have a wired xbox 360 controller, but the port is weird: my computer detects and uses it fine, until I start final fantasy, after which my computer miraculously doesn't recognize the xbox controller anymore to the point where i couldn't use it anymore. Maybe the latter is a problem with my own computer, I don't know.For the cons:- the game is supremely linear, I mean every final fantasy game is linear, but for instance in FFX or FFXII you had this open world kind of thing where you moved around and went as you please. In here it's a map, you never really decide where you're going, you're just following and moving forward on one street. At least it's like that from the point where I'm at, haven't finished the game yet. I really miss being able to walk inbetween mountains and explore a little bit before eventually moving to the next checkpoint, whereas in here you really... can't exactly go anywhere else other than where you're supposed to.- I dislike the weapons upgrading system. Once you've upgraded a weapon, you can't see the base stats, making a comparison between your current lv15 weapon and a newly found lvl1 weapon a little weird. Basically I didn't know wtf to spend my resources on without googling it.Other than that:Great game, good story, not as mind♥♥♥♥ing as FFX for instance but still with enough gaps to keep you interested. Combat is actually rather nice, although the battles last pretty long. The characters are, as far as I can tell, pretty likeable  and 'natural' in all. Giving it a recommend, although it is by far not one of the best FFs out there.			"

												After putting over 100 hours into this game, and obtaining 100% of the achievements, I can whole heartedly recommand this game to anyone and everyone. This is a fantastic representation of what an RPG should be. The plotline carries this game extremely well, and the combat system almost never gets tiring with the introduction of the paradigm system. Overall this game is very well put together, while the steam port was initially awful, the rescent bug fixes and patches have made it a fantastic experience. This continues the legendary Final Fantasy series with upmost of honors. 10/10			"

												While the version of the game might be better on PS3, it was very unpleasant on PC.I've a read a few other reviews and I don't seem to share some of the same problems they have like the black bars and crashing. I can comment on one issue I had and that was the controls stopped responding to my commands after a few hours of playing. I wouldn't be able to ALT+TAB out of the game and sometimes I would have to rely on it to get my controls back, at which point they would continually scroll through menu options making selection a timing-based thing. This was particularly horrible during battles and swapping paradigms. Since the game has been out for a long time I will be brief in my review.Pros: + Good English Voice Acting - I didn't know you could play it in Japanese, but I don't particularly want to hear a Japanese guy voice a black guy.+ Good Music - I owned the soundtrack before owning the game, so I played a vast majority of the game in silent minus the cutscenes. + The Paradigm System - Once you can unlock swapping team members, the possibilities for battle styles becomes interesting and a lot of fun.+ The Crystarium - The game, as a JRPG, is obviously going to be grindy in a way and the Cyrstarium makes you feel like you're getting results from mindless battles.+ Rendered Cutscenes, and Character Portraits - Great art and attention to detail. Characters are expressive and it's nice to watch the cutscenes.+ Lots of Lore - Kind of necessary to explain some backstory when the names for the entities in the game are so stupid.+ Upgrades and Disassembly of weapons and accessories - Pretty cool system but it feels like I'm throwing a lot of items at something and it only gets a little bit better.Neutral:+ Linear Paths and Gameplay - If you don't want to think, this game's map is good for that. Go down every path the NPCs don't is my general rule.Negatives (oh man, and are there ever negatives):+ The ♥♥♥♥♥iest camera ever - Like it really just sucks major♥♥♥♥♥♥ There's no visual feedback to let you know that the camera can't be turned in certain areas and it defaults to an awful location. Its turning speed is incredibly slow and you can't change its settings except for inverting its axis. + Defaulting to Auto-battle can just make battles ""Press Enter To Win""+ Grinding gets significantly less effective in a short amount of time - Enemies offer less CP and abilities cost a LOT more. + You can't freely move in battle - Which may seem obvious, but characters just wander around as they please and can get hit by AOE spells at low health.+ No option to turn off animations for changing Paradigms - At first it starts of by focusing on each character and this ACTUALLY TAKES TIME IN BATTLE. While you're transforming, someone can die and you're basically ♥♥♥♥ed.+ Can't control other members in battle+ When your Leader dies, it's game over - Even though other characters can learn to raise other team members from death!+ Bland characters+ Sometimes difficult to understand map - Trying to find Marks to hunt and I can't figure out where they're meant to be.+ Characters can't actually walk straight - They default to North on the minimap, but the map actually starts turning slowly while walking so you start walking diagonally in hallways. + Limited settings interactionThe list could go on, but I can't really think of anything else at the moment. This game reminds me of Ni no Kuni but it sucks as a port. I'd play it as a PS3 game, but not as a PC game. I'm going to stick with it and its sequels just because I've come this far.			"

												I haven't played the PS3/X360 version when it came out so long ago so when it released on PC (and went on sale for $6) I had to give it a shot.Warning, FFXIII does have a bad reputation for being linear (it really is except for pretty much one chapter, 11 if you want to know...), but I really did enjoy the story and the battle system. The game takes a while to reach its stride, the true battle system isn't unlocked until Chapter 3, and up until that point, battles are pointless and albeit a bit tedious. And like classic JRPGs, you're in for a lot of cutscenes.If you're not a fan of JRPGs or if this is going to be your first, I honestly wouldn't recommend this game to start unless you're a stickler for storylines and character development (I know I am so perhaps I'm a bit biased here). For most of the game, it's a lot of running towards the goal mark while making slight detours for treasure orbs. That said, I am a fan of the Final Fantasy series and I truly enjoyed this game.Is it the best Final Fantasy? No. Would I recommend this game to everyone? Also no.I think this game is sadly made for a few choice groups of people. Maybe not even the Final Fantasy fans over the ages. I've played my share of FF games and came into this one with an open mind, and I adored the story (it does get a bit confusing in the beginning with flashbacks throughout to fill in the gaps, later it will make sense) and the gameplay. The leveling system reminded me sort of the leveling system in FFX albeit unique for each role and character instead of one giant thing.If you're familar with JRPGs and you don't mind a linear world, definitely give this game a shot. If not, you might want to try other FF games first.			"

												It was quite challenging to me to decide, how to rate this game after i beat it to the end. As this is my first Final fantasy game, I was really thrilled and astounded with its beginning. This game has really nice and impresive visuals, glamorous world and developed characters. I have really enjoyed about the first 40 hours of a gameplay stuck deep with it. To this point everything perfect for me. Quite a lot of people wrote a negative reviews about the engine performance, which haven't occured when i played (stuttering, lagging, crashes, unresponsive controller and such) - everything worked nicely on my 3 years old notebook (2.3 Ghz, Radeon HD 5650 1GB, 4GB ram - using XBOX 360 controller) on 108p0. I have felt some framerate drops during really graphicaly challenging sceenes with many spells blazing, but still most of a time really playable with decent FPS (30-40 FPS -> Yeah it is not that trendy 60FPS, but still really good,ey? :D)But after those cca 40 hours came a big downside of a game. Massively repetetive fighs, same enemies started to bore me a lot. A LOT...There i decided I really dont want to strive for all achievments (what would take about another 40 hours of repetetive grinding) and rushed to a finish....That is quite sad, because it quite ruined the game for me after that nice time i have spent with it. The last 2 hours were really teeth grinding and needed full will to not trash the game and finished after i have spent so much time with it. + Outro is really great :DSo at the end it was 50/50 between recomendiing this game or not, but still i have enjoyed longer time than i didn't, so after a long decision I recommend the game....I think many people will really like it but my tip is : Dont grind too much (as it is not really needed (I have easily finised with my Specs and Equip in middle level (LVL 2 items-some not fully upgraded and crystalarium in about lvl 8), with only 3 hours of pure grind (and even there i was slopy :D) and enjoy the game as a story takes you or you may get in similiar situation of bored gamer and that might ruin your game.STORY: 8/10 - Story is great, but some strange twist and the prolonging (for boredom to me) sometimes strikes it down. Still, in a basics I have enjoyed the storytelling.Graphics : 10/10 - Nice for 3 years console port and the settings, artworks and such is realy beautifullSOUND : 6/10 - There are some nice pieces but i found some soundtrack tittles really out of the place for a given situation. Also the sounds used in fights are quite similiar to each other and after a few hours of listening to them over and over again they got quite annoying.GAMEPLAY: 3/10 : Quite a lot said in a review...inovative (for me as a newbie in JRPG) at first, really borring and headbashing after some time. Of course you can swich to different charracters, change the style but at the end, it is still the same over and over again.TOTAL 6/10			"

												I played this game on the PS3 version. PS3 version is better. This game is by far the worst port than COD: Ghosts. You can't change resolution,720p locked. Fps dropping 30 when battling or during cutscenes. Seriously?! Square Enix?! How Disappointing!Save your money, people! Don't end up like a victim who's expecting the game to be good!Edit:Finally, they decided to place a patch on graphic options. Patch will release on December. (Switched Rating to Good.)			"

												As much as I enjoy Final Fantasy as a serie, I don't think it is a good reason enough to pay twice for a game I already own. However, let me explain why I bought it twice! (PC and Xbox 360) Refer to the rating/ Pros and cons to know whyFirst, I would love to specify that it was not a Steam Gift, gifted by a friend or something, I made the purchase at full price. On thus lets go!I do not mind the Battle System as much as other people! In fact I believe it is quite a challenge to understand at first but then once you get the hang of it, you can play it really strategic.The game's progression is chapter-based and in most chapters, the player will see the story through different characters' view. Players can move around the field map while controlling the party leader, the other members moving independently, sometimes running ahead, engaging in dialogue, or stopping to look at objects on the field and pointing things of interest out to the party leader. Other party members being far away from the leader does not affect their participation in battles that take place in a separate module. Players can jump, but only at specific jump spots marked on the map. Enemies will appear on the map and battles initiate when coming into contact with them. Treasure chests cannot be opened in close proximity to a monster, and there are several instances enemies are ""guarding"" treasures and must be banished to collect the loot. Shrouds can be used to move about the field without triggering enemy encounters, and to bestow the party with buffs prior to the battle's start.Pros Beautiful Visuals, including a variety of open world maps and areas to explore for hours Chocobos, obviously Strategic battle system including sort of classes Amazing Story telling, easy to fall in love with each and every details of it. (Exclude characters)Cons Hard to feeling attached to the characters during the first entry of the game The skills and stats unlock/system is a tiny bit too simple Not enough chocobos It is the first game of a trilogy.  Rating Rate/10   Visuals 9/10   Playability 9/10   Story 8/10   Characters 5/10 Would I recommend this game? The answer is Yes!However, make sure you have a good 40 hours(If you skip a lot of stuff) to spend.			"

												For this being the first Final Fantasy game I've ever gotten into, it's been fantastic so far. If you're new to the series, there's no need to play any previous installments because it's a fresh, dank and brand new story. This game is well priced, and it's HUGE. The game exceeds 50 GB and it packs hours of  gameplay in there. The cinematics are great, and are balanced with gameplay in a way where you won't be waiting tens of minutes between getting to play. Hell, the intro to the game is short, yet gets its point across very easily. The battle system is great, and requires you to actually think most of the time rather than mindlessly mashing the ""OK"" button to spam the same attack.As for the story of the game... It's amazing. The characters are all unique and very fun, and I thought it was very clever. I don't want to spoil anything, so I reccomend watching someone's playthrough on the game, or just play it for yourself.[9.3 / 10]   ""Hella addictive. Give it a try, for sure.""			"

												A nice game with very good graphics.Sadly does not reach its predecessors. The characters range from annoying to neutral, the grind is real and i still have no idea how you should get enough Gil to buy some of the upgradeitems without a really massive grind.To be a little more specific:The combatsystem is fast. Way too fast do make some decisions in combat, not counting the paradigm-switch.If you want to have a high rating, dont even try to switch to something that isnt all out damage and even then you often enough only get a max of 3 stars.And since the combat is so damn fast you can rarely appreciate what you actually do and see. The camera flies over the battlefield and confuses more then it helps. You have no way to position you're party which makes them eat a lot of AoE. There a some way older games that did it way better (take a look at Grandia).The Characters didnt really grew to me. Most of the time i wished they would shut up or just disappear. Especially the youngest member of the cast.The Story is ok, but for me it isnt something much to remember. Same with FF 12. I played through it, but cant really remember what happened at the end.As a summary:If you see this game on sale and you like RPGs give it a try by all means, but dont expect it to reach the level of a FF 6 or 7. Even FF 10 was way better then this.			"

												Final Fantasy XIII is the first entry in the Fabula Nova Crystallis series (similar to the Compilation of FFVII). This essentially makes a sub-franchise of the FF series, where this series in particular has multiple games all clumped up together with the same mythology, but with different stories all together. I remember way back when they first teased this game in 2006; I believe at E3. It was pretty big news for Final Fantasy in general, so when this game finally came out it was hyped up a lot for being the next main installment in the FF franchise. This FF in particular has a very unique concept and setting overall. Among the other FF this takes the trophy for being the most Sci-fi-esque one. Comparing this to FFX, FFXII, or even FFVII this one is incredibly futuristic as seen in the trailers, which may turn you off a little from the traditional medieval setting that FF used to be known for. Nonetheless this game proves to be very beautiful, and divergent from the rest of the games in it's own little way. A lot of FF games age pretty well, but after 6 years this game still shines bright among other modern titles.The game starts off very user friendly if you will. About the first 8-9 chapters of this game can be considered a tutorial for the entire game, which is actually quite disappointing since there's only 13 chapters total. Square Enix was playing it perhaps to safe this time, and wanted to appeal to a more broader audience because compared to other FF's this one is the easiest, and the most linear even moreso than FFX. In a way I appreciate how painless the game can be on your first playthrough, but there're parts where you feel like gouging your eyes out because of this certain boss. Some of the enemies you engage do require atleast some sort of skill, which leads to the battle system. Square created a new system called ATB, which essentially voids the old FF turn-based gameplay mechanics for what it was originally known for. You can view this as a positive or negative thing, but imo it made the game easier than it should of been. Some people will say that it's a boring mechanic and express that by saying all you do is button mash ""auto-battle"" endlessly thus resulting in an automatic win. Now I won't say that they're wrong because they're in fact right in many occasions. I'm pretty adamant that you can finish this game's story by just doing that, however if you decide to complete the extracurricular activities; you will indeed find yourself in a more traditional JRPG FF of grinding and lvling up. Unfortunately a lot of the side quests won't open up until later in the game. If you're a person who just wants to play the game, and not care about the story than this game will not satisfy your needs until you progress through the story, which can be enjoyable or not depending on yourself. A battle team consists of 3 people. Only 1 character is assigned to you in a battle whom you control, while the other 2 are controlled by AI. However you are able to change your character in between battles, but you will find yourself only using 1-3 for the sake of strategy. This brings us to the story of FFXIII, which is arguably very cliche yet imo very interesting and distinct among other games in general. Linearity was this games biggest problem, so you will find yourself being shoved tons of exposition down your throat 24/7, which some of us may enjoy. I personally didn't care as much because I found the concept of it very intriguing. You got 6 main characters: Lightning, Snow, Sazh, Hope, Fang, and Vanille. Serah is another character who sort of has a role in this game, but you never play or control her. Lighting is the essential main character who was posted on promotional art. She's a strong individual who's stoic, humble, lacks humor, and resembles a soldier of an army. Snow is your average wannabe hero, but lacks intelligence and can't face facts. Sazh is the comic relief racial diversive character. Hope is your annoying little brat who later develops into a stronger individual. Fang is much like Lightning, except much softer to her friends, and has humor. Vanille is your average annoying waifu little teenage girl from anime who's oblivious to everything. I must say that some of these characters are weak, but they all end up being solid ones in the end. I never found myself utterly annoyed by any of the characters except maybe Hope.The main plot of the game is rebelling against the gods of the world, while creating/fighting for your own destiny. The 6 of the characters all end up meeting each other, and are given the same fate from the gods known as the Fal'Cie. The Fal'Cie turn the 6 humans into L'Cie, which basically makes them a demigod. They're given magic powers like summoning eidolons such as Bahamut and Odin. The people of their world (Cocoon) fear another world called Gran Pulse (the world beneath them...Literally). Cocoon is a planet that floats above the world of Gran Pulse, which is a wild land that consists of wild-life, and titan-like beings. The people of Cocoon have this irrational fear of an invasion from Gran Pulse, which is where our game begins. The story can be a little confusing because of the terminology they use to refer to the mythology, but if you can wrap your head around all of that; it becomes very clear.I personally think the best thing about this game is the soundtrack. Final Fantasy has always been known for their OST's, but this one blew me away. Nobuo Uematsu has always been known to be the composer for most of the FF's, but XIII had a brand new composer Masashi Hamauzu who did an amazing job. It has the right amount of instruments that create a soothing blend of euphoric music that is catchy, yet very distinctive from other FF OSTs. Serah's Theme, and Dust to Dust is a small sample of some of the great songs in this game. be sure to listen to the OST if you can.The game runs okay for what it is. You might need an above average PC to run it flawlessly, but I noticed FPS drops during certain fights, but it shouldn't be anything gamebreaking. About 70% of the time you will have 60fps.This game also has 2 sequels called XIII-2 and Lighting Returns. Both of them are shorter than this one, but the story of the 2 sequels are quite garbage. They utterly destroyed the perfect ending the original had, much like how X-2 dumpstered the original. I would recommend this game to anyone. I don't neccesarily think it's the greatest FF by any means, but it's not the worst imo. It's a beautiful game aesthetically, and stands out very well. If you can get past how linear it is, it can be very fun to watch and play.			"

												As a long time Western RPG player, it is quite a suprise that I found this game is quite enjoyable to play. Even with its limited visual customization of player controlled characters, other aspects of this game helps it to shine; the convincing voice acting, believable fantasy setting and lastly the story that is quite well written. Plus the PC version allowed us to play it in glorious Full HD resolution, which was not possible when it was first released on PS3. Give this game a try and I'll sure you will not regret it!			"

												XIII is a pretty polarizing entry in the Final Fantasy franchise. While I can understand why, I certainly don't agree with the haters; the things that warrant complaint from others are some of the bigger things I like about it. Let's take a look at these first.To start with, YES, it's linear. Most of the chapters are pretty straightforward. To me, this meant less time spent looking for your destination and more time heading there. But if you don't like the idea of little exploration, then I suppose this would be an issue to you.Another compliant I hear a lot is about the level-up system, the Crystarium. For the first two chapters (few hours), your characters can't get any stronger, but I didn't notice this for a while and didn't mind. It actually makes sense in-universe that the characters can't become magic-slinging superhumans until they're no longer normal humans. Once you get it, the Crystarium progresses in stages, up to 10, and though you can accumulate more CP (EXP equivalent), you can only upgrade as much as your current Crystarium stage allows. This means you can only be as strong as Squenix decided you'd need to be at that point. Yes, this means you can't overlevel, but it also means that you'll always know that if you're stuck on a boss, it's not your characters, it's your tactics.The battle system uses six different roles, with each character having three as their primary roles (they unlock the others as secondary roles late-game): Commandos, who do the most damage, Ravagers, who use elemental attacks to exploit enemy weaknesses and build the Stagger meter, Sentinels, who draw enemy aggro, Synergists, your buffers, Saboteurs, your debuffers, and Medics, self-explanatory. You can store up to six ""Paradigms"" of different roles for your party to switch between in battle as need arises. For example, open by having a couple Synergists buff the party while a Saboteur debuffs the enemy, switch to Commandos and Ravagers to attack, and switch to a paradigm with a medic or two when your health is low. You can only directly control your party's leader, but the ai is programmed to use what's needed where it's needed- Medics prioritize healing the party member closest to death, Ravagers use elements the enemy is weak to and stop using elements that don't work on it, etc.How does this game look and sound? I think it's beautiful. There are a lot of great environments you'll travel through, and you'll stop on those linear paths a lot to admire them. The summoning sequences look so good they'd make a fitting wallpaper. The soundtrack doesn't stick out much in my memory, but it's not bad. You won't get sick of, and there are a couple pieces you're sure to like.The plot's one of those types that's intentionally vague at first: you'll wonder how A led to B and what even caused A, but the backstory leading up to the start of the game is all revealed in bits and pieces as you go along. I won't say much on what the plot consists of, but I would put it among the better plots for the eight numbered Final Fantasies I've played.To wrap it up, if either or both of those common complaints are a minus for you, then you probably won't enjoy it. But if you don't mind or consider them pluses, I don't see why you wouldn't. This game has a fast-paced battle system that'll keep you busy, scenery I've got multiple screenshots of on my profile, and a plot I looked forward to seeing through to the end. It doesn't feel much like prior Final Fantasy installments, but that doesn't mean it's not a great game.			"

Nice graphic, complicated story, and new battle system are the reasons that may challenge you to beat the gameIf you're a real JRPG fan, be sure to buy this game, as not many JRPG like this one you can find on Steam			"

												After putting over 100 hours into this game, and obtaining 100% of the achievements, I can whole heartedly recommand this game to anyone and everyone. This is a fantastic representation of what an RPG should be. The plotline carries this game extremely well, and the combat system almost never gets tiring with the introduction of the paradigm system. Overall this game is very well put together, while the steam port was initially awful, the rescent bug fixes and patches have made it a fantastic experience. This continues the legendary Final Fantasy series with upmost of honors. 10/10			"

												While the version of the game might be better on PS3, it was very unpleasant on PC.I've a read a few other reviews and I don't seem to share some of the same problems they have like the black bars and crashing. I can comment on one issue I had and that was the controls stopped responding to my commands after a few hours of playing. I wouldn't be able to ALT+TAB out of the game and sometimes I would have to rely on it to get my controls back, at which point they would continually scroll through menu options making selection a timing-based thing. This was particularly horrible during battles and swapping paradigms. Since the game has been out for a long time I will be brief in my review.Pros: + Good English Voice Acting - I didn't know you could play it in Japanese, but I don't particularly want to hear a Japanese guy voice a black guy.+ Good Music - I owned the soundtrack before owning the game, so I played a vast majority of the game in silent minus the cutscenes. + The Paradigm System - Once you can unlock swapping team members, the possibilities for battle styles becomes interesting and a lot of fun.+ The Crystarium - The game, as a JRPG, is obviously going to be grindy in a way and the Cyrstarium makes you feel like you're getting results from mindless battles.+ Rendered Cutscenes, and Character Portraits - Great art and attention to detail. Characters are expressive and it's nice to watch the cutscenes.+ Lots of Lore - Kind of necessary to explain some backstory when the names for the entities in the game are so stupid.+ Upgrades and Disassembly of weapons and accessories - Pretty cool system but it feels like I'm throwing a lot of items at something and it only gets a little bit better.Neutral:+ Linear Paths and Gameplay - If you don't want to think, this game's map is good for that. Go down every path the NPCs don't is my general rule.Negatives (oh man, and are there ever negatives):+ The ♥♥♥♥♥iest camera ever - Like it really just sucks major♥♥♥♥♥♥ There's no visual feedback to let you know that the camera can't be turned in certain areas and it defaults to an awful location. Its turning speed is incredibly slow and you can't change its settings except for inverting its axis. + Defaulting to Auto-battle can just make battles ""Press Enter To Win""+ Grinding gets significantly less effective in a short amount of time - Enemies offer less CP and abilities cost a LOT more. + You can't freely move in battle - Which may seem obvious, but characters just wander around as they please and can get hit by AOE spells at low health.+ No option to turn off animations for changing Paradigms - At first it starts of by focusing on each character and this ACTUALLY TAKES TIME IN BATTLE. While you're transforming, someone can die and you're basically ♥♥♥♥ed.+ Can't control other members in battle+ When your Leader dies, it's game over - Even though other characters can learn to raise other team members from death!+ Bland characters+ Sometimes difficult to understand map - Trying to find Marks to hunt and I can't figure out where they're meant to be.+ Characters can't actually walk straight - They default to North on the minimap, but the map actually starts turning slowly while walking so you start walking diagonally in hallways. + Limited settings interactionThe list could go on, but I can't really think of anything else at the moment. This game reminds me of Ni no Kuni but it sucks as a port. I'd play it as a PS3 game, but not as a PC game. I'm going to stick with it and its sequels just because I've come this far.			"

												I kinda feel that after my playtime, I can make a valued judgement on Final Fantasy XIIIGood bits:1. Pretty damn good graphics overall.2. Brilliant and engaging battle system. A little complex too.3. Interesting story, with quite a few backstory-style datalog entries to read.3a. The Soundtrack! The best video game soundtrack I've heard in a long while. Simply fan dabby dosie.4. Controller support. I like using Mouse and Keyboard, but not with this. Too... clunky. Controller doesn't take away from the experience, so why not? It only makes it better!Bad Bits:1. My god the frame drops. My computer, without sounding too flashy, can run this game on max shadow resolution (8192x8192), so it begs the question: Why can't it maintain 60fps? It only drops to 30, nothing less. It just noticeable.2. Around 15 hours of total linearity. Which in my eyes is okay, due to the game being able to hold my attention for that period of time. Now, around 13 hours of my playtime after this has been non-linear, but involved alot of farming. Alot. A word of warning.3. 30gb+ install. My god. If you're where I am, where your internet runs off a pizza box and is 1.2mbp/s (0.12MB/s), then good luck downloading the game. If you're anywhere else, you should be fine.Overall. 8.5/10. Pretty fantastic, with great visuals, an engaging story with pretty damn badass characters. Except one.Would recommend.Edit: Okay, solved the FPS drops. It's because for some reason the game hates CPU's with more than 4 cores. So, you have to run it on 4 or less. So, I've changed the rating in lieu of the port being unoptimised. Easy fix though, so not a hefty decrease.			"

												I haven't played the PS3/X360 version when it came out so long ago so when it released on PC (and went on sale for $6) I had to give it a shot.Warning, FFXIII does have a bad reputation for being linear (it really is except for pretty much one chapter, 11 if you want to know...), but I really did enjoy the story and the battle system. The game takes a while to reach its stride, the true battle system isn't unlocked until Chapter 3, and up until that point, battles are pointless and albeit a bit tedious. And like classic JRPGs, you're in for a lot of cutscenes.If you're not a fan of JRPGs or if this is going to be your first, I honestly wouldn't recommend this game to start unless you're a stickler for storylines and character development (I know I am so perhaps I'm a bit biased here). For most of the game, it's a lot of running towards the goal mark while making slight detours for treasure orbs. That said, I am a fan of the Final Fantasy series and I truly enjoyed this game.Is it the best Final Fantasy? No. Would I recommend this game to everyone? Also no.I think this game is sadly made for a few choice groups of people. Maybe not even the Final Fantasy fans over the ages. I've played my share of FF games and came into this one with an open mind, and I adored the story (it does get a bit confusing in the beginning with flashbacks throughout to fill in the gaps, later it will make sense) and the gameplay. The leveling system reminded me sort of the leveling system in FFX albeit unique for each role and character instead of one giant thing.If you're familar with JRPGs and you don't mind a linear world, definitely give this game a shot. If not, you might want to try other FF games first.			"

												It was quite challenging to me to decide, how to rate this game after i beat it to the end. As this is my first Final fantasy game, I was really thrilled and astounded with its beginning. This game has really nice and impresive visuals, glamorous world and developed characters. I have really enjoyed about the first 40 hours of a gameplay stuck deep with it. To this point everything perfect for me. Quite a lot of people wrote a negative reviews about the engine performance, which haven't occured when i played (stuttering, lagging, crashes, unresponsive controller and such) - everything worked nicely on my 3 years old notebook (2.3 Ghz, Radeon HD 5650 1GB, 4GB ram - using XBOX 360 controller) on 108p0. I have felt some framerate drops during really graphicaly challenging sceenes with many spells blazing, but still most of a time really playable with decent FPS (30-40 FPS -> Yeah it is not that trendy 60FPS, but still really good,ey? :D)But after those cca 40 hours came a big downside of a game. Massively repetetive fighs, same enemies started to bore me a lot. A LOT...There i decided I really dont want to strive for all achievments (what would take about another 40 hours of repetetive grinding) and rushed to a finish....That is quite sad, because it quite ruined the game for me after that nice time i have spent with it. The last 2 hours were really teeth grinding and needed full will to not trash the game and finished after i have spent so much time with it. + Outro is really great :DSo at the end it was 50/50 between recomendiing this game or not, but still i have enjoyed longer time than i didn't, so after a long decision I recommend the game....I think many people will really like it but my tip is : Dont grind too much (as it is not really needed (I have easily finised with my Specs and Equip in middle level (LVL 2 items-some not fully upgraded and crystalarium in about lvl 8), with only 3 hours of pure grind (and even there i was slopy :D) and enjoy the game as a story takes you or you may get in similiar situation of bored gamer and that might ruin your game.STORY: 8/10 - Story is great, but some strange twist and the prolonging (for boredom to me) sometimes strikes it down. Still, in a basics I have enjoyed the storytelling.Graphics : 10/10 - Nice for 3 years console port and the settings, artworks and such is realy beautifullSOUND : 6/10 - There are some nice pieces but i found some soundtrack tittles really out of the place for a given situation. Also the sounds used in fights are quite similiar to each other and after a few hours of listening to them over and over again they got quite annoying.GAMEPLAY: 3/10 : Quite a lot said in a review...inovative (for me as a newbie in JRPG) at first, really borring and headbashing after some time. Of course you can swich to different charracters, change the style but at the end, it is still the same over and over again.TOTAL 6/10			"

												I just finished Final Fantasy XIII and I'm still planning on going back and completing all the remaining sidequests.  I wouldn't say this game ended up as my absolute favorite in the series, but it's still very much worth playing through.First off, I'm going to discuss the main point of criticism everyone keeps bringing up about this game: the linearity.  I would definitely say that I prefer games that are more open and adventurous instead of games that constantly force you in one direction.  However, while the first part of the game is extremely linear, it actually didn't bother me as much as I was afraid it would.  Many of the game's 13 chapters consist of your team running down long, narrow pathways (with the occasional offshoot containing treasure) while fighting enemies and watching cutscenes.  All shopping and upgrading is done at save points; there are no minigames or towns (well, there are ""towns"" but you'll be running through them fighting enemies just like in the other parts of the game).  On the bright side, the story, combat, and character progression system were all engaging enough to keep me entertained throughout all the linearity.  Still though, when first starting the game one might wonder why Square-Enix would ever decide to make it so ridiculously linear.  My guess is that it's their way of making the player focus on the story during the first part of the game without getting sidetracked - most sidequests in the earlier parts of these types of games tend to yield insignificant rewards, anyway, so the developers opted to save all of the sidequests for the later part of the game.  Indeed, if you are able to make it through the first 10 chapters without getting sick of all the corridors and pathways, chapter 11 finally presents you with the expansive, wide-open, sidequest-filled world you've been craving.  At first, it may seem like too long of a wait to reach chapter 11 out of 13, but believe me, this open part of the game is HUGE and is very well worth the wait.  Don't be thrown off by the fact that it's just one chapter.  To put it into perspective: if you plan on completing everything there is to do in the open section, it will likely take you more time than the main story by itself.  Also, even if you decide to move on and finish the last two chapters of the game, you are still allowed to return to the open world.People tend to have different opinions on this game's battle system, but personally it's one of my favorites in the whole series.  It introduces enough new aspects to make it unique and refreshing, but at the same time it doesn't stray too far from Final Fantasy tradition like I feel FF12's combat system did.  Combat is fast-paced and engaging, but you still have enough time to strategize.  There are six different roles that a character can assume during battle, and you can instantly change those roles by shifting the party's ""paradigm"" (set of roles for all three active characters) depending on what you need to do at any particular moment, whether it be healing, attacking, buffing/debuffing, etc.  Speaking of roles, the character progression system strikes a perfect balance between customization versus character uniqueness.  You are free to choose which role you want a character to improve in by spending CP (the game's term for EXP) wherever you please.  At the same time, even though every character will eventually be able to access all roles, each character will still have three roles that they are better at than the others, and these roles vary depending on the character.  Even characters who are both good at a certain role will each have access to their own unique abilities for that role, so they're definitely not blank slates that you have to build from the ground up.To top it all off, the game's soundtrack is pleasant for the most part and the environments are beautiful and full of color.  I'm aware the voice acting has occasionally been criticized with regards to certain characters, but I've heard much worse - in fact, I didn't find it bad at all.  My final word: if you never had the chance to play this game on a console, now's the time to get it.			"

												I'm an old school gamer of the Final Fantasy franchise.  I stopped playing them when we went our separate ways; they went with the online only route, and I in turn took the PC only road in around the change of the millenia.  Now that Steam reconnected our different pathes again with this bridge from disk to PC configuration - it's like we never parted ways.This game has the full complex storylines, excellent cinematics scenes that aid for story depth, along with using your own personal style of battle play and gameplay that I live for - STILL!  It's as much different as it is much the same as ever.  Square game developers know how to keep their games as well as their gamers immersed in hours upon hours of gameplay.So, since I am close to being done with this game, Steam just so happens to have FF13X2 on sale for 50% off this weekend... AND IT'S MINE!  I'm all set for more Final Fantasy, the next chapter.I highly recommend this game for those of you who need complex, diverse, rich, and detailed storylines, AND like to use your own wits of strategy in formulating great battle plans with a variety of melee and magic... Prepare to be sucked in and NEVER forget these epic adventures of Final Fantasy!!!			"

Fair warning: The port is garbage. 50GB for Eng+Jap and 30GB for Jap only. Has plenty of known issues and lacks proper things you might expect from a PC port. Thankfully there ARE refunds on steam now. TL;DR: Game has a LOT of depth and good encounter design for a game that ""plays itself""This game is a prime example of Auto-Battle done RIGHT, unlike your generic mobile game which does indeed play itself without you looking at it. I picked up this game after watching many speedruns of it, because I was intrigued by the amount of depth in an ""auto-battle"" game. Needless to say, it did not disappoint.This game unfortunately doesn't have much hand-holding, you have to discover a lot of tricks and details by yourself, which is considered rare for a modern game. (At least it isn't Mario And Luigi: Tutorial Team right?) At no point does the game really go into detail about things like Cut, Keep or Chain duration. If you dislike discovering things for yourself, there are plenty of game mechanic resources online that you can find. All the same, the game is entirely playable without knowing these things. This game is HARD. It's quite execution heavy, but you shouldn't fall into the trap of setting your ATB speed to slow in options because just about the only thing it does is help you die of boredom faster. It's a lot about finding out how to best prepare for your fights to equip the AI with the right tools to win, especially so if you want to auto-battle all day. You'll find yourself retrying fights a lot, doubly so if you're not looking to run a Sentinel in every single fight and die of old age. In fact, it's often many magnitudes faster to go into a fight, flail around to understand the enenmy, then retry and optimize your setup. This is the reason why ""Retry"" is a really good mechanic in this game, despite how cheesy and overly forgiving it might seem.People like to bash this game for being Hallway Simulator. It definitely isn't the strongest part of the game, but I hated the missions a lot more. The missions felt like hallways simulator + unnecessary padding, and I'd rather play a game with a strong main experience than to be shoved a tonne of boring sidequests to inflate play hours and provide artificial ""branching"". That being said, the missions are not bad, they've done a very good job with encounter design in this game. You can't always charge headfirst with the same paradigms into every fight unless you're planning to take 20mins to clear by sitting in Solidarity, Combat Clinic and Tortoise all day. The game might feel like ""Stagger and win"", but it isn't always the case; Sometimes you want to raise the post stagger chain to 999.9% first, other times you want to not cause the enemy to enter another phase by doing too much damage, and occasionally you want to stagger later so that you can set up a 1 stagger kill. The game has constantly encouraged a variety of strategies to efficiently take down each boss.			"

												I just finished Final Fantasy XIII and I'm still planning on going back and completing all the remaining sidequests.  I wouldn't say this game ended up as my absolute favorite in the series, but it's still very much worth playing through.First off, I'm going to discuss the main point of criticism everyone keeps bringing up about this game: the linearity.  I would definitely say that I prefer games that are more open and adventurous instead of games that constantly force you in one direction.  However, while the first part of the game is extremely linear, it actually didn't bother me as much as I was afraid it would.  Many of the game's 13 chapters consist of your team running down long, narrow pathways (with the occasional offshoot containing treasure) while fighting enemies and watching cutscenes.  All shopping and upgrading is done at save points; there are no minigames or towns (well, there are ""towns"" but you'll be running through them fighting enemies just like in the other parts of the game).  On the bright side, the story, combat, and character progression system were all engaging enough to keep me entertained throughout all the linearity.  Still though, when first starting the game one might wonder why Square-Enix would ever decide to make it so ridiculously linear.  My guess is that it's their way of making the player focus on the story during the first part of the game without getting sidetracked - most sidequests in the earlier parts of these types of games tend to yield insignificant rewards, anyway, so the developers opted to save all of the sidequests for the later part of the game.  Indeed, if you are able to make it through the first 10 chapters without getting sick of all the corridors and pathways, chapter 11 finally presents you with the expansive, wide-open, sidequest-filled world you've been craving.  At first, it may seem like too long of a wait to reach chapter 11 out of 13, but believe me, this open part of the game is HUGE and is very well worth the wait.  Don't be thrown off by the fact that it's just one chapter.  To put it into perspective: if you plan on completing everything there is to do in the open section, it will likely take you more time than the main story by itself.  Also, even if you decide to move on and finish the last two chapters of the game, you are still allowed to return to the open world.People tend to have different opinions on this game's battle system, but personally it's one of my favorites in the whole series.  It introduces enough new aspects to make it unique and refreshing, but at the same time it doesn't stray too far from Final Fantasy tradition like I feel FF12's combat system did.  Combat is fast-paced and engaging, but you still have enough time to strategize.  There are six different roles that a character can assume during battle, and you can instantly change those roles by shifting the party's ""paradigm"" (set of roles for all three active characters) depending on what you need to do at any particular moment, whether it be healing, attacking, buffing/debuffing, etc.  Speaking of roles, the character progression system strikes a perfect balance between customization versus character uniqueness.  You are free to choose which role you want a character to improve in by spending CP (the game's term for EXP) wherever you please.  At the same time, even though every character will eventually be able to access all roles, each character will still have three roles that they are better at than the others, and these roles vary depending on the character.  Even characters who are both good at a certain role will each have access to their own unique abilities for that role, so they're definitely not blank slates that you have to build from the ground up.To top it all off, the game's soundtrack is pleasant for the most part and the environments are beautiful and full of color.  I'm aware the voice acting has occasionally been criticized with regards to certain characters, but I've heard much worse - in fact, I didn't find it bad at all.  My final word: if you never had the chance to play this game on a console, now's the time to get it.			"

												If you love JRPGs or a fan of Final Fantasy series. Buy this game!.I know that some people don't like FF13 because of its linear story,and battle system. I still bought it because I love final fantasy since I first played FF7 on psx. You may not find the charm you are looking for in this game. But still, for me it is worth it. and who doesnt like Lightning right? "

												Lots of people hate this game. I've been enjoying the hell out of it.To start: I've played about 15 Hrs. My internet connection is spotty sometimes so most of my playtime is offline.More: I'm old school. I played FFVII on playstation near release. Remember the black-bottom discs(like three of them)? That was my first FF game and since, it has been my favorite. XII is a distant second place for me (in terms of FF games). XIII (so far) has my attention. Granted it has no chance of dethroning VII or XII But the game is enjoyable. Apart form the terrible dialog (which I've actually grown to like form FF games) I have trouble finding much fault. Tunnel simulator? sure. but no more than X. Even VII had the same feeling at points. You may have to search through endless pages of journal logs to find the story but does anybody remember the Kingdom Hearts series? Talk about melodrama, huh? Now I didn't come on here to bash all of my favorite games. Not at all (and these are some of my favorites (VII and KH topping the list)). The point of all of this is to say that no game is perfect. Every FF game has its quirks. Each game has made different design choices in some form or another. This one is no different. The most outlandish change that this game tries is its paradigm based battle system. Which is its strogest feature. It's not my favorite battle system of the series but it's fast, engaging, and ultimatley enjoyable. For any true FF fan, I say, that there is nothing wrong with this game. You get a pure FF game in XIII. To all the nay sayers, I say, open that small mind of yours and stop being such a genre fanboy. To those of you who skipped this one due to the bad publicity, maybe give it a try (thats why I waited so long). I bought this on sale but if I would have known the true nature of its reputation I wouldn't have minded paying full price. (Though I am glad I got it on sale, I'm not stupid...or rich). But if it isn't on sale and your in the mood for a FF game and have a few bucks to spare this is a solid buy.End Review. "

												The port - is it good enough to play happily (now) ? - Certainly.Is it perfect? - Absolutely not.I've just about finished a fairly comprehensive playthrough (after doing everthing several years ago in the PS3 version) running at 4k on a 980Ti and i7 6700k and after 83 hours ingame, have experienced a single CTD.Yes there was the occasional FPS low, it would dip now and again to the 30s, but for the most part spent its time happily sitting at 60.Did the occasional frame rate low detract from the game? Not at all.Whilst the original port was somewhat shoddy, it has been hugely improved and is a very pleasant experience.Final Fantasy XIII is a curious game. For the first 30+ hours, you are railroaded along with minimal input, occasional fights (auto attack) and a LOT of FMV.The storyline is a little confusing and even non-sensical (I honestly think its the absolute worst FF storyline, ever, having played everything since 3) but I love the character development.Forget the l'Cie, forget the Fal'Cie, forget the never ending fight between Cocoon and Gran Pulse, listen to Lightning, Vanille, Fang, Sazh, even Snow and Hope as they grow and realise that the world is a much bigger place than they thought it was and that their own problems are really quite petty in the grand scheme.Auto Attack really does kill off the majority of fighting, but the paradigm system shines when the going gets tough, being able to switch in healers, buffers and debuffers and swap melee / ranged classes as required was a masterstroke of design, its the single biggest inovation in the FF franchise in a long time, so much so I found the 6 variation limit too... limiting.The side quests (Ci'eth Stone missions and Choco treasure hunting) do offer some variation, but even when on Gran Pulse, there is quite limited freedom and whilst quite large, there are too many tunnels.Finishing the game isnt terribly hard, but if you want to level your main teams weapons up, finish the Ci'eth Stones / Titan Missions, then you are going to have to farm a fair bit as you are fairly starved for gil unless you focus on earning it.Overall, a good port of a somewhat different Final Fantasy game that has garnered a lot of love and hate over the years.

												Edit Feb 2015: I started really playing the game inspite of the framerate hiccups and have gotten over it.  I am not satisfied, but still am enjoying the game.  The game is beautiful, battle is pretty mindless in the early game, but gets decently interesting, and playing the game with the japanese voices is pretty cool.  Story is a bit confusing at first but eventually is explained...and good enough.  While this port could have been better, the game is still a great game.  Ultimately, if you like a good Anime show with a progressive fantasy storyline and setting, you will like this game.Bottom line: Get this game once you have verified that it is working well for the majority of people.Lesson learned: Don't pre-order a console port.I have a beastly computer and still have frame drop issues, even after the recent patch.  FRAPS says it runs at a constant 60fps even though I visually see stutter randomly in and out of battle.  I have tried to do some tweaking with settings in game and in the Nvidia control panel...but really?  Nobody got time for dat!  Going to keep waiting for more optimization before I grind out 60+ hours of a playthrough.  If I get it running smooth like it should then I will change my review.			"

												This is my third playthough of FF13, the first 2 times were on PS3. I still think people are way too hard on this game. I have been a long time FF fan, playing since FF1 was released back on NES long long ago. Playing every FF as soon as it released. Basically, I got alot of FF experience.As for FF13 PC, with the choice of making the game look better and Japanese voices making it even better. Raises the level of this game all the more. Is it the best FF game out there? No, of course not. Is it the worse FF game? Hell no. Pros:Amazing GraphicsAmazing MusicBest Battle System so far in a FF gameGood Story with likeable main cast.Big custom systems with weapons and leveling upGreat Voice acting on the Japanese side, and good enough on the english side (I say play in Japanese)Cons:Lack of a ""great Bad guy""Maybe too linear for some (This actually didn't bother me)Takes a little too long to get to the main battle system (slow start)Overall, I strongly recommend this game.

												Though the 13th (not literally) installation of the FF series doesn't live up to its predecessors, it still possessed few positive factors that made me like it. I never had the chance to finish this on the PS3 because the console was my cousin's, and not entirely mine. I understand why most people gave this a bad rep, but here are some simple explanations on why I like it more than I hate it.Linearity 11/10-the word I frequently see being used when describing FF13. But it's very sadly true. The FF series as a whole is known for its vast open world and the running around in different cities and completing mini games before going into the final battle. FF13 made me feel like playing a movie rather than a game with its dragging and frequent cutscenes and trodding on roads which can only lead you in one direction. You're literally running on a straight line, or an intersection that still ends up on one path. The only place you can freely enjoy is the open fields of Gran Pulse. Freedom is limited, which is ironic since the characters themselves were not given much.Characters 6/10-Lightning is just too bland--a female version of Cloud Strife but worse. I felt like Fang should be the lead character, and Vanille the second (which makes sense because the creators originally wanted Lightning to have Fang's personality). Lightning is under the bundle of brooding, untalkative, serious main characters Square Enix seems to like. The first half of the game you're stuck with a bunch of people with no objective whatsoever, but still kept on running to wherever fate takes them. You get the brooding kid, the self-proclaimed hero, the father figure... basically people with more personality than Lightning. You may hate them at first, but the long cutscenes and the story progress can make you like them little by little. The conversations between the characters were awkward and poorly written, but gets better fortunately.Gameplay 8/10-The gameplay may have some few faults here and there, but it becomes fun as you progress. To be honest, I hated the battle system. You can only manually control one person, which is the battle leader. This could've been an okay concept but the game doesn't let you pick your teammates until the second half of the game. Otherwise, you're just stuck with only two people in one chapter (Hope and Lightning; Sazh and Vanille for example.) It's tedious to get into the battle system, but once you can unlock every single option, it becomes enjoyable. The paradigm and crystarium system is great, as you can choose what that certain character's specialty would be.Music 10/10-There hasn't been an FF game that disappointed me at this component and FF13 is not an exception.Graphics 8/10-FF games have always been beautiful little things. Since FF13 was released years ago on last gen consoles, I still think it's pretty even up to today's standards. After the update, the developers added more graphical settings, but even on max settings I still get the jagged lines and low-res textures on some surfaces (but I guess it was just really made that way) They also recently added an 1080 version thank god.Plot 6/10-Basically, the game throws you in a world with no explanation, not even a little. They have a Datalog option which enables you to read about the background and history as you progress. I doubt people read all the pages in the Datalog. It took me a long time to differentiate l'Cie with Fal'Cie and C'ieth, etcetera. They don't explain . Even the narratives and the long cutscenes isolate you. I like that they influence the story with Norse Mythology which I'm very interested in, but overall the plot was relatively okay, though it doesn't make sense most of the time, but I guess that's just the game's lack of explanation. Technical 5/10-I have a generally ok rig, somewhere in the center of mid-tier and high-tier—an intel i7 and an AMD 7870 plus 12GB of ram. I could run most games smoothly on 1080p but this one seems to be an exception at first. It was stuttery--like hiccups. My FPS doesn't stay on 60, especially during battle. Small areas (like rooms and hallways) doesn't lag so much. When I finally couldn't take the 0.01 second stutters I searched the net for a fix. It worked, thankfully. But I wished the developers did something about it themselves, as the game seemed to always try to detect a game controller, which made it lag a lot.Despite my wavering review, I still recommend this game, but only to those familiar with the Final Fantasy franchise. I wouldn't recommend this game to someone who wants to get into the series. Still, I enjoyed it. I have a love-hate relationship with this game. The ending was so touching that I cried (literally) because of the utter satisfaction that I felt. I hope you'd give this game a try, especially since the price has gone down.			"

												It seems that most people either like or dislike this one with very little room inbetween. I believe it has a lot to do with your expectations going in. If you are anticipating a generic RPG or even Final Fantasy experience, then you are in for a surprise or perhaps disappointment. If you approach this game with an open mind, you may find it to be a unique and enjoyable journey.In my opinion, this game was sufficiently challenging. It's not a game you can smash one button through while staring off into space. The battle system is one of the best I have experienced in any RPG. It is unique, fast-paced, and requires you to think strategically. If you don't have an understanding of how the different battle roles work and enter fights blindly, you are going to have a bad time. That said, once you have grasped how things work, it is much easier, but still not too easy. The battle system and the challenging nature of the battles are the highlight of this game.The characters are likable and inspiring. There were several scenes that I felt were very emotional and made me cry a bit (secretly, of course). As for the story itself, as someone who has grown up playing RPGs, I feel there are few unique storylines. Pretty much everything has been done before in one way or another. What matters to me is how a story is told. Like almost every Final Fantasy game, they hit the nail on the head with this one. The story unfolds beautifully and draws you in. I have heard some people say the story is confusing. I felt this way at first, but as the game went on it made sense. I guess you just have to give it a chance and try not to think too deeply. It's actually rather straightforward for the most part. Also, there is a datalog you can access in the game that includes entries on people, events, and history and myths, which should provide more detailed information.One of the biggest critisims I have seen about this game is its linear nature. For some it is their only complaint but it completely ruins the game for them. Without spoiling the story for anyone, If this game were more open world it would not make sense. The fact that it feels like a ""hallway simulator"" to many people is completely understandable, but I feel as though this makes it easier to relate to the characters and what they are going through with the themes of fate and destiny, and their personal circumstances. Even the limited interaction with NPCs makes sense once you have an understanding of what's happening.In conclusion, if you'd like to experience a strategic, fast-paced battle system, and a well told story, give this one a chance. I really enjoyed it and I hope you do too.			"

												Final Fantasy 13 (XIII) is one of the most polarizing main numbered titles in the Final Fantasy franchise. Every part of the game has been streamlined, from how the story progresses to combat to even how your characters get stronger. I may have Stockholm Syndrome, but I think much of it has changed for the better, removing some annoying hiccups in the process, while some resulted in the pitchfork emporium running out of stock. TL;DR FF13 is a good but not great game that tries a lot of new things, many of which are good, but don't mesh well together, with a good story, decent characters, and simple combat system that has some flexibility. 7.5/10 Quick Overview Final Fantasy 13 is the first entry on the PS3/Xbox360 generation. It takes place in the cyberpunk super hi tech world of Cocoon, overlooking the much larger wild planet of Gran Pulse. There are 13 chapters within the game, with the first 10 being entirely linear (no side quests, no extra areas to explore, just a main path to the objective with a few short paths for treasure) and the world opening up for extra stuff in chapter 11. Progression is through the crystarium system, which keeps you from becoming too powerful too fast by only unlocking more stuff and certain junctures, including after beating the game. Combat uses a modified ATB system, where you control one character; if they die, game over. Using paradigms, you can manipulate what your party of 3 is capable of doing, from tanking damage, to debuffing, to buffing, to healing, to dealing a crapload of damage, to increasing the amount of damage that enemies take. Story One of the biggest changes is in how the story is told; more specifically, how the game is basically a corridor for 15 hours and you have no choice but to progress with the story. Personally, I don't think that this is that big of a problem. The story is one of the best parts about the Final Fantasy series, and this one is no exception. The main party are pretty whiny in the opening chapters, but there is a lot of character growth through the middle and latter stages of the game, especially with Lightning and Hope.The big problem is that they just open it all up in chapter 11 by shoehorning it in. Oh, we've been building up our story for several chapters and now you have a very short period of time to complete your focus? Let's just throw that pacing out the window and let you go kill a bunch of stuff! The game was pretty good (maybe not up to Final Fantasy hype standards, but good none the less), but it feels like the developers wanted to do a certain something with the game by having a lot of focus on story, but felt the need to include some classic side quests and world exploring that are part of what gives the franchise its mystique. Combat Combat, in short, is a ""Press X"" simulator. You have a party of up to 3 characters, with direct control over only one character. As it is still the ATB system, you have a bar that fills up to determine when you can make actions. To use the ATB bar, you can either select auto battle to have the game automatically choose what it thinks are the best actions, or go to abilities and select a chain of abilities for yourself. What's great about this system is that 1) it is good but not perfect, so you can auto pilot easy stretches of battles while having the normal flexibility that comes with a variety of abilities and 2) abilities are only constrained by how many portions of the ATB gauge they cost, and not mana, meaning if you fight a flan that is weak to magic and strong against physical attacks, you aren't screwed by a lack of mana. Other options in combat that don't use the ATB gauge are items and TP skills, which include stuff like summons, a huge team heal + rez, the only earth spell in the game, mass dispel, and mass stop. The whole TP system gets a bit complicated, but it's existence adds a bit of depth and limits summons in a unique way to the series that are otherwise extremely strong. Other Stuff The progression system in this game is pretty♥♥♥♥♥ You have a Crystarium for each character that eventually has 6 paths (1 for each class) and 10 levels with a linear path to upgrade. Weapons and accessories are upgraded by consuming random junk that drops from enemies, meaning that there are very few treasures worth actually finding in the game that aren't components. The whole system is kind of like the Draw and Junction systems from FF8; interesting in theory, but really really tedious and, more importantly, removes a huge chunk of potentially interesting gameplay as you spend time grinding money to upgrade to ultimate weapons as opposed to doing interesting things to go find the ultimate weapons and accessories.One of the biggest negatives I feel was  creature design . The names we have come to know and love from the series are still there, but have unrecognizable names. Goblins have a giant gaping hole for a mouth and rollerskates, bombs are a floating piece of origami, and the list of strongest enemies in the game is a bunch of giant turtles that are common enemies. There are a handful of good boss fights throughout the game, such as Enki and Enlil, the Havoc Skytank, Barty round 1, and the Proudclad, but there is little to no fanfare around most of them. You just casually stumble across most bosses, bonk them, chapter over, no interaction other than beating them into submission. There are good fights, but the enemies have no depth from the story (other than Barty) and are just dust in the wind.It's part of the story, but I'll just add this last part here. There really aren't a lot of characters in this game. You have the 6 in the party, Serah and Dajh, the 2 PSICOM colonels Jihl and Rosch, Snow's NORA squad of 4 (Gadot, Yuj, Lebreau, and Maqui), Cid Raines and his lieutenant, the big bad guy, a handful of 1 offs in Hope's parents and Lightning's sergeant, and... that's it. It's a really meager cast and takes away from the epic feeling of the game.			"

 FFXIII is a solid FF game  Though not as universally loved as its predecessors, Final Fantasy XIII, for me at least, is one of my favorites of the series. The main cast: Lightning, Fang, Vanille, Hope, Snow, and Sazh, are all interesting in their own right even if the story doesn't fully explore their personalities and backstories. Despite the linearity and obvious lack of exploration (hallways, hallways and more hallways), the game does a good job of presenting its drama through beautiful cutscenes that puts the player in the conflict between Cocooon and Pulse. I think the major flaw of this game in terms of its overall reception has to do with the timing of its release. Released in December 2009 in Japan and in March 2010 in North America, it was viewed as a savior for the PS3 for RPG gamers since there was a substantial drought of solid JRPGs at the time. Many had their hopes up that this game would be the FF game they were expecting but instead the game was so different than the others that the feelings of disappointed were completely understandable. 2009-2011 was an especially rough time for Square-Enix since the public failure of FFXIV 1.0 took a toll on the company's reputation and finances and the FFXIII series didn't help much. Thankfully in 2015 they are in much better place than they were a few years ago.The story is confusing as hell. I've played this game and its sequels (FFXIII-2 and FF:Lightning Returns) and I am still not 100% comprehending the whole story. I won't spoil details here but the events in this game make more sense after some careful explanations in the following games. The main fault of the story isn't that it set itself up for sequels, but instead that the lore and events have been spread too thin between the three games and there is quite a bit of piecing together to do on the audience's part.There is little customization. The only thing really is to upgrade weapons and accessories from junk that drops from enemies and mess around with paradigm set ups.The battle system shines in this game. It may seem like you are mashing A the entire time, which you may find yourself doing for quite a bit, but the Paradigm system is what makes and breaks boss fights. The hardest boss fights in this game (i.e. Barthandeus, Proudclad II) all require you to be attentive to the animations and patterns of the bosses and to prepare for heavy damage, recovery, and openings to stagger them. Also, some fights even have a doom counter which places a time limit on how quickly you should down the boss (similar to an MMO boss' enrage timer). It's similar to the classic ATB formula but with more involvement.If you're looking for an RPG with solid characters, an engaging battle system, and you don't mind that a game will take you through to the end, then this is perfect. If you're looking for exploration, choices, and freedom to do what you want, I'd recommend looking at some of the western RPGs that have come out recently. One of the developers of this game Motomu Toriyama said that he felt FFXIII had more FPS elements than a traditional RPG anyway.			"

												Final Fantasy XIII is practically my first Final Fantasy game in the core series (I started with Tactics Advanced, and then the DS version of Crystal Chronicles). It's a pretty old game, but it has all of the classic things found in practically all Final Fantasy games. The gameplay is fairly linear for the majority of the game, so this leads to endless grinding and long corridors. You've got six characters to play around with, and luckily, whenever you earn XP, all characters get that amount regardless if they were in the battle or not. With the right team setup, you can mash the A button and get through battles in a few seconds, but boss battles might require you to pay a bit more attention since you'll need to juggle healing and defense on top of your attacks. This does get boring after a short while, but if you can brave past the 20 hour tutorial (yep, it's that long), you'll find yourself on Gran Pulse, practically the only non-linear part of the game. When you first arrive on Gran Pulse, you'll meet a few overpowered monsters that you'll have to avoid, but thankfully, you'll know just by looking at their size. You'll still be grinding a lot, but there's plenty of missions to track down and defeat a particular monster(s) that'll sometimes grant you some cool items. You're free to choose how you want to level up your characters, whether it's by class (Commando, Ravenger, Medic, Sentinel, Synergist, or Saboteur) or by stats/abilities. Each character has 3 primary character classes that you can level up through rather quickly, and the remaining 3 can be leveled up a bit slower later on in the game. Weapons and accessories can also be upgraded, although you really don't have a need to do this until the latter half of the game. Overall, this game is most definitely a Final Fantasy game. Battles are a mix of turned-based and real-time strategy, and the getting through this game will set you up for the sequel (which is way better in only the first few minutes). Sure, there's a few cliches, and the game can be tough to get through in the first 20 hours, but if you like Final Fantasy, or just wanted to see what a game in the series is like, this one is definitely one to check out.

												A beautiful and very cinematic video game plagued by some of its weak points that are very apparent when compared to the usual and traditional Final Fantasy experience. It is also made fun of as a game that is very linear through almost the whole game (there is a certain point in the game where you can do sidequests and explore a bit and can return to that point near the endgame) being dubbed as a ""hallway simulator."" Also made fun of by its vast amount of cutscenes, which are wonderfully shot and beautiful, also calling the game a ""movie."" This is a title that shouldn't be avoided by any type of Final Fantasy fan whether a newcomer or long time fan such as myself. And as per usual from a JRPG, the combat is a new form of active choice based combat, even if you can let the game optimize the attacks and support by simply selecting ""auto,"" it still lets you switch the team's roles and plan the battle according to the situation at hand.To summarize, give it a try before you join the naysayers who most likely just judge a book by its cover, so enjoy the music, the wonderful visuals, and the interesting combat.

												A solid rpg but not one without issues. The game is pretty much one giant linear corridor for the first 20-30 hours. The game doesn't even seem to try and hide it with no real towns or buildings along the way until like 10-15 hours in. However, the combat is very fun and unique compared to other turn based games as it includes a huge amount of real time combat elements and the game gets quite challenging despite a slow start. The combat also works suprising well with a keyboard and mouse. I played through the entire game with kb+m despite believing initially that I would need a controller to play. Customization could be deeper but is still there. Graphics are excellent for a console port and the story is very interesting. However, there are some noticeable port issues despite the fixes the implemented. There are still very few graphics option. I also got random framedrops in some overworld areas despite playing on a 780 ti with 16 gigs of ram and an i7 4790k. It seems the framerate drops were totally random and seemed to mostly occur when there was very little occuring on the screen compared to where you would normally expect frame drops, in the larger more open areas later in the game and in combat.7/10			"

												+ The graphics in cutscenes are amazing.+ The characters are loveable.+ There is full voice acting. + The story is pretty good. It isn't as awesome as FFVII or FFX in my opinon, but good none the less.There are a few very minor negative things as well:- There is a character with a really awful made up accent! When she talks she is annoying to listen to at times.- There are a few story elements that have made up names with complicated pronounciations and we don't know much about these things so when the characters talk about them especially when they talk about them all at the same time it gets extremely confusing and hard to figure out what on earth they are talking about. - There are 2 modes of gameplay, Normal and Easy. Normal IS Easy. I don't see why they have mode options.- Unlike some of the prettier Final Fantasy games that have lavish terrain that is flourishing with life, this game has you in a dark hellish looking place at the start and up to the point I have made it to I have not seen any environments that are pleasing to the eye, for the most part. Don't get me wrong, the dark hellish environments have a lot of detail about them and they are well done. I suppose it is probably designed that way on purpose to create a sort of dark atmosphere, but I am left wondering if we will see any nice looking areas with green plants, and things. Such things don't even exist as far I am aware up until now.- The one thing that bugs me more than any other thing in this game is the Esc. key. when I hit it I don't get a menu. I get a windows dialog box that pops up with a classic windows ""DING"" alert that says ""Are you sure you want to quit? Yes / No""  And you have to use Tab > Enter to select No to contiue playing. Every single time I try to open a menu I get this stupid popup in its place. Every PC game known to this Earth uses Escape to open the pause menu. This game decides to screw with us and make it the E key. Over all, I would have to say I am pleased with this title. In my opinion it is the best in the series since FFX-2.Rating: 8/10			"

												Tl;DR Good game. Some flaws but worth buying if you like a good story and fast paced battles.Looking at the reviews for this game, many seem to criticise it for two main problems: first is the lack of port and second is the corrider/linear styled gameplay that could potentially restrict the freedom you have when playing. However, I personally didn't have a problem with either. The games's port for my laptop was absolutely fine. I experienced very minimal to absolutely no framedrops throughout my game time, even during battle scenes, and my laptop kept the game to a steady 60fps. The linear styled gameplay, however, may put off some people from buying this game and I personally can understand that opinion. The game starts off very slowly at the beginning and most of the early hours spent on this game will consist of you of either watching cut scenes or simply swatting away easy enemies that adds very little experience in terms of content in the game. Even so, if you're a major FF fan or if you're a patient type, like me, the late game experience is certainly a reward for toiling through countless yet pointless hours. In my experience, the story line starts to bring life and excitement at around chapter 7 (some may disagree) and once you're about 20 hours in, the game finally provides an alternative to the monotonic, corridor styles gameplay and introduces the player to a vast, open world in which you can finally participate in some side missions or just explore and generally have fun. In addition, the battles start to feel more challenging, and with the entry of the paradigm shifts and techniques such as libra or summon, they begin to feel enjoyable and rich in content with great, fast paced action that'll keep you on your toes throughout the whole fight.In conclusion, Final Fantast XIII is a good game. There are definitely some flaws that some gamers may not like and if they're the reason why it's preventing them from buying or liking this game, then I can only wave away what little argument i have and simply agree with them: everyone has their opinion. However, I think there are some who are too critical and too unfair which could then upset the true reflection of a solid, good game. Personally, I think this game is worth buying.I only wrote this long♥♥♥♥♥review because it's an excuse for revision, essay writing if you're wondering what i'm revising.Also, if you think it's rubbish it's because i wrote it from the top of my head in under 5 minute and it's my first one :).

												FFXIII, a decent title in the Final Fantasy Series, its mostly cinematic every 10 minutes but it looks good. Sadly this port is not the greatest, I had to do several hours of searching before i could even make the game launch because of DEP. After getting pass that hurdle things ran pretty good from 45fps to 60fps on 1080p. The story is the same are heroes are forced into saving the world by the Pulse L'cie in order to supposedly stop Ragnorak from there vision and they find along the way its not as simple as they think.The level system is a bit quirky in this title, if you havent played FF13 it uses a grid similar to FFX for stat and abilitiy progression and allows later in the game for multiple jobs on each character.If i was to rate this game i would give it a 7.5/10			"

												A solid rpg but not one without issues. The game is pretty much one giant linear corridor for the first 20-30 hours. The game doesn't even seem to try and hide it with no real towns or buildings along the way until like 10-15 hours in. However, the combat is very fun and unique compared to other turn based games as it includes a huge amount of real time combat elements and the game gets quite challenging despite a slow start. The combat also works suprising well with a keyboard and mouse. I played through the entire game with kb+m despite believing initially that I would need a controller to play. Customization could be deeper but is still there. Graphics are excellent for a console port and the story is very interesting. However, there are some noticeable port issues despite the fixes the implemented. There are still very few graphics option. I also got random framedrops in some overworld areas despite playing on a 780 ti with 16 gigs of ram and an i7 4790k. It seems the framerate drops were totally random and seemed to mostly occur when there was very little occuring on the screen compared to where you would normally expect frame drops, in the larger more open areas later in the game and in combat.7/10			"

												I went in with zero expectations. I heard it wasn't a true Final Fantasy, the story was confusing, the controls are ridiculous and so on. But it was finally available on pc and it bore the name Final Fantasy so what the heck, I bought it. And I'm very glad I did.First of the world looks simply gorgeous. Everything is a joy to see and nothing is the same. Sure, nowadays we expect everything in HD and this is not, but I could care less. The graphics are simply awesome. Zero complaints here. Secondly, the story isn't that confusing at all. Sure, in the beginning you go what in the name of insanity is going on, but it all becomes clearer the further you get in the game. For me it was an incentive to keep playing because I wanted to know what it was with Vanille, the whole stuff and more. Neither does the story progress very linear. It may seem that way because you traverse linear places, everything's a hallway basically, but you jump pretty much everywhere. The linear hallways didn't bother me either, but that's probably more due to the fact I always get lost on world maps and find three other places before I find the one I need. Once you're on Gran Pulse the linearity decreases in the field as well.Thirdly, the battlesystem was great. You're not exactly controlling all your characters anymore, but you still have some flexibility. Two of your team do whatever the heck they want, but within their role you assign them and you have total control over your team leader. Not to mention, you can switch jobs in the middle of battle. It makes for some great versatility and no more useless healers unable to do anything but sit back and enjoy the show. The game is really easy to control too. I played with keyboard and mouse and the controls were really easy to learn, though I did remap the pause button. Just remember that spacebar works like enter and you're fine. Fifthly, the game made me fall in love with the characters. They were well done, had motives and grew over the course of the game. They are far from flat and their interactions are fun to watch. I do have some complaints though. First of, Snow takes an incredibly long time to stop exclaiming he's a hero. I heard you the first thousand times Snow. Secondly, Vanille makes some definitely dubious sounds. My major gripe though is the money issue. Where's the gil? I spent most of the time completely broke. You don't get money from defeating enemies, so you'd better start beating every PSICOM ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you see and then some, and hope they drop loads of incentive chips and credit chips to sell. In the end, is it a true Final Fantasy game? Heck if I know. What makes a game Final Fantasy anyway? It does have a depressing lack of moogles, but the Chocobo chick Sazh carries around more than makes up for that.			"

												I played this on ps3 when it was new, and I got it on pc because I prefer pc gaming in general. Well, I couldn't get past the beginning. The controls are poorly implemented and awkward, the camera doesn't work well and gets stuck in my character's♥♥♥♥♥a lot. Half the enjoyment of this game is the views but all I get to see is Lightning's shoulder blades. I tried to work in a controller set up but couldn't get more than 2 buttons to work. It's a fantastic game, but the PC version is just unplayable in comparison to ps3.			"

												Final Fantasy XIII is practically my first Final Fantasy game in the core series (I started with Tactics Advanced, and then the DS version of Crystal Chronicles). It's a pretty old game, but it has all of the classic things found in practically all Final Fantasy games. The gameplay is fairly linear for the majority of the game, so this leads to endless grinding and long corridors. You've got six characters to play around with, and luckily, whenever you earn XP, all characters get that amount regardless if they were in the battle or not. With the right team setup, you can mash the A button and get through battles in a few seconds, but boss battles might require you to pay a bit more attention since you'll need to juggle healing and defense on top of your attacks. This does get boring after a short while, but if you can brave past the 20 hour tutorial (yep, it's that long), you'll find yourself on Gran Pulse, practically the only non-linear part of the game. When you first arrive on Gran Pulse, you'll meet a few overpowered monsters that you'll have to avoid, but thankfully, you'll know just by looking at their size. You'll still be grinding a lot, but there's plenty of missions to track down and defeat a particular monster(s) that'll sometimes grant you some cool items. You're free to choose how you want to level up your characters, whether it's by class (Commando, Ravenger, Medic, Sentinel, Synergist, or Saboteur) or by stats/abilities. Each character has 3 primary character classes that you can level up through rather quickly, and the remaining 3 can be leveled up a bit slower later on in the game. Weapons and accessories can also be upgraded, although you really don't have a need to do this until the latter half of the game. Overall, this game is most definitely a Final Fantasy game. Battles are a mix of turned-based and real-time strategy, and the getting through this game will set you up for the sequel (which is way better in only the first few minutes). Sure, there's a few cliches, and the game can be tough to get through in the first 20 hours, but if you like Final Fantasy, or just wanted to see what a game in the series is like, this one is definitely one to check out.

Posted: March 16, 2016
												This is my first FF game, i never saw any, read about any, i actually not even known much about it, all i known was this game from japan, this is some kind of rpg, and this game for consoles, thats all. After i have finished the story and almost all side quests i started to search about FF universe and another games, i also tryed some more FF games, not so many so far, FF13-2 FF13-3 Type 0 and FF4, just to compare this game with others, because lot of true FF fans just hate this game, so i was just wondered why. Well i saw lot of bad reviews with one main ""problem"" like they said, this game is too far different from FF universe, well i can say nothing about it, i repeat this is my first experience in FF, but i can say a lot of good things about this game.1. First of all graphic, i was really shocked, its just amasing, i didnt skip any cutscenes (about 8-10h ^^ even when i killed last bost and watched final cutscene, was another last boss after that and like 4-5 last scenes more, and then true final boss with true final cutscene), it looks very colorful and beaty, this game was originaly released in 2009-2010, and i tryed it in 2016. Graphic not main plus of this game, it just first thing i noticed2. Story. well first 5h i think i just didnt get any facking minds about story, it was not even hard to understand, it just was like im playing it on japan, all i could say about story was 2 words: l'cie and Fal'cie. But after some time i realised whats going on (tnx to database) and was really inspired, its not that unique, it has same ""rules"" with same words like ""love"" ""never"" ""together"" ""forever"" and so on, whatever i liked it much, and one of reason because of music.3. Soundtrack. i already have favorites songs like ""dust to dust"", or ""snow theme"" or ""Archylte Steppe theme"". but most excited thing about music in this game is facking right track in facking right moment, really sometimes smiley sometimes lonely, but alwasy in right time and right place. for me one of this moment was when u first visited oerba and dust to dust song was playing, wet eyes4. Characters, and ofc perfect woman - beatch LIGHTNING, first i hated Snow much and ofc always crying Hope, but later in game i just couldnt imagine someone instead of anyone of the group, again was just perfect summ from both procs and cons, all chars will say typical♥♥♥♥♥♥in their dialogs, bla bla bla forever ever never whatever, but its just nice gang, at least i was enjoed while was with them, and btw for me vanille just a little bit high, not autism like all haters saying, and high woman its just fun. oneworddescribe Lightning - beatch/(or perfect, just same to me). Snow - ""hero"", Hope - woman/child, Sazh - black (no offence, no rasism, just one always must be black, because of rules, i repeat for me no matter even if they all were black, jsut fun to watch another game or movie where everyone white, but at least one must be for sure black, god tnx his son at least black too) Vanille - high, Fang - vanille's friend (show me you friends and i will tell about you, right?)5. Gameplay, talking about battle mechaincs now - so im not really that good in any strateges rts or turn based, not only i hate strateges, but it seems they hate me too, so i was really afraid of this here. Well for my pleasure gameplay is weird, i mean its not true turn based, and not true real time, i dont even know how to call it correct, just google it ^^. And when u not in battle u just moving straight forward from battle to battle. there is some kind of open world in post game, but whole game yes its linear, just regular walk from battle to battle through stroy cutscenes, but i cant say its bad, at least in this game. And also u will use 1 button always, yes its true this game is onebutton but only before first mob which kill you, well and even after u will still almost always use one button - auto attack, yes mob it wont be boss who KOed you first. But its not slasher with combos and etc, all u will need to do is figure out paradigms and equipment for this battle and correctly switch it during battle. For me at end it really remind just puzzle.6. Leveling system,♥♥♥♥♥♥yes i love it, its simple u cant screw it and then create new game just because of your inta was not enough for casting golems.... for me its perfect, u dont need at least read freaking guides about BEWARE ABOUT STAT POINTS SON7. I said at the begining not graphic main plus of this game, what is main u ask, i think all, i mean its not just graphic with some sountrack and so on in my list, i think all these things are just common but all they made this game perfect TOGETHER FOREVER WHATEVER PS: if u need cons feel free to just find red review in store page			"

												After watching an LP of the game, I really didn't like it. But thankfully, my best friend convinced me to try it for myself and it turns out, she was right. I ended up really liking it. It may not be my favourite in the series but it really is a great game. Awesome cast of characters, interesting plot that may not appeal to all. I definitely love the character development, the crystarium system is pretty incredible. Definitely worth a try to any Final Fantasy fan or RPG fan in general~			"

												Contrary to what some naysayers says I definitely recommend this game. It has compelling emotional story, fun and challenging combat mechanics and it has really nice graphics (with one of the most beautiful sceneries I've seen in the game). Some say that this game is one long tunnel ride and they would be right but it's because everything is very story-driven and that's something of appeal to me. And what's more - half-way through it this tunnel opens up into large explorable valley full of hidden areas (you can explore this even after end of the game to find tons of hidden secrets). The game also has interesting item upgrading system that adds some flavor to choose of your equipment. Game mechanics opens up gradually, slowly adding more and more complexity to everpresent fights (some of which are very tough).Yes, there sure were some low-points in storytelling but one have to remember this is the story of hope and overcoming weakness and see it for its themes and as kind of fairy-tale. There were some emotional, beautiful and touching moments that were really worth it. Lore is very complicated though and without regularly reading everything in Datalog you may be lost. In the end I enjoyed this from first to final fight and I'll never regret that I bought this. If you can, play this with japanese VO though as it has a lot more depth in comparison with weaker english.			"

												So, FFXIII. One of the (if not THE) most hated Final Fantasy in existence, has such infamy that I expected very little of the game when I got it here on PC........and it's not THAT bad.Well, I can see why you'd hate it if you came in from all the other FF's. The world map got, for the most part, reduced to corridor walking, no towns to speak of, the story is incomprehensible if you don't read a primer sitting somewhere in the menu, the game takes a long time before it gives you full control (the famous ""it gets good in 20 hours) and battles are quite simplified, to the point that most of them are basically automated....but all of these turned out not to be that much of a turn-off to me. In battles, the stagger system helps turn things around, with quite a few enemies gaining weaknesses that didn't have before (ie: status ailments are finally useful in a FF game)Graphically, the game looks very good! I'd say unusually good for a 7th gen game, and until recently, only with mods could you see it in full 1080p, but latest patch thankfully adds resolution & GFX options. Unfortunately, framerate is still a hot mess, with SE promising 60fps, but the game actually having a hard reaching that, even with good hardware (4670k+R9 280). Expect battles to run @ 30fps for the most part.So, to sum my opinion: Good game, ""heh"" Final fantasy game, terrible framerates. Recommend buying it on sale if you have some interest in the game/series.PS: note that the Asian version is regionally restricted AT RUN-TIME! Meaning you can't run the game outside of Asia if you bought it from there. Unless you really want JP subtitles, you should try to get someone to gift you the western version, as it includes both ENG & JP voices.(source: https://steamdb.info/sub/41110/) "

												I really love Final Fantasy games. Definitely gonna buy the next Final Fantasy series (until I have the money to buy the FFXV *cries in my country). The point is, if you're a Final Fantasy fan, you know you will buy Final Fantasy games for the story, so I kinda accept the 'best corridor simulator games ever' since the story is really entertain me.The cons for me is that you will need a lot of grind once you got to the big map which will need a lot of your time to play it. Overall, I can't expect more or less and I am happy with what I have got.Frost Rating: 8/10			"

												I should preface this review by stating that this is my third complete playthrough of this game (All achievements, sidequests etc.) having played through the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions. I played through the Xbox 360 when it first released back in 2010 and then once again in 2013 for PS3 and just completed another 100 hour playthrough for the PC, putting my life total at around 300 hours for this game. Quite a lot of time I must admit, but I feel this game's story and gameplay (despite some flaws) has great replay value and totally justifies coming back and revisiting the world of Cocoon and Gran Pulse every 2-4 years. One of the main points of contention of this game is the 20-25 hours of travelling in corridors until you arrive at Chapter 11 in the story where the game opens up considerably. But I feel the developers made a wise decision in order to get the player to become emotionally invested in the characters. It's my opinion that if the game opened up completely from the outset, the developers would have had a much harder time trying to develop a cohesive narrative. Nonetheless, if you stick with it, the endgame will keep you quite busy with a myriad of freedom and challenges...you just have to endure 10 chapters of running through corridors.The game truly shines in the combat department and you'll indubitably spend most of your time fighting monsters. It can become quite ""grindy"" trying to gather gil for your huge expenditures endgame, but unlike the aforementioned PS3 and Xbox360 versions I played through, the game allows you to switch over to an ""easy"" mode which greatly increases the drop rate from monsters. This helped me shave hours of my completion time versus the previous versions I played. Also, the combat mode (for the most part) requires your full attention and you have to do more than ""repeatedly press x"" in battles. When I am grinding endgame in other final fantasy titles, I tend to use about 10-20% of my attention in non-boss battles whilst reading or some other non-gaming activity. However, this game will require your full engagement throughout. Other reviewers have expressed the pros and cons quite well so I don't need to reiterate them here. To succintly put it; if you are willing to invest some time in the more trying sections of the first half of this game, I feel it can be a rewarding experience.Update: Due to its nature as being quite misunderstood or ""polarizing"" amongst fans of the Final Fantasy series; I've henceforth nominated as ""Most misunderstood game"" for the upcoming Steam Game Awards.

												Just finished the PC Version of Final Fantasy XIII yesterday...Like most FF games, it is massive in scope and require many hours of playing to complete, I will start with a list of pros & cons.Pros:Massive Game, lots of playing hoursGreat CharactersGreat Voice ActingGood StoryExtensive & Quite easy to use level-up systemAmazing GraphicsOverall a very fan game to playCons:You can only control one character during battlesLack of control over Eidolons levels & customizationLack of Eidolons varietySome characters are imbalanced in my opinionSome minor camera bugsBad Keyboard controlsOK, first thing first, the PC version looks amazingly better than the Xbox 360 version of the game, if you're going to play the game I suggest using a game controller like the X360 wireless controller, it makes the game much easier to navigate and control, and much more enjoyable.The characters in FF XIII are very well written & the voice acting is absolutely superb, I found many instances in which I could relate to the characters emotions.The battle system is extensive and elaborate, without the tutorials FF XIII controls will be very difficult to understand for those who play the game for the first time, nevertheless, once you get the hang of it you'll find it to be very fluent, the level system in this game is called Crystalium and is basically composed of spherical levels of crystals on a grid with each crystal costing a certain amount of point called CP, it is very extensive and quite easy to understand, it also makes battling enemies more important as that is the only way to gather the points for the level-up system.Overall, it is a well built system that could have been a little better if it included the ability to level up your characters Eidolons as well.The few things I was disapointed with in FF XIII was the ability to control only your party leader in battles, while it makes the battles a little more fluent it removes a lot of the controls and the versatility that existed in many past Final Fantasy games, also, the lack of control over the level & customization of the Eidolons and the limited number of Eidolons in the game are a little disappointing.The game also have some minor camera bugs, mostly at the end of battles when the camera just shakes, it resets as soon as the battle summary screen is shown so it's not a big deal.Overall, Final Fantasy XIII is a very enjoyable and a very good installment to the series and I very much recommend it to Final Fantasy fans.

												Ok im very torn by this game if there was a option between Yes and No i would have clicked it. The graphics are great in the battles and the world but the story was just not done well, there are times that I really liked what was going on with some good twists but overall the story was just blah! The characters in my opinion sucked, they just didnt work.The combat system i didnt mind, the battles are very fast paced and done semi automatically, so it eliminates any sort of battle management. Some may like the system but most i would suspect wont.It is definitely not the best Final Fantasy game but do get it when its on special.Also Vanille sounds like she belongs in a hentai so when she is in the scene put the volume down or else you'll be explaining urself to your parnter.

												If you are not Japanese and live in Asia, you should go buy this game on Square Enix Online Store where you can get it in English.I dont know why Steam store limited this game in Japanese in all of Asia. Please, not all of us speak Japanese.Seriously, bought this & FF13 II and I had to buy them again on SE Store just for English audio.			"

												I should preface this review by stating that this is my third complete playthrough of this game (All achievements, sidequests etc.) having played through the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions. I played through the Xbox 360 when it first released back in 2010 and then once again in 2013 for PS3 and just completed another 100 hour playthrough for the PC, putting my life total at around 300 hours for this game. Quite a lot of time I must admit, but I feel this game's story and gameplay (despite some flaws) has great replay value and totally justifies coming back and revisiting the world of Cocoon and Gran Pulse every 2-4 years. One of the main points of contention of this game is the 20-25 hours of travelling in corridors until you arrive at Chapter 11 in the story where the game opens up considerably. But I feel the developers made a wise decision in order to get the player to become emotionally invested in the characters. It's my opinion that if the game opened up completely from the outset, the developers would have had a much harder time trying to develop a cohesive narrative. Nonetheless, if you stick with it, the endgame will keep you quite busy with a myriad of freedom and challenges...you just have to endure 10 chapters of running through corridors.The game truly shines in the combat department and you'll indubitably spend most of your time fighting monsters. It can become quite ""grindy"" trying to gather gil for your huge expenditures endgame, but unlike the aforementioned PS3 and Xbox360 versions I played through, the game allows you to switch over to an ""easy"" mode which greatly increases the drop rate from monsters. This helped me shave hours of my completion time versus the previous versions I played. Also, the combat mode (for the most part) requires your full attention and you have to do more than ""repeatedly press x"" in battles. When I am grinding endgame in other final fantasy titles, I tend to use about 10-20% of my attention in non-boss battles whilst reading or some other non-gaming activity. However, this game will require your full engagement throughout. Other reviewers have expressed the pros and cons quite well so I don't need to reiterate them here. To succintly put it; if you are willing to invest some time in the more trying sections of the first half of this game, I feel it can be a rewarding experience.Update: Due to its nature as being quite misunderstood or ""polarizing"" amongst fans of the Final Fantasy series; I've henceforth nominated as ""Most misunderstood game"" for the upcoming Steam Game Awards.

												The first half of this game is more of an interactive movie than a game. That's not such a bad thing, I like interactive movies, but I can see how it would turn most people off.The story is even pretty good, at first. It's an interesting exploration of loss and grief. In first few hours of the game, a group of people is granted tremendous magical powers, but at a terrible price. They lose their freedom, their family, their future, and their place in society. They become outcasts and pariahs, and the military/police have orders to shoot them on sight.Sounds like a pretty compelling setup, right? I thought so. I got sucked in. Even though the areas were all linear and the battle system was dull, I got sucked in. I regret it now, because the story eventually fell apart. Most of the characters' arcs and key moments were bungled. Sazh is an exception, but he wasn't enough to carry the others' dead weight. In true anime fashion, the world made less sense as more of it was revealed, and the twist at the final battle was just idiotic.Eventually, the interactive movie takes a break, and you are dumped into an open world. Neat, right? Except there isn't anything all that compelling to DO out there, and the story kind of takes a break as well. It's boring as hell. It's the section everyone touts as the game's saving grace, and I didn't enjoy it at all. Maybe if I liked the battle system, it would have been a different story, but I really didn't.The battle system works differently than most other RPGs. It doesn't really concern itself with the minutia of players attacking. You can micromanage their actions if you really want to, but you quickly learn that the best results are achieved by mashing the auto-battle and letting the computer sort it out. The paradigm (mode) a character is in determines what attacks are available. So your job is to assemble characters with the right combination of abilities and switch their paradigms at key moments.Again, this could have been interesting, but it wasn't. Most battles are easily won with a simple pattern of paradigms, all the while mashing A as fast as the menu animations allowed. Worse, the equipment system is unorthodox and not at all explained, and it doesn't seem to matter for most of the game. Only certain boss fights and monsters in the open world were even challenging, making equipment upgrades unnecessary for most of the game.Even the visuals were a mixed bag. Some were gorgeous, and some were blah. The one bright spot is the prerendered cut scenes, which are very pretty and quite entertaining. The music is also a mixed bag, sometimes amazing and sometimes unremarkable.So, yeah. This game stinks. Save your money and your time.			"

												This is a fun game, I love just about all the Final Fantasy series games, and this one does not dissapoint. However, the PC version was poorly ported... The U.I. is clunky and one wrong botton push would make the game want to quit. Once you get use to the botton layout the game becomes playable. This is the curse PC suffers, when a console game gets ported to PC, its like the developers don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥or they don't know how to make it work.... So, I said i would recomend this game if this happen to you. Number 1. You had a PS3 but all of a suddent die and now you don't want to waste money on buying a new ps3.Number 2. WHen this game is on sale, I got the game for like 5 dollars or so when there was a steam sale.Number 3, You have a pc controller to play it with... This game with keyboard and mouse is so bad, and one wrong move and you be looking all over the place....Since this two things happen to me and I really wanted to see the end of the game I got it. However DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR IT. It is not worth it. Wait until is on sale OR you could just wait until it gets a remake for PS4 as the HD edition....and then you will have a functional game. But then you will probably have to pay like 50 dollars for it...			"

												Although I have only put in under an hour into this game, I am severly disappointed and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Pros:- You can play this using a Japanese dialog which I think is really cool as not many games allow you to do that these days.- You can use either a controller or a mouse and keyboard (listed as a pro but debatable)Cons:- Only 720p resolution (Yes someone has kindly created a mod that allows you to play in 1080p, but the game should come already with a 1080p option)- Listed as 60fps... It isn't.- Graphics are horrible.- Cut scenes would look remotely decent if it wasn't constant frame tearing from vsync.- The keyboard and mouse option is ♥♥♥♥ing horrendous.- No option to change any of the graphical settings.- One of the worst console ports I've seen over the last few years.- Starts off as an interesting combat system but gets boring after the 1st 4/5 battles.- Only difficulty settings are easy and normal, and normals easy as♥♥♥♥♥♥- Oh yeah did I mention the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics?Conclusion:Just don't buy it at retail price, yes £10 isn't a alot at all but it's not worth that, buy it when it goes half price or lower.

												preface: I play the game in offline mode most of the time; actually been playing for over 10 hours as of writingIt's as awful as people say. I don't feel like I have to give many complex reasons. I'll focus on one: the menus in battles.Even the MENUS are sluggish. Essentially, there are no actions that execute after selecting commands from the main combat menu; there is always at least one sub menu. For example, the ""Attack"" command will lead to a sub-menu displaying the ""Attack"" and ""Blitz"" commands. After selecting the command, you then choose from a list of enemies in another sub-menu to target, which finalizes the actions of a leader character until the ATB refills. Even Auto-attack requires you to choose a target.EVERY MENU HAS A LOAD TIME. There is a fancy animation that plays every time a new sub-menu is opened. You can not, say, input a series of commands from the main menu like down-select-select-down-select and know you'll attack with the basic Attack command to the second closest enemy. Instead, you will only get to the first or second sub menu because the game DOES NOT REGISTER INPUTS WHILE NEW SUB-MENUS LOAD. I am explaining this in extreme detail because it is a hard concept to understand; in a menu-based RPG, how can there be periods of dead input between selections? It's because the game wants to play its fancy animations at the detriment to all gameplay. Even the menus need to sparkle and dance for a half-second after each input, making the game's already glacial pace artificially pad in the most inconcievably basic level. Every other FF game I can think of lets you finesse the ATB system by remembering input sequences for oft-used commands. In this game, you have to button mash just to execute an auto attack (when games released before it have a toggle between auto- and manual-battle, this is especially inexcusable; the auto-battle isn't very automatic).tl;dr THE MENUS ARE LAGGY IN AN RPG WITH MENU BASED COMBATI don't wanna write 10 paragraphs about why this game is bad in every detail because it would be an essay. It's just fundamentally, deeply flawed, down to the damn menus.EDIT: I'm coming around on the game, but I won't change my review score.http://etrosgate.com/ffxiii/basic-overviewEssentially, you need to read this in order to understand the battle system. A lot of mechanics are still obfuscated even beyond this guide with no way to clarify them in-game (for example, how much chain guage damage do skills do? you'll have to look it up on the internet!). Having a poorly explained battle system is almost as bad as just having a bad battle system, though.The game's plot also makes more sense than it seems to, but it's horrible at explaining itself in a logical, ordained way. Which is as bad as having a poorly thought out story.So, the game's still very deeply flawed, but I am now (sometimes) enjoying it after indulging my morbid curiosity.			"

												Game will not work without a game controller (certain type).Says Mouse/Keyboard but it has a constant stutter every second, not just on movie sequences but the entire game. So far the only way to stop this is to have a game controller plugged in which is anywhere from £40-70. Is the game worth that cost, I have to say hell no. "

												Normally I'm a huge fan of Final Fantasy games but this one has really reminded me that Square Enix isn't perfect. It's a complex, weird storyline that jumps around everywhere and not in a good way. They tried to make combat smoother I think but it's super grindy and uninteresting if pretty. Encountering creatures you can't fight early on is interesting but it can make it difficult to tell what is at your level. Boss battles are long and arduous with one mistake making you repeat the entire thing. They've also made it too linear I think and too difficult to get around.I'll finish it eventually but I wouldn't recommend anyone else starting this particular Final Fantasy			"

												This Game is like a good Book. It took you by your Hand an guides u through the surprisingly complex Story. Yes it is linear, yes the port is not perfect and it runs on 720p / 60fps, but this smooth. And it looks beautiful, at least in my opinion. Encountered no bugs / problems so far, my Xbox Controller works fine with it and it feels exactly like a Final Fantasy should feel. lots of people are complaining about the combat system and how it isn't ""FF - like"" but i can't agree. Every single FF i've played so far had some unique kind of battle system, so does this one. The fact that u only control one Party member directly and the other two only indirectly makes the combat system not bad. If you want it easy just press auto fight. I's not the first FF with an Auto Fight option. Otherwise coordinate your Abilities and Combat stances by your self and yes, this can be quiet intresting. At least in my Opinion.Personally i don't regret to buy this. Its a only 12€ Game and i've got enough out of it, to get my money valued already.Out there are Triple A 50 -60€ Games that doesn't can do that, at least not for me.			"

												There is a ""yes"" and a ""no"" rating...  why no ""meh"" rating?I do enjoy the game, and it runs well on my desktop (I appear to be vaguely lucky there).  I really only have two complaints, but it is enough that I wouldn't have purchased the game had I known this in advance.  I'm definitely waiting on FFXIII-2 and FFLR to see if they also have the same issues on the PC.1) 60GB for the game?  That is ridiculously massive, and there is no way I'd be able to store all three games on my main drive and have much room for anything else.  Even for those not running off of SSDs and have space, that is a long time spent downloading one game.2) No options to tune the graphics.  I know a lot of people are complaining about the lack of 1080p, but the game still looks pretty good at 720p.  I'd say it is much more close of a port of the XBOX360 version than the PS3 version, which makes sense considering the platform.  Regardless, it would be nice to tone down some of the options to play on lower end computers.  The framerate was terrible on my gaming laptop, and I had to give up on trying to play there.			"

												I am sorry Square Enix, but i have to write this.Ill be short. I love Final Fantasy and i was waiting for FF 13 as a small child.Im not gonna mention the graphic and the resolution issues, i don play RPGs for graphic.-Pros: 1. Its Final Fantasy2. Visuals - awesome3. Cinematics - awesome4. Combat - awesome , new , fresh, chalanging5. Music - awesome, Final Fantasy standard6. Linear - yes u heard me. I did know the game will be linear and i bought it. Its like u watch an interactive movie.7. Very good menu control with mouse. Left click right click-Cons (spoilers)1. Console based - u move like moroon, u cant go where u want, invisible walls2. Linear - Yes LINEAR even the DIABLO is linear and u can go for ♥♥♥♥ing side quests. Here is nothing. Sometimes i have    feel thet the game plays itself. U have no control. U cant even go 5 meters to the side. U are in linear tunnel. Its like a railroad game3. No towns, no shops u just go straight forward.4. 10 chapters of the game u cant choose your party, and what is worse u cant change your leader. Once u get familiar with your curent party the game takes them from u. The game gives u another memmbers and  doesnt take carap about if u did spend all theyr CP points. You appear straight in the middle of the battle nad noone asks u if u are ready.5 Leveling - the leveling is interesting with one minor issue. Its a total crap. U just add more points and there are no crossroads. Do i wanna go fire magic or do i wanna go water magic. No you just add points and thats it. This is a travesty to the RPG. FF 12 had a great leveling system u could become anything here u will become the fabricated character.6. Level design - There is no level design. There are just textures in different tunnels. Each tunnel has 5-10 battles than u go to another tunnel. No chests or secrets. When u see an dead end on the map u are sure there will be chest. U cant go anywhere, the game forces u to go only straight forward. ( u can go back obviously:-) )7 - movement - clasic console based - terrible. U cant jump. The game jumps automaticly. U have to aim precisly if u want to go inside some entrance. 8 -  and many more...sry guys im so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off on Square Enix, that i cant even finish this review. Sry for the gramar too im not english born.OK final result. Im NOT recommending this game. If u never ever played a Final Fantasy game dont even try it, it will disguse you.WHen u are FF fan as me try it, may be u will like it but i warned you. I really wanted to love this game so much but i just cant guys just cant.5/10 its an awerage rpg with great battle system and the worst overall gameplay i ever experienced. "

												i heard a lot of bad stuff about this game before finally playing it for the first time on steam. but you know haters are gonna hate, and im glad i didnt listen. first of all, the battle system is fantastic. yes there is an option on your battle menu labeled ""autobattle"". it feels cheap and boring at the start of the game but you'll understand it once you reach the third area or so and the battlemechanics are expanded a bit. you'll want to use it often and it by no means fights your battles for you. most of your strategy will go into paradigms. and theres plenty of it. later in the game youll also find yourself canceling attacks or attacking early in response to events as battles progress, and youll also find yourself more frequently going into the menues and setting up specific attacks for certain situations. at the very least i found this battle system to be far more engaging than that of titles like FFX or FFIX. its also much faster paced. battles are meant to be fought as quickly as possible and youll actually find yourself taking advantage of and strategizing around the various strengths and weaknesses of each enemy, which is something that provided very little benifit in most games as I usually found most final fantasies became more and more button mashers towards their endgames, whereas this one seems to get more complex as the game goes on. the game rewards you for defeating enemies faster. it also penalizes you with doom if a battle drags on for too long, but ive only very rarely encountered this, and i actually consider this a pro as its usually a good sign that your missing something and forces you to reconsider and improve your strategy. even then, most of the time i still managed to defeat the boss before time ran out. gone are the days of literally wasting an hour on a single boss battle, or even multiple hours on superboss battles, as even most of these will be no more than 10 - 15 minutes.that said, this brings me to what i consider to be the only major cons to the game as well. first of all, you can only ever control one character in battle. and while you can change who is the lead character, its a long ways into the game before you get that ability, or any control over your party for that matter. this wouldnt be a major issue in my opinion however, if it werent for my next con. the biggest con in this game is that you cant save your party configurations. this means that anytime you change out party members, you also have to re-setup all your paradigm settings. because of this, i generally found my self sticking with one group configuration whenever possible and continuously refining my paradigms and strategies with that one group rather than trading out characters and playing as all the different characters to take full advantage of their different character strengths and paradigms.all in all, yes this game is pretty different from the other final fantasies. but not really any more so than they are from each other.like all final fantasies this game also has a fantastic story. in fact i would rate it among my favorites next to 9 and 10 as far as story goes. and while japanese voices is an option, i actually found the english voice actors to be very good in this one, with no memorable cringeworthy moments. the story is also serious and deals with some pretty down to earth emotions. the characters of lightning, hope, and sahz are some of the deepest and best developed characters in the entire series in my opinion. lightning even beat sqall in becoming my favorite protagonist of the series.since this is a port, something has to be said for port quality. shortly after release, they released an update to allow higher resolutions. however, there are still some issues, which i dont expect to be fixed at this point, regarding that update, particularily one involving scan notes that keeps me from taking full advantage of it. for some reason, on my machine anyways, any resolution above 1280x800 causes the notes to disappear from the enemy details screen when using libra. this is especially problematic since, as i mentioned before, playing off your enemies strengths and weaknesses is an important part of the battle system in this game. most importantly, the summon battles become practically unwinnable without some critical information that is provided in those notes.that said, even playing at 1280x720 on my 1080p monitor, the graphics are surprisingly good, impressive even, and the scaling is hardly noticable. even though for me, most other games ive played are almost unbearable at such low resolutions. ive also only very rarely noticed any of the frame rate issues or lag that most other people complain about so excessively. Edit: it occurred to me that since I've discussed performance in this review, I should list my system specs. So those have been added at the bottom of the review.last but not least, and perhaps most surprising, the mouse and keyboard controls are good. and i dont just mean for a port, but good in general. its unfortunate that they didnt stick with these controls for the pc ports of xiii-2 and LR. i'll probably have to find some way to get a controller working for those before i can get more into them. but as for this game, well, i was fully intending to play this game with a controller like every other final fantasy id ever played, but i started a game without setting it up at first just to see how it ran and try it out really quick and not only was i completely satisfied, i was very impressed with the pc keyboard and mouse control sceme they came up with. in fact, i played the whole game through using mouse and keyboard. its easily the most satisfying ported controls of any ported game ive played on pc. other ports need to take some notes on this one. very dissappointed that xiii-2 and LR didnt follow suit.overall, this game was very enjoyable for me and i highly recommend it for anyone whos interested in jrpgs.My system specs:AMD fx-4100 quad-core OC'd @4GHzAMD Radeon HD 77908GB RAM DDR3 1866MHz Dual channelSeagate barracuda SATA 2 HDD 7200RPMWindows 10 64bit OS			"

												+ Great sci-fi fantasy lore+ Great atmosphere+ Great story concept+ Gorgeous designs+ Stunning CGI sequences+ Decent amount of endgame content- Terribly optimized port- Story, lore and characters are not easy to get into- Awkward dialogue- Some uninteresting characters- Flawed battle system- Terrible level designs, takes more than 20h for them to get interesting- Too many pre-rendered sequences (not all are CGI)Verdict: People might actually think that I don't like FFXIII, but it's the other way around. Out of the three from the Lightning Saga, XIII is my favorite because of its atmosphere, lore and world. All the nonsense added in XIII-2 didn't appeal to me (not to mention that the story was far more confusing than XIII's in many aspects) and Nova Chrysalia, while gorgeous and with a stabe lore, didn't feel as great as the original party's fight against fate. XIII has problems though, starting with its extremely linear nature and flawed battle system (which was greatly improved in XIII-2). Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a good linear game and I understand that many previous FFs had a linear nature even though they were open world, but the early level designs of XIII are really just terrible (as many would put it, ""it's like being on rails""). The story and lore can also be a problem for some people as they're not easy to get into. The story requires a lot of interpretation, while much of the lore is hidden behind datalog entries. General FF fans are not used to either as previous entries in the franchise were pretty straightforward with their stories and didn't have a very deep lore, or at least not deep enough to require a detailed explanation through walls of text. The last problem is that the game is just too big for Western Steam users. A 50GB download is absurd for a game this old, which shouldn't be necessary because many of the pre-rendered cutscenes could run on the engine if Square Enix made the effort. Alternatively, they should've provided the Japanese VOs as a free DLC.All in all, is not that easy of a game to get into and newcomers may need the help of other players and/or wikia to understand what's going on. If you play this without being spoiled by haters and can get over its performance issues (which are not as bad as XIII-2's, but are still there), it's a hell of a game with high production values. Fans of sci-fi fantasy might find the lore appealing and the environments, breathtaking.			"

A lot of mechanics are still obfuscated even beyond this guide with no way to clarify them in-game (for example, how much chain guage damage do skills do? you'll have to look it up on the internet!). Having a poorly explained battle system is almost as bad as just having a bad battle system, though.The game's plot also makes more sense than it seems to, but it's horrible at explaining itself in a logical, ordained way. Which is as bad as having a poorly thought out story.So, the game's still very deeply flawed, but I am now (sometimes) enjoying it after indulging my morbid curiosity.			"

												Although I have only put in under an hour into this game, I am severly disappointed and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Pros:- You can play this using a Japanese dialog which I think is really cool as not many games allow you to do that these days.- You can use either a controller or a mouse and keyboard (listed as a pro but debatable)Cons:- Only 720p resolution (Yes someone has kindly created a mod that allows you to play in 1080p, but the game should come already with a 1080p option)- Listed as 60fps... It isn't.- Graphics are horrible.- Cut scenes would look remotely decent if it wasn't constant frame tearing from vsync.- The keyboard and mouse option is ♥♥♥♥ing horrendous.- No option to change any of the graphical settings.- One of the worst console ports I've seen over the last few years.- Starts off as an interesting combat system but gets boring after the 1st 4/5 battles.- Only difficulty settings are easy and normal, and normals easy as♥♥♥♥♥♥- Oh yeah did I mention the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics?Conclusion:Just don't buy it at retail price, yes £10 isn't a alot at all but it's not worth that, buy it when it goes half price or lower.

												FFXIII just doesn't feel like a Final Fantasy at all.The combat is mind-numbingly dull, if you lose a battle there are no consequences at all. The game is just really linear, there's no exploration or freedom to do whatever. The maps are pitiful. The tutorial is way too long and it just holds you hand way too much. There are barely any NPCs at all, just tons of mobs to kill and grind. No towns in which to rest or talk to NPCs or do sidequests. There aren't any mini-games with chocobos. No Triple Triad for god's sake. Look, graphically, it's great yeah but that's all it has going. The music is okay, not bad, not great tho.Most of the characters are terribly written and not likeable at all. The story is poor and the storytelling is even worse, there is no immersion in the game, there is no exploration and you can't customize♥♥♥♥♥♥I bought this FF on sale, wouldn't pay full price even if my life was on the line. Just, no. "

												8/10 for the newest Final Fantasy series from console platforms. It's difficult to say that overall it's good enough to be a RPG game on PC platform or not...!8/10 for the new style of RPG gaming. It had features that unlike other RPG games. I was excited for the new things I saw in Final Fantasy XIII. I did not feel tired or boring while playing this game.9/10 for the soundtrack, BGM, effect, character voices. All sound is unique. I can feel it8/10 for the designing. The characters, monster, skills, colors, lighting, clothings, fighting, as well as details in various locations. Those things look great. Amazing and Awesome. However, I feel that there are some places too narrow. It seems like action more than RPG. Sometimes you can not avoid monsters. You have to fight with no choice. That's why everyone often need to save the file.7/10 for the storyline and plot. When you play forward, you will know the story of each character, That's very common. The disadvantages of playing FFXIII is mission and side story. It will be available at the end. So, if you feel tired or unable to continue, you will miss all of them. As I said, this JRPG game was made to look like an action game.			"

												Don't buy this game if you dislike stuttering or frame drops. I have a good computer, but this game sutters really bad. I've looked online and it effects a lot of people.  I wish developers were less lazy with ports like this.  I saw there is a trick you can do involving unplugging a controller, starting the game, closing the game, then plugging in a controller and starting the game again.  But that hasn't worked for me.  You shouldn't have to go through that trouble to play a game, anyways.			"

												I Have a bit of this game to finish, But i want to write a review so that i dont waste my freetime typing out a long list of why i enjoyed the game, so im gonna do it earlier...First of all, this is a RPG, Which means you have to grind ALOT!!! Which the problem for me is... i didn't grind till the 5th chapter...But that made it alot harder for me to beat the chapter 6 boss... so that mistake went into me making a schedule for a whole day of grinding and focusing on the enemy attacks, which is hard for me since i forget most of the enemy attacks, which brings me onto the next point...ENEMIES.WILL.THROW.EVERYTHING.AT.YOU! No matter if your ready or not, enemies will throw anything at you which makes it really hard to remember there order of attacks. Why? Because the order is random. (At least for me) So if you want to remember every single attack, welp good luck, as this can take Hours upon end... Believe me, i almost ripped my hair because of one boss... so that was very painful for my head and now that im saying this it just tells that i may be a little bit crazy... ANYWAY!Instead of talking about the main game... Lets talk about the parts that are good, or just awful...+Soundtrack is just amazing, when your not battling, the music is very peaceful.+When you get junk from enemies (cloth, tears, etc...) You can go to the same save station and upgrade weapons and little accessories you can find in little floating bubbles. (The upgrade station is later on in the game while the items are already there) +There are weapons and accessories that are either very useful, useless, powerful or just plain crap+Bosses are a neat little challenge, so are some smaller enemies and mini bosses--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Battle system is kinda weird to use for me personally, for you it might be good or the same like me-One enemy in a chapter is so hard to beat that even the GAME warns you about him, but there right, STAY AWAY UNLESS YOU HAVE A GOOD WAY OF BEATING HIM!Thats all i have to write, so here's my little tip (as a bonus ^^)Stay away from this game if you dont have alot of time for it, or dont have the money. otherwise, buy it. its fun!

												Boring characters, I knew it was bad when I realized I skipped a cutscene I hadn't watched before because it was annoying.Also don't bother unless you have an i7 6700k for a game released in 2010 or 2014 given on how you want to interpret it, or expect to get framerate drops.And this is coming from someone with a i5 4690k, which is far from low end and I still get drops to the 30s.

												Final Fantasy XIII is a linear JRPG with some tweaks, one of my favorite mechanics is the gear upgrade system, where you use creature parts that you take as loot and make your weapons stronger. Unfortunately this system was badly balanced, making it uninteresting to play with. The scaling of the game chapters made leveling up a waste of time, artificially increasing gameplay time with repetitive battles against the same creatures in different collors. The Paradigm system is a nice take, but waiting seconds for it to happen every single battle, multiple times, transforms it into a painful experience more than an interesting one.Overall is not a bad game, but for 50h+ in order to beat it, you might as well just watch the whole thing on Youtube!

												Slight Spoilers within!I have a love/hate relationship with this game. Like most Final Fantasy's before it, I think the story is well written and the graphics are stunning and beautifully executed. I like the fighting system, despite it feeling sometimes over-simplified (I like having more control over my party during a battle, but it's something I'm willing to overlook). The one thing I can't stand is how linear this game is for the first 20-30 hours. It is without a doubt the longest tutorial I have ever seen. It would have been nice to see them attempt to make Cocoon more open with more areas to explore. Instead for the first 30 hours you are forced to go from A to B in what is essentially a straight line. It would have been cool to maybe have different paths and choices on how to get from A to B. That being said, once you get to Pulse it gets better and becomes more like the Final Fantasy we know. You just have to get through 30 hours of linear gameplay. I'm happy to see Square Enix patched this port with more options, but the keyboard controls are clunky. Use a controller if you have one; you're better off. Overall, despite it's flaws, this game is enjoyable...after 30 hours.   7/10			"

												(Important Note - The game is a barebones port and has barely any graphical options and is locked to 1280x720 resolution. You can force a few graphical settings through Nvidia Control Panel or AMD Catalyst though.)(Update - It seems a lot of people have problems with game looking really bad. I recommended it originally because the game looked nice on my end without any tweaking but it seems to be not the case for everyone. If you don't mind trying to tweak the settings in Nvidia Control Panel or AMD Catalyst, the game can look really good and I do recommend it but otherwise I definitely say you should wait for a patch to the game before buying. A Square Enix developer said they are looking into adding more resolution options and potentially more graphical options. Until then, I don't recommend it unless you don't mind playing with Nvidia Control or AMD Catalyst settings which may or may not work for everyone.)For me, I used Nvidia Control Panel, go to ""Manage 3D Settings"" and click the ""Program Settings"" tab and click ""Add"" and select ""Final Fantasy XIII"" (and make sure it is selected when you are changing the settings, ""don't use the mousewheel"" as you may accidentally move to other programs). It seems the major settings which help is to set ""Texture filtering - Negative LOD bias"" to ""Allow"" and ""Anisotrpic filtering"" to ""16x"" (or at least 4x) and ""Anisotropic sample optimization"" to ""Off"". A few other options is ""Power Manager Mode - Prefer maximum performance"" (this should fix FMV stuttering in case you have it). A few other settings that may help are ""Antialiasing - FXAA"" to ""On"", ""Antialiasing - Setting"" to the highest values. ""Antialiasing - Mode"" to ""Override any application settings"". ""Texture filtering - High Quality"".It seems the major setting though is make sure ""Texture filtering - Negative LOD bias"" is set to ""Allow"" and ""Anisotropic sample optimization"" set to ""Off"". Try playing with the settings in Nvidia Control Panel or AMD Catalyst to see if any of those settings help. Those are the settings I use and the game looks great.Due to a lot of potential settings fiddling, I don't recommend the game yet until Square-Enix releases more graphical options, which a developer said they are looking into. The main issue though is the lack of resolution settings and borderless windowed mode (plus sound settings).(If you don't mind it and really want to play FFXIII, you can fiddle with the settings and the game can look great but I still recommend you wait for an official patch for the game before buying, especially if it is your first time playing it since it'll be best to wait until FFXIII is at its best before trying.)(Older Review Below.)A few important things to know before buying and/or playing the game:1. The PC port is bare but if you want to play FFXIII and don't have a console, it's decent and playable.There is no borderless windowed mode (only just one regular windowed mode which you can't resize). You also can't set the resolution or change any display settings besides full screen and windowed. Game is also locked to 1280x720 resolution but the devs said they are looking into it and potentially add a patch to allow scaling to other resolutions.My monitor and desktop resolution is natively at 1920x1080 and the game still looks fairly decent at 1280x720 (my Nvidia control settings is set to scale full screen games in Aspect Ratio mode under ""Adjust desktop size and position"" settings, for those with Nvidia cards - So the game plays without black borders).2. The PC version really lacks a lot of customization settings. For example, you can only change a few keybinds (not all of them). You can't change certain keybinds like the cancel button (it's Backspace my default and it seems you can't change it). This is sort of a big deal since you'll be using the cancel button a lot (going out of menus, going out of the map, etc), so you'll have to get used to using that key a lot. Also, don't accidentally press esc or you will exit the game without any confirmation. Update - I noticed you can use the mouse. I set ""H"" to Pause"" and ""T"" to ""View Enemy Intel"" and ""Tab"" for Paradigm Shift / use Shrouds. ""Open Area Map"" is set to ""4"" (these are settings under Keyboard config in game). With Mouse, I can use WASD for movement + Cursor and ""left click"" for ""confirm"" and ""right click"" for cancel and I can use the mouse for camera. I highly recommend playing the game with a controller but I have gotten used to the keyboard controls after 2 hours of play, so even if you don't have a controller it's not too bad (just don't accidentally press ""Esc"" or else it exits the game without saving). Most of the keys can be rebound though. The keys you can't rebind are the camera (Numberpad), the cancel button (Backspace), the confirm button (Enter), movement (WASD), and cursor (arrow keys or WASD).Besides that, the game really runs well and I haven't really noticed any problems. Just a few things to note (you can get used to the keyboard controls easily but it does take some time to get used to).It is a bare bones port but I haven't noticed any errors and the frame rate is smooth for me, so it is playable.My computer specs are:Windows 7Intel Core i5-3750k8GB RAMGTX 750TINow on to the game itself:3. It is recommended you set the default battle command to ""Ability"" and not ""Auto-Battle"" (under settings). While this won't make the game that much deeper, it can make the gameplay a lot more interactive and fun if you input the commands manually rather than selecting Auto-Battle. Of course there are times when you can use Auto-Battle and it can remove the tedium of having to manually select or use abilities (especially later in the game or when you just want to apply a bunch of debuffs quickly). For most cases though, it is definitely a lot more fun (especially in the early game when there's not as many abilities) if you select the abilities manually rather than using Auto-Battle.Personally this made the game a lot more fun for me.4. The game is really linear and there's almost no customization until near the very end of the game. You only control one character at once and you cannot switch between characters mid battle (FFXIII-2, you can switch between characters mid battle but you still only control one at a time). Plus, you only have two characters with you for the majority of the game and you are limited to three paradigm roles per character for most of the game too. Finally, while the summons are visually impressive in this game, they are really impractical to use and aren't all that viable in the majority of battles (at most, you can get a few free attacks in but it's nothing like the previous Final Fantasy games where you can use summons as much as you want). There are a few viable strategies involving summons later in the game but it still isn't as fun or usable as in the previous Final Fantasy games.However, if you don't mind the above and if you are are prepared for lots of cutscenes and dialogue, then you'll probably enjoy the game. I've known about this before I played FFXIII and I definitely enjoyed the game a lot despite those facts. Near the end of the game, there are a lot of optional bosses and enemies you can fight and there's a bit more customization. Plus, the battles (some of them) are a lot fun and fast paced too. Taking note of the above - If the linearity of the game, lack of customization, and the numerous amount of cutscenes don't scare you away, then you'll probably enjoy the game. It is around a 20-40 hour game (20 hour game if you skip all the optional stuff near the end of the game) and it is probably over a 70 hour game if you want to get all the achievements and fight all the optional bosses as well as max out all accessories and ultimate weapons.

												Casual Fantasy XIII or Corridor Simulator XIII. The J-RPG genre went astray. Completed straight when it first came out in 360, but I can't continue further this time: --Little to no spoilers---Flat and childish characters (Sazh is the only credible man in the game, and he still is a worse version of Barret -background, story and battle wise).-Super convoluted story. S-E ""tryharded"" too much and ended with a bunch of nonsense premises.-0 difficulty and near to 0 customization makes this game boring. If you die you can restart right before the battle, the character stat/skills development is castrated and unlocks progressively because narrative reasons. No random battles, but level programmed -and easily avoidable- battles instead. You don't even need to shop until you are 30 hours into the game, etc...-Poor level design in terms of gameplay. Long corridors with short branches that always lead you to treasures.-Eidolons and weapons. Everything in this damn game is a Transformer. That's one of the worst ideas I've ever seen, not in a FF, but the entire RPG genre. The game suffers from that. ""-Hey guys, what about the MC wears a blade? -Hey, better, what about a compact gun-blade? And Odin can morph into a horse too! EPIC!"".-Combat is dynamic, but repetitive and unrewarding. The stagger system brings something but it isn't enough.-The class system in this game is done badly. There is no Physical class and Magic class, just non-elemental mixed attacker and elemental mixed attacker. Then there is a full healer, full tank, full support and full disrupter.-PRESSING ""ESC"" BUTTON CLOSES THE GAME. FOR REAL? I MEAN, F-O-R R-E-A-L.There's a bunch of things i won't criticize because I tilt too much; let's talk about the goodies.+Beautiful grapichs, even now they are somewhat charming and impressive. Nice scenarios, good character face details. I don't like the context nor the futuristic setting, but that is too personal to be relevant.+The OST fitted the game perfectly and has some of the best tracks of the series and pretty much every theme is enjoyable. He's not Nobuo Uematsu, but Masashi Hamauzu performed.+If you survive the early and mid game, the game becomes not-so-terrible. Some sidequests and challenging battles open in the majestic Gran Pulse. "

												I can't recommend this game until Square-Enix does soemthing to fix the settings. The game ran at 1080p on PS3 almost 5 years ago. Sure, there's some 3rd party fixes, and the game is still technically playable, but I really think the developer should step in and correct this.  I mean, FFVIII for Pc can run in 1080p and has a few graphical tweaks you can enable or disable, and that games 15 years old.  It just doesn't make any sense. The game itself is exactly as it was in 2009, warts and all. I'd give it an 8/10 and it's probably my 4th or 5th favorite entry in the series. So if the lack of any real graphical options and the fact that hitting Esc ends the game abruptly (It does this.) doesn't bother you, then go for it,			"

												shame the game is a lame.The story is full of holes, things happen without a reason and are not explained why.The walking system is ridiculous, the characters change direction at their own will in a circlish movement.The battle system is even more ridiculous, has NO inteligence at all... RPG are all about inteligence, but in this game, all you do is press 2 buttons and you'r good.The enemies are ridiculous too because they are not different from one another, they just change color! was ff13 build on an overnight???Also, the movement of the camera during battles is anoying... when the enemies are bigger or when we throw them in the air, we just stop seeing them! and we can't see the damage they are taking, wtf??? who would design huge monsters and not back the game to support the idea?Final fantasy 7, 8, 4. You had to think, you had to stop for a while to understand what was going on, where to go, what choice to make, and it was thrilling. The songs made we feel fear, first mission of FF7 gives me shivers until today.Sad to see that final fantasy became a one button push game.To do not be so negative, the image is splendid, very nice beautifull images and scenes.

												Slight Spoilers within!I have a love/hate relationship with this game. Like most Final Fantasy's before it, I think the story is well written and the graphics are stunning and beautifully executed. I like the fighting system, despite it feeling sometimes over-simplified (I like having more control over my party during a battle, but it's something I'm willing to overlook). The one thing I can't stand is how linear this game is for the first 20-30 hours. It is without a doubt the longest tutorial I have ever seen. It would have been nice to see them attempt to make Cocoon more open with more areas to explore. Instead for the first 30 hours you are forced to go from A to B in what is essentially a straight line. It would have been cool to maybe have different paths and choices on how to get from A to B. That being said, once you get to Pulse it gets better and becomes more like the Final Fantasy we know. You just have to get through 30 hours of linear gameplay. I'm happy to see Square Enix patched this port with more options, but the keyboard controls are clunky. Use a controller if you have one; you're better off. Overall, despite it's flaws, this game is enjoyable...after 30 hours.   7/10			"

												A lot of people hate this game because it breaks the norm for most JRPGs established clichés: No towns (in the common way you percieve them), barely any NPCs, no exp./levels, no money after battles, No MP, total restoration of HP/ailments after battles... how a game so weird can be good? Well surprise, because for me it is.One of the best FF story, nice music (still worse than Uematsu's works, anyway), and a system that it's all about the combat: which equipment and paradigms to choose, when to change them, which attacks/magics to use effectively to chain combos... all of this in a TIMED fashion that forces you to think quickly if you want the best and safest results.Sure, auto-battle is there but you won't last long if you only use that.The bad part is that the game is very demanding: easy and linear until you reach Chapter 11 of 13 about 20 hours into the game. A turn off to some people but in my opinion if you're not willing to spend 20 hours into a game you should play another genre instead of RPGs.			"

												I try to like this game. As a fan of the final fantasy series ever since the snes, I feel I'm required to cling on to the franchise and ignore the fact that it's turning into something I don't like.I played through the game on xbox back when it was new. I bought it again now on steam and restarted for the sake of actually getting the story. And seven hours in, I feel that I really don't care about the story. Yes, final fantasy games have hardly ever been at shakespearian levels of character motivation, but we don't need that. We just need some reason _at all_ to go into the world, be it because your imaginary boyfriend might be real after all, robin williams told us to scrag his wife, or because our childhood girlfriend has a great rack.Lightning has none of this. No reason at all known to the player why we should move forwards. Which is a shame, since moving forwards is the only gameplay available. Har har.And so, with no further info than the fact that she's angry at something, we follow clip-clop through the world. A beautiful world full of rich details, wonderful landscapes, and a massive backstory. None of which makes any real impact. We don't know why clip-clop does what she does-. We don't know which external harddrive is on our side and which aren't, and we don't know why it's so imperative that we complete our quest. We wallow in the world, letting things flow over us, but not really absorbing anything because we have no starting motivation we can attach further knowledge to.I'd say that the story is bad. I'd say that the world is bland. I'd say that the characters are badly written or hard to emphasize with. But really: the setting and the story is just wasted effort. A whole ton of writing and design which goes unappreciated because we have no reason to pay attention.What we are left with in the end is a pretty picture, a combat system which is a good take on the job&paradigm systems of previous games but ultimately so disconnected from the story it might as well be skipped altogether, and a whole lot of backstory which is basically getting in the way of trying to figure out the story.Bonus points for the game: It really is a beautiful game, and it runs nicely on older hardware. Even my busted up old rig can handle the 30fps cap on 4k resolution. Clip-clop punches the most dislikable character in final fantasy games since Gilgamesh. Shiva has turned into two hot chicks who scissor into a motorcycle on demand. The battle system is different from previous games, and actually somewhat balanced for once. There's a whole lot of gaming hours for the asking price.I tagged the game as not recommended, but really; for its flaws, it's a definite maybe.			"

												Plot is weak, characters are annoying and flat, you get railroaded everywhere (literally, maps are just corridors - apparently there is ONE map in the late game that concentrates ALL of the exploring you can do in the game), combat is underwhelming and pretty one-dimensional. Overall, I regret buying this.			"

												Before I start this review, I will let you know I'm addicted to this game and series for various reasons, so expect moderate to high level of bias. I will try my best to explain WHY i enjoyed it because there are a lot of things that this game does well and you the reader will be able to gouge if it is something you would fancy or not.Story: good and bad The game has a strong well developed story. The main story and narative is quite complex and it does a lot of reminiscing and going back and forth between past and present. I found this enjoyable as it replicated to a small scale how we often remember specific moments from the past in different situations. It's not just that the game flings you into flashbacks, it does it when it generally makes sense. One of the characters is going through a specific conflict or hardship, here's a flashback letting you know how some of those feelings and thoughts came to be. It adds to the experience, not detracts from it.That being said, I've heard a lot of people complaining about this and I can see why some did not like it. There's a lot to keep track of and the number of cutscenes and flashbacks is quite high. If you're not on the ball, the story can become complicated and convoluted really fast. You NEED to pay attention to it, it's not spoon fed to you.There are also special entries in the datalog section explaining various aspects of the world. These are small pieces of text regarding locations, characters, deities folklore and more. These offer quite a bit of information about the world but it's not for everyone. If you're the kind of person who likes reading books in Skyrim in addition to talking to people it's great, if you dont' care for it, it sucks. And the bad thing about this is that a reasonable amout of information, especially in the later part of the game, is only really explained in these entries.Bear in mind however that these are only added information to make the world richer, it's not really needed to experience the story. You don't really need to know how NORA came to be or what each Fal'Cie's function is, but it's fullfilling to know a little more.Characters: Really good Personally i found them realistic and sometimes annoyingly so. Most complaints people have tend to partake to Hope a very very young boy going through some very turbulent times and emotions and Vanille, a character with a ton of internal conflicts. Both of these character often annoyed the people who played the game, myself included: Hope can be extremely whiny and Vanille seems to be a walking oximoron with so much double-think it makes your head spin. And that's fine! As you progress through the story and understand more and more about the characters, the world and their situation, it starts making sense and you warm up to them. While avoiding spoilers it's important to note that the characters are thrust into a situation that is pretty much ""Us versus the entire world"". In such a setting, where everyone you meet can turn a handshake into a potential knife at your throat, these conflicting and often irrational behaviors are ""normal"" or at least expected and plausible. I really can't stress this enough. The story is heavy and it doesn't tell you how to feel, you have to put in a bit of effort to understand it. But once you do, it is oh so rewarding.Gameplay: A rough diamond, no exagerationAs someone who works in Games QA, I didn't get to play a game with a system as rewarding as XIII's. From a design point it's so great I could talk about it for weeks on end, but i will try to keep it as short as possible.The basics are very simple to pick up and understand. Use elemental magic and attacks (Ravager) to stagger enemies ( staggered enemies take more damage and in various cases become weak to a few or more types of attacks) use non-aspected attacks and magic (Commando) to deal tons of damage. Use buffs and Debuffs to take less damage or deal more. Straight forward, easy to pick up. The beauty of the system is its depth however. There are so many ways to defeat enemies it's hard to describe. The intersectionality between item functionality, abilities, buffs and debuffs allows for countless customization. But that's not all. There are a lof of small aspects that can easily go unnoticed as well. Every character has unique animations for its attacks which makes some characters exceptionally strong in specific scenarios. Snow for instance has a very fast casting animation, while Sazh Blitz ability is a hail of bullets resulting in multiple smaller attacks. Even abilities themselves have shorter/longer animations or impact timers. Switching between paradigms gives you an ATB refresh if done correctly which reduces downtime between attacks for instance. Learning these small secrets adds a whole new dynamic to how you perform in battle. A 5 minute fight can suddenly become a 30 second stomp simply by using the right abilities and aproach. In this sense the game is more about understanding the system and less so about the actual execution. You don't need fast reflexes or specific timings most of the time. Difficulty: Very easy, very boring or very frustratingBecause of what i also mentioned above the difficulty can vary drastically. There are some tactics that will work on most enemies and encounters, making it very boring to go through when you can just repeat one patern to win. Using said patterns can be very frustrating however when you fight some of the mobs that require more unorthodox approaches. All of a sudden you find yourself hitting a brick wall because you didn't explore the system enough. The combat mechanic is designed so that you abuse the various enemies weaknesses, and some of them don't flaunt their weaknesses on their sleeves. Once you understand the system and the enemies, the game becomes almost trivial. There are only a handfull of enemies that can be considered hard and none of them amount to anything you would call a superboss, unless you intentionally go there unprepared in which case they can be devastating.Music: It's a Final Fantasy gameHonestly, that's all you need to know. Like every other game in the series, Final Fantasy XIII has a beautiful soundtrack. If you're familiar with the series you won't be dissapointed, if you're new to it, you will likely end up loving it.Voice over: Play it in english, no reallyThis game is one of few ""foreign"" games i would actually recommend playing in English. The main reasoning behind this is because there are several characters that don't feel, look or act asian/japanese. Sazh is a clear example of this. Aside from some hickups on Vanille's part where she sometimes switches accents, (she and Fang are not from the same ""world"" as the rest of the characters so the accent may be intentional) the english VO fits the characters and their personalities.Linear Gameplay vs. Open World The vast majority of the game is linear. Others have said it and it bears repeating. If you like your RPGs westernized with tons of exploration, XIII isn't the game you're looking for. The game only opens up late into the playthrough, chapter 11 to be specific. Even then, the exploration aspect is minimal and most of the available optional content is mission/quest based where you're only tasked to kill monsters. However i find this also a strong point. It makes missing items/objectives less of an issue. If you like unlocking all achievements on a game, or want to do it for the first time, this game is a fairly good place to start. Not too easy to ""plat"" not too hard.VerdictAll in all i would definitely recommend this game to the right people. It's a good game and it gets a lot of things right, but while I say that, i must also admit that some of its strengths can also be its weaknesses.			"

												This is one of my favorite Final Fantasy games. It gets a lot of hate due to being very linear, and that is an admitted flaw of the game, but beyond that it has what I think is a fantastic story. I primarily play games for their stories and not to spend hundreds of hours doing trash-mob battles so I can just mow through the rest of the game. I heartly recommend FFXIII to anyone who likes RPGs, and I'd suggest people who wrote it off to go back and play it again for the story this time, you'll probably enjoy it a lot more.			"

												I'd only recommend this game to FF fans only.Long story short:Storyline: Well written. Don't expect anything non-linear it's Final Fantasy we're talking here.Graphics: Exceptional when you take into account the original release date of the game.Combat: Combat is challenging. Not only because you need to adjust your tactics depending on the situation but also because the combat system is close to trash. When you switch speed to slow it is acceptable but on normal speed it is not shining at all. Forget about timing and precision because the system is not build with those two words in mind. Apart from that even routine battles take too much time due to the opponent staggering mechanic where you have to fill a stagger-bar in order to inflict more damage to the enemies. The catch here is that very often it takes forever to build up even when you select the proper roles for each party member making even easy battles last way longer than they are supposed to.Overall: A good game in overall but since most of the time you will be battling opponents utilizing a combat system which is pretty frustrating most of the time I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but FF fans like myself.

												I think most people here have already addressed most of the issues, downsides, and upsides.My only gripe with it right now is that you can't customize gamepad controls. That's like the most basic thing I expected from a port. Had low expectations and still disappointed. You just have to get used to the controls they have mapped on your gamepad. It works nice on xbox controller, but on other type it gets a bit awkward. Controls on keyboard is okay. But if you're like me, and accidentally tap Esc on reflex to open the menu every now and then, then it gets quite stressful when you accidentally exit the game when you don't intend to.Not recommending this game at the moment. Probably later when they patch or someone else come up with something to cope with this problem. But I guess if you need something outside official stuff to run the game properly, that still makes it a terrible release. But if you think 15 bucks is worth all the trouble, or if you just need to get it over with because its Final Fantasy, by all means go for it.			"

												terrible terrible game. Hard to call it a game when you have so little choices to make. It was hard to force my self to play through it. the controls for walking around are terrible and the camera sucked at following where i was going which is really sad because there is only one freaking way to go haha. it was like watching a movie that made no sense at all but to watch it you have to walk down a senseless path that doesn't even lead anywhere. and once you get to the end of the path another part of the senseless movie will play. The characters were developed in a sense to cause appeal. like everything was trying to be a hilarious sunflower or dramatic senseless lover or just a plain please hate me I've gone full retard and lets kill everbodys children so we can save the world kind of characters. No idea who anyone was or why they were there or what the hell was going on. Nothing was explained every character was full of senseless thoughts from living a previous life of senselessness. Crappiest game ever I want my money back. would have rather shoved the money up my own♥♥♥♥♥than have given it up to play this craptacular game. End Review.			"

												Hello there ! I dont know why are there so many negative reviews so i want to add my opinion to this mass.First of all for those who didnt play this master-piece on xbox/ps3 , for you it`s a must buy . For this price there is 40+ hours minimum of gameplay . With cool graphics 720p as they where on concoles , and keybord and mouse countrolls ( I recommend a controller) , wich are partly customizable. All in all it`s a very good looking Final Fantasy game ON PC !!! Wich is wicked already , cause back at the days i coudnt even imagine having FF on PC. And having it on steam is amazing ! FF13 is a turn based RPG with a lot CG cutscenes , amazing and touching story and cool machanics that i like a whole lot ! For those who played on a concole , there will be mostly nothing new for you here , except for window mode ( that I am using )  and keybord/mouse  controls . For most part i have spotted that there were less frame drops than on Xbox and the picture lookes better cause on a 47 inch plasma pixels where always there , while on my 17inch laptop it looks much better . To summ it up , it`s a simple port of a concole ONLY game without graphics settings that most PC games have but never the less , if dont have a concole and like Final fantasy series this is a game for you . MOST IMPORTANTLY : I havent encounter any of the FPS drops that are ONLY on this port , cause there were many drops on Xbox too and it didnt hinder my gameplay at all . 9/10 from me . No game is perfect and never will there be such a game . For all those who write negative reviews i will remind you that this game is the same as Dark Souls it is a PORT( and there are very few of those) ! And we are lucky to have it at this price ! I personaly am very thankfull for this PORT as i was with dark souls . I would like to have such games as God of War or other Gears of war on PC even if those would be PORTS . Thank you for you attention. Good luck and don't suck !			"

												--Updated--Well didn't expected a huge lot for 15 bucks but I was expecting native 1080p support at least as it is the standard resolution in 2014 but I guess SE devs still lives in 2009 alas the 720p lock. If you don't like to play 720p upscaled or don't like to tinker with the game and use mods then don't buy this game right now cos you will be very disappointed. This game needs some fixing and tinkering from fans before it comes playable and enjoyable atm sadly. Other than fullscreen mode and windowed mode there are no other graphic options available without modding so that's a bummer. But thanks to Durante and GeDoSaTo now we can render the game in 1080p and must say it looks friggin beautiful in 1080p with AA at 8. If you are going to play this checking out GeDoSaTo is a must http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/  This is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played.Story gets interesting after around 10 hours or so & if you are gonna give up before that I urge you not to. Gameplay is linear but its acceptable and somewhat enjoyable, would've liked to have the opportunity to interact with the surroundings more since this is a rpg. Characters are a mixed bag for me as Lightning is very interesting, Sazh is somewhat interesting and rest is well not that much interesting so far tbh, not gonna spoil the whole game explaining why. Combat system will take some time to get used to but once you starts to master it, it will become fun trust me. The cut scenes my god they look really beautiful considering they are from 2009 and from a console game(no offense console users), would've preferred the H.264 cut scenes from the PS3 version as bink is outdated and if you look really closely you can see the pixels in very few videos sadly, specially when upscaled to 1080p. Download size is whooping 49.4gb thanks to the international version being dual audio with both Japanese and English audio so before buying might wanna look into that if you cannot download that much data.Overall if you are a fan of JRPG and turn based combat games go for it as for 15 bucks you are not gonna loose that much. Beautiful world (with mods ofc), huge and very interesting story, great music, somewhat good characters that you will start to like more you play, good voice acting in both languages(except for Vanile in English, she's a disaster :/ ), somewhat okay port so justifiable for 15 bucks. Hopefully SE will patch this up soon and fix all the issues.			"

												EDIT POST-PATCH FFXIII-2: Ok so when Final Fantasy XIII-2 came out they released a patch to fix some of the problems, and ok they fixed SOME of the problems. Works great in 720p no frame stutter anymore, and overall the proper experience that should have been able to be played at launch. For whatever reason, any time I go beyond 720p and increase shadow detail, the framerate starts to do the stutter a bit but not quite as bad. In the cutscenes it is definitely noticable, so Square-Enix you still have some work to do. I already know people will say, ""Oh it's your system, your graphics card sucks, etc."" Which ok, if that was the case, why is it I can play Skyrim on Ultra 1080p no problem? BF4 Ultra no problem? Just this game has problems...? Yeah so it's not me, it's Square Enix who needs to do some more work on their PC port. It even states on some systems that if you bump up the resolution your game can freeze/crash. So don't give me the ""It's your system"" crap. Square-Enix you've done ok so far, but you still have a ways to go before this is the definitive port of the bunch.Old review as of first release:While I'll agree with everyone that this is a dodgy PC port, if you love the game I still recommend getting it. Hopefully the visuals will be patched for max potential 1080p or higher, and the frame stutter will be fixed. The frame stutter is noticable in game and if it really bothers you then I guess don't pick this up. I however love this game and I am willing to at least put up with an annoyance to play through this game again.Another bonus is getting the option of Japanese and English audio, which apparently the console versions didn't give you an option to choose (I didn't mind the English voice acting so I never bothered to look up a Japanese alternate). Overall, if you are a fan of this game, if you want it bad enough you'll buy it and probably put up with it's problems for now, but hopefully we will get a patch to fix the game. Other than what I mentioned the game plays fine for me. No crashing, black screen, etc.			"

												Probably one of the most controversial games in the whole saga, up there with XII and XIV 1.0. And boy, does it deserve it!It does some things well, some things are okay and a bunch of'em very bad, which leaves a taste sweet and sour at the time.The story starts slow, not knowing what's happening besides there are baddies out there and they wanna kill you. As you progress the history, everything starts unravelling in two timelines, the days before the first one (when you start playing) and in the present (by moving the story forward). It gets quite chaotic sometimes but nothing a quick read on the Datalog cannot repair. As boring and bad was the beginning, I think it changed up to good. From ""we bad you good"" it changed more into a grey-ish tone at the end, were you cannot feel but think ""Damn. He had a point."".The visuals are stunning, but I've a hard-one for this kind of art, so take that with a pinch of salt. The game suffers for some low level textures that don't mesh well with some of the high res one. For example, in some upclose scenes of Ligthning, everything is detailed but the grip from her gunblade isn't. Maybe it was a problem with my own system but damn.The music delivers, as expected from a FF title even though it wasn't composed by our dear Nobuo Uematsu. If you're curious to hear some of the best tracks of the title. you can google ""Born Anew"" (Watch out for the spoilers!) ""Blinded by Light"" or the heavier ""Snow's Theme"".Aaaand the gameplay department. The most controversial of things. In this game, you can only control your main character (that you can change and it's useful to do it due to special skills of each character) and the other ones will act accord a role you have set up (Damage dealer, debuffer, healer, tank...). It starts slow due to not having too much options/party members, but boy it does well later on! You have to constantly switch paradigms to react and adapt or fail on your quest.Finally, as a port? It sucks so hard ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s could do a series with it. I mean, pressing ESC in fullscreen closes the game without a warning! WTF SE?Get Durante's GeDoSaTo and fix it by downsampling (game's locked at 720p in vanilla) and having 60FPS.In the end? Worth the 10 euros. I beat it on 35 hours (story) and farmed a bunch outside of Steam and started doing sidequests. Game clocks at 90 right now and have to still beat the hardest optional bosses. Already had beaten it on X360 so had an advantage on some encounters and what-to-do. Even if it was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port, the PC community always stands up.Pros:·Stunning visuals and music·Interesting gameplay and difficultyCons:·Longass tutorial (Pretty much 10 hour long)·Doesn't feel like the old FF games without a big space to travel around besides an area you unlock later in the game. No overworld map, city visit...·Such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port. God bless Durante for fixing it!			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS! This game has a few game-breaking bugs that can freeze things up. Sometimes, you would need to manually shutdown the computer and start it again to get other things working because this game freezes up. It feels like this game was released without any proper bug testing. You have been warned.			"

												""It gets good later"" is a rather common phrase used with a lot of games that start rather slow. FFXIII though takes that premise to the extreme. It does get good later, but it forces you to go through an entire game's worth of (bad) content before it starts getting interesting. I was actually all set to quit the game at around the 12-13 or so hour mark, and I only forced myself to go on because of a quote from another review regarding the game's characters, which read ""these are all winning characters"". Considering how bad they had been till that point, I couldn't bring myself to understand how anyone would say that, so I decided to force myself to go on just to see. Well... I'm actually really glad I did, because eventually they did become winning characters, but for the love of all that's good and holy in this world, did it take FOREVER for them to get interesting. The same goes for the main story itself and the gameplay.See, the main issue with the game is pacing, it's just awful at pacing itself properly. The game is padded with filler to the extreme, which is already an issue in and of itself, but when combined with a ""in medias res"" beggining that does a terrible job at explaining the basic premise to the player, well, it makes for the most mind bogglingly bad (loooooong) intro to a (eventually good) game ever. It doesn't help at all that the game is linear to the extreme. I don't mind linearity in and of itself, it's fine when it's delivering the right notes at the right times, but again, with the pacing of the game being practically dead for so long, the linearity sticks out like a sore thumb.The game got interesting for me at chapter 7 (of 13, so yeah, about halfway through), it's where all the characters finally started showing proper develoment, the story finally started making sense, and the gameplay itself also finally became a little bit more than just spamming the auto battle key (it never really becomes anything noteworthy imo though, even if it can be fun).It's funny to say now that I actually love all the characters, considering how much I didn't care for them at first, but I really do love them now, Fang and Vanille in particular, who were more central to the plot than the ""official"" main character Lightning herself. Fang is super awesome from the moment she's introduced, though Vanille is quite the opposite, terrible at first (like all the others), but once her character and motivations are expanded, she gets interesting and likable, not to mention that she eases up a bit on the uber annoying kookiness.The rest of the cast also deserves praise though, Sazh, Hope, Snow, they all get very good development (eventually...) and it was easy for me to root for all of them by the end. Ironically, Lightning was the least developed character, never really becoming that interesting, though she was likable enough.The main story itself, once it finally came together and I was able to understand what the hell was going on (reading the datalog is mandatory since the game doesn't bother explaining vital details), it became quite good, not a masterpiece by any means, but definitely entertaining. The ending though, now THAT was a masterpiece imo. It's without a doubt now one of my favorite endings, a perfect mix of bittersweet and joy, with clear closure. I kinda don't even want to bother with the sequels because of it, I like for stories to end on a high note and just leave it there, and this was as high a note as it could possibly achieve, no need to mess up with that.Since the story and characters are what made me love this game, I won't really go into that much detail about the gameplay, especially since I don't even feel there's much to go on about. Combat is sorta a hybrid of turn based and real time, with the action happening in real time but individual actions only being possible when a gauge fills up.For the most part you don't really need to think a lot during battles, the autobattle system chooses the most optimal actions for the character to execute. Only thing that really demands your attention is healing and the paradigm system introduced later on, in which characters can switch classes midway through a battle. It's actually a nice system, feels like you're playing coach to the team during combat, but it's still not the most engaging thing out there.Lastly, one thing that gets mentioned a lot is how the game stops being linear at chapter 11. Well it's true sorta, you get an open area where you can do lots of ""side quests"", which are just more battles, though some of the more interesting battles take place here. However, considering how late in the game that area comes up, at that point not only was I already exhausted from the combat, the story was also nearing its climax, the last thing I wanted to do was take a massively long break from it, so eh, don't really care much for that area.Finally, the game is gorgeous to look at and an absolute joy to listen as it has a FANTASTIC soundtrack. Hell, when I was first all set to quit the game early, I actually consoled myself on at least having gotten a great soundtrack out of it.Anyway, to sum it up, I ended up loving the game even if it did everything in its power to make me hate it. If you're gonna give it a try, I warn you, you better be patient.EDIT: Right, forgot to mention the PC port issues, but then those have been discussed to death already, no graphics options, 720p res, 60gb install, etc. At least the port had the decency to show keyboard controls properly, not like I haven't seen other ports still showing console controls... :/			"

												Well, that's over with.In the years between this game's original PS3 release and about a month ago when a friend of mine decided to buy me this game in order to satisfy my morbid curiosity, i've heard quite alot of things about FF13. I could write paragraphs about this, but instead i'll just sum it up like this:- The game is ridiculously linear for much of it's duration- It feels like a very long tutorial before the ""real"" gameplay actually begins- The story is confusing and very poorly told early on, and only really makes sense as time passes- If you can slog past the first crappy hours of this game, it gets better eventually- The PC Port is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥br>All of these things turned out to be true.It took me a month to beat this game for two reasons. First I got embroiled in a very nasty conflict in ARK Survival Evolved that required alot of my time and attention before it was settled to my satisfaction, and second playing anymore than an hour or two of this ♥♥♥♥ing game during it's early parts was just too much for me. Also I played in only in offline mode so I wouldn't be harassed by friends wondering why I was playing this known ""terrible"" game, and I can only really get away with that a few hours a day.I don't feel like typing a long review for this, so, much like I summed up what people have told me about this game over the years, I will do the same with my general thoughts:- I was bored out of my mind for large segments of the early game.- The battle system became kind of neat later on, but at first it felt like I wasn't even playing a game because of how little input was necessary.- The port annoyed me because I couldn't change the key bindings (or at least I never found out how).- I'm glad there is an ""easy mode"" setting for the battles because it means I was able to spend less time with them.- The art/graphics are pretty, and it is obvious even to people who haven't played this game that that is where most of the effort went.- The main characters eventually grew on me, but at first they were all either whiny, ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, or I didn't quite know enough about them yet to form a solid opinion. If I had to pick favorites, it would be Lightning and Fang, though Hope certainly had the most character development.- The running theme throughout the story about xenophobia and how it can lead to horrible things being done was actually a bit novel. It was probably one of the more interesting things that was going on story-wise.- I managed to play the game for extended periods of time without getting bored once the party was (finally) united and I was able to use strategy for battles and roam around maps that weren't completely linear. But this only happened about partway through Chapter 9... of 13. The stuff before that was either tolerable or boring.- Certainly the weakest FF game of the ones I have played and finished up until this point (7, 8, 10).- No, I will not be getting the rest of the achievements. ♥♥♥♥ grinding.So... with all of that said, what do I say to this notoriously divisive game? Ehh.... I gave a negative review to Far Cry 4 yesterday and I generally had more fun with that than this. But unlike that, my expectations for this game were pretty damn low, so there was far less room for disappointment. I -knew- that this game would be pretty mediocre or bad for about half of its duration, and by now anybody who is considering looking into this will know that as well.""Maybe"" isn't an option on Steam, so I'm going to blow everyone's mind and give this game a ""Yes"". Why? Not because it is a good game, because it isn't. I can't think of a better example of a game to point to and say ""The devs really should have gotten people to play this and submit critique before they decided to release it"". But by now, this game's reputation is pretty hard to avoid. If you are getting it, then you should know that you are in for a very long game that won't be very good (or good at all in some parts) for quite a few hours. But, eventually, it will end up being okay. Not great, but... okay. FF13 is not as bad as I was led to believe, but it's bad enough that I'm pretty sure I won't ever install it, much less play it, again.Besides, I hear the sequels are actually kinda good, and you do kinda need to play the first game in a series before moving on to those. Sadly, this is the reason why I still haven't played Witcher 2/3 yet. I bet somebody's jaw is dropping about the fact that I managed to get through FF13 before I got through Witcher 1. That amuses me.So now I'm installing FF13-2. I'll get around to that eventually. If that turns out to be crap however, I may turn around and give this game a ""no"" review just to be spiteful or something.Can I go to sleep now? Yay.			"

The graphic and cinematic is top notch. The battle is a bit hard and more intensive even tough it's not real time like FF 12.

												**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**I was a massive fan of the XIII series and played through them all on the PS3. Now with the PC port here and nearly 300 hours of experience (on the PS3) I can write with some leverage to you.Graphically, this game is pretty fantastic. Minus some pixelly textures on the sides of the environment, the backgrounds and everything else, spell visuals, weapon details and model textures are pretty high quality, very excellent in terms of a port that was released all the way back in 2010. If you're a fan of CGI, then FFXIII nails this part perfectly. It's pretty tough to judge the quality of this game's CGI when it pretty much looks like something out of real life. However, for the PC port of this game, this is where FFXIII falls apart here. There are MASSIVE issues with the port regarding FPS. It is very tough to get constant 60FPS everywhere, and for some this will be a massive downside, this was the case for me. Below this review, there are some performance tips that will make or break the game's performance for you. Try these out and see if your PC can achieve 60FPS for this game.During battles, the game dips to as low as 10FPS when switching paradigms, a form of switching classes mid battle to put it short-like. Aside from FPS issues, FFXIII offers a very indepth battle system that can get very intense against some of the toughest enemies this game as to offer. Gameplay wise, ignoring all the technical difficulties, the game starts off by holding your hand and explaining what each option does for quite a bit, all the way up to Chapter 5 roughly. The pathways are often just a single path towards your goal, up until Chapter 11 when you reach the open world part. The Paradigm system is underestimated by a lot of people  - not many people choose to manually select their Abilities and just go for Auto Battle. My tip is to change the Default Command to Abilities instead of Auto Battle in the ingame settings menu. FInal Fantasy XIII is a beautiful game is that often underestimated by a massive majority of the public. If you appreciate visuals, a good JRPG, some bland humour (mostly Sazh's script) and of course, want to give yourself the chance to have a challenge, then I highly recommend this game to you.**PERFORMANCE TIPS** - People have been using a program called GeDoSaTo edit the ingame's graphical capabilties, lowering or increasing the resolution beyond 1080p, etc. (Google GeDoSaTo, find a link from github.- To achieve 60fps in the field, turning off the minimap can be a massive help. For me, I went from around 30FPS fluctuating to 60FPS constantly.- Unconfirmed FPS fix for everyone but for me, restarting before playing the game gives you a perfect 60FPS performance everywhere, minus some very little stuttering. My build if anyone is wondering...              - GPU: AMD R9 380              - CPU: i5 3470k              - RAM: Corsair Vengeance 8GB.			"

												Without a doubt the best corridor simulator I've ever played. There are concrete corridors, rocky corridors, mechanical corridors and one area with no corridors so you can see how bleak a game with out corridors can be (don't worry it doesn't last long).You can beat the whole game but running forward and mashing the confirm command thanks to Square Enix's patented easy gameplay and corridor technology that prevents the need for turning or looking at your screen.

It´s very linear until you reach the %60 of the game. If you like Final Fantasy universe this is definitely one you should add to your collection. Enjoyable at 1080p after they patched.			"

												This game could be fun. Frankly to me that would be great; but with such a God Awful port with no patch for the stuttering caused by the game looking for a controller every second with no option to disable the game from looking for it... full failing marks. The best part? The controller does not have to actually work with windows. I literally plug in my PS3 controller (which for those wondering does not work with windows without some TLC on your part) and the game flows fine. I unplug it and the game chuggs on. It is just looking for the controller; it doesn't care if you can use it or not. The game has been out for almost three years and they have yet to patch this. It's silly- that is really the nicest thing I can put on here. I loaded it up naively thinking, ""Surely by now they'd have patched such a thing...""			"

												Easy there, cowboy. The thumbs up is an ""only for a certain kind of gamer"" recommendation. While that usually doesn't need to be said, in this case fans of RPGs may find the game's flaws too glaring to forgive. So I strongly recommend researching the ups and downs of Final Fantasy XIII before committing to a purchase. Steam does have a refund policy, but it takes more than two hours of game-time to really see where FF13's design flaws come into play.Having played through this game on the PlayStation 3, I can say without reservation that I enjoy this game's combat system and that I think the characters are pretty cool in their own ways. Whether that can carry you through a 60 hour RPG is up to your individual tastes. The game can be engaging and pretty but the main draws that players associate with RPGs aren't really here. The storytelling is badly-paced and underdeveloped, often requiring the player to take a break and read in-game Datalog entries to solidify their understanding of the game's concepts. The stage design is almost oppressively linear for the vast majority of the game and does not really open up until close to the end (at which point you are given the opportunity to experience the plains and valleys of Gran Pulse, which introduces the kind of area design that Xenoblade Chronicles on the Wii gave players free reign over from the very moment they took control of Shulk and Reyn in Colony 9). There are no real town exploration sections except for a single mid-game interlude in a theme park which players are not allowed to revisit afterward, either; the game consists almost entirely of traversing enemy-laden wilderness and dungeon areas in a strictly linear progression, making it by far the most monotonous game in the Final Fantasy main series (one could accuse Final Fantasy X of being too linear, but it still had the basic staples of an RPG's adventure progression and the freedom to revisit old areas, two things XIII does not provide).The negatives are ever-present and all-encompassing: this is a game that is definitely not for everyone, and even having enjoyed my first playthrough of it, I personally have not been compelled to either complete all of the sidequests (which you only gain access to once you reach that late-game Gran Pulse area) or to play through the story a second time. Replay value is at an all-time low here.If these things do not sound like flaws that will totally break the experience for you, then I encourage you to give Final Fantasy XIII a try. If you're unsure which way you'll swing, I recommend watching some Let's Play videos of the game on YouTube to see for yourself what the game is like--HCBailly in particular is a good bet.The bottom line is that this isn't a game I can give a single sweeping recommendation for. I could do that for the sequels, which while lacking in story cohesion are just better-designed as videogames; but this first entry in the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy is the hardest recommend to people, even as I can't see it as exactly ""bad."" If that makes any sense.If there was an option in between ""yes"" and ""no"" I would probably have picked that instead.			"

												When I first bought this game I had big hopes for it to be great and that it would have stunning graphics. And I sure hope I would have read any reviews before purchasing it... Because what I was stuck with was a extremely poorly optimized game which ran in 720p with no graphics options whatsoever. However, there was still hope for me, within just A DAY the work of ONE man was enough to give me what I craved for. Full HD resolution... Something that should be the absolutely minimum to be supported. Then when I today saw that Square Enix had released an update I got quite excited, so I rushed to the news feed to see what they had updated and this is what I saw...""Hello, The FINAL FANTASY XIII team have been working hard to improve your experience on Steam and we're happy to announce the following changes will be rolled out. ■ All versions A request-to-confirm notification, will now appear when you try to quit from the full-screen mode. ""Is it not enough that they have yet to be able to do what a single man was able to do within a fraction of the time they had to develop this game, but then they go out and post that they have been working HARD! This makes me rather upset, I would never in my life recommend this game to anyone and it's a shame, it's most likely a pretty decent game which have rather stunning graphics when you are able to play it in 60fps 1080p... However, I can't recommend a game where it takes the developers over a month to put out a fix for something as mundane as the fact that the ESC-button simply shuts down the whole game. A fix like that shouldn't just take less than a day to fix, it shouldn't even have been there from the start. Square Enix have made great games and I really mean great games. With stunning visuals and great storytelling, however, if this is how they wish for their PC-versions to be, then I'm sad to say that I no more will buy a game from them. At least not until they prove that they have learnt their leason.			"

												As you see there too many negative due resolution cap at 720. I think it no need to retact too fast. It need to calm down and report to developer and work with them to bring the best instead throw the rock. that not what Game Community for. Game Community to team up together and make the game great again. For this Game Final Fantasy XIII is amazing game however too much grind. I am deaf, I don't mind about audio things, But I had cochlear implant to hear beatiful music and voice. I really enjoy this game since PS3. I am look forward to re-collect them into Steam library.Please don't mind what people bashing over-retaction on resolution and others, give feedback to developer or 3rd party can bring them better.Kupo!

												I want to recommend this game but I can't for the following reasons (Please note this is my FIRST time playing 13, I don't own a PS3 sooooooo)*  Doom - I know the point of this spell, it worked great in the Eldioun (summon fights) BUT if you take too long (like 20 minutes+) the boss will cast this one you and it's game over if that counter goes up.  That's all fine and dandy IF the cast begins at the START of the fight not because you're busting your !@#$ butt off and you get this slapped on you.  As a player, it makes me feel like crap.  I work hard to hold my ground and only lose the battle because I ""took too long"" that's just dumb!* Linear - Don't mind linearatiy but it would have been nice to have SOME open world (not just the chapter 11 part)  This doesn't bother me too much because the game tells a decent story (too poltical at first but somewhat makes sense at the end).*♥♥♥♥♥♥poor port - I know they're are putting a fix for this later this December but a final fantasy title a game with these awesome sauce graphics LOCKED at 1280x900 res?  Props to Durante for the GeDoS program took me 4 hours inintally to get it to work right (because it was in beta for FF13 so I would have wierd things like mini map not showing up, menu selections dimmed out, and blurry characters).  I finished this game before the fix has came out...which is sad.  It also interfers with the steam interface so I can't reply to my friends either.* No forcefeed back - Really?* BIG download - Give the option to download the Japanese voice overs, 60 GB is pretty huge.and finally* Leader dead = Game Over - I find it overwhelmingly frustrating that if the leader dies it's instant game over.  Sometimes this works in some games (like Persona 4) but for this one it really didn't.  I had many o times my leader being KO'ed were my other two party members were at full health....just frustrating.If you can get over these factors, for $15 (or maybe 10$ for a sale), it's a decent purchase.  I overall enjoyed the game and had few rage quits but to recommend someone this title would be a flat out lie w/o warning them of these features (PS3 or even PC).Ok fan boys, do your worst and trash my ""review"", I'm OUT!*Drops the mic*  "

												Final Fantasy XIII was originally released on both the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2009/2010 and brought Final Fantasy to that generation of consoles. The game and its subsequent sequels offer some of the greatest visuals, original music, and engaging battle systems that builds off previous games in the series' successes.FFXIII serves as the introduction to the world and people of Cocoon, led by the ""divine"" Sanctum Fal'Cie, and whom are afraid of the world of Pulse that lies beneath their floating paradise. Lightning Farron is a sergeant in the Bodhum Regiment of the Guardian Corps whose life is changed when she is branded along with five others as a l'cie, a slave to a Fal'cie from Pulse tasked with the very destruction of her home. As she comes to terms with her fate of either fulfilling her 'Focus' or becoming an undying monster, she and her new companions are hunted by the military and hated by civilians. The story is a dramatic tale of six people that must put beside thier anger, fears, and despair, and make a choice... Final Fantasy XIII is, like many other games in the series, one that demands some time to complete: Roughly 40 - 50 hours. Get ready to spend a week or so with this one. It is also a game that departs from many series staples, like exploring through towns and engaging in side quests. This means that the biggest draws for the game are its story and combat systems, which fortunately(in my opinion) get passing marks. The combat system in this game is called the 'Command Synergy Battle' system. Throughout the battle, you are in command of one character, the party leader, and the other characters in your group are operated by a surprisingly iintelligent A.I. that takes the best course of action in battle based on their selected roles and known enemy stats/weaknesses. There are six ""classes"" in the game: Commando, Ravager(magic attacker), Medic, Synergist(enhancing abilities), Sabeteur(enfeebling), and Sentinel(tank). Characters can develop their stats and abilities in the Crystarium by expending Crystal Points earned after the end of battles. Battles progress by switiching 'paradigms', or role combinations to best take advantage of the situation. Should you press the attack with a pair or ravagers and a commando to build up chain gauges? Should you put a sentinel on the field to soak damage while a synergist enhances your attacks? The choices are up to you as you try to weaken and 'stagger' enemies to submission. Trying to gain high battle ratings through skillful use of the paradigm system is surprisingly engaging.  A grand portion of the game is spent ""on the run"" from the military, and this informs a lot of the exploration segments. So much in fact that the game has been called(rightfully so) very linear up to a certain point where it opens up tremendously. Fortunately there's never a dull moment in the story, and many times I've found myself needing a break just because of how intense the story and battles can get. This game can be hard, make no mistake. If you aren't careful in certain conflicts, enemies can get some pretty quick hits that'll have you retrying quite a few times.After originally having played Final Fantasy XIII on the Xbox 360 back in 2010, I've loved the the series even more with each new entry. The mythos behind Gran Pulse, Cocoon, and the beings that inhabit them create a dramatic story filled with great characters facing immense tragedy while trying to escape their fate as pawns in a Chess game being played by beings beyond their comprehension for reasons even more unclear. When it originally released, nobody was aware there would be a series of sequels released later, so a lot of the plot points seemed to be very hazy without the context provided by future games. I feel that this has become less of a problem with the release of Final Fantasy XIII-2(my personal favorite. Give this RPG a shot. It's different by a lot of standards, but I feel that it is an entry in the series with a lot of merits.			"

												First: Is this a good port? Absolutely not. You can read all the complaints about the lack of graphic customization options in the game hub.Second: Is this a good game? Absolutely YES. Ok, it has the same anime-japanish-cliché characters than other common JRPG games, and it doesn't provide a lot of freedom like other Final Fantasys, making this one a VERY linear game. But, for this prize, it is a very good game. Not a 9/10, but certainly a 7/10. The game feels like a big-budget movie, with a great story, great graphics and a great soundtrack.			"

												Although you've probably heard it's a terrible game and you should never go near the thing, it's really not nearly as bad. The reason people say that is because fans of the rest of the series complain it is very linear, and that it has no 'independent elements'. That could be considered as true, though I have at the time of writing this played 4 hours, I think it is a fun and worthwhile experience yuo should have if you like FF in general or like JRPGs. The soundtrack, maybe not as good as previous title in the 20 year-old-series is still very good and gets you pumped for battles adn cut-scenes.The story is quite complicated but the general idea (no spoilers) is quite simple. Your characters become, lets say, 'cursed' in a huge accident whilst fighting in a resistance. For the most part I've played your characters are wondering around aimlessly trying to find things and people. But thats all for now. Summary : Very good JRPG with elements veterans will find familiar.Great music. (as always)Great battle system (even though XII's was better XIII's is still good)Great characters: Snow, Lightning, Sazh, Hope, and Vanille offer a good range of playable characters. (BTW I'm really not sure how a baby Chocobo survives in Sazh's hair. Though it is very spongy)Great story (if a bit complicated).Final Verdict: (Bearing in mind I have NOT finished it) [{(8.5/10)}]Also: XIII-2 and LR's are both coming to PC so if you like those on PS3 or XBOX 360 get this so you can play the ENTIRE story. You need to otherwise you won't have a bloody clue what's going on in those two.			"

												The ""game""  itself is good , but unfortunately we were again given a bad port.It is a pity that square didnt spend the time making an actually decent job porting this game , with that said , they did add the jap audio option , which was nice of them.Honestly , nothing really changed on this ""game"" when it came to PC , so the 2009 reviews about the ""game"" in general count , but the game got the usual poor porting job we saw many times already.Mind you , currently modders like Durante are fixing some of the issues , but i dont believe a game should get a good rate when it requires third party software to be decent.PS: If SE do come foward and solve this issue on their own , then i will change this review.

												I absolutely adore this game. I played through it when it first released on the Xbox 360, and I'm loving my chance to play it again. The music is beyond great and the scenery is the best I've encountered in a game neck and neck with Xenoblade Chronicles.Lightning the main character is a total badass out-shining Cloud, Sqaull, Tidus..... you name it.The battles are a fast paced Active Time Battle building on what Sqaure brought to the table with FFX-2.The Story is a bit Linear in that there is little room for exploration or even retracing you steps but the Mythos and character developement are top notch. Buy it if you will I sure as hell Love it.			"

												i only recommend this game if you're a final fantasy fan who is overjoyed because square enix finally port FF franchise into pc like myself or you are a gamer who prioritize amazing graphics, cool animations and good battle system without minding the confusing story and weak character backgrounds too muchlike what everyone said this game is indeed badly ported, and what i meant by bad is REALLY BAD,, not only you can't change a lot of things in the settings like graphic options and resolution, they made the esc button a freakin' rage quit button (that means one press and you're out of the game, yes seriously)you probably know this already, since square enix is in charge of the FF games the battle system changed from turn based to time based, and what makes me disappointed is they used the FF X-2 battle system instead of FF XII which in my opinion is the most unique because of the gambits (i haven't played that far, but that is the feelings i got from the first time playing) but i ilke Lightning more as MC rather than Vaan, god i hate that kidso yeah either wait for Square Enix to make a fix (which i doubt would happen), just deal with it or don't buy the gameoverall 6/10			"

												A porting disaster. No graphics tuning, no audio settings, you cant even change keybind settings but stick to default setup. 720p resolution despite the game doesnt use more than 40% of my GPU/CPU powah, so had to rely on 3rd party tools to crank it up. Its an insult to PC players who are treated as 2nd rate citizens. So no buy, and frankly this game isnt even worth pirating.			"

This game is advertised as being ""...optimised for PC, featuring full screen support and running at 60FPS."" This is a bold faced lie. The day Japanese developers learn the meaning of ""optimise"" is the day I eat my hat.Utterly pathetic. Avoid like the plague.			"

												Has the Final Fantasy franchise lost its ability to make a game?  Like many of the recent Final Fantasy series (I would say 12+), these are nothing short of an amazing movie, with the viewer/player taking part in the battles.  The rest is left to movie script. Playing the many hours of the XBOX and a few hours on the PC (bad port - esc key kicks me out! Really? and I didn't save), it became apparent that the game just guided the player through a scripted movie, and all the while I watched I kept yelling ""..LET ME PLAY DAMMIT"". Square Enix LITERALLY controlled the player, not the other way around, What if the player needed a break? nope - just gonna have to hold it.  It was mentioned to me that after about 25hrs of game play, you end up in the open world. Really? Players have to sit through a 25hr movie, to ""get to the good stuff"" and even then, I found, it is still limited to the movie script, and not what the player wants to do.It's no doubt that Square Enix reigns supreme in the graphic skills, and one only needs to watch a few videos to see this. But what about game play? This is a game. Most would feel that game play involves PLAYER interaction on many levels, after all, they are in control! While playing, I kept feeling that I was playing THE WALKING DEAD (any episode). I get to watch the movie, with a few breaks in between for some action scenes. But even TWD had more interaction, as you were allowed to interact with the NPC's to change the outcome of the game, and other events. In FF13 a great opportunity came when the mom wanted to join. But no, scripted right on by while players just sit and watched.Square Enix has more than enough skill, money and man power to make a game something similar to METRO, FALLOUT 3, TOMB RAIDER and the list is endless. Like Final Fantasy, these games are linear, but there is an added illusion of freedom, and many choices will change the out come of the game.When people sit down to play a 55gig game, they expect to PLAY. Not to sit cut-scene after cut-scene.  I was really excited at the beginning, when the kids were gonna hop on that cycle, and many  thought, sweet, gonna take a look around, but no, that was taken from the player as well. We sat helpless as the ""game"" guided it to the next destination. Maybe players want to go left, instead of right (at all times) and learn from mistakes that was the wrong way. Tell a NPC that they are wrong, only to find out later, we better go back and make them change their mind so we can progress the story. Many AAA games are out there that do this, why is Square Enix behind? If you are looking for a hand-holding ""game""  to do more than fight, and watch the movie, this is not for you. To me, this is an alpha game, simply because player interaction is not finished, story line control needs to be adjusted (Star Wars TOR?, Old game, but you can interact with the NPCs). Square Enix is NOT a small company, yet the continue to make games that, while amazingly drawn, come across as something created by a small company and empty.  Never have I played a game, where I was so disappointed at not only being a part of this story, but even in combat it was nothing more than button mashing (after you set up some combat settings).Sadly, many REALLY wanted to play this one, as  most are avid FF fans, but even they are at their ""Limit Break-ing"" point. This is not the 90's, and higher standards for the Final Fantasy franchise have been set. I don't want to watch cut-scenese, we know Square Enix can make trailers - we want to play your game!EDIT:I wanted to add  that if the game goes on sale (reasonably priced that is), and you are a FF fan, definately one you want to add to your collection. But paying full boat to watch a movie and play stunt man for the fight scenes - watch it on youtube.			"

												--- Review of the game after the Dec. 11 patch ---Good on Square Enix for coming back and patching in resolution options and graphics settings, essentially fixing most of the technical problems I had with this game on release. Call me fickle, but fixing that alone has greatly increased this game's value for me - especially (pardon any potential snarkiness) as it makes it seem SE actually care about what they release on Steam.FFXIII, whilst it definitely has some issues - the story seems really overly complex for what it is and the game doesn't open up the full extent of its battle system until way later on (a problem I found was fixed in FFXIII-2, also available on Steam), I couldn't help but find myself enjoying it. I found that if you experiment with it fully, employing the use of Saboteurs and Synergists alongside Commandos, Medics and Ravagers, the Paradigm system is great fun to use, particularly later on when the battle system finally does fully open up. The game definitely has some great visual design in both the characters and the world as well in my opinion, with the trip through Nautilus being a highlight for me, showcasing what might be best described as a ""Final Fantasy Disneyland"".Though the grindy combat system will understandably turn some people off the game, in my opinion those who can make it through that will find a huge JRPG adventure with a cast of either honestly or ironically enjoyable characters that whilst being incredibly long, never truly gets boring....If peeps can find a way to mod in alternate playermodels GAAAAH - you can do it, you beautiful modding geniuses, you! :P			"

We deserved better, not only because we're talking about industry standards, but also because this is a port of an almost 5 year-old game and one that was received poorly. This port is a an offense to consumers. Sure, modders will fix it (THEN I will play it), but they will do for free what everyone paid for Square Enix to do.			"

												A lot of people complain about the graphics and FPS. Did you played through the first chapter? Or even started the game? Since the graphics are more important than the game experience? Do you care about the story, the characters, the locations, the music, the battles? OK, the port is not the best, but play with it if you payed for it. I think many of you have not played with the previous FF games like V or even VII…What you will expect from this Final Fantasy (tl,dr; if you interested please read all, I played with the X360 version):Pros: - Exciting new combat system - Lovable characters with background story- Epic music- Amazing and captivating story, but...Cons:- ...Linear and complicated (only at early)- Minimal open world - Short especially for a FF game - Not the best RPGPlaytime: Story: 45+ hours (ofc with cutscenes), Full Achievements: 130-150 hours(or more based on farming-luck)Terms you may need to know first:Fal’cie – False gods, machines responsible for the creation and maintenance of the land where humans dwell, and indirectly govern their lives. They can turn the people into l’cie.L’cie - humans ""branded"" by divine entities (mostly fal’cies) and given great physical and magical power, as well as a Focus to fulfill. If they manage to complete their Focus they will become crystal or you will become a cie’th. People are afraid of l’cies.Cie’th – those who fail to complete their Focus in time. They are mindless monsters who attack everybody.Cocoon – A planet which floats in the sky above the land of Gran Pulse (it’s like the Moon), the events starts here.Gran Pulse – A planet like the Earth, and Cocoon floats in its atmosphere. It is a world of natural evolution where animals and plants can grow to tremendous sizesthe human civilization of Gran Pulse had nearly been wiped out by the War of Transgression.The War of Transgression – It was a war fought between Cocoon and Gran Pulse between six and seven hundred years.Purge – It is a form of social cleansing conducted by the Sanctum, the fal'Cie-run government of Cocoon, to get rid of those believed to have been ""touched"" by Gran Pulse.Story/Characters:If you new in Final Fantasy games I can recommend this one, it plays on a planet called Cocoon, where you can control 6 characters, our heroine is Lightning who was a soldier (Guardian Corps) she is on the Purge train to save her sister Serah who is caught by a fal’cie and marked as a l’cie. Serah’s boyfriend Snow travels to the Hanging Edge to fight PSICOM and the Purge in the hopes of saving her. Meanwhile Sazh the old timer pilot boards with Lightning to save his son Dajh. On the same train Vanille (who is already a l’cie), Hope and his mother are part of the group of exiles onboard the Purge train. And Fang who will appear later in the story she searches for Vanille and aims to complete her Focus. Their ways cross them to Serah who fulfill her task as a l’cie and turns into crystal while the other party members marked as l’cie. With the fatal fate on their shoulders our heroes take up the struggle against the curse, rescue Serah and Cocoon’s people from the suffering of the fal’cies… “The Battle Within Begins...”For me this game 10/10, if I need to compare to the other FF games then 8.5/10.If you liked this masterpiece I can recommend the XIII-2 and Lightning Returns too.Thanks for reading!

												This game reminds me of Bioshock 2.  Not becuase their gameplay or thematic design is even slightly similar, but becuase they both got ridiculously unfair hate becuase folks were expecting something else, rather than becuase the game is bad.Everyone always talks about it being the worst FF and it just isn't at all. It does some things differently and in some places it stumbles, but at its core it is everything a ff games is supposed to be. It's fun, and set in a beautiful compelling world filled with compelling characters. You can find faults like how occasionally poor AI will cause you to lose a fight, or what have you, but it is a good game. Not a fantastic mindblowing game, but a good game I'll happily sink hours of free-time into.Three notes:1. It is linear. I don't think that is wrong, linear does not equal bad. Through a linear design it can more closely guide your experience and I think it shows in the pacing and build of the plot. It is nonetheless linear and I know many don't come to a jrpg for that kind of gameplay.2. It is simplified. Or at least feels so at times.3. It does kind of feel like the vast majority of the game is a tutorial. Again this is a design choice. Rather than quickly dumping all the mechanics on you then letting you get better gear over the course of the game, the characters evolve along with the story. Nice thought, but becuase of the precedent you never get the ""okay tutorial over""  subconcious cue so that feeling is left without closure and sort of hangs around. It also means the first third of the game feels a little sparce in mechanics. "

												I can not recommend Final Fantasy XIII on PC in its current form. The port is utterly broken and locked to 720p, which admittedly can be fixed with Durante's tool. What can't be fixed however is the shocking performance.Users fortunate enough to own nVidia hardware can improve performance somewhat, but for those of us with AMD the framerate is broken. Even without unlocking the resolution the game cannot maintain a stable framerate and flucuates wildly between 30 and 60. Some users report even worse than this.If you are on the fence, do not spend your money. If there is one thing Square Enix have demonstrated with this port, it's that they do not care about the PC audience.			"

I have played and finished the game on PS3 before and thought I'd give it a buy on PC since I enjoyed, YES the game is good, the gameplay is good and the story is as well but this game is absolutely a slap in the face to all PC gamers, no video settings at all, forced to run the game in 1280x760, locked at 720p, and the only options you have is to run it in a window or full screen. Terrible frame rate issues, my PC can run Battlefield 4 on ultra at 144fps where as this game struggles to achieve 60fps.Overall a good game, but just one of the worst PC ports I've ever seen.

												This game is stunning! Especially the CG. However in-game it looks leaps and bounds for a Final Fantasy game. The game is beautiful, stunning and the memorable characters.Initially the game was quite a bad port having quite some stuttering even on high end PC. It seem fixed in latest patch on 1080p averaging 60fps for me (but in battle i'm still locked with 30fps bu there's no stuttering).This is the first Final Fantasy game for me after more than 10 years. FF7 & FF8 PC were my first Final Fantasy game. This game could be perfect for me if the first 10 chapters were not linear. However it's not a problem for me as i understand the linearity is for the progression of the story.Also, it would be great if Summoning weren't that limited (You get to summon once per battle and only the leader). And limit breaks are only introduced once you have maxed out the skill level for your characters.I would have preferred that we could use the summoning of your party members and not just the leader plus the ability to control individual party members. However, i understand the trend is going towards more actioney than more turn based.All in all the CG and story is just superb!			"

This being a port of the consoles it was fixed at a 720p resolution and apparently had bad anti-aliasing, but be excited to know that since December 2014 it was patched to have a simple graphics setup on launch where you can choose resolution, shadow resolution, and anti-aliasing. As far as I'm concerned the game looks AMAZING for a game from 2009 with this port and I totally reccomend it. It looks extremely better than it did on 360.			"

												Since people really prefer to have these pros/cons type of reviews at the Steam pages i'll keep them like that and easy to read.+ Great graphics/cutscenes.+ Good music. (It's a Square game after all.)+ Interesting story that isn't as nearly as convoluted as some others in the series.+ Japanese voice acting included, and it's really really good.+ Most of the characters are rather likeable, except ironically the main protagonist and one spineless coward called Hope.+ Tons of content and quests to do. (The game is about 50 hours long.)+ If you know how to fix the game it runs fairly stable and crash free...- ...Although that WILL require some fiddling with.- Seems like at least the first 15 hours are tutorial sections.- The game can feel like it plays itself sometimes.- Character customization extremely limited.- Game really rewards you only after you've finished the 50% mark.Now, the PC stuff.* Although all the negative things i'm about to say, the PC version is STILL the optimal version to play the game. Offering a stable 1080p/30fps on most rigs compared to the attrocious 720p/15-25fps average that was offered on the consoles. Just make sure you apply these fixes to both FFXIII and FFXIII-2 so you'll avoid the game breaking issues.= Optimization is terrible, expect to play this game with locked 30fps to avoid frame dips all the time.= Disabling Steam Cloud is mandatory since it can cause your game to crash while saving and corrupt your save file.= Playing with the keyboard is not recommended and you really should own a 360 pad to get the best experience.Overall, a pretty good JRPG plagued with technical issues and minor annoyances. I'd still recommend it.			"

												This was my first entry into the series back on the 360 and I enjoyed it a lot. The game is linear until you get 2/3 into the game then the world opens up a little and you can take on side quests. The story can be quite confusing. I only learned what was really going on after getting all the achievements/trophies on 360 and PS3. Combat is deceptive where you would think ""auto battle"" does the work for you but you still have to strategize properly with assigning each characters particular roles and how to use them properly. If you came from the consoles, the only differences are expected PC features (higher resolutions, fullscreen mode, shadow resolution, etc.) and easy mode. The game is maybe slightly visually better but the framerates are the real problem. You can go up to 60 fps but don't expect to stay there. I'll look at a mob of enemies and stay at 60 fps but then I'll look at a blank wall and drop to 12 fps. This isn't a game breaking issue as precision is not required for the game but it does hurt the overall experience when you notice it and you will notice it.			"

												Having played Final Fantasy XIII on the PS3 twice, I decided to purchase the game once again, this time for Steam. The game will take up a big amount of GB, around 50. Yes, that is much, because of the many cutscenes this game has. The game has a good and interesting story, maybe a bit confusing at times if you don't pay attention, but luckily, you can reread all of it in the game itself; so if you take a break from playing the game, coming back to it later and don't know what's going on, it's easy getting back into.The battle system is pretty cool. You can only control one character in battle, but that's not a bad thing, since the battles are still pretty busy when you're fighting enemies. It is true that you don't have a lot of freedom in the game when it comes to exploration, it is pretty linear, but on the other side, it gives the story enough time to unfold itself.The characters are all individual; one is funny, the other one may be more serious, etc. I'm sure you'll find someone you like. My personal favorite is Lightning.All in all, I like the approach that this game in the Final Fantasy series is taking. Alot of times, people complain about that games and their sequels are too similar, so why not change something once in a while?I hope you have as much fun with this game like me.			"

												What is there to say Final Fantasy XIII is a very great game visually an improved version over consoles. Though the game is very linear to begin with and i expect to some that will be somewhat boring. I found it to be great fun the story is involving and interesting which is one of the reasons why final fantasy games are so popular. All in all its worth getting.			"

												[Spoiler-free review!]After playing the game on PS3 at its release time and after pouring 50+ hours on this Windows port, I think I can say my opinion about this game. Let's start with the bad stuff.Final Fantasy XIII at the time caused much fuss as it's the first Final Fantasy game that is ""on rails"" for pretty much the 90% of the time: you can't explore the world as you wish (except much, much further in the storyline), and the maps really feel like a tunnel where what you can do is just to face monsters, wave after wave.I can agree on all of this, and initially I was kind of put off by it -- add the fact that in the first 2 chapters your characters have limited abilities and attack powers, to the point that fights in these chapters can be summarized with ""attack, attack, attack, ... , potion, attack, attack..."" and so on and so forth.So why is this review a recommendation?First of all don't treat this game like a classic FF game but for what it is: a gorgeous adventure with unexpected plot twists, that in time will make you absolutely love all the protagonist characters.I won't speak much about graphics as screenshots and trailers can speak for themselves -- yes, that's in-game, realtime graphics! -- and instead I will focus on the combat system, that I unexpectedly found out to be very tactical (albeit it unlocks fully starting with chapter 3).It is very easy to understand but takes time to master: in short, you take direct control only of the ""leader"" character of a 3-man party using the classic Final Fantasy's Active Time Battle system; the other characters execute actions according to paradigms (think ""strategies"") that you can plan before each battle. For example, you could have a very offensive paradigm with one physical attacker and two ravagers, a very defensive one with a medic, a synergist and a sentinel or something in between; during the battle you can switch at any point in time among up to six different paradigms. Much different than what I just said about the prologue now, isn't it? =DIn conclusion... if you like JRPGs and good stories, and you can bear map linearity give this game a chance. It's a good one.My vote: 8 / 10			"

												If you've seen any other reviews of FF13 you already got an idea what this game is like - linear, corridors everywhere, wasted potential in characters, but nice artwork and soundtrack and enjoyable fights. I do not disagree.Story is very legthy and it was very difficult for me to keep attention, especially with massive amount of fights between cutscenes. It's like you'd be watching a movie, but every 5 minutes you'd have to pick up a button and press it for 30 minutes to get next 5 minutes of the movie.Sadly, pressing one button for fights is reality for two thirds of the game. (With few exceptions of like 3 boss fights) Some call it 25 hours tutorial, I call it boring bs. For those 25 hours you have no power over your battle team and thus have to play as every character in the game, no matter how much you dislike them. (Feels really bad if you bought the game specially to play as Lightning)Another point I'd like to make is that in no point of the story I felt like I want to know what happens next. And that's bad for any game... Basically if you are able to play through the game in one or two days, it could be okay, but when I left the game for a week or so, I had to really push myself to click that FF13 icon again and progress further...On the positive side, once you endure through the first 10 chapters, you are greeted by beautiful open world with lots of side missions, combat challenges and achievements for completionists.Design of the locations is also very nice, unfortunately now I realize that I didn't really care where I was as long as I was making progress. And it's of course not possible to return to places from chapters 1-10. Welcomed feature would be unlockable mode that would allow you to play again from chapter 1, but with a) fully upgraded characters so that you can easily tear any enemy apart and quickly go for the story or b) without enemies at all.I really want to recommend this game, but as I went through this review, it proved to be unrealistic to click thumbs up at the end of this, so no, don't buy. Go watch FF13 all cutscenes movie on Youtube. It's faster, cheaper and it'll still deliver the most important part of the game.EDIT: I realized I forgot to mention one very important thing; I ran the game on an ancient laptop, having 7-10 fps all the way. I imagine the combat and exploration are much more fun if you can react to enemies' action and actually run, not hobble like my 80 yrs old grandma... So, if you have good machine to play this on, consider this review to give thumbs up...			"

												Steam said I've been playing for 2 hours but actually I've played 10 hour in offline mode.This game is a bit different. It isn't like any other JRPGs. I started to know final fantasy when i bought psp and played crisis core ffvii and thats awesome. I hope to see that in this game but rather get the same experience, i got it alittle boring. This game is so damn linear and unlike any other FF games this game dont features sidequest or hidden treasure but still, this is a good game.ProsThis game has amazing graphics (CGI maybe) and good battle system. I am an anime fan and of course I like the voice acting and the classic music is fantastic. Interesting place or setting for the game.ConsIt was very LINEAR, its like u just following a long straight path. Character motive is difficult to understand.Weird leveling system, u couldn't upgrade what u want.Overall this grame is great but like I mentioned above its not too great to be ur JRPG. If u hatehallway u shouldn't pick up this. Go straight to XIII-II			"

												don't just don't I usually like to leave reviews after i have actually played the entire game but the continual stuttering and the wall of possible ""solutions"" for it makes me think for the first time ever ""why didn't i just pay 30$ for a used copy for my PS3"".  The fact is this is still a continual issue that they have not bothered to fix before shoveling the second one out.  This just plain disgusts me as a loyal customer to the company and a die hard fan of the final fantasy series (ya since nintendo).  Its seems like another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port to grab up some extra cash I feel that they either didn't care or just flat out disregarded the PC community allowing their name to pull us into buying it because who cares if it doesn't perform well the cash has been spent. .   I spent 6 hour downloading this game and another 6 hours trying to find a fix for the stuttering and the missing voice over audio whenever the characters speak.   One thing is right though it is a unique experience I don't think anything has made me this frustrated outside of an EA game.   I honestly would recommend just buying it for your console (and I am not a fan of consoles) but the money spent would be well worth it to avoid this crippling dissapointment.			"

												I thought that this game was really good  and I'm one who thinks FF10 was the best in the series. It has a  confusing but yet has a good story and character development. It isn't open world like FF7 or FF10 where you can fly in a ship but you can re-vist three areas near the end of the game (stuff like the Calm Lands in FF10.) It is pretty linear and certain monster are tough as f**k. I would reccomend if you are looking a for another decent succesor in the Final Fantasy series. I would NOT reccomend this game if you are new to the Final Fantasy series since you will be extremely confused with the battle style and abilities. Maybe start off at Final Fantasy 6 or 7.			"

												As they said where everybody is super there nobody is super. Main character Snow is flat and... wait Hope is the main charachter... no wait or maybe Light, it doesn't metter.  If you have at least a little bit of brain you might not like it. Why? because this game treats you you like an idiot. 1. Almost everything is set to auto and you are not allowed to do anything. 2. Compare to previous parts - no freedom, places or world map to be discovered, only very narrow corridors you are running straight from point A to B. 3. You are not allowed to pick you characters, instead they are split and you are jumping every 30 minutes to different team with slightly different story (but no history about them at all). 4. You have to spent a lot of time reading about the entire background story to undderstand what is going on. 5. Couple of major bosses I've finished pressing only one button ""A"" on my controller (was eating lunch at the same time). If you want to play good Final Fantasy game, I would recommend FFV, FFVI, FFVII, FFVIII instead.			"

												Updated: I have flipped this from a not recommend to a recommend thanks to the patch that changed a lot of the graphics issues. There's still a really stupid bug where there is a lot of frameskip if I don't have the xbox controller plugged in, but I'm glad Squeenix appears to be listening to the complaining and have made this port a lot better in the past couple months. Now it's a real treat to play on the PC, where landscapes/textures are even more vibarant and certain components of the game run even smoother than PS3 on a nice graphics card. Note that many pre-rendered movies for the game have not been upscaled, but still maintain a good quality even when playing in a nice 1080p graphics mode.			"

												Finished it in December 2014, and I hated it.I gave this game another chance today - because all the hype around FFXV made me want to play some FF, so I started again.

												First of all let me start by saying that I've played through this game three times now, twice on ps3 (getting the platinum trophy the second time), and once on here. This game, and it's sequels, are by far my favorite game series and that is mostly to do with the characters. They're well-rounded, relatable, and you can't help but empathize with them. All of their relationships are rich and complex, and the game didn't have to resort to putting romance at the forefront to do it unlike many of their other games. It also has a female protagonist whose entire reason for existing isn’t about furthering a man’s storyline, so for that refreshing change of pace I’d give this an A++.The game of course isn't without its flaws, but I think the biggest one for me personally was how repetitive battling was in the beginning. The game basically built in a continuous tutorial throughout your adventure so that you can master paradigm shifts and whatnot before it really begins to matter. This, of course, can be irritating if you’ve played the game before, or are a faster learner. Still, I found the paradigm system to be much more engaging and fun than the bland turn-based gameplay of RPGs in the past. The game is also very linear until you get to Gran Pulse, but at least Square Enix seemed to listen to complaints about that, as both sequels following this game gives you more freedom with open world gameplay. When I had a crappier computer, the game played flawlessly up until Lake Bresha, where the FPS dropped to barely a smidge above 15. It was completely unplayable, and I had to wait until I got a better computer in order to finish the game. It now played perfectly with a solid 60 FPS during the entire rest of the game and has not crashed once, so for those of you complaining about it being a crap port… get a better computer, or play it on the platform it was originally intended for. Some games are just too much for badly specced computers to handle, and that goes for all games – not just ones that are ported.Anyway, overall I highly recommend it; not just this game but the series as a whole. It’s been worth every penny for me.			"

Posted: December 11, 2014
Note: This review is updated to take the recently added graphic options into account.I'll start with the port before moving to my opinion about the game itself (which I for some idiotic reason 100% completed).PC port:Graphic options:The recent patch added graphic options to the game, which include  -Custom resolutions (up to 1080p (+?))  -MSAA Anti-aliasing (up to x16)  -Shadow resolutions (up to 8192 x 8192)  -(and full-screen/windowed mode)So yeah, it's better than nothing, but it's not exactly amazing. Options are also changed in the launcher, which means that you can't change them in the game. The game runs at 60fps.(It might be that the resolution goes higher than 1080p and it just doesn't show them to me because I have a 1080p monitor. Let me know if this is the case.)Performance is poor, as a result of very poor PC optimization. Some people have reported that they are running this with smooth 60fps, but other people have reported huge performance issues even with high-end machines. I myself am getting around 30fps. What seems to be causing this is the UI, which is in some way bugged, and disabling the UI via a thirdy party program actually gives me a huge performance increase. However, you obviously can't play the game without the UI. This is something that Square should really look in to and fix it. FFXIII is not an action game so I found that bareable, but your opinion (and performance) may vary. I'd never play an action focused game at 30fps.There is still no audio options, which is a problem for some people. There's also both Japanese and English audio, although this heavily increases the file size. The game is roughly 50gb, so that might a problem for you if you have a small hard-drive or a slow internet connection.Keyboard and mouse controls are functionable, although I found playing with a controller much more pleasant.Keyboard and mouse controls are mostly rebindable. Mostly. You can't rebind movement controls from WASD (or whatever AZERTY uses) and selection keys, which are left and right mouse buttons. I really don't see this as a problem because, honestly, would you actually ever rebind those? Rest of the keys are fully rebindable.So yeah, the port is still very barebones, but if you can deal with that, I think that the game is worth playing. Review of the actual game:Final Fantasy XIII is a very story focused game, so if this is not what you are looking for, I wouldn't recommend the game for you. First eleven chapters of the game are very linear, but this allowed them to focus on the story telling in a way that would not have been possible on a more open game, although at times even I found this linearity fairly dull. I actually quite enjoyed the story of the game.I have one problem with the characters though. In my opinion, Final Fantasy XIII has five well written characters, and then there is Lightning. I just found her incredibly boring character, and aside from one scene in around chapter 4 or something with Hope, she received practically zero character development. This would not be a huge problem if she wouldn't happen to also be the main character of the game. On the other hand, I found all the other characters very well written. Combat system of the game is fairly unique, and while it starts out as very repetitive, I did find it quite interesting after a while. Although I must recommend that do not use ""Auto-Battle"" button. Just don't, that makes the combat very dull and isn't always the most optional option anyway. I have some minor problems with it though, biggest one being that you can't change your party leader/controlled character during the combat. I heart that this is changed in FFXIII-2, so I'm quite looking forward to that.Soundtrack of the game was in my opinion also very good, although thanks to the sound balance (which you can not change due to lack of audio options), it's not quite as loud as I would have liked.As I said, the game is very linear, but honestly, the side quests that the game introduces in chapter 11 are very dull. I got obsessed with it and got all the achivements, but I really do not recommend that. It is very grindy and takes countless of hours and hours, and hours of time. There is a reason why only 0,64% have the Treasure Hunter achievement. Just, don't do it. Play through the story and do those few side quests (Cie'th Stone missions) that you do during it, and leave it at that.In the end, I enjoyed FFXIII, despite its faults. Thanks to the linearity, I found some of the chapters fairly boring and doing all the side quests definitely wasn't enjoyable, but the story, combat, and the characters (aside from Lighting) were quite good. I do recommend the game, at least to fans of JRPGs.			"

												I haven't beaten it as of this writing, but I've gotten to the part everyone considers to be the best part. Which is about 20-30 hours in. I personally enjoyed everything so far. Except Hope. That kid is annoying. The port was originally awful. I myself used a mod to make it better. But since release they have patched it to be much much better. Still not a great port, but if you like Final Fantasy or JRPGs, this has one of the best battle systems out there and some of the best graphics in a FF game.			"

												If you're a long time fan of the Final Fantasy series, then you're in for another treat. Although the game is extremely linear, the majority of the game is very enjoyable. Furthermore, no game is without it's fair share of problems. Half the cast of characters that you'll be playing with aren't needed within the games story at all. Instead, they seem to either be an annoyance, or hardly used due to being a weaker overall character compared to others. The story is fair, nothing that will blow you out of the water but enough to keep you interested and looking to see what happens in the game which if you look around and do a fair amount of battles/training, can see from start to finish of the game, last you 40-50 hours. The music however, is fantastic. Every battle, area, cutscene, has different unique music to it that's very enjoyable and my personal highlight of the game. Another con for this game is that in my opinion, it has zero replayability to it whatsoever. Unless you're looking to play the game in a few years after completing it, which is completely fine, then replaying the story soon after beating the game isn't probably something you want to do. It's linearity is what condences the game too much which makes it feel very repetitive and not very engaging as if it would be more open. Finally, one huge complaint that many people seem to have in the framerate in the game. Although a small sample of people don't have any issues, the vast majority of players will experience constant framerate drops throughout the game.  Cutscenes will always hit 60FPS without problem, but there are areas in the game that can see fluctuation in FPS. If you're using the minimap, just disabling it will for whatever reason, will increase the FPS drastically. Enabling the mini-map will drop your frames to 40 in most places, but disabling it will push it back up to a full 60FPS. Additionally, when entering a battle, the frames will even drop to 30FPS. Square Enix could've done a much better job of porting this over to help the FPS issues that many players have and would've made the experience of the game a little better. The game struggles in certain places, but that doesn't overshadow the other aspects of the game too much. If you're a long time Final Fantasy fan or even a newcommer, I'd say pick it up.

												I see a lot of negative reviews towards this game, I've been playing it, and havn't beaten it yet, but i'm on Chapter 10 right now, nearly finish Chapter 10.  This game has 13 chapter, the gameplay is long, and some bosses are quite hard, and this is not a joke.  People will say ooo this game is easy and all that, but don't be fooled by the reviews user give out on public.  I've been playing this game for about 30 hours total.  I love the battle system, the characters are great, and I must say it is a bit different from other final fantasy games, but not extirely.I don't see why all the hate towards this game, I really love this game.  It has a very addictive battle system and leveling up the storyline is actually great, and not confusing like many will say.I got confused as I started Final Fantasy XIII-2 on Xbox 360 back in the day and almost finished it, but was entirely confused as I didn't played the first one lulz.  Now I'm playing it on PC which is better on, and I just bought FFXIII-2, so I can't wait to finish up FFXIII and jump on FFXIII-2 on PC, I never played the 2nd one on PC, and very excited to play it again because I will now understand the first part of the story.I say get this game it is a very amazing game, and Yes i'm all possitive for this game its one of the best graphics i ever seen in a final fantasy game, and it is pretty damn good!Thanks for reading my Review, and I hope more and more people actually put the real positive truth of this game.  If you are a JRPG gamer and a fan of Final Fantasy, it is one big collection to add on steam :)It is also the biggest Final Fantasy game ever made.			"

												This game is a straight line. It brings new meaning to linear. While this does make it virtually impossible to get lost, any backtracking is literally running the game backwards.

												This game was so bad, it made me write my first review. The game basically consists of walking in straight lines, and is a dissapointment to the Final Fantasy series. You can only control a single character at a time (the rest are controlled by AI), and fights are basically made obsolete by an auto-attack button that chooses the best attack option for you. There is no leveling up through fights (so one may ask why even bother to engage enemies), and most engagements can be avoided by walking around an enemy. Combining all this with save points every 30 seconds (literally), just makes me wonder why even bother playing?The story line is completely lackluster and mind numbingly dull, yet you are forced to sit through an eternity of cut-scenes after every linear corridor you walk through. It makes little to no sense if you don't intend on reading the never ending amount of side notes in the menu, and is possibly the worst in the entire Final Fantasy series.Don't waste your money on this.

												This is one of my favorite games. People say it's linear and it is, but you can still choose to play the end game or not, which is about 40% of the game. The game might lack some mystery for being linear in terms of where to go and what to do, but the story makes up for that by being just as mysterious and making you want to keep going. I've played all of the Final Fantasy games and I just agree with this one the most personally.  The combat is fun to figure out as well and gives you options to customize your team how you want to play. You can focus on Buffs,Debuffs,Meele,Casting,Tanking. While sometimes it's necessary to focus on certain ones more than others you still develop your own way of playing different than others. The summons aren't as amazing or appealing as previous FF games though. One of the huge things I like is that the main character doesn't whine or come off as annoying like most other FF Games.			"

												This game is just okay. It has real flaws, but isn't as awful as it's sometimes made out to be. True the battle system is dreadful, and the corridors are annoying, but I did like having such a character focused story. I didn't like was some of the rediculous gatchas thrown in to make a more complicated plot; this game has a some goofy plot points that probably could have been done much, much better. CinemaSins on youtube has a hilarious 3 video review of what the plot and story did wrong, and it's well worth watching.Also didn't like the lame combat system, stupid puzzles, and cardboard character stereotypes.

												Final Fantasy XIII is still one of my favourites in the FF series that I've played so far of X and XII and multiple Crystal Chronicle games. It's combat style is quick paced and interesting to watch but can unfortunately become a tedious mash of auto battle unless you are looking for the best strategies to consistantly 5 star your fights and boss battles in epic strategic frustration.It's story is based mostly on the development of characters' morals and their reason to ""keep on fighting"" but other than that we are left quite in the dark about the history of Cocoon and Gran Pulse which would have been amazing to flesh out and bring to life within the game. I have yet to finish FF XIII-2 or play Lightning Returns to see how the world fleshes out but it is an interesting and exciting universe. However, it's linearity is frustrating but offers the same number of options previous Final Fantasy games offered for early game story. The length of the ""tutorial"" as seen by a lot of the public to be the first 9 or so chapters can be quickly played through with dodges and correct combinations of upgrades in less than 4 hours but this requires a lot of skill and strategy of a later playthrough. So for your first time sitting through expect a 15 hour + ""tutorial"" but with a lot of ""annoying"" characters that have you screaming ""ughhh, not you again"" to ""why won't you just die!""Overall, I enjoyed my experience with the computer ported game as it ran just as smoothly and even smoother in most parts than my previous Xbox360 could handle and also displayed in better resolution when I have quite a weak laptop for such displays. I barely experienced lag so far in my play and found this still to be one of my favourite games.			"

But all that aside This game here is worth taking the time to play regardless of what people say. Wish they stuck with this battle system going forward (FFXV/lighting returns), altho type-o battle system is also fun.			"

												This was my first entry into the series back on the 360 and I enjoyed it a lot. The game is linear until you get 2/3 into the game then the world opens up a little and you can take on side quests. The story can be quite confusing. I only learned what was really going on after getting all the achievements/trophies on 360 and PS3. Combat is deceptive where you would think ""auto battle"" does the work for you but you still have to strategize properly with assigning each characters particular roles and how to use them properly. If you came from the consoles, the only differences are expected PC features (higher resolutions, fullscreen mode, shadow resolution, etc.) and easy mode. The game is maybe slightly visually better but the framerates are the real problem. You can go up to 60 fps but don't expect to stay there. I'll look at a mob of enemies and stay at 60 fps but then I'll look at a blank wall and drop to 12 fps. This isn't a game breaking issue as precision is not required for the game but it does hurt the overall experience when you notice it and you will notice it.			"

This being a port of the consoles it was fixed at a 720p resolution and apparently had bad anti-aliasing, but be excited to know that since December 2014 it was patched to have a simple graphics setup on launch where you can choose resolution, shadow resolution, and anti-aliasing. As far as I'm concerned the game looks AMAZING for a game from 2009 with this port and I totally reccomend it. It looks extremely better than it did on 360.			"

												[Spoiler-free review!]After playing the game on PS3 at its release time and after pouring 50+ hours on this Windows port, I think I can say my opinion about this game. Let's start with the bad stuff.Final Fantasy XIII at the time caused much fuss as it's the first Final Fantasy game that is ""on rails"" for pretty much the 90% of the time: you can't explore the world as you wish (except much, much further in the storyline), and the maps really feel like a tunnel where what you can do is just to face monsters, wave after wave.I can agree on all of this, and initially I was kind of put off by it -- add the fact that in the first 2 chapters your characters have limited abilities and attack powers, to the point that fights in these chapters can be summarized with ""attack, attack, attack, ... , potion, attack, attack..."" and so on and so forth.So why is this review a recommendation?First of all don't treat this game like a classic FF game but for what it is: a gorgeous adventure with unexpected plot twists, that in time will make you absolutely love all the protagonist characters.I won't speak much about graphics as screenshots and trailers can speak for themselves -- yes, that's in-game, realtime graphics! -- and instead I will focus on the combat system, that I unexpectedly found out to be very tactical (albeit it unlocks fully starting with chapter 3).It is very easy to understand but takes time to master: in short, you take direct control only of the ""leader"" character of a 3-man party using the classic Final Fantasy's Active Time Battle system; the other characters execute actions according to paradigms (think ""strategies"") that you can plan before each battle. For example, you could have a very offensive paradigm with one physical attacker and two ravagers, a very defensive one with a medic, a synergist and a sentinel or something in between; during the battle you can switch at any point in time among up to six different paradigms. Much different than what I just said about the prologue now, isn't it? =DIn conclusion... if you like JRPGs and good stories, and you can bear map linearity give this game a chance. It's a good one.My vote: 8 / 10			"

												let me start this off by saying the reviews are very misleading. I am four hours in and am hooked.you will have to access the datalog to look up certain information, because the dialogue doesn't really do a good job of spelling out what these things are..the controls with the keyboard will take 10-20 minutes to get used to, but besides that the game is fantastic.great combat system and animated characters, besides Vanille. I have only played 4 hours but Vanille is like cancer to my ears.			"

												I like this game; its got a great battle system and the soundtrack is nearly flawless. I'm only 15 hours into the game but so far the story is pretty captivating.my biggest beef with the game is that its pretty linear, but its no where near as bad as FF4. the graphics are amazing, especially for a game made in 2009! Most of the environments are breathtaking and very well designed.The characters have flaws and traits that are both likable and dislikeable, you'll have favourites and ones that you dont like as much, but overall, pretty well written characters. I got this game for $8 on sale and its was well worth it. if you're on the fence about the game i suggest buying it on sale. I actually prefer this to some of the earlier games like FF4 and FF10. 15 hours in and I'm not bored at all, FF13 starts slow, but if you give it time it really grows on you.I think this game is fun, dont listen to people who whine about the story, they are the reason FF Legends was made.

												Having played this game on Xbox 360, I can say I am happy to own it on PC now as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the game and I don't undertand what is so confusing about the story to people. At this point, I think it is just a fad to call this story confusing. Sure some of the charatcers seem a little flat and aren't lovable, but they grow on you in different ways. Definitely by far, Hope has the most character development and becomes one of my favorites story-wise by the end of the game. Enough about the story though, let's talk about the port. So far (Although I haven't played it much yet) I have not run into a single bug, runs just as smooth as you would expect from a Square Enix game. the 60fps is definitely noticable having played it at a now considerably less smooth 30fps on console. The anti-aliasing is also a great touch going all the way up to 16x to wipe away the jaggies that 7th gen console games are known for. Having not actually changed the textures of the game (which still look fine for 2014), don't worry about raising the settings and experiencing lag because as long as you meet the recommended, pump up that AA. The shadows resolution goes all the way up to 8k creating crisp player shadows suring fights and walking around. And last but not least, being able to run this game natively 1080p is a dream come true. Given the astonishing beauty of this game even on console, a 1080p version of it makes it all the better and really turns this game into a piece of art. Now as for cons, just wish that they would have tweaked the gameplay just a bit like the camera control which is still god-awful. All it wants to do is reset back to center. Might as well have a fixed camera. I would have liked better camera control to admire the beautiful scenery this game has to offer. Also speeding up the gameplay such as making paradigm shifts smoother like in XIII-2 would have been nice. Instead you have the long drawn-out shifts. Also I would have liked to see them up the amount of Gil you get from treasure chests or maybe throw in Gil when you win a battle. Gil shortage was a huge problem in the console version and required endless hours of Trapezohedron and Plat ingot hunting to get enough to get everyone's final weapons. On console, I put about 120 hrs into a single playthrough of this game and probably more than 20 of it was grinding for money... This game was obviously a copy and paste port, but at the price point, can't blame them.Given there are no bugs so far and the game looks better and plays just as well as on console, I give the port a 9/10 and the game a 8/10. For a final fantasy game story wise, 7.5/10.

												Let me say this: You had better turn on the Japanese voices before you play this game.With that taken care of it makes the story more engaging (imho).Pros1. COMBAT. IS. SUPERB.2. The visual syle is very much Final Fantasy3. Soundtrack is beautiful to listen to4. Character development and interaction5. Stunning set pieces6. Combat animations. The way the characters fight in battle is how I imagined FF should be in my head while I was growing up.8. Ability to upgrade every weapon and accessory in the game7. Sazh. Most interesting character and extremely useful in battleCons1. ......VANILLE2. Mostly linear (But I don't hear people complaining about FFX's linearity?!!!! Cut this game some slack)3. 50GB download (C'mon, guys. Really?)4. Crystarium is limited by story progressionReally the main thing I loathe about this game are the English voices for Vanille (that's the woman's real voice, btw. Some kind of Australian/British/American thing she has going on. Absolutely horrendous), Snow (Even though he is a good voice actor I don't like how he portrayed this character), and Hope. Just......look, no one cares, Hope. Shutup.I am enjoying my second playthrough and picking up on things that I missed the first time around.I had forgot about Sazh's son, Dajh, being a Cocoon l'cie while Sazh is a Pule l'cie. Dem feelsI would recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of JRPGs and FF in general.			"

												I totally fallen in love with Lightning and the whole story. The graphic is amazing and it makes me fun all the time to explore the new areas.I`m pretty happy that I can play this game, too because I have no PS3 or Xbox.The game play wasn`t so easy at the beginning for me because you can only controll Ligthing and there are different modis, which are important for the fight. But training is everything and when you`ve got how it works, it is pretty much fun and I can`t wait, how the story will go on and to play the next part.For Fasn of Final Fantasy is it a must have and I definitly would recommend to other people.

												What is there to say Final Fantasy XIII is a very great game visually an improved version over consoles. Though the game is very linear to begin with and i expect to some that will be somewhat boring. I found it to be great fun the story is involving and interesting which is one of the reasons why final fantasy games are so popular. All in all its worth getting.			"

												Having played Final Fantasy XIII on the PS3 twice, I decided to purchase the game once again, this time for Steam. The game will take up a big amount of GB, around 50. Yes, that is much, because of the many cutscenes this game has. The game has a good and interesting story, maybe a bit confusing at times if you don't pay attention, but luckily, you can reread all of it in the game itself; so if you take a break from playing the game, coming back to it later and don't know what's going on, it's easy getting back into.The battle system is pretty cool. You can only control one character in battle, but that's not a bad thing, since the battles are still pretty busy when you're fighting enemies. It is true that you don't have a lot of freedom in the game when it comes to exploration, it is pretty linear, but on the other side, it gives the story enough time to unfold itself.The characters are all individual; one is funny, the other one may be more serious, etc. I'm sure you'll find someone you like. My personal favorite is Lightning.All in all, I like the approach that this game in the Final Fantasy series is taking. Alot of times, people complain about that games and their sequels are too similar, so why not change something once in a while?I hope you have as much fun with this game like me.			"

												I brought this game when it was released on PS3 because there was a guy with a chicken residing in his afro. No joke. Okay, I wanted to give a Final Fantasy game a try too.I was very pleasantly surprised.Yes, the game has it's shortcomings. The vast majority of the game has you running down ""corridors"" because the game is THAT linear. Yes, the story is a bit confusing to begin with, but once you get into the swing of things it picks up quite well (there's always the internet/datalog to assist you). Yes, the meat of the gameplay doesn't really begin to surface until a few hours in when you can manage your team and get into the bigger fights. Yes, there is a bit of grinding towards the end as the difficulty curve increases sharply.However, after all that you still have an interesting game with unique and fleshed-out characters, with a fantastic musical score, in-depth lore, emotion-invoking story, immersive graphics, and intense gameplay to boot! I was really happy with my purchase and it took me a good 30-40 hours to complete the game first time around. In fact, at the time I couldn't help but pray for a sequel (which, it turns out, wasn't as good and XIII was in fact best as a standalone story).If you like Final Fantasy or game's with fantastic story/cutscenes, I whole-heartedly recommend this game. For the price, I recommend just trying it out anyway even if it isn't your usual cup of tea!			"

												This game was so bad, it made me write my first review. The game basically consists of walking in straight lines, and is a dissapointment to the Final Fantasy series. You can only control a single character at a time (the rest are controlled by AI), and fights are basically made obsolete by an auto-attack button that chooses the best attack option for you. There is no leveling up through fights (so one may ask why even bother to engage enemies), and most engagements can be avoided by walking around an enemy. Combining all this with save points every 30 seconds (literally), just makes me wonder why even bother playing?The story line is completely lackluster and mind numbingly dull, yet you are forced to sit through an eternity of cut-scenes after every linear corridor you walk through. It makes little to no sense if you don't intend on reading the never ending amount of side notes in the menu, and is possibly the worst in the entire Final Fantasy series.Don't waste your money on this.

												I see a lot of negative reviews towards this game, I've been playing it, and havn't beaten it yet, but i'm on Chapter 10 right now, nearly finish Chapter 10.  This game has 13 chapter, the gameplay is long, and some bosses are quite hard, and this is not a joke.  People will say ooo this game is easy and all that, but don't be fooled by the reviews user give out on public.  I've been playing this game for about 30 hours total.  I love the battle system, the characters are great, and I must say it is a bit different from other final fantasy games, but not extirely.I don't see why all the hate towards this game, I really love this game.  It has a very addictive battle system and leveling up the storyline is actually great, and not confusing like many will say.I got confused as I started Final Fantasy XIII-2 on Xbox 360 back in the day and almost finished it, but was entirely confused as I didn't played the first one lulz.  Now I'm playing it on PC which is better on, and I just bought FFXIII-2, so I can't wait to finish up FFXIII and jump on FFXIII-2 on PC, I never played the 2nd one on PC, and very excited to play it again because I will now understand the first part of the story.I say get this game it is a very amazing game, and Yes i'm all possitive for this game its one of the best graphics i ever seen in a final fantasy game, and it is pretty damn good!Thanks for reading my Review, and I hope more and more people actually put the real positive truth of this game.  If you are a JRPG gamer and a fan of Final Fantasy, it is one big collection to add on steam :)It is also the biggest Final Fantasy game ever made.			"

												Don't get me wrong this game has more than a few flaws but personally I managed to look past them. It's kind of hard to persuade people in this situation because the problems this game has I don't really pay attention to. Also for the price it's at I doubt anyone would be interested.Plot-Personally I liked it, it was something different as to what I have played before, really I don't have a problem with it. However that is one to be disagreed with because according to some people it's hard to understand, which I can relate to at times. Gameplay-One of the major problems in the game for me. Yes, the game does have a very nice switching paradigm system but it's all dumbed down by the fact that you can just auto-battle and win. Graphics-I love this game's graphics, the enemies, the surroundings. When you get to Chapter 11 you will see how great it is however it will take a LONG time to get there and when I got there my fps dropped substantially.Characters-I believe most people have problems with the same ones namely Hope, Vanille and Snow. I can agree with Hope to some degree but he gets less ""hopeless"" *wink* as time goes on. Vanille is extremely kooky and at first I didn't like her but I started to like her as time went on. Snow is my favourite character but he's a complete idiot.Finally the part almost everyone has a problem with...corridors. It's all good saying ""oh well if you get to chapter 11 it opens up"" ok bright idea I will play over 30 hours of your game to get to the fun part, nope, it isn't going to happen. Needless to say I persevered and I tried to ignore it and to be honest I didn't have to try hard. To me as long as a game has interesting parts that keep me preoccupied I couldn't care less about corridors. However that is down to opinion, also one last thing I want to state before jumping to my conclusion, the New-Game+ is good but a few things are getting on my nerves. If you do get to the end and you actually do like it there are a few things you can do afterwards like the remaining quests (stone missions), maxing out COMPLETELY (trust me it's going to take years to do so) and getting all achievements. Where most of my beef comes from is maxing out, it will take ages, there is however a way to speed it up. One of the missions will give a Growth Egg doubling xp so when you need it is when your low levelled (logic). However that's where the problem comes in, to beat the boss that drops it you can either be almost maxed out (if so what's the point of the reward) or test your luck at getting a 1% chance instant kill move. Good Luck...So I can only really say buy the game if you can look past its problems which I did but I am not saying it will work for you. I liked it because I tried to look past all of it and in the end I succeeded, I came out pleased. I was stuck on what to give this because in many ways it can be considered a really bad game. Its lacklustre start will put of most people but as long as you can endure it until the half way point hopefully it will start to change your mind. I reccommend it just purely because I found it fun. Even though I have covered more than a few things to me the game has so much more good things about it than bad.			"

												this game is absolute garbage. the story is absolute garbage til 30 hours in the combat system barely works it requires you to switch between different paradigms but  regardless of what paragidm you use sometimes rngn will screw you over. the other major problem with the combat system is the fact you have to wait to attack and then those attacks can be interrupted if you are attacked in the middle of them which means bosses that chain attacks can literally 4 shot you in any paradigm so regardless of what you use some fights just come down to rng aka luck to win. all around this is a downgrade in every way but one from other final fantasy games whats that one things you ask graphics. so if you want a turd wrapped in pretty paper buy fail fantasy 13 and youll have your wish granted. also gone is leveling now you have a completely asinine crysthanium leveling system which you get points to upgrade based off a rating system that shows up after combat but there is no clear cut way tol get a higher rating sometimes i do perfect and get 3 stars other times i almost die and i get 5 IN EVERY SINGLE WAY THIS GAME WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT.1/10 now i have to go boil my eyeballs to make the pain of my childhood dieing go away.

												If you have played any other previous final fantasy game other then XI and XIV then you won't be dissappointed. the story is great the music is amazing and the core gameplay is much faster than others. If your not sure due to the ""graphical issues"" then how about you turn your frame counter off and play it at the default settings on either resolution. With it off your experience is 100 times better and this game never lags or stutters even if <30fps			"

												If you're a long time fan of the Final Fantasy series, then you're in for another treat. Although the game is extremely linear, the majority of the game is very enjoyable. Furthermore, no game is without it's fair share of problems. Half the cast of characters that you'll be playing with aren't needed within the games story at all. Instead, they seem to either be an annoyance, or hardly used due to being a weaker overall character compared to others. The story is fair, nothing that will blow you out of the water but enough to keep you interested and looking to see what happens in the game which if you look around and do a fair amount of battles/training, can see from start to finish of the game, last you 40-50 hours. The music however, is fantastic. Every battle, area, cutscene, has different unique music to it that's very enjoyable and my personal highlight of the game. Another con for this game is that in my opinion, it has zero replayability to it whatsoever. Unless you're looking to play the game in a few years after completing it, which is completely fine, then replaying the story soon after beating the game isn't probably something you want to do. It's linearity is what condences the game too much which makes it feel very repetitive and not very engaging as if it would be more open. Finally, one huge complaint that many people seem to have in the framerate in the game. Although a small sample of people don't have any issues, the vast majority of players will experience constant framerate drops throughout the game.  Cutscenes will always hit 60FPS without problem, but there are areas in the game that can see fluctuation in FPS. If you're using the minimap, just disabling it will for whatever reason, will increase the FPS drastically. Enabling the mini-map will drop your frames to 40 in most places, but disabling it will push it back up to a full 60FPS. Additionally, when entering a battle, the frames will even drop to 30FPS. Square Enix could've done a much better job of porting this over to help the FPS issues that many players have and would've made the experience of the game a little better. The game struggles in certain places, but that doesn't overshadow the other aspects of the game too much. If you're a long time Final Fantasy fan or even a newcommer, I'd say pick it up.

												A brave step away from the many things the franchise holds dear.. unfortunately, it doesn't pay off. Linear story and little autonomy make this game disengaging. Developers try very hard to make you care for the characters through constant cutscenes but those attempts fall flaccid. An interesting concept, a poor execution.			"

												Very linear but expected from any Final Fantasy game.The fights inspired by FFXII are very dynamic and enjoyable. Changing roles in combat is a very a good idea (I think it was already in an older version of FF).Also, the way to develop characters' skills is well thought. A better version of the spheres in FFX.The story is ok and the graphics are there.This game should be played by any FF lover.			"

												As a long time Final Fantasy fan, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. This game lacks substance. There's nothing to break up the boring, monotonous gameplay. No real minigames, nothing really other than a hallway simulator with some terrain changes to make it appear like you're actually doing something. Final Fantasy X had blitzball, it was an integral part of that game and it was a lot of fun. It made sense from a lore perspective and they just happened to make it a very enjoyable minigame too. It had chocobo racing and quite a few other minigames. Final Fantasy VII had so many minigames there's not even a point to me mentioning it. The point I'm trying to make here, is that all those other games had SUBSTANCE. The combat and the storyline was the main attraction yes, but they had many other aspects to the game that made the world interesting and fun. Exploration, The Chocobo races in FFVII even had a betting system, it had that fully fledged Mog Game. FF 13 has no real substance aside from it's main narrative. Walk a bit - fight - walk a bit - fight. Story advances. Rinse, repeat. The graphics are really good and the gameplay is so so. The soundtrack is decent, but it doesn't have any memorable tracks like Nubuo Uematsu's from FF7. That being said, this games biggest flaw is that it fails to captivate me in any way shape or form unlike almost every Final Fantasy before it had done. The Paradigm system was interesting to use and fun at times, but I prefer Turn Based Combat akin to the majority of FF Games. I'm finishing this because I'm a diehard FF fan and not because I want to.			"

												First of all let me start by saying that I've played through this game three times now, twice on ps3 (getting the platinum trophy the second time), and once on here. This game, and it's sequels, are by far my favorite game series and that is mostly to do with the characters. They're well-rounded, relatable, and you can't help but empathize with them. All of their relationships are rich and complex, and the game didn't have to resort to putting romance at the forefront to do it unlike many of their other games. It also has a female protagonist whose entire reason for existing isn’t about furthering a man’s storyline, so for that refreshing change of pace I’d give this an A++.The game of course isn't without its flaws, but I think the biggest one for me personally was how repetitive battling was in the beginning. The game basically built in a continuous tutorial throughout your adventure so that you can master paradigm shifts and whatnot before it really begins to matter. This, of course, can be irritating if you’ve played the game before, or are a faster learner. Still, I found the paradigm system to be much more engaging and fun than the bland turn-based gameplay of RPGs in the past. The game is also very linear until you get to Gran Pulse, but at least Square Enix seemed to listen to complaints about that, as both sequels following this game gives you more freedom with open world gameplay. When I had a crappier computer, the game played flawlessly up until Lake Bresha, where the FPS dropped to barely a smidge above 15. It was completely unplayable, and I had to wait until I got a better computer in order to finish the game. It now played perfectly with a solid 60 FPS during the entire rest of the game and has not crashed once, so for those of you complaining about it being a crap port… get a better computer, or play it on the platform it was originally intended for. Some games are just too much for badly specced computers to handle, and that goes for all games – not just ones that are ported.Anyway, overall I highly recommend it; not just this game but the series as a whole. It’s been worth every penny for me.			"

												I've recently played Final Fantasy XV, being my first true Final Fantasy game I've played. So I bought some other games from the series because I liked 15 so much. This game doesn't dissapoint, kind of repetitive fights, but other than that, very fun. Amazing visuals, great characters, and a nice story to follow along with. I'm very glad I tried out this game, as well as others.			"

												Final Fantasy XIII is still one of my favourites in the FF series that I've played so far of X and XII and multiple Crystal Chronicle games. It's combat style is quick paced and interesting to watch but can unfortunately become a tedious mash of auto battle unless you are looking for the best strategies to consistantly 5 star your fights and boss battles in epic strategic frustration.It's story is based mostly on the development of characters' morals and their reason to ""keep on fighting"" but other than that we are left quite in the dark about the history of Cocoon and Gran Pulse which would have been amazing to flesh out and bring to life within the game. I have yet to finish FF XIII-2 or play Lightning Returns to see how the world fleshes out but it is an interesting and exciting universe. However, it's linearity is frustrating but offers the same number of options previous Final Fantasy games offered for early game story. The length of the ""tutorial"" as seen by a lot of the public to be the first 9 or so chapters can be quickly played through with dodges and correct combinations of upgrades in less than 4 hours but this requires a lot of skill and strategy of a later playthrough. So for your first time sitting through expect a 15 hour + ""tutorial"" but with a lot of ""annoying"" characters that have you screaming ""ughhh, not you again"" to ""why won't you just die!""Overall, I enjoyed my experience with the computer ported game as it ran just as smoothly and even smoother in most parts than my previous Xbox360 could handle and also displayed in better resolution when I have quite a weak laptop for such displays. I barely experienced lag so far in my play and found this still to be one of my favourite games.			"

												Love the graphics, some gritty feel, although like movies, the faces never get dirty. A very linear game, but fun none-the-less. There is not a whole lot of side quests, or excursions to build a character like an RPG. I got the game at a reduced price, and that made this a little more palatable for playing. It is very possible to keep the high end of scoring in the battles by simply mashing the buttons a bit faster. The choices in combat are very limited in the beginning, but appears to build. Overall score 7 out of 10			"

												Final Fantasy XIII is not a good Final Fantasy, but it's a really fun and gorgeous JRPG.The story follows two different worlds: Pulse and Cacoon, each so afraid of the others that even contact with someone from the other planet will cause friends and family to turn against each other in order to rid themselves of those affected. Ruled by benevloent creatures called fal'Cie, players follow a commando, Lightning, and the people she meets as they are touched and turned into l'Cie, or touched warriors, by a Pulse fal'Cie that had hidden on Cacoon for ages.The combat system features some FF staples such as Phoenix Downs, summons, and certain magics, but instead of picking abilities individually, most players will likely be auto-attacking. Instead, the challenge comes from its Role system, or Paradigms. Paradigms are customized for each party, and rather than selecting attacks, players will be juggling roles among their characters fairly heavily. The result is a little different from other FFs, but it's fast-paced, pretty fun, and can get fairly difficult if role combinations don't pit well against tougher fights. Characters can then be leveled up by putting points into their various roles.Perhaps the biggest criticism with the game comes from the exploration, as this is where XIII splits from previous titles. Instead of an open world environment, players are set along linear paths with little room to move about. There are no World Maps, airships to control, or forests filled with random battles to get lost in. It feels nothing like Final Fantasies in that that regard.However, franchise name aside, the maps tend to work. Most jRPGs are simply ""Go From Point A to Point B"" to begin with, even with World Maps. The tunnels make it easier to play in shorter bursts for people with busy lives, and they keep players from forgetting where to go if they put the game down for a few weeks. The game does open up significantly in Chapter 11, but for the most part the game trims the fat and focuses on the fights and getting through the story.It helps that the environments and character models are gorgeous. With the PC fixes/patches, everything is beautifully rendered with smooth models and bright color palette. The characters themselves are highly engaging (though some take longer to warm up to than others), and there's a great deal of cuteness scattered throughout. Even with the hallway maps, there is a great deal of content, and players can expect to spend 60+ hours easily to finish.I highly recommend this game if players can put the ""Final Fantasy"" name aside. There are certainly some great traditional FF elements here - big swords, Cid, a Moogleworks shop - but it doesn't feel like the classic games. That's perfectly ok. It's well worth the price when taken to be its own jRPG.			"

												Graphics are cool and both landscapes and cutscenes are really beautiful. The game is ok but I would only recommend it if you are looking for an experience closer to a movie than a game. The story is not inspired and the feeling is even worse with the characters. The skills evolution is linear and the map exploration is almost none (believe me, countless corridors). Battles are visually astonishing and fast but after a few ones, they lack of interest and fighting becomes boring.  Truth is you are going to enjoy just few parts of this game and keep moving with an “it’s ok” feeling rest of the time. And definitely, I am not going to buy any of the others FFXIII trilogy games.

The graphics on PC are amazingly hires on a 4k monitor which allowed for some truly amazing cut-scenes.   The story line is well written and the game fighting mechanics are very well done.  I'll admit that there is a lot of extra tedious side nonsense that you can get sucked into such as filling up your crystarium 100% and upgrading weapons which forces you to grind a bit.  Overall though the game is still winnable without having to grind too much.  I think that SE found a good balance between grind and play on this specific release.			"

I can't comment on the story because I uninstalled after about an hour. FFX had a similarly confusing beginning, but the story was far more gripping and the world more immersive. FF!2 had a far better semi real time combat system.The graphics were fine. Impressive, even, considering the time this game was made. But not enough.The only way I can imagine you'll like it is if you haven't played a better FF game. Huge disappointment. Thank god I didn't buy a PS3 to play this.			"

												After playin for 66 hours, around 200 screenshots and 16achievements i managed to play through this gameFirst of all: Final Fantasy XIII-1 is getting a lot of bad reviews, because its a ""corridor simulator"". While this is not exactly wrong, it isnt in Chapter 11, and this chapter offers quite alot to do. Two supperbosses, 64 missions, and lots of awesome areas to see. The story can be a bit confusing at some points, but is simply amazing, especially the end. I also see people complaining ""720p? 0/10 trash"". Thats crap. This game looks AMAZING. I can easily say its one of the most beautiful games i played so far. even above modded Skyrim. Its running smoothly on an AMD Anthlon II X2 250 3Ghz Processor with a, a NVIDIA GeForce 660 GTX and 8 Gb Ram. The only tanking FPS where at one of the final bossfights.

												The Story and Cinematics are awesome as always, however I was kinda dissapointed in the gameplay. If you expect a similar gameplay as in FF XII then you gonna get dissapointed. The Gambit system doesnt exist and the only thing you do is changing between predefined fighting stances (fighter, tank, mage, buffer, debuffer, healer) and press ""Auto"" to wait for your chars to end the battle. You also run in a straight line (which was probably said a billion times before) so the open world feeling as in FF XII is also non-existant.I won't tell anyone not to buy the game, because in the end the story was what kept me playing and you might love it as well.

FF XIII is not a ""traditional"" Final Fantasy game in the sense that it places the story front and center for the vast majority of the game. This is different than other FF games in that the battle systems, mini-games, character abilities, and exploration are primarily hands-off affairs for the first 15+ hours. Once that period is over, there is a rich game to explore and delve into, but it takes time and not everyone will be up for the investment it takes to get there.Here's the breakdown section by section:StoryThe majority of the story in FF XIII happens between the characters that you control and the group of seemingly antagonistic entities known as Fal'Cie. There is quite a bit that happens that would take far too long to detail, but know that this is a pretty story-rich game with decent character development and a satisfying story arc for each character. That said, there isn't a lot of explanation of the backstory for the world, the Fal'Cie, and environments that happens in-game, which leaves the player with questions. There is much, much more information that can be gained by reading the datalogs in the menu, but it can be quite tedious and it's a shame that there wasn't more of this information put in the actual game. Clearly this game asks for a large amount of time from the player, would it have been that much more onerous to explain the inner-workings of the game's world to the user without resorting to datalogs?BattlesThe battle system for a FF game is a good one. Similar to FF XII you are only in control of one of your three party members at a time, with the computer taking over for the other two. You can assign ""paradigms"" to your party, with one of six being active at any one time, with the ability to switch to others mid-battle. This system works well throughout the entire storyline, but can occasionally cause problems when attempting optional late-game content. In some late-game scenarios it would be extremely helpful to have more control over the other two members of your party, and sometimes you might have to retry battles due to computer players making bad decisions. ExtrasAs stated earlier, there is a point late in the game in which you can explore/grind/take on side missions that really shines. This section of the game really feels more like a final fantasy game than the rest, and if you're a fan of the series then this section will definitely scratch your itch for more FF. If you're not a veteran, than this area still holds some value and interest if you're enjoying the RPG aspects of the game and want to go further. While some people might argue that it was frustrating to leave this section until the later parts of the game, I think it was actually a good idea. Players who only want to experience the story can do so and can completely ignore this section of the game. While others who want the ability to ignore the story for a bit and develop their characters and inventory further can do so without the worry of having missed certain items or content earlier in the game. With all the ""missables"" of previous FF games being a frustration to completionists (especially FFXII with the Zodiac Spear nonsense), leaving this content until later works out really well. There are plenty of challenging side-missions and achievements to hunt that will satisfy all but the most hardcore of FF fan.			"

												The Game’s Actual Name: Ah Final Hallway Thirteen. This isn’t a joke, most of the game is on rails, just hallway after hallway, but that’s what makes it a Final Fantasy Game. Grinding out game experience is something RPG and MMO Fans hold dear to their heart in joy or in anguish.  My first time grinding out EXP in a bunch of hallways was Final Fantasy 5 on the SNES.   The Grind: This FF Game is an Item Grind. Less Character EXP, and more emphasis on improving your Weapon and Accessory Slots. You can totally complete the game without a huge investment in grinding, it’s just much harder to complete. Like and grinding game (and achievement wise) it’s going to take upwards of +100 hours to nab all of these if you’re going for 100% completion. Many guides exist to show you grinding locations. Pro Tip: Search FFXIII Adamantoise Farming in Google for starters and get ready for spamming Death with Vanille. (is this considered a Spoiler?)Game Mechanics: For those of you who have played all the previous FF Titles, it is a more chaotic, fast paced, and refined version of FFX-2. Now hear me out before you curse me for mentioning that game… Eventually each character can spec into each role, Commando, Ravager, Medic, Synergist, Sentinel, and Saboteur. Each character is better at one role than another and bring their personal flair into it. In battle you set up Paradigms which are a combination of your role across your 2 or 3 active characters.  You can preset a stock of up to 6 different Paradigms. These can be switched freely in battle at any given time, even mid attack animation.  Each Role has a function it carries out. Character Stats this time around a much more simplified than other Final Fantasy games. You have Strength, Magic, and HP. Strength determines your Physical Damage (Com) and Magic, your Magical Damage (Rav). Weapons & Accessories: Your Weapon then adds some baseline stats to your overall Strength and Magic Values. Weapons also are part of an Item set that confer bonuses to specific actions or other game mechanics. Accessories augment your character by either raising stats, conferring resistance to elemental attacks, increase HP, and a different variety of things. Guides exist to show the item set each piece belongs to, but that is outside the scope of this Review. Stagger Bar: Each enemy has a Stagger bar which ones it hits a certain threshold, the enemy is “broken” and damage to it increases at an accelerated rate. In this state some enemies don’t even attack. Roles: Commandos are direct damage dealers who cause the stagger bar to deplete at a much slower rate. Ravagers are magic and weapon imbued magic damage dealers whose main purpose is increasing the progress of the Stagger Bar.Medics heal and dispel negative effects.Synergists pass out party buff spells like Protect which reduces incoming physical damage.Saboteurs dish out magical debuffs to the enemy like Slow and Poison and act as the magic version of the Commando. Sentinels absorb damage and taunt enemies with Provoke. They are the Tanks and can even Counterattack while Defending.  My 6 Stock of Paradigms are Relentless Assault (Com,Rav,Rav) // Diversity (Com,Rav,Med) // Evened Odds (Sab,Syn,Med) // Smart Bomb (Rav,Rav,Sab) // Solidarity (Com,Sen,Med) // Combat Clinic (Sen,Med,Med) Of course some fights do require to you change up a bit when time is of the essence. Try Tri-Disaster (Rav,Rav,Rav) at 50% stagger bar for Quick Kills.  At the end of the day though, slot in the 6 that fit you best.Final Thoughts: It has a great story in my opinion with over the top cliché voice acting. For its current price of $16.00 USD I’d say it’s a good buy.As Always watch gameplay videos before buying! "

												Opinions on FF XIII are either strongly for or strongly against.I fall under the former category.In short I strongly recommend this game to all fans of jRPGs, those who do not put freedom of exploration before the story and are alright with being steered by the narrative instead of shaping it. The story is only hard to understand if you are unwilling to read the additional information provided in the codex which offers further explanation, but if you spend some additional time reading it, I believe you'll find it quite enjoyable. It is a tale of coming to terms with one's circumstances, challenging onself and then facing a seemingly hopless situation head on and learning the machination behind what might seem a random plot at a glance. Detailed reviewStoryNarrative is placed in a world that is a mixture of sci-fi and fantasy, focused on the struggle of each of the 6 main characters learning to deal with the situation they have been thrown into and their growth into people which will try to change their fate however improbable the odds may be. It is set in a time of unexpected war and starts off by throwing the player into the middle of the things, ensuring the player is as every bit as confused with the entire situation as the protagonists  are. While the story unfolds, it offers some additional insight into the protagonists minds by means of flashbacks mixed with some read-through material in the form of a codex. It is also being told for the majority of the game through the points of view of the specific characters until, quite late in the game, it gets unified into one generic point of view of all the characters joined together in one goal. The initial pace the story unfolds in is slow, however, mixed with a sort of prolonged introduction into the battle system. It picks up the pace after around 7-8 hours into the story.MusicHands down one of my favorite OST ever created for a video game. Love it, is all I am going to say.GameplayI find this game to be beautiful, with detailed settings, interesting character design, but not something you would not expect in a jRPG, and interesting monsters design. All is kept in a clearly defined style which adds to the story as one can see everything is a part of the same universe. Nothing in this game seems out of place.The battle system is sort of turn based with its own twist, but it really takes its time to give the player full control.I agree that the tutorial is way too long for no apparent reason, limiting the player choices to very few options in the early game. The introduction of class switching and the intricacies of this system are explained and then make for some very spectacular and interesting battles, but I do feel it has been weirdly dumbed down in its execution. The complexity of this system and the need to really plan one's tactics comes up in only a couple of battles.The entire game can be beaten quite fast, but in order to complete all of the side quests, all of which involve running somewhere and killing a monster, and get all of the achievements griding for experience becomes necessary and quite tedious. Especially since the sidequests are not really that creative and forcing player into a lot of running through all of the locations only for the sake of prolonging the time the player spends with this game.Thankfully the beauty of the game somewhat makes up for the need to revisit the locations and the amount of running one's does, nonetheless, I could have done without it and would have still loved the game.If you want to obtain all of the achievements you're looking into around 80 to 100 hours, depending on how willing you are to truly understand the mechanics of the battle system to ensure you can beat the most difficult enemies to receive the most experience points.

												XIII doesn't deserve all the bad reputation it received, just some of it.Story and characters are on the bad side in the series and game is pretty much one single linear path until like 15 hours into the game, at which point you can branch off a bit to do stuff. Combat system is new and fresh, but can be absolutely frustrating sometimes and game implements some questionable mechanics (like a lot of normal mobs can 1 shot entire party without sentinel) just to make it work. You also control only 1 character's combat directly, with even less freedom to customize other members' actions compared to XII. Equipment system is IMO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and character progression is a linear path disguised in a convoluted spiral-grid-abomination thingy just to make you think you have choices (you don't).Graphically this game is about what you'd expect from FF port, console quality with some few improvements. All in all the port is quite lazy, everything is just pulled over to PC as is. It's fine though, as most will play this with a controller probably anyway. Fixing the instant esc quitting was a nice thing too.So, after ranting about all the bad and irrelevant sides of the game, why did I give it a thumbs up? It's still an interesting game, world looks great, I liked monster and boss designs, and combat, once you get used to it, can be really fun. XIII also refreshingly hard Final Fantasy unless you grind your♥♥♥♥♥off. Still, it's only barely thumbs up. It's not expensive considering how long game you get for this amount, and it's not all bad either, so you probably should at least give XIII a shot if you like JRPGs.			"

												I'm a final fantasy fans, n I'm great that steam has port the final fantasy 13 to PC as I do not own ps3. I do not want to spend money on the console just for few great titles in ps3. Though the game is already 5 yrs old, it actually is my first time to play this game.Pro: - Graphic is superb, playthrough is like watching MV- different type of battle system (more like an action turn-base style)- The crystarium system, which in my opinion is easier n better than level up system- The fighting is intense and more challenging- Boss fight is unique and I have to shuffle btw classes in order to win the intensive fight- If I am lazy to fight enemies I can actually use items to hide and run past them- MusicCon:- Although jap voice is great, I think Square Enix shl let gamers choose the type of voice that they wanted it- During in-game time, when i shift+tab when my friend was talking to me I will experience super lag in typing and pressing esc numerous time did not help, this problem actually surface after the recent patch- When I in-game for too long, pressing esc did not prompt me to exit the game, instead I have to go to the task manager to close the game			"

												First of all - i was playing at least 70 hours, as people can see the screenshots i took - BUT i was playing while was in offline mode and then came the first patch. steam has overwritten my savegame with a savegame that was uploaded in the cloud and threw me back about 52 hours, back to chapter 4. that sucked.knowing that this was still a poor worked-over port, i used the GeDoSaTo tool from Durante to unsure i had full-hd graphics with more or less 40-60 fps (people have to get to know their PC better before shouting that they have such a high-end setup that doesnt work), the tool works wonderful with the game and makes it a better experience as on the console. without, the game has overall performance difficulties, reason for that is most likely the fixed resolution of 720p at 24Hz (or something like that). therefore the game and the system has unnecessary extra work, that heavily slows down the game.i'm eager for the december 2014 patch for this game to see if SE can bring the game to a performance that is rather standard for most games released today.i will keep my opinion about the story to myself, except that you have to play all 3 FF XIII titles to get the full FF experience, i'll wait for that till i'll played all 3 here on steam (have played all three on the console)as for gameplay - i am fond of it, because it gives the hardcore FF-fan the chance for nice strategic battles and weapon customizations later in the game, while giving new players the platform to play a FF title without getting too deep into the FF mechanics which turns out unforgiving every once and a while.i highly recommend this title to all, who wants to play a FF, but dont want to spend an additional 100+ hours on sidequesting, farming, revealing story-related secrets, etc. BUT i would wait till SquareEnix has patched it properly, otherwise the easy to use GeDoSaTo tool is free for download (and if possible support Durante's great work!)

												I like this game; its got a great battle system and the soundtrack is nearly flawless. I'm only 15 hours into the game but so far the story is pretty captivating.my biggest beef with the game is that its pretty linear, but its no where near as bad as FF4. the graphics are amazing, especially for a game made in 2009! Most of the environments are breathtaking and very well designed.The characters have flaws and traits that are both likable and dislikeable, you'll have favourites and ones that you dont like as much, but overall, pretty well written characters. I got this game for $8 on sale and its was well worth it. if you're on the fence about the game i suggest buying it on sale. I actually prefer this to some of the earlier games like FF4 and FF10. 15 hours in and I'm not bored at all, FF13 starts slow, but if you give it time it really grows on you.I think this game is fun, dont listen to people who whine about the story, they are the reason FF Legends was made.

												Having played this game on Xbox 360, I can say I am happy to own it on PC now as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the game and I don't undertand what is so confusing about the story to people. At this point, I think it is just a fad to call this story confusing. Sure some of the charatcers seem a little flat and aren't lovable, but they grow on you in different ways. Definitely by far, Hope has the most character development and becomes one of my favorites story-wise by the end of the game. Enough about the story though, let's talk about the port. So far (Although I haven't played it much yet) I have not run into a single bug, runs just as smooth as you would expect from a Square Enix game. the 60fps is definitely noticable having played it at a now considerably less smooth 30fps on console. The anti-aliasing is also a great touch going all the way up to 16x to wipe away the jaggies that 7th gen console games are known for. Having not actually changed the textures of the game (which still look fine for 2014), don't worry about raising the settings and experiencing lag because as long as you meet the recommended, pump up that AA. The shadows resolution goes all the way up to 8k creating crisp player shadows suring fights and walking around. And last but not least, being able to run this game natively 1080p is a dream come true. Given the astonishing beauty of this game even on console, a 1080p version of it makes it all the better and really turns this game into a piece of art. Now as for cons, just wish that they would have tweaked the gameplay just a bit like the camera control which is still god-awful. All it wants to do is reset back to center. Might as well have a fixed camera. I would have liked better camera control to admire the beautiful scenery this game has to offer. Also speeding up the gameplay such as making paradigm shifts smoother like in XIII-2 would have been nice. Instead you have the long drawn-out shifts. Also I would have liked to see them up the amount of Gil you get from treasure chests or maybe throw in Gil when you win a battle. Gil shortage was a huge problem in the console version and required endless hours of Trapezohedron and Plat ingot hunting to get enough to get everyone's final weapons. On console, I put about 120 hrs into a single playthrough of this game and probably more than 20 of it was grinding for money... This game was obviously a copy and paste port, but at the price point, can't blame them.Given there are no bugs so far and the game looks better and plays just as well as on console, I give the port a 9/10 and the game a 8/10. For a final fantasy game story wise, 7.5/10.

The visual syle is very much Final Fantasy3. Soundtrack is beautiful to listen to4. Character development and interaction5. Stunning set pieces6. Combat animations. The way the characters fight in battle is how I imagined FF should be in my head while I was growing up.8. Ability to upgrade every weapon and accessory in the game7. Sazh. Most interesting character and extremely useful in battleCons1. ......VANILLE2. Mostly linear (But I don't hear people complaining about FFX's linearity?!!!! Cut this game some slack)3. 50GB download (C'mon, guys. Really?)4. Crystarium is limited by story progressionReally the main thing I loathe about this game are the English voices for Vanille (that's the woman's real voice, btw. Some kind of Australian/British/American thing she has going on. Absolutely horrendous), Snow (Even though he is a good voice actor I don't like how he portrayed this character), and Hope. Just......look, no one cares, Hope. Shutup.I am enjoying my second playthrough and picking up on things that I missed the first time around.I had forgot about Sazh's son, Dajh, being a Cocoon l'cie while Sazh is a Pule l'cie.

												I bought this game because I saw on the store page that Japanese language is supported. What I get is a region locked version that only got non-asian languages. This region lock is totally rediculous. I mean come on SE what's the point in dividing it into asian version and RoW(rest of world) vesion. People in asia are demanding English audio and people in RoW are demanding Japanese audio. If you can double the size of the game for RoW players why not also unlock the Japanese text that is already in the files. It's not like that RoW banned everyone from playing Japanese game so do the right thing SE, merge the two version and make it ONE Final Fantasy. And also don't forget to do a better port on XIII-2.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It only allows you to play 720p. This is NOT a PC game. It is great to play this game at my eyefinity resolution (NB sarcasm here) and it only allows me to play at 720p which takes up 1/9th of the total screen area... Unplayable until Square fixes this and all the other issues. Plenty of other problems people are talking about like controllers not working properly. It looks like square did a lazy port over without actually doing any work or worse giving us a worse copy then the PS3 version (cutscenes of worse quality). Their excuse that they didn't release it on PC because of piracy, well this game on the PC version at time of release isn't even worth pirating.Disclosure: I purchased a pre-order so I had no idea that this was going to happen.edit: For those who say this is a whinge. This is what it looks like on my screen.

			Great. This is what FFXIII PC version gives you when trying to play with PC resolution of 4320x2560 resolution. It doesn't even let us play fullscreen!		


. You tell me if A6 sized gameplay is acceptable to anyone. And ask yourself why every other PC game works. I have over 246 games on steam and most of them work and without these problems.update: they have fixed the graphics options finally. Will update this review once I play through to check if everything runs smoothly.			"

												I'm playing the Asian version of the game (with Jap audio) and it's only 29 GB of download. I feared much after hearing the gigantic size of the Western vesrion, although there's no option for me to change the dub language.The game seems magnificent even with only 720p resolution (probably my rig's a factor too) and plays smoothly. I'm not a good game critic, but I'm a fan of the series and I think this one's a good port.			"

It may not be the best Final Fantasy out there in terms of gameplay, but the story and music are definitely worthy of their title.			"

												Okay, first of all all I did not like that the game came with such a poor resolution by defualt, but after installing a third party tool, this game shined once again for me. The graphics turn amazing and I was again surprised as I was when this game came out and played it on PS3. This game in much more linear than most of other FF in the game series and the first installment n the series of FF XIII has a slow start, but later on the game becomes really fun. I totally support this game, specially if this mean square enix will bring other RPGs to PC. I have read so many complains about the graphics or the escape issue but really, is nothing that big. As a PC gamer I hardly press escape by mistake. This game is not perfect by far, but supporting it will show the industry it should release this games on PC too.  I will definitely recommend it to any RPG fan and I cannot wait to get the other 2 parts of the series. If SE bring FF XII to PC it will blow my mind!! EDIT: After playing the game a lot and been grinding in chapter 11 like crazy, I can say the game is as good as I remembered. I know it wont beat classics from SE but having on PC, the game looks amazing. The audio is spectacular, I have a 7.1 system, which I used on my PS3 as well and I do not remember the audio sound this clear. The sorround effects are great. I really recommend this game. I just hope we could get ports of the new HD version of FF-X/X-2.  But if SE realice how much more they can sell on Steam, I know they will make them available.			"

												The game itself is not bad. I played it on PS3 way back when. However, this game has so many problems on pc! This game only uses one core of your cpu making the framerate drop seemingly out of nowhere. It runs at 720p natively and you can't change it. It has no graphics options to speak of. It has no audio options to speak of. And on top of all that, if you just so happen to have an amd cpu the game sill be locked at 30 fps. To everyone thinking about buying this: DON'T! At least not until they patch it. If you really want the game but don't want to deal with any of this there is a petition to get Square to fix the game.Go here and sign the petition: http://www.change.org/p/final-fantasy-13-pc-version-1920x1080-and-graphic-options-give-the-pc-version-of-final-fantasy-13-the-ability-to-change-graphical-settingsPS: The reason why the game is a 50 gig download is because they automatically include the japanese audio. You don't even have a choice to download it!PPS: There is no real way to quit the game in ANY menu. You literally have to hit escape and the game instantly stops. No "" Are you sure you want to quit?"" It just ends! "

												'Warning, this person is a ff-fanboy for more than 13 years.'First of all after FF XII disaster, this game is like a savior to the FF-Universe. Some people might dislike it,  cause it starts as a linear play-style like FF X but I would say , there is nothing bad about it. Story might look complicate it to you with weird words and stuff that happens in the game, but with flashbacks and in-game dialogs between protagonists you'll likely begin to understand whats happening and like the scenario.Combat is different, different then what I've seen before. Characters have different roles which you can swap during combat to heal, make your enemies vulnerable or to create tactics which suits you best. Character development is quite same as FF X, in which you use points that you gained combat to increase their base stats and make them learn new spells and techniques. While the stories moves on , you meet with your Espers, like Shiva and Odin but the with the name of Eidolon, which you can use in-combat also. I don't know why, but they can turn into motorbikes and horses and stuff , I don't know why, but hey it's Final Fantasy Right?! And, even if it's a port from PS3, I am playing and also recording the game with 60 fps. Splendid work from Square-Enix.What I don't like about the game, is mostly the male main characters and first chapter areas of the game. I don't like Sazh, Snow and dark & wasteland areas, which you encounter a lot during first 6 chapters. On the other hand, female characters are awesome, which I can say, is the best in all of FF series. ( even better than Tifa or Terra in my opinion ) They are tough, cold but strong and have their own dark/painfull past which makes them more interesting and wealthy.With it's price, I asure you, you wont regret playing this game , but beware, 40gb's are gonna be downloaded first.10/10 will play again and make Lightning mai waifu. Sorry Fang..			"

												This game is a bit different than the other FF games, by different I mean the gameplay... I played it on ps3 and bought it in steam and have to say, that nothing changed, ps3 version = pc version. So if you have it on ps3 and expect changes like 1080p options, you wont have them. It's a linear game, but that's nothing bad! In linear games you can follow the storyline better... And the most say, the game is linear, because they didn't play it til the end. If you arrive in Grand Pulse, I really began to enjoy the game, a big place with hard missions and Trials, but before doing the hard missions, you should end the storyline =DI played all Final fantasy above VII and I have to say, that XIII has the best battle themes, imo! :P  "

												Unfortunately, this game stuttered literally every second, making it very unenjoyable and almost unplayable. I believe the issue was caused by the game constantly searching for a controller, and being unable to find one. If you do not own a controller, you may experience this issue with the game so be wary. Needless to say, I had to refund this game. I'm just glad I bought it while it was on sale.			"

												After many breaks I've finally managed to finish this game.Beginning of this review may not sound too encouragingly, nonetheless I'm still going to recommend this game to every fan of intresting, addicting stories.Unfortunately, somewhere in the middle of a game combat get's pretty boring and predictable, what caused me to put it off for some time. Although, as soon as you get hooked into story (and in my opinion well developed charcacters), you'll play it even just to know what happens next.Luckily you can change the difficulty to easy, which will fasten your adventure.As in every FF game the soundtrack is outstanding and the graphics still suprise in some aspects.I'd recommend you to just take out your controller, lay comfortably on a bad/chair and enjoy the game, cuz that's what it's made for.Summarizing,The game is pretty mediocre,but the stroy is definitelly enjoyable!

												I liked the overall game. The graphics were nice and gameplay wasn't that complicated. This game took me a lot longer to finish than I had originally anticipated. It took me about 73ish hours to finish this game which I did not enjoy. Frankly it was too long for me. I don't understand why people would describe this game as ""linear."" When I played it, it did not feel very linear. They're a lot of side quests, lots of stuff you can find if you want, and lots of challenges that you can face if you want and of course there was a lot of grinding. I even got lost a few times wondering ""ok, what am I suppose to be doing now?"" The crysterium system (or however it's spelled) was probably one of the most infurating things I've encountered. I would constantly grind to max it out only to find out a few scenes later it would grow even bigger. I've had many moments while playing this game where I've said to myself ""ok this has got to be the end or I'm really close to finishing this game"" and I was way off. Let me give you a tip, when you're leveling the crysterium don't put any points in any other roles except the default ones given to the characters from the very begining. Save your points so once you reach level 5 (which is after you finish the game) and max out their main roles then you can start grinding for points in the other roles which aren't really neccessary and you'll probably won't use for some steam achievement or something. Oh and if you stuck on a mission that seems impossible, chances are it is. There are acouple of missions that are almost impossible to beat until after you finish the game so don't think it's because you didn't max the other not main roles, the game was simply made that way. I also found out while playing the game that the upgrading system is useless. You can finish this game without leveling your equipment at all. Save everything until after you finish the game then you can upgrade your equipment and try to unlock all of the things for a steam achievement or something. One last thing, this game is very buggy. It microstudders for me unless I use a 360 controller (or just a game controller) which is weird. This game is really poorly optimized for the PC. The FPS drops many times throughout the game. Even with the buggy FPS I still played this game and found some enjoyment out of it but it sucks that this game is optimized so poorly on the PC. I'm not going to recommend this game but I'm also not -not going to recommend this game, I leave that up to you. Since steam doesn't have a button other than yes or no I'll put a yes on it.			"

												The Story and Cinematics are awesome as always, however I was kinda dissapointed in the gameplay. If you expect a similar gameplay as in FF XII then you gonna get dissapointed. The Gambit system doesnt exist and the only thing you do is changing between predefined fighting stances (fighter, tank, mage, buffer, debuffer, healer) and press ""Auto"" to wait for your chars to end the battle. You also run in a straight line (which was probably said a billion times before) so the open world feeling as in FF XII is also non-existant.I won't tell anyone not to buy the game, because in the end the story was what kept me playing and you might love it as well.

												First of all - i was playing at least 70 hours, as people can see the screenshots i took - BUT i was playing while was in offline mode and then came the first patch. steam has overwritten my savegame with a savegame that was uploaded in the cloud and threw me back about 52 hours, back to chapter 4. that sucked.knowing that this was still a poor worked-over port, i used the GeDoSaTo tool from Durante to unsure i had full-hd graphics with more or less 40-60 fps (people have to get to know their PC better before shouting that they have such a high-end setup that doesnt work), the tool works wonderful with the game and makes it a better experience as on the console. without, the game has overall performance difficulties, reason for that is most likely the fixed resolution of 720p at 24Hz (or something like that). therefore the game and the system has unnecessary extra work, that heavily slows down the game.i'm eager for the december 2014 patch for this game to see if SE can bring the game to a performance that is rather standard for most games released today.i will keep my opinion about the story to myself, except that you have to play all 3 FF XIII titles to get the full FF experience, i'll wait for that till i'll played all 3 here on steam (have played all three on the console)as for gameplay - i am fond of it, because it gives the hardcore FF-fan the chance for nice strategic battles and weapon customizations later in the game, while giving new players the platform to play a FF title without getting too deep into the FF mechanics which turns out unforgiving every once and a while.i highly recommend this title to all, who wants to play a FF, but dont want to spend an additional 100+ hours on sidequesting, farming, revealing story-related secrets, etc. BUT i would wait till SquareEnix has patched it properly, otherwise the easy to use GeDoSaTo tool is free for download (and if possible support Durante's great work!)

FF XIII is not a ""traditional"" Final Fantasy game in the sense that it places the story front and center for the vast majority of the game. This is different than other FF games in that the battle systems, mini-games, character abilities, and exploration are primarily hands-off affairs for the first 15+ hours. Once that period is over, there is a rich game to explore and delve into, but it takes time and not everyone will be up for the investment it takes to get there.Here's the breakdown section by section:StoryThe majority of the story in FF XIII happens between the characters that you control and the group of seemingly antagonistic entities known as Fal'Cie. There is quite a bit that happens that would take far too long to detail, but know that this is a pretty story-rich game with decent character development and a satisfying story arc for each character. That said, there isn't a lot of explanation of the backstory for the world, the Fal'Cie, and environments that happens in-game, which leaves the player with questions. There is much, much more information that can be gained by reading the datalogs in the menu, but it can be quite tedious and it's a shame that there wasn't more of this information put in the actual game. Clearly this game asks for a large amount of time from the player, would it have been that much more onerous to explain the inner-workings of the game's world to the user without resorting to datalogs?BattlesThe battle system for a FF game is a good one. Similar to FF XII you are only in control of one of your three party members at a time, with the computer taking over for the other two. You can assign ""paradigms"" to your party, with one of six being active at any one time, with the ability to switch to others mid-battle. This system works well throughout the entire storyline, but can occasionally cause problems when attempting optional late-game content. In some late-game scenarios it would be extremely helpful to have more control over the other two members of your party, and sometimes you might have to retry battles due to computer players making bad decisions. ExtrasAs stated earlier, there is a point late in the game in which you can explore/grind/take on side missions that really shines. This section of the game really feels more like a final fantasy game than the rest, and if you're a fan of the series then this section will definitely scratch your itch for more FF. If you're not a veteran, than this area still holds some value and interest if you're enjoying the RPG aspects of the game and want to go further. While some people might argue that it was frustrating to leave this section until the later parts of the game, I think it was actually a good idea. Players who only want to experience the story can do so and can completely ignore this section of the game. While others who want the ability to ignore the story for a bit and develop their characters and inventory further can do so without the worry of having missed certain items or content earlier in the game. With all the ""missables"" of previous FF games being a frustration to completionists (especially FFXII with the Zodiac Spear nonsense), leaving this content until later works out really well. There are plenty of challenging side-missions and achievements to hunt that will satisfy all but the most hardcore of FF fan.			"

It looks like square did a lazy port over without actually doing any work or worse giving us a worse copy then the PS3 version (cutscenes of worse quality). Their excuse that they didn't release it on PC because of piracy, well this game on the PC version at time of release isn't even worth pirating.Disclosure: I purchased a pre-order so I had no idea that this was going to happen.edit: For those who say this is a whinge.

			Great. This is what FFXIII PC version gives you when trying to play with PC resolution of 4320x2560 resolution. It doesn't even let us play fullscreen!		


. You tell me if A6 sized gameplay is acceptable to anyone. And ask yourself why every other PC game works. I have over 246 games on steam and most of them work and without these problems.update: they have fixed the graphics options finally. Will update this review once I play through to check if everything runs smoothly.			"

												I'm playing the Asian version of the game (with Jap audio) and it's only 29 GB of download. I feared much after hearing the gigantic size of the Western vesrion, although there's no option for me to change the dub language.The game seems magnificent even with only 720p resolution (probably my rig's a factor too) and plays smoothly. I'm not a good game critic, but I'm a fan of the series and I think this one's a good port.			"

												The game runs fine, it might be capped at 720p but it still looks beautiful, and a modder is already working on a fix.I always wanted to play the game because I switched to PC from a PS2 ages ago and I couldn't believe this game would come to PC, I'm really happy Square is bringing RPG's to PC, hopefully other developers will do the same in the future.Im pretty sure Square will update the game later with 1080p and some minor fixes, so for 15u$d this game is awesome, but hey, it's my opinion. If you have a TV or monitor higher than 24 inches, staying at some distance from it will make the quality seem 1080p, so don't worry.Thanks Square Enix!			"

												I'm sorry... but does pressing esc close the entire game?I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE THE ORIGINAL DEUS EX, ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY UNLEARN 12 YEARS OF PC GAMING!It doesn't even give you a warning its just like (Fart noise) and DIES to the desktop!!!Yes I'm posting this with just half an hour of gametime logged but I can't recommend a game if the esc button doesn't even work as it should. Hopefully this gets patched soon so I can recommend it but not until this is fixed.This is a BLATANT bad design choice by Square Enix; a company who has disrespected pc gamers and have put little to no effort into their ports for years.I don't belive that we should be holding back critcism for issues that could have been solved by a 10 minute QA session. If they don't care about their games why should I care?I'm not even bothered by the UI problems and the fact that the game dipped under 40 FPS when I run TWO GTX 780 TI's in SLI or the fact that you can't change control schemes or Reolutions without messing with the CFG/.INI Files OR the 58 GB DOWNLOAD!! 58 GB!?! That is absurd!Remember all these issues are withing 30 minutes of booting the game.Heres hoping they put effort into optimizing and supporting FinalFantasy XV for the PC platform when it drops sometime 2016.

It's different than most of the games I play and I enjoy the change of pace. (and the countless deaths)The story is good - but confusing.Generally: enjoy it - but not as much as I used to.			"

												I bought this game because I saw on the store page that Japanese language is supported. What I get is a region locked version that only got non-asian languages. This region lock is totally rediculous. I mean come on SE what's the point in dividing it into asian version and RoW(rest of world) vesion. People in asia are demanding English audio and people in RoW are demanding Japanese audio. If you can double the size of the game for RoW players why not also unlock the Japanese text that is already in the files. It's not like that RoW banned everyone from playing Japanese game so do the right thing SE, merge the two version and make it ONE Final Fantasy. And also don't forget to do a better port on XIII-2.

												Final Fantasy XIII is not a good Final Fantasy, but it's a really fun and gorgeous JRPG.The story follows two different worlds: Pulse and Cacoon, each so afraid of the others that even contact with someone from the other planet will cause friends and family to turn against each other in order to rid themselves of those affected. Ruled by benevloent creatures called fal'Cie, players follow a commando, Lightning, and the people she meets as they are touched and turned into l'Cie, or touched warriors, by a Pulse fal'Cie that had hidden on Cacoon for ages.The combat system features some FF staples such as Phoenix Downs, summons, and certain magics, but instead of picking abilities individually, most players will likely be auto-attacking. Instead, the challenge comes from its Role system, or Paradigms. Paradigms are customized for each party, and rather than selecting attacks, players will be juggling roles among their characters fairly heavily. The result is a little different from other FFs, but it's fast-paced, pretty fun, and can get fairly difficult if role combinations don't pit well against tougher fights. Characters can then be leveled up by putting points into their various roles.Perhaps the biggest criticism with the game comes from the exploration, as this is where XIII splits from previous titles. Instead of an open world environment, players are set along linear paths with little room to move about. There are no World Maps, airships to control, or forests filled with random battles to get lost in. It feels nothing like Final Fantasies in that that regard.However, franchise name aside, the maps tend to work. Most jRPGs are simply ""Go From Point A to Point B"" to begin with, even with World Maps. The tunnels make it easier to play in shorter bursts for people with busy lives, and they keep players from forgetting where to go if they put the game down for a few weeks. The game does open up significantly in Chapter 11, but for the most part the game trims the fat and focuses on the fights and getting through the story.It helps that the environments and character models are gorgeous. With the PC fixes/patches, everything is beautifully rendered with smooth models and bright color palette. The characters themselves are highly engaging (though some take longer to warm up to than others), and there's a great deal of cuteness scattered throughout. Even with the hallway maps, there is a great deal of content, and players can expect to spend 60+ hours easily to finish.I highly recommend this game if players can put the ""Final Fantasy"" name aside. There are certainly some great traditional FF elements here - big swords, Cid, a Moogleworks shop - but it doesn't feel like the classic games. That's perfectly ok. It's well worth the price when taken to be its own jRPG.			"

												I never was able to complete this on the PS3 so having it on a laptop while I travel was great.  The graphics on PC are amazingly hires on a 4k monitor which allowed for some truly amazing cut-scenes.   The story line is well written and the game fighting mechanics are very well done.  I'll admit that there is a lot of extra tedious side nonsense that you can get sucked into such as filling up your crystarium 100% and upgrading weapons which forces you to grind a bit.  Overall though the game is still winnable without having to grind too much.  I think that SE found a good balance between grind and play on this specific release.			"

												As much as I wanted to like this game, the best I could do was tolerate it. Even with a modicum of interest in seeing the storyline unfold, it was hard going being dragged through one wearisome corridor of battles after another for the sake of just a moment or two of exposition; then another gruelling corridor. The new combat system doesn't involve you enough to keep it interesting. I appreciate what they were trying to achieve, but it's a system that leaves you feeling like a passenger, idly mashing the auto attack button, rather than a participent in the fight. It's not so bad a game as others would suggest, but it is difficult to recommend, even for a fan of the series.			"

I can't comment on the story because I uninstalled after about an hour. FFX had a similarly confusing beginning, but the story was far more gripping and the world more immersive. FF!2 had a far better semi real time combat system.The graphics were fine. Impressive, even, considering the time this game was made. But not enough.The only way I can imagine you'll like it is if you haven't played a better FF game. Huge disappointment. Thank god I didn't buy a PS3 to play this.			"

												After playin for 66 hours, around 200 screenshots and 16achievements i managed to play through this gameFirst of all: Final Fantasy XIII-1 is getting a lot of bad reviews, because its a ""corridor simulator"". While this is not exactly wrong, it isnt in Chapter 11, and this chapter offers quite alot to do. Two supperbosses, 64 missions, and lots of awesome areas to see. The story can be a bit confusing at some points, but is simply amazing, especially the end. I also see people complaining ""720p? 0/10 trash"". Thats crap. This game looks AMAZING. I can easily say its one of the most beautiful games i played so far. even above modded Skyrim. Its running smoothly on an AMD Anthlon II X2 250 3Ghz Processor with a, a NVIDIA GeForce 660 GTX and 8 Gb Ram. The only tanking FPS where at one of the final bossfights. But that really was kinda to much stuff happening. This game also comes with an amazing soundtrack.Graphics: 10/10Sound: 10/10Story: 10/10Characters: 9/10  (Some of them just are annoying at the start, the childish Snow, and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hope for example. It gets better later)All in all, i would rate this 10/10			"

												This is, by far, the best Final Fantasy in the franchise; if not, it is certainly the most modern of them.Every time I sit down and play Final Fantasy XIII again, I find it to be even more thrilling than I remembered.  It's hard to get all the negative reviews and fanboy hatred for this title out of your head when you look at the game; until you play it.  Then the stunningly detailed visuals, the most coherent story in any FF game to date, and the deep many-layered characters pull you into an immersive world; two worlds, to be exact.  Alright, that's the short and sweet bit up top; that's the synopsis.  Below will be a page-long point-by-point rebuttal of the common view of this game; so that you folks who are trying to gauge if you want to spend your hard-earned money on this can get both sides of the story.So, to begin; all the criticism and hatred a lot of people have for this game is, in my mind, just them being nostsalgic and whining (fanboy syndrome).   What people hate about this game, I love.  What they say breaks the game, I say is the innovation that Square promised would revolutionize the JRPG genre.  Let's start this list!1) Linearity:  This is the number one complaint you hear about Final Fantasy XIII, ""It is too linear.""  Compared to what?  Fallout and Elder Scrolls?  It is, in my humble opinion, exactly as linear as any traditional JRPG usually is.  It's just waaaay more in-your-face about it.  The story AND the paths are one-directional.  Spoiler: You're on the run from folks.   The story is driven as though it were a tightly bound book.  Each page you turn is filled with exactly what you want and need to continue through that leg of the story; not with a bunch of ancillary baggage and side-quests that make the real story feel like some fading memory.2) Story:  This is the second complaint I tend to hear; people say that either the game is too story-driven, or that it didn't even attempt to have a coherent story.   This section will contain mild spoilers.  I will use broad generalizations, no names, just themes spoken of in broadstrokes:You start off in the middle of a holocaust (big props, Square); you're being sent to die for fear of contamination from an alien, hostile world.  You escape your bonds, you help stop the holocaust, odds are stacked against you, you run through hugely cinematic warzones, better than anything Square has ever done before.  Compelling from minute one.   The story then unfolds that there are two worlds, and they are at war with one another.  Your world (Cocoon), is made to seem like the haven of all humanity and the perfect paradise, but you learn it is darker than you thought.  There are these magical inter-dimensional type demi-gods (Cocoon Fal'Cie), they built your world, and they fight against the world below (Pulse) and its demi-gods (Pulse Fal'Cie).Compare this to my favorite Final Fantasy, FFVIII, and tell me that the story is less coherent.  FFVIII's story sports some child soldiers brainwashed in a floating terrorist/mercenary training facility in the sky!  They all grew up as kids in an orphanage, but not one of them remembers this because of mental heatlh damage resulting from military hardware they're required to use as...child soldiers.   You race through many nations and warzones to find that powerful Sorceresses control the face of world politics.  Then you find, in fact, it has always been one Sorceress, who can bend time and possess people.  Then she, in fact, kompresses all time-space into a kind of purpl'ish goo that you have to navigate through to reach the end-game.  Honestly, and I love FFVIII, but that story is ridiculous.  It would be hard-pressed to survive in novel form.  FFXIII, however, could easily make a novel.3) Voice Acting/Character Design:  People appear to hate Vanille, Snow, Hope, Lightning, and maybe Sazh and Fang too. Vanille is an upbeat young woman that sounds a bit 'slow' at first, yes, but I think they invented a fictitious accent (Pulsian) for her to use; which startles us Earthicans at first.  Snow is the archetypical hero; this isn't new.  Every Square game has a Snow.  Remember Zell?  Snow is way less annoying than Zell.  Imagine if Zell were voice-acted.  Now imagine Zell said the things Zell said in FFVIII, in a wheezy, energetic, high-pitched voice. I'd have let Zell die repeatedly.  Snow has a good voice-actor, it's just his lines are sometimes cheesy.  He's a self-proclaimed hero that's crushed by the guilt of his own failures.  Of course he's blustering.   Lightning, they claim, is one-dimensional.  People who say this didn't play the game, or don't understand the idea of character development.  She starts cold, she learns to trust.  The characters are well thought-out, look beautiful, and have remarkably well done, grade-A professional voice-acting.  For those that disagree, go back and play FFX and listen to Titus' grainy whining voice (that sounds like he's narrating from in a bathroom), then tell me FFXIII did a worse job.   People complain that Lightning is a trophy female protagonist with no personality.  She's essentially a better, female Squall, in my opinion.  They both can't trust, they both have deep pains from personal loss and people they failed to protect.  They're both strong and silent.  They both use gunblades; but Lightning's is ten times as awesome; exactly like Squall, but ten times as awesome.  That about sums her up.4) Music:  The best, period.  8 and 16-bit scores do not compare to this symphonic magnificence.  The music fits the setting, the mood, and it flows.  The battle theme is light years beyond anything Square has EVER done.  Thank god I don't need to listen to jarring synthesizer techno while I save the world anymore.  Square has always excelled at making original, moving soundtracks; this is by far their best.5) Visuals: Like a slice of an LSD-induced dream that was rendered into a game by Pixar.6) Terminology:  So, I've read reviews of people ragging on this game for all it's jargon, ""What's a Gran Pulse? A Fal'what? Gestalt? Is that a german seasoning?""  There's like, seriously, ten words or something you will need to learn.   Gran Pulse and Cocoon are worlds, the only two worlds in the game, so it's not like they're a galactic compendium of planets you have to remember.  Fal'Cie are the demi-gods, a human bound by a Fal'Cie's magic to serve them is called a l'Cie, a human that fails to complete his focus given to him by the Fal'Cie becomes a C'ieth (like a zombie).  That's about it, really.  The rest is just come-and-go.  Gestalt is just a meter you fill when you beat up the summons you're trying to acquire.  It's really a trite complaint.  Every RPG has it's own jargon, let alone FF games.  GF's, materia, mako energies, Ivalice, Shinra, etc.  FF is renowned for it's own jargon.  Jargon, in this context, just means unique story concepts.  Unique story concepts generally mean more attention to detail, more depth of story, and more immersion in the end.7) The Battle System:  People either hate it or they love it.  I think it's, by far, the best battle system in any FF game other than XII.  The people that complain it's too simple are playing on easy mode.

												I said I would repost after playing the game. I can't comment on the patches because my system (stats follow) handled the game beautifully. The only times I missed 1080p (versus the 720p fullscreen) on a decent 42' screen was when I missed antialiasing/anistropic filtering settings. Basically if you pay too much attention to other characters on the map, you may see edges that aren't exactly smooth.MY RATING: That said, I give this game 9/10, considering it's an FF jRPG classic and the graphics are amazing and the port is really good.DISMISSAL OF GRAPHICS WHINERS WITHOUT APPROPRIATE HARDWARE: As I said before, I'm a software developer, and, using my knowledge of code and now experience with the game, I don't think the character models, textures, etc. need any updating to 1080p. Instead, let folks add AA and such, if they can't already get that through their graphics driver. It would ruin the original graphics, imho! I heard someone complain that the computer got the lesser quality cutscenes, but 50GB is enough for a game, imho, and, again, this is the definitive modern jRPG non-MMO graphically and otherwise as far as I'm concerned.SUMMARY: So, that done, on to the summary of the game: be prepared to not understand the story or how combat works completely for 4-8 hours, depending on the speed you play jRPGs. But this game delivers in length- not quite as long as I'd wish in a perfect world, but, being completionist, it took me at least 120hrs to get through. You can handle that, as the crazy FF fan who can't choose between FF, FFIII, FFIV, and FFVI for the best FF, right? FFVII was great, no question, but not in the running... kind of like FFX.STORY: actually not bad, after you understand what le'cie are... the voice acting is very good, including the annoying teenage female character who later develops. The story draws various types of relationships between the characters, drawing you into the necessity of the quest. Altogether, it's somewhat contrived, but, hey, go retrieve four crystals and no further explanation!GAME MECHANICS: The most annoying thing is the lack of a world-map like most final fantasy series games... a lot of the fun/sense of accomplishment of other FFs is when you gain a vehicle that allows you to visit those ""secret"" places you couldn't go to before. So, I think this is where the ""linear"" criticism comes from. You will see a multi-level large world environment. And there is an elementary ""side-quest"" system, and you can still go through areas again and again (it sometimes gets old, but seldom, since the wonderful music and varied environments keep you in it) to chase after the ultimate badassdom.The class system/grouped-combat feels confining for about 4-8 hours until you realize the variety of skills each character specializes in and that the system makes ""formation"" of front/back seem like ""Goodnight, Moon."" Though I love that book. You can play the combat in so many ways- I recommend ignoring the timer-based results of combat... just try all sorts of techniques out... you can speed-kill later.COMBAT: There are people who hate the fact that a jRPG is not Truly turn-based, and vice-versa. I like both, especially that correct blend that gives me time to decide strategy and ""units of time"" to work with, while reasonably limiting the decision as to sometimes influence my decisions. Hence, the ""auto-battle"" technique you're familiar with so far. Guess what? ""Auto-battle"" is surprisingly often what you want to do - healing) auto-heal will pick the person who needs healz the most tank) well, depends how you like to tank, but it spams some sort of guard skill, which you'd usually do anyway. Taunting skills are used too much, but you can always stop the queue after you successfully taunt, giving the skill added value since it auto-picks non-taunted targets.The bosses are challenging to a mid-aged gamer who played each FF. Most teach you to use new game-mechanics, and there are definite tough-fights if you go seeking them. And the bosses are like ""wait, whoa- look twice.""Anyway, the combat system has true depth, give it some time, and once you have some good commands, you're only badass if you set the default command to ""abilities"" instead of ""auto-battle.""END: In the end, FFXIII really delivers what you'd expect of Square *coughSOFT* Enix. The port is pretty well done considering some annoying FF ports in the past, that felt half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FFXIII is ftw once you realize that it's a post-MMO jRPG that chose a lot of the good parts of an MMO without being online. But don't think it's dumbed-down, because it has worthy challenges. This is truly the definitive jRPG of the post-MMO world, with all the bells and whistles you'd expect, imho. Not that I don't log in to FFXIV now and again ;)			"

												I had no technical problems with this game it runs fine.  The combat and mechanics are fine if a bit over top cartoony.I wanted to like this game and played all the way through but in the end I have to just describe it as bad.  The problem is, if you are going to have a linear story based game then the story needs to make sense and be interesting.  The plot in this game is literally the main characters wandering around never knowining what to do next.  After having no clue what is happening the whole time, the evil bosses then give cliched speeches telling the heroes what to do next.  It is truely awful.This isnt just bad translation or acting.  The characters actually endlessly discuss that they never know what to do next.  That is the plot.   Square literally has no idea how to write a plot and dialogue that makes any sense for them to follow.  This is really to bad because alot of other things about the game are great.  The characters themselves are fairly interesting and the English voice acting is actually top notch making me want to like the characters.  The actual plot and sequence of events is just eyerolling and unforgivable.If anyone is totally new to the Final Fantasy games, get Final Fantasy 10 in the bargain bin instead of this one.  It is better in just about every way imaginable with a story that actually makes some sense.  It is the difference between ""This is our story..."" and what story?			"

												The Bad : Very linear gameplay,  a lot of grinding, is not an open RPG, battle system has potential, inventory system kinda suck, too much Data log to read to dig informations about the worlds, boss fights are not very memorable not that hard either, the whole upgrade system is basically google everything.The Good: pretty cutscenes, some summons are cool, music is good, characters have their moments near the mid-end game, Chocobo, environment is pretty to look at, run very smoothly!I wanted to like this game but is OK at best. Only recemmend if u have completed all the other FF game and have free time and money to do so.			"

The game has amazing graphics and great music. The sotry so far is a bit confusing but I hope that gets better later on. I also like the battle system quite a bit. Overall I recommend this game!

												This game is very beautiful. The graphics are amazing and the characters are good. They are have a reason to do what they are doing for the story and it's fantastic. The gameplay is fun. You only control one character during battles and there is an option to ""Auto"" battle but i never use that because what is the point of that. People say this game is boring because of that option, but if you don't use it the game is much better. Everyone complains about the linearity of the game and I knew about it but I didn't know exactly what they meant, so here is what they mean by linear. In most other FF games you can freely go to towns or villages that you have previously been to but this games is just forward all the time. There are no towns, no safe areas, no shops, or anything like that. Just the characters running pretty much down a hallway. The only ""stops"" are save points along the path that also serves as a shop. All in all, it's a decent game, if you don't mind the linearity of it then i think you will love this game just as i do.			"

												This is, by far, the best Final Fantasy in the franchise; if not, it is certainly the most modern of them.Every time I sit down and play Final Fantasy XIII again, I find it to be even more thrilling than I remembered.  It's hard to get all the negative reviews and fanboy hatred for this title out of your head when you look at the game; until you play it.  Then the stunningly detailed visuals, the most coherent story in any FF game to date, and the deep many-layered characters pull you into an immersive world; two worlds, to be exact.  Alright, that's the short and sweet bit up top; that's the synopsis.  Below will be a page-long point-by-point rebuttal of the common view of this game; so that you folks who are trying to gauge if you want to spend your hard-earned money on this can get both sides of the story.So, to begin; all the criticism and hatred a lot of people have for this game is, in my mind, just them being nostsalgic and whining (fanboy syndrome).   What people hate about this game, I love.  What they say breaks the game, I say is the innovation that Square promised would revolutionize the JRPG genre.  Let's start this list!1) Linearity:  This is the number one complaint you hear about Final Fantasy XIII, ""It is too linear.""  Compared to what?  Fallout and Elder Scrolls?  It is, in my humble opinion, exactly as linear as any traditional JRPG usually is.  It's just waaaay more in-your-face about it.  The story AND the paths are one-directional.  Spoiler: You're on the run from folks.   The story is driven as though it were a tightly bound book.  Each page you turn is filled with exactly what you want and need to continue through that leg of the story; not with a bunch of ancillary baggage and side-quests that make the real story feel like some fading memory.2) Story:  This is the second complaint I tend to hear; people say that either the game is too story-driven, or that it didn't even attempt to have a coherent story.   This section will contain mild spoilers.  I will use broad generalizations, no names, just themes spoken of in broadstrokes:You start off in the middle of a holocaust (big props, Square); you're being sent to die for fear of contamination from an alien, hostile world.  You escape your bonds, you help stop the holocaust, odds are stacked against you, you run through hugely cinematic warzones, better than anything Square has ever done before.  Compelling from minute one.   The story then unfolds that there are two worlds, and they are at war with one another.  Your world (Cocoon), is made to seem like the haven of all humanity and the perfect paradise, but you learn it is darker than you thought.  There are these magical inter-dimensional type demi-gods (Cocoon Fal'Cie), they built your world, and they fight against the world below (Pulse) and its demi-gods (Pulse Fal'Cie).Compare this to my favorite Final Fantasy, FFVIII, and tell me that the story is less coherent.  FFVIII's story sports some child soldiers brainwashed in a floating terrorist/mercenary training facility in the sky!  They all grew up as kids in an orphanage, but not one of them remembers this because of mental heatlh damage resulting from military hardware they're required to use as...child soldiers.   You race through many nations and warzones to find that powerful Sorceresses control the face of world politics.  Then you find, in fact, it has always been one Sorceress, who can bend time and possess people.  Then she, in fact, kompresses all time-space into a kind of purpl'ish goo that you have to navigate through to reach the end-game.  Honestly, and I love FFVIII, but that story is ridiculous.  It would be hard-pressed to survive in novel form.  FFXIII, however, could easily make a novel.3) Voice Acting/Character Design:  People appear to hate Vanille, Snow, Hope, Lightning, and maybe Sazh and Fang too. Vanille is an upbeat young woman that sounds a bit 'slow' at first, yes, but I think they invented a fictitious accent (Pulsian) for her to use; which startles us Earthicans at first.  Snow is the archetypical hero; this isn't new.  Every Square game has a Snow.  Remember Zell?  Snow is way less annoying than Zell.  Imagine if Zell were voice-acted.  Now imagine Zell said the things Zell said in FFVIII, in a wheezy, energetic, high-pitched voice. I'd have let Zell die repeatedly.  Snow has a good voice-actor, it's just his lines are sometimes cheesy.  He's a self-proclaimed hero that's crushed by the guilt of his own failures.  Of course he's blustering.   Lightning, they claim, is one-dimensional.  People who say this didn't play the game, or don't understand the idea of character development.  She starts cold, she learns to trust.  The characters are well thought-out, look beautiful, and have remarkably well done, grade-A professional voice-acting.  For those that disagree, go back and play FFX and listen to Titus' grainy whining voice (that sounds like he's narrating from in a bathroom), then tell me FFXIII did a worse job.   People complain that Lightning is a trophy female protagonist with no personality.  She's essentially a better, female Squall, in my opinion.  They both can't trust, they both have deep pains from personal loss and people they failed to protect.  They're both strong and silent.  They both use gunblades; but Lightning's is ten times as awesome; exactly like Squall, but ten times as awesome.  That about sums her up.4) Music:  The best, period.  8 and 16-bit scores do not compare to this symphonic magnificence.  The music fits the setting, the mood, and it flows.  The battle theme is light years beyond anything Square has EVER done.  Thank god I don't need to listen to jarring synthesizer techno while I save the world anymore.  Square has always excelled at making original, moving soundtracks; this is by far their best.5) Visuals: Like a slice of an LSD-induced dream that was rendered into a game by Pixar.6) Terminology:  So, I've read reviews of people ragging on this game for all it's jargon, ""What's a Gran Pulse? A Fal'what? Gestalt? Is that a german seasoning?""  There's like, seriously, ten words or something you will need to learn.   Gran Pulse and Cocoon are worlds, the only two worlds in the game, so it's not like they're a galactic compendium of planets you have to remember.  Fal'Cie are the demi-gods, a human bound by a Fal'Cie's magic to serve them is called a l'Cie, a human that fails to complete his focus given to him by the Fal'Cie becomes a C'ieth (like a zombie).  That's about it, really.  The rest is just come-and-go.  Gestalt is just a meter you fill when you beat up the summons you're trying to acquire.  It's really a trite complaint.  Every RPG has it's own jargon, let alone FF games.  GF's, materia, mako energies, Ivalice, Shinra, etc.  FF is renowned for it's own jargon.  Jargon, in this context, just means unique story concepts.  Unique story concepts generally mean more attention to detail, more depth of story, and more immersion in the end.7) The Battle System:  People either hate it or they love it.  I think it's, by far, the best battle system in any FF game other than XII.  The people that complain it's too simple are playing on easy mode.  I die routinely, and I am a twenty year veteran of RPG's.  Once you reach Pulse, there are regular mobs that are like mini-bosses, and there are daunting challenges all around you.  It's a new system, but not at all shallow. The infamous 'auto-battle' is a feature you can choose to never use with one menu option.All in all, the fanboys' critique seems to be irrational, raging nostalgia lashing out with venomous spite at a masterpiece that failed to reach their dreams' fondest hopes.  In other words, they got let down and took it out on Square.   This game is easily 9/10.  The port has no graphics options, beware.  It runs fine on my PC, though.  Square will patch the game in December to fix this.			"

Only control one person in your party, need to constantly switch paradigms, just not a lot of ontrol in combat.  Also the game is beyond liner. I mean I've only got like maybe 3 hours of gameplay in but all I've done thus far is run down hallways and watch cutscenes. It's kinda boring in my opinion. Don't buy this game is my recomendation.

												While most people complain about graphics and some technical aspects, I never experienced anything game breaking for the few first days. But even if I did, I would cope. The thing is that this horrible port has made the game impossible to launch sometimes, so I can't play when I want. And also, the keyboard gets locked very often, usually with anything related to the ESC key. Imagine wanting to get out and the damn thing doesn't let you. It's more than annoying. Plus, when the ESC key works 'fine', it doesn't even ask you if you want to quit, it just quits without warning. A lot of issues.That said, the game itself is pretty good, I enjoy it. Sadly all these issues let me no option than to not recommend to buy this. At the very least until Square-Enix even dares to apologize or even release some statement regarding this. They're acting like the game is fine and as if we all are happy. Awful behavior for what it calls itself a serious company. What a joke!			"

												The game is beautiful and can be fun despite it being one of the most linear games of all time, which especially sucks for a FF type game.Emphasis on ""can be fun"". But not really because as everyone knows, Square is tied with Ubisoft for #1 all-time bad port masters and this is a poorly optimized piece of crap that runs like garbage even on the most powerful computers. The same can also be said for FFXIII-2 and Lightning Returns, both also run very poorly. Yes, I know that some of you reading this can run it fine but the fact is that this game is just simply known for being poorly optimized overall.I stopped supporting Square a long time ago and so should you if you are exclusively a pc gamer because they will never learn to code for pc games properly. They only care about the console market because that's where probably 90% or more of their profit comes from. I guess I wouldn't care either if I were them in that case.			"

												FFXIII's lack of character development damages the already confusing story. (voice acting didn't help) Combat system differs from FF games and not for the better. Summons are useless. Enemies aren't memorable. Weapon system sucks. Only highlights are summon designs/animation and fights to obtain summons, grinding strategies (growth egg and adamastoise kills), and being a Final Fantasy game.			"

												Having finished the game before on PS3, I feel qualified to say that, for all intents and purposes, this is a pretty decent port of the game that all Final Fantasy fans should try. I'm not going to give my opinion of the game in detail but I will say that it is very underrated and, if nothing else, worth experiencing at this price for the visuals and audio alone. Square Enix is truly in a class of their own when it comes to audio/visual design and FFXIII is one of the best places to see it until XV is released. This new port of the game is optimized to run at 60 frames per second, maximum, though you might have a hard time hitting that consistently if your system isn't configured properly. By enabling Vsync through my GPU drivers for this game, forcing Anisotropic Filtering (which is unrelated but really helps the visuals), and setting my PC to Maximum Performance in the power settings I was able to get 60fps at almost all times during battle and field scenes, though cutscenes (especially the pre-rendered ones of course) tended to hover around 30fps, which is fine.In general, if you were ever interested in this game and are very easily swayed by gorgeous, artistic visuals and sound, you will enjoy this game, especially at a discount like this. The Japanese dual audio option also helps if you find the English voices grating on your ears, which is subjective; I'm fine with them but options are always nice! It's true that, at the moment, the game is locked at 720p and you use the ESC key to quit the game, but those are not nearly as big of a deal as they're made out to be as long as your GPU or monitor properly scales the game to your screen size. The game uses a lot of post-processing effects so that the 720p visuals are barely noticeable on my 1080p screen except for occasional aliasing, and the game runs so smoothly with those small tweaks that I barely notice anything ""wrong"" with how the game looks anyway. In the end, if you've intended to give this game a try or even experience it again, there is no better time than now.My general, relevant specs, if anyone is curious, are:CPU: Intel i5 3570k OC'd from 3.8 to 4.2ghzGPU: Nvidia GTX 770Monitor: Asus 1080p 60hz			"

												Out of all the Final Fantasy games, I've only cried at the end of two: IX and XIII.I play Final Fantasy because I am driven by two things: Story and combat. The somewhat linear model never bothered me...I actually found it quite enjoyable. Best Final Fantasy combat out there for sure.And in my opinion, one of the best Final Fantasy stories out there. Such complexity, beauty and relatability.I couldn't recommend this game enough.			"

												Fun JRPG with engaging plot, great visuals and good soundtrack held back by a few flaws. I would recommend this to anyone that is a fan of the series and it is a great starting point for everyone else.The drawbacks of this game is the lackluster performance, level design and combat. For the most part performance is steady however all that changes when you get to Gran Pulse near the end of the game where enemies start popping in and out while your framerate almost halves (and this on a GTX 1060 at 1080p). The level design is very basic. The majority of the game you just run in a straight line, going from one cutscene to the next. It is very linear.The combat takes a long time to get engaging. After say 20 hours in, when your characters develop enough to get attacks and varied team combinations, it will lead to some nice battles here in there. For the most part there are few challenging enemies in the game. For the most part you will spam the autobattle button.That being said the characters are memorable and the story will keep you engaged. There is a lot of cutscenes in this game and they are, for the most part, well done. The humor is hit and miss. One of the best thing this game has going for it, aside from the graphics and well done animations, is the music. It really does stand out and I found it great.			"

Product received for free
												The game isn't as bad as everyone made it out to be. Was the story pretty linear? I suppose so, but if you compare it to the other FF games, they were pretty linear themselves. I think they presented FF13 well enough to make it into the FF series though I didn't really feel an ounce of emotion while playing the game. Sure there were some cliche scenes and dialogue that makes you want to tear your eyes out, but what's an FF game without some cliche scenes and cheezy lines? The story itself wasn't good or bad. It was pretty much your average save the world story and the ONLY thing I was looking forward to was Serah and Snow getting married. When I finished the game, I was like WHERE WAS THE WEDDING? It was half the reason why I finished the game. The other half was to see whether Fang and Vanille were either in a family-sister relationship or a romantic relationship with each other. I had a feeling that Square Enix was sort of in the middle between the two types of relationships since after all they are a world known company and game developer.The battle system in my opinion was actually a nice change of pace compared to some of the older FF games. The old turn based battle is okay and all since it gives you all the time in the world to make a strategy or eat a snack! The introduction of the paradigm system made the game refreshing and new, though IMHO it isn't exactly hard to learn or master. You just need to know the weaknesses of your enemies and adapt your paradigm decks to them. Honestly, the only BIG flaw I cared about in this game was the travelling system, especially if you hadn't completed any missions yet. It's such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to move through Gran Pulse when you have no way to teleport or travel once you hit chapter 11 in the game. Even post-game, it's still a hassle to move around and that sort of turned me off from actually completing all the achievements in the game.It took me around 38 hours to beat the game itself. I don't regret wasting 38 hours exploring the breathtaking scenery they created in this game or listening to the beautiful music they implemented for each area. For example, the bgm in Oerba - the home of Fang and Vanille. In my opinion, Oerba had the best bgm out of all the areas because it really made you understand the feeling of losing a home and never able to return to it. The ending song, no not ""My Hands"" by Leona Lewis (totally ruined the English version of the game), but ""Kimi Ga Iru Kara"" (Because You Are Here) by Sayuri Sugawara made me feel satisfied with the game. Are you hesitant to play this game? Just buy it and try it out yourself. You won't regret spending $15 - even though this was gifted to me.			"

												Game that has been released halfway through development. Would recommend only to die-hard Final Fantasy fans but they already have played this game.The battle system has a lot of potential and can keep interest up for the game. Unfortunately the game suffers from unsufficient testing and being published too soon. There are many points in time that that you end up wondering ""what on earth were the developers thinking when they did this?"" If this had not been a Final Fantasy game I would have stopped playing much earlier but I thought that when the problems surfaced were just lone hiccups.Quite often you find yourself losing a fight with no idea what you did wrong. This happens even if you have your party leveled up as much as they can be at those points. You simply have to google what to do. Even then you might be left wondering why the solution you googled worked.The final straw for me was the final boss. The fight was going completely fine and was taking way quite some time as the final battles tend to do until I suddenly just lost and I didn't understand why. I had to google the last attact the boss had used (one it had used couple of times during the fight). The thing is the final boss has an attack that has a 50% chance to kill a party member. If you party leader dies, you lose the fight. Having 3 party members this means every time the boss uses that attact you have a 15% chance of losing the fight.			"

												I said I would repost after playing the game. I can't comment on the patches because my system (stats follow) handled the game beautifully. The only times I missed 1080p (versus the 720p fullscreen) on a decent 42' screen was when I missed antialiasing/anistropic filtering settings. Basically if you pay too much attention to other characters on the map, you may see edges that aren't exactly smooth.MY RATING: That said, I give this game 9/10, considering it's an FF jRPG classic and the graphics are amazing and the port is really good.DISMISSAL OF GRAPHICS WHINERS WITHOUT APPROPRIATE HARDWARE: As I said before, I'm a software developer, and, using my knowledge of code and now experience with the game, I don't think the character models, textures, etc. need any updating to 1080p. Instead, let folks add AA and such, if they can't already get that through their graphics driver. It would ruin the original graphics, imho! I heard someone complain that the computer got the lesser quality cutscenes, but 50GB is enough for a game, imho, and, again, this is the definitive modern jRPG non-MMO graphically and otherwise as far as I'm concerned.SUMMARY: So, that done, on to the summary of the game: be prepared to not understand the story or how combat works completely for 4-8 hours, depending on the speed you play jRPGs. But this game delivers in length- not quite as long as I'd wish in a perfect world, but, being completionist, it took me at least 120hrs to get through. You can handle that, as the crazy FF fan who can't choose between FF, FFIII, FFIV, and FFVI for the best FF, right? FFVII was great, no question, but not in the running... kind of like FFX.STORY: actually not bad, after you understand what le'cie are... the voice acting is very good, including the annoying teenage female character who later develops. The story draws various types of relationships between the characters, drawing you into the necessity of the quest. Altogether, it's somewhat contrived, but, hey, go retrieve four crystals and no further explanation!GAME MECHANICS: The most annoying thing is the lack of a world-map like most final fantasy series games... a lot of the fun/sense of accomplishment of other FFs is when you gain a vehicle that allows you to visit those ""secret"" places you couldn't go to before. So, I think this is where the ""linear"" criticism comes from. You will see a multi-level large world environment. And there is an elementary ""side-quest"" system, and you can still go through areas again and again (it sometimes gets old, but seldom, since the wonderful music and varied environments keep you in it) to chase after the ultimate badassdom.The class system/grouped-combat feels confining for about 4-8 hours until you realize the variety of skills each character specializes in and that the system makes ""formation"" of front/back seem like ""Goodnight, Moon."" Though I love that book. You can play the combat in so many ways- I recommend ignoring the timer-based results of combat... just try all sorts of techniques out... you can speed-kill later.COMBAT: There are people who hate the fact that a jRPG is not Truly turn-based, and vice-versa. I like both, especially that correct blend that gives me time to decide strategy and ""units of time"" to work with, while reasonably limiting the decision as to sometimes influence my decisions. Hence, the ""auto-battle"" technique you're familiar with so far. Guess what? ""Auto-battle"" is surprisingly often what you want to do - healing) auto-heal will pick the person who needs healz the most tank) well, depends how you like to tank, but it spams some sort of guard skill, which you'd usually do anyway. Taunting skills are used too much, but you can always stop the queue after you successfully taunt, giving the skill added value since it auto-picks non-taunted targets.The bosses are challenging to a mid-aged gamer who played each FF. Most teach you to use new game-mechanics, and there are definite tough-fights if you go seeking them. And the bosses are like ""wait, whoa- look twice.""Anyway, the combat system has true depth, give it some time, and once you have some good commands, you're only badass if you set the default command to ""abilities"" instead of ""auto-battle.""END: In the end, FFXIII really delivers what you'd expect of Square *coughSOFT* Enix. The port is pretty well done considering some annoying FF ports in the past, that felt half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FFXIII is ftw once you realize that it's a post-MMO jRPG that chose a lot of the good parts of an MMO without being online. But don't think it's dumbed-down, because it has worthy challenges. This is truly the definitive jRPG of the post-MMO world, with all the bells and whistles you'd expect, imho. Not that I don't log in to FFXIV now and again ;)			"

												Please bear in mind that I've played over 100+ hours in the 360 version of this game which is the reason for my low playtime.While many people may not like it, this game is deserving of the Final Fantasy name. Why? Because it FEELS like a Final Fantasy; there's great character development, pacing, storyline, battles and of course outstanding music.This is a perfect starting point for those new to the franchise. Although it may be confusing and overwhelming at first, I strongly suggest for those who are confused by the opening (which I will admit explains nothing) is to check the datalog entries on L'cie and Fal'cie etc.Now. Onto the meat of the game.Like previous FFs, progress is largely done by exploration and battles. Sadly, exploration is where the game falls short. No doubt you've heard of the lineraty of the game, and its true. You will be walking in a hallway-like fashion most of the time. However, the game does open up at a late stage in the game which is great for those yearning for side-quests and exploration - that they are plenty.Instead of following the traditional method of Turn-Based battles, all battles will be in real time which makes the game far more interesting and difficult at parts.On the whole, this was my first FF and I loved it. Where it falls short is on-the-rails exploration and the game holding your hand most of the time. However, this will be undoubtedly be overpowered by the sheer production values and experience this game possess.			"

												Final Fantasy XIII is, as the name implies, the 13th main-line Final fantasy title. And much like previous titles, the game has very little to do with the rest of the series, apart from some minor reoccurring elements, like the Chocobos (a kind of large bird that some people ride on). Let's get the most glaring issue with this game out of the way. The port is terrible. Slowdown for no obvious reason was quite common, but what was worse is that the game has really bad keyboard controls, yet there's a common bug that causes the save menu to freeze if you have an Xinput controller plugged in, and it does not play nice with a DirectInput controller. It recognizes DirectInput controllers, just not all buttons on it.Graphics & soundFinal Fantasy XIII is a really nice looking game. It keeps a mostly consistent art style, with interesting looking  enemies and beautiful environments. Animations leave a bit to desire, but they're not terrible.The soundtrack is a disappointment. The Final Fantasy series is known for its great music, but here it just felt flat and uninteresting. Thinking back on the game, I don't actually remember any of the songs, yet I remember songs from the FF games I played in the 90's. Voice acting is mostly good, but not outstanding. The voice actors do a good job with the material they're given, even if there's no standout performances, but it feels like they are hampered more by the script than with any lack of talent.Story & writingThe story always plays an important role in the Final Fantasy series, and 13 is no exception. There are a lot of cutscenes and a lot of dialogue.The game takes place in a place called Cocoon, which is led by a fal'Cie. There's the l'Cie from pulse that are the enemy to Cocoon, and if you have no idea what a fal'Cie or a l'Cie is, then you've just experienced one of the major issues with the writing in this game. It loves to throw in-universe terms at you without explaining them. After a while you will figure out what a fal'Cie or a l'Cie is, but it's something that the writers seem to have expected you to know getting into the game.The fal'Cie are supernatural beings of great power, who more or less rule the world. The l'Cie are humans branded by the fal'Cie, who need to fulfill a task given to them, or else they'll be transformed into monsters. The branding also gives them special powers.The game throws you right into the story, some people who were near a pulse fal'Cie (the enemy of the l'Cie of Cocoon, where the main characters  are from) getting deported, due to fear of them being marked and dangerous. The main characters want to stop the deportation, which is protected by the soldiers of Cocoon. And it's boring. You're not really given any motivation for why you should care about anyone at this point, and the game does a terrible job at actually explaining what's going on, who the people are, it just expects you to be engaged in the story already. The characters are also introduced as 1 dimensional stereotypes with little in the way of personality outside of their one dominant trait. This goes on for nearly 3 hours.Then the characters reach the Pulse Fal'Cie and get branded, and this is where the game actually gets started. Now you're given some motivation, and the characters start showing some emotion (though it still takes a while before they really evolve into something relatable9. In terms of story pacing, this is terrible, you should not have to sit through nearly 3 hours of made up words that the game just refuses to explain and drip fed story before it gets anywhere, at least not in a game that tries to put the story in focus. Once the story really gets going, it actually turns into something that's relatively good, and moves along at a mostly good pace, up until the last 3rd of the game, where it starts to feel drawn out and padded once more. Overall, in the hands of better writers and with a better pacing, this story could have been quite good.GameplayFinal Fantasy XIII uses a real time combat system, unlike most previous games in the series. You only control one character, who you can give direct orders to. The rest of the characters are just given ""stances"", and they'll do whatever they want to do that fits into this stance. It works, but much like the story taking 3h to get started, so does the gameplay. Until you've become l'Cie all you can do is attack and use items, and there's really no skill or decision-making involved. You just attack. You won't get experience until you've become a l'Cie either.Once you've become l'Cie, you can start earning levels, and leveling up is handled in a less direct way than most Final Fantasy titles. You have skill paths for each stance, and you invest points into them to get stronger. Some give new abilities (but just for that stance), while other improve your stats. It's not a very complex system, all you really do is move along mostly linear progression paths, but you at least get to chose which path you want to invest your skillpoints in at any given them.Level navigation is more or less entirely linear. You move through long corridors with enemies. No chance to deviate from the path, other than possibly take 2 steps to one side to open a chest at certain points. Most FF games are linear, but none are as linear as this one. This makes for rather monotonous gameplay.Most enemies are easy enough to take down, and you don't really need to worry about stances and such all that much. Bosses though, those are at the same time almost always really easy and really frustrating to face. The game developers figured that by just giving the bosses huge health pools, they would make them harder,. Most bosses during the second half of the game are just damage sponges with some special attacks you need to watch out for. My advice is to just play the game on easy, they have smaller health pools if you do (an advice I wish had been given to me before I started playing, as I played through the entire thing on normal, apart from the last 3 bosses).Final thoughtsFinal Fantasy XIII is a deeply flawed game. The main story is actually rather interesting, but it's ruined by poor writing and pacing. The port is really bad, and you might have to play through the game with really awkward keyboard controls. The gameplay is also a bit monotonous, but were it not for the damage sponge bosses, it would have been alright at least. Overall, this is a game that can, and probably should, be skipped. You won't have a terrible time playing it, after the first 3 hours at least (which were the most boring 3 first hours I've ever seen in a JRPG), but there are so many better games out there that deserve your time and money instead. Games like Tales of Zestiria or most previous Final Fantasy titles.			"

												Warning!!! this game isn't Call of Duty.Feel like i had to put this in, with all the confusion on what JRPG actually is.JRPG (Japanese Role Playing Games) are more focused on story line and tactics then your Western RPG. This is usually paired with a lot of grinding if you want to 100% complete these titles. With no offence intended i like to state that this is what RPGs are about, Its role playing, the world revolves around you, sure Western RPGs have that to but not this heavy.Most games are becoming more and more streamlined and Final Fantasy is no exception. Fans like me seen Final Fantasy grow from turn-based to a more action-based game to target more players. In the first half of the game i was bored, nothing much to do then to hit that autobattle function, not to mention the confusion i had with terms like ""Fal'cie"" & ""l'cie"" during the main storyline. (If Square needed something to dumbed down, that will be it) Further into the game this changes fast, combat becomes more complex and you slowly beginning to understand the story there telling. In my opinion, this is the reason why most fans were upset. the first half of the game feels like you're in a speeding train, no breaks from the story, everything happening all at ones. But... i'm glad i tried to endure this, because by the second half of the game it is all explained better, the reason why you fighting and so much more. Even the battles become more tactical.my verdict on this title is mixed, if only the first part was explained better then at least you have a better understanding of why everyone acts the way they do. That and JRPG isn't for everyone, it's hit or miss. Maybe you like it? Then again it isn't a 60$ title so maybe bought on sales you at least gotten it cheap so maybe worth a try to see if you like it or not?			"

												Just a warning to anyone looking to buy this game. TLDR - Horrible porting job.There are no graphical settings. You are locked in to 720p and have no control over texture quality, antialiasing  or anything else. You can use GeDoSaTo to get around this, which will allow you to get the resolution up, but it has no effect on the pre-rendered cut scenes (of which there are plenty).The game couldn't tell the difference between a 360 controller and a joystick, wouldn't let me choose, and refused to accept the latter's input until the former had been unplugged.It's a good thing that the save points are so close together, because pressing escape will immediately  exit the game. No warnings. Straight to desktop. Why did they bind the ragequit button to one that is normally used to exit a menu?!?Don't expect to alt-tab either. And attempt to minimise the game will make it crash. If you're unlucky enough to have something minimise the game (add new hardware wizard, I'm looking at you!) you're going to be re-loading your save from the most recent point.If the one-man team behind 'From Dust' can do an awesome PC Port, I don't see why Square Enix can't. Not worth the money in it's current state.			"

												Linear, on-rails, inept at storytelling. Combat system an absolute borefest for the first two hours, it gets better afterwards, but it won't let you choose your leader and, in six hours of gameplay, it wouldn't let me pick my battle team either. I played up to a particularly annoying enemy called Odin and lost my patience after the first five tactics didn't work, because the guy would get my only other team member killed.I would've stomached trying a bit more, but what for? Nonsensical dialogue and plot points that never get explained, all centered around the most irritating character since Squall? On top of that, while the Paradigm system is interesting on its own, battles ended up being a ""screw around with the menus"" excercise. I have Microsoft Excel for that.Your mileage may vary.Incidentally, Japanese audio is left in, which is a huge plus and I have to congratulate Square Enix for it, but the port drops at 30fps at random, no matter how high or low the settings, for no good reason. Didn't try keyboard controls, but the gamepad's fine and responsive. The PC port isn't too bad, but the game is just not good enough to justify the price. I got it on a sale and I have buyer's remorse.			"

												This game is real candy for the eyes. It almost feels like a movie which is interrupted by fighting gameplay. In the fighting scenes you don't do that mucheither, as it is turn-based strategy. You just smash some keys and enjoy the stunts that Lightning, the main character, pulls off. If you like beautiful graphics paired with a beautiful soundtrack, you'll like this. The price is also pretty low. But beware of a loooong downloading time (60 GB)Gameplay: 8/10in the beginning it is somewhat monotonous, but eventually more and more aspects were added. It didn't get boring for me, but it is as linear as it gets.Story: 5/10 confusing and not very original, but not really bad, it still motivates to play onCharacters: 7/10 interesting enough, likeable and well animatedVisuals: 11/10Everything looks nice and awesome :)Music: 10/10 just beautiful and very fittingControls: 10/10easy to handle with a controllerGerman Translation: 4/10most of the time, it is not 100% accurate... it feels a bit loveless			"

												Framerate is horrible, even though my PC exceeds the recommended specs given. Changing graphical settings (to the limited degree allowed for by the game launcher) does not affect this at all. Whether I run it at 720p with everything dialed down or 1920x1200 with everything at max has no effect at all. It still runs mostly at a stuttery 30, with occassional jumps to 50 and drops to as low as 20. It doesn't seem correlated to the amount of action on the screen either. Some of the more complex scenes ran smoother than walking across an empty bridge.			"

												This is my first time playing through Final Fantasy XIII and 8 hours in I'm satisfied so far. The combat system is new, the roles have names I'm not used to, but you adjust quickly and figure it out as you go. I was fully prepared for the linear aspect of the game and with all the cutscenes I am choosing to view my playthrough as a long movie with some battle sequences thrown in. I bought this game to experience the story so I am fine with this. Prepare for a long download! This game comes in at a whopping 50GB. I was expecting to play the night I purchased it but wasn't finished with the download until noon the following morning.In terms of bugs and glitches, I'm assuming the November update made some big changes because I am having 0 issues with the game so far. I will update my review if something comes up but having played for a few days I am content with the quality of this port. I'll definitely be buying a copy of XIII-2.			"

I uploaded on my profile some screenshots with different resolution (720p and 1080p) with 2x MSAA (you can push it even better up to 16x MSAA), so you can see them!			"

Yeah, it's obvious they left out most settings and customization that pc gamers demand, but is it a deal breaker?  Seriously, for the price?  I've paid much more for a pc game that is horribly flawed and crashes to desktop every time I sneeze. So after a lengthy download, the game booted up flawlessly, menus and animations all seem to work fine.  The graphics and visuals are good, even at a lower res that i'm accustomed to.  Characters look better than alot of the landscape textures, but hey it's not a brand new game.  Music and atmospheric sounds are very good.  Some of the sound effects could be better (character footsteps), but overall sound is very good.  I've put a couple hours in with no glitches or crashes, and look forward to continuing to see what this game has to offer.  If you plan on purchasing, just wait for a sale.  As far as all the negativity goes, to each there own.  Some peoples horses are higher than others.			"

												Seriously, play this game with a controller and pretend your PC is an Xbox, it is not the best solutoin but it will make most of your problems go away. I would seriously recommend against playing this title with a keyboard.Yes, this game has every bit of problem the community claimed. ESC instant exits the game, no graphics options, no key rebinding, random framerate drop, etc, but overall, you can't help but take notice of the insane details in this game and be amazed at its incredible production value.Graphics:People complain about the 720p resolution lock quite a bit and how it ruins the gaming experience. I call bull sh*t. At 720p, this game far surpass most of the games that I've played at full 1080p, thanks to good lighting and insane texture level. The character models in this game are the best i've seen, even at 720p, they are so detailly rendered that you can count every single strand of hair on their head, LITERALLY. I am beyond amazed. An example of in-game screenshot i took:(http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/534001204805125661/34549CA31921479B1BC84FDF9AD69F6E53081788/1024x576.resizedimage)Gameplay:Very fast paced, but not really that innovative and fun. A lot of the times you are simply running along a narrow path, going from point A to point B, fighting waves and waves of the exact same enemies. It gets quite tiresome after a while, you will just end up using auto actions 90% of the time.Story:Can be a bit unnecessarily confusing at times, but mostly very well written. Memorable characters with distinguished voice acting, emotional cinematic moments throughout, and twists that are sure to keep you longing for more. The story is what really keeps you going, not the gameplay.Controls:Very disappointing. For such a fantastic game, the controls are really not up to par with the rest. Wanky auto camera, control smoothing, awkward character movement controls, everything in this category  just sums up to be a disappointment. Overall value:Even though it is a 4 year old game, i still have a lot of respect for Square Enix for putting it out at a $15 price point, and if you can manage to grab a controller, this game is pretty much a no-brainer, and you will definitely get more than what you paid for.

												Terrible port lacking even the most basic options. You get 720p and Japanese/English audio. Thats it.Thankfully there are ways to fix these problems and play the game in any resolution you wish. The game also responds well to driver level enhancements. The game itself isnt bad. For $15 it could be much worse. The game takes a while to really get interesting and you will spend a good amount of time walking in hallways. The game's saving grace is it's interesting combat system and half decent story. The game looks damn good after you apply various fixes and tweaks too.

												Just like the PS3 version.  Game runs smooth and haven't run into any problems.  My only complaint about this installment in the FF series is that it's VERY linear.  It's not much of a problem for me since I like to focus on the story just as much if not more than the gameplay but it might be a turn-off for some.  You're in for many hours of being lead down a narrow path before you can get to a point where you can explore on your own.There are a couple or characters I couldn't care less about so it's a bit of a bummer when I'm forced to have them in the party but luckily if you neglect them they still get points they can spend to increase their skills when the others fight.  In particular I wanted to smack Hope in the head every time I had to listen to him whine and couldn't wait for his part of the story to end so I could get back to the others.  To each their own I guess.			"

												I like the story of this game, but I hate pretty much everything about actually playing it. It's literally more than 20 hours before you get to an environment that is more than a linear corridor. The combat system is designed to feel fast paced and actiony, which it achieves by removing any actual decision-making from the player. It's also a 50 gb ♥♥♥♥ing download.Bottom line, see if you can find a lets play series for this on youtube or something.			"

												Where do you even start... I read, that the whole development of this game was quite a mess with dev team not knowing what they want and how they want to do whatever they do. And you can see the results of that - FFXIII is an expensive mess of good and horrible ideas mixed together and executed mediocre at best.Story starts horribly, then actually tries to redeem itself with interesting ideas and some character growth that makes unbearable characters interesting... only then to start backtracking on itself and repeating the same lines and silliness over and over and over and l'cie fal'cie enemies of cocoon focus. Which, I guess, perfectly fits the story where characters ultimately don't know what they're doing and why up until the very last cutscene.Mechanically it's an attempt to fit ideas of FF8, 10 and 12 together with some concepts from The Last Remnant into one thing, but failing spectecularly at doing so. Where FF8 ideas were fresh and concepts interesting (and later evolved further in Parasite Eve and Vagrant Story), here they feel like blind attempts at coping something you don't understand. Where 10 (which, I must add, I don't particularly like and haven't finished yet) tries to make leveling up go interesting ways, here crystalium is just a thing made up to look like it gives you more choice than it really does and surves no real tactical purpose up until the end, where it can, but really doesn't. Where in 12 automating characters in battles was a clever game of making interesting algorithms and made combat fast (as it happened without loadings) but strategic, FFXIII feels like boring battle of attrition with load times for battles (so I got bored and started outright cheating, not because there was any kind of ""challenge"", but simply because I wanted all of this to end faster). Where Last Remnant actually tried to make some fresh and clever additions to battles with units instead of characters fighting and you having more overall control of the characters, paradigms don't feel all that interesting and fights, despite cool animations and all, don't feel any more epic than they are. Also, corridors up until the very end, where the game ""opens up"" for one chapter, by which I mean creates few areas specifically for grinding and doing ""missions"" so the grinding is less boring. It's all optional, thankfully, but still adds up to the annoyance about the overall direction of the game.Overall, the game feels like a giant time waste built on ruins of amazing ideas that could make FFXIII a very interesting game. Both gameplay-wise and story-wise it shows glimpses of great ideas that got buried under frustrating and ultimately boring and pointless experience. If you want to try it because it's FF... well, you still will, I did after all. If you want to try it because you heard it's bad - don't, it's not entertainingly bad, just boring bad. And if you just want to know the story... I don't think the game does truly know it's story, so playing won't help much.			"

												My opinion of the Final Fantasy 13 trilogy.Now this isn't a little kid review unlike most the reviews already posted. If you play for graphics, you aren't a gamer and should uninstall steam.Alright, this is going to be lengthy. Since most haters can't put up arguments on why this game is bad, here's my good/bad. Overall i'd give this game a 7/10.Good things I liked about Final Fantasy 13 was the side quests(all 64 of them), the paradom(paradime? forgot the systems name), memorible characters and the fact they added more to the story.Game had difficulty, specailly first bartandualus fight(don't know how to spell that face gods name), the summon things that come out when they face themselves were no pushovers and the star rank rating system was amusing, good way to test out your skill. Bad things I don't like is the AMOUNT of cutscenes they have, its like MGS4, they focused too much on the story. The footsteps were also very loud, annoyed me through most of the game. The villians were also meh, didn't really like them all too much. I forgot them fairly quick.The game did much better in 13-2 by allowing EVERY area you've been to be explored again. Required a lot of back tracking to get through the game. Even had a difficulty level in case you thought the game was too hard or too easy. The main villian was great, very memorble.Lightning returns story was bleh at best, but I LOVED the action RPG combat it had. Not to mention you could explore EVERYTHING in that game. Requires a lot of side quests to be able to finish the 5 bosses(6, not sure cause of hidden boss on the 13th day). The villian was bloody terrible, bad writing too.I'd recommend it for RPG lovers, not for casual gamers however.			"

												Yaaay!! it got a patch! Now this game is everything the console game was :) FF13 has a very bold and unique battling system. Those of you who love the older final fantasy games will love this one too. Yes, it is different from what your use to. But it is better than 12 thats for sure. Id say the worst about this game is the first 20 or so hours that are linear with not much freedom to do as you please. Also , there is a slight lost in translation that is happening with the story line. Lol but I swear that is every final fantasy game. If I were to rate this game it would be a 4.5 out of 5. Don't listen to the hate, IT REALLY IS A GOOD GAME!!			"

Short Version: This is not a Final Fantasy, it just has the same name. This is a low cost ripoff of Last Remnant.  If you played Last Remnant, this game will be really boring. This game is NOT for you if you want to have full control of tactics, skills, a good story, a crafting system, a deep level of customisation, explorations and discoveries on a big map. This game is for you If you like seeing beautiful graphics, face animations, pressing enter and be assisted by an AI. It's a good experience as a first RPG, if you don't seek challenge or afraid to be lost on the map or on skill trees. Gran Pulse is a lie, it should be renamed Grind Pulse, This game is closer to a Korean RPG than a Japanese. If you didn't understand: FXIII is not a ""RPG"", its a grinding railroad visual novel.Long version, of facts that may you reconsider choice of buying the game: Game doesn't give you full control until Chapter 11 of 13, so after roughly 20 hour (easy 5 hours of videos and animations). Story is dull, even SpongeBob's life is more interesting. Battle Team of 3 max, on the 6 possible heroes. You control only the leader, the AI controls the others depending on the current Parag~ Auto-battle Option, because its better to let the IA choose the attacks instead of wasting time checking enemies weakness and select strategic skills. You can't switch teams during the fight. If the leader dies during a battle you lose, even though you have an healer that can rez him. Each hero can execute one Role at a time (Commando(Warrior), Ravager(Mago), Sentinel(Tank), Saboter(Debuff), Medic(Healer), Synergist(Buff)) Each Roles has its own abilities, and they can't be shared. You have to switch Parag~ all the time.  When you switch Parag~ every hero does an useless wasting time animation, while the enemies keep attacking. Every Action sequence is directed to only 1 target, you can't heal several heroes one by one, or hit different enemies to disable them. So what's the game do? It split the sequence for each target,  You can only invoke the Summon of the leader. Each hero has only 1 summon (that you get after 20hours), so only 6 summons availables. That's poor. Once summoned, the creature replaces the team and fight only with the leader, but its damages are weak on late game, so you don't use them. You can't move your heroes during the fight. Result: Your tank aggro the enemies AOE just near the healer and the dps. You can lose or win a fight because of this. No open-world: Gran Pulse is a joke and is the same as the common maps in Last Remnant. No crafting Each weapons are the same, but the textures change. Attack animation are the same with every weapons. There are archetypes of enemies, they are all the same, but the textures change. Enemies attacks animation are the same. VFX of magical attacks are simplistic, you don't feel any power from them. There are tons a cinematic and animations sequence for nothing. They just break the rhythm (for as slow it is). Skills tree is a joke, i wonder why they didn't made an auto-level option, like the auto-battle option. Wasted my time waiting for useless animation of line filling up. Skills are the same for everyone, the only difference is the amount of xp to reach them. Each battle gives you a score with stars...  but no scoreboards or records of best fights exist. Enemies drops are bad, 2 max per enemies: 1 normal and 1 rare. Boss are HP bags, and not memorables...... i could go on but i won't.And if you still feel like playing this game because you never played FF, then don't because its not an FF.			"

												Played and loved FF6 - FF10 here's my opinion:- ALL main characters are extremely unlikeable ESPECIALLY Hope is the most annoying thing ever and ""the"" main character ""Lightning"" comes in as a close second on my unlikeability list- bad pacing - extremely predictable alternation between walking+fighting and short+meaningless ""story/interaction"" sequences. Nothing enjoyable to switch it up i.e. no blitzball, no chocobo hide and seek, no Lindblum hunting festival, no card game. I'm not exaggerating when i say nothing interesting ever happens. Everything that happened after the first bossfight about 11 hours ago was meaningless and uninspired.- terrible writing - not fun, not interesting in any way. Most characters just whine all the time.- boring story - played 13 hours and i still know about as much as after 2 hours of playing- terrible combat - you control only 1 character with a very limited skillset at a time in a FF typical ATB System. Imagine if in Final Fantasy 7 you could only ever give orders to 1 character which the game picks for you for a majority of the game. It also has barely any strategy outside of --> get stagger --> burn -->low hp? -->heal. This applies to every enemy in the game and even bosses are lame.- no limit breaks (wot???)(this deserved special mentioning)- linear progression/bad rpg elements - the way you characters progress is pretty much laid out for you. There is close to 0 customization. All characters feel essentially the same with some stat differences.- looks good but resolution is capped at 720p and even in fullscreen mode there's huge black bars on the top and bottom of my screen which i looked for a way to remove but didnt find any (steam forum / ingame / google)+ audio is niceI will probably finish the game at some point just to be able to say i played through it but after 13 hours of played time there's nothing here that makes me want to play it.

												Well thank you for the update Square :DThe game is working much better now, I would like a feature to remap the keys/controller but the graphics are ok. The framerate is almost 60 most of the time even using the 8k and AA 16X (for a second from time to time it can go down a few frames but it's nothing noticeable at all) and the stuttering is easily fixable by enabling V-Sync in the 3D graphic options of your GPU (in my case the ""ON - smooth"" option worked perfectly for the sli, not a single defect on the screen anymore).The game is very good, well I already completed the game 2 times in PS3 so obviously I enjoy it enough to recommend it. I'm glad that after our complains they took the time to try to fix the problems, I hope they learn from these mistakes to improve in the future and personally I would llove to see other titles of Squaresoft like Parasite Eve in PC.Duncan.>>> EDIT <<<I just found a weird thing when I was using 8k shadows, in some scenes the shadows on the skin of the characters were very dark and that was kinda annoying. However, by running 2k shadows instead of 8k the issue start to go away as you lower that value, you can see it in these SS:8K

2Khttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=354839216Maybe it's not a big deal for some, but Vanille with that shadow beard doesn't look so cute :PAlso, while I was testing this, I found that in some particular places if you use the 8K you might get fps drops. But again, just by lowering the shadows to 4K you will not get that problem at all (I tested walking through the same 5 locations with different options). Just by doing this you most likely will fix the problem. Bottomline, I get 1080p/60fps with no other issues using AA x16 (even while recording at max settings with shadowplay) by using vSync and 2K instead of 8K. This doesn't change much what I said above, because despite this reduction from 8k to 2k the quality is very good at the end, and you still get the constant 60 fps with no stuttering at all.Duncan			"

												First Of all, this must be addressed. The Game is Quite Linear. Even More so than Final Fantasy X. To me this is No real Issue, because the gameplay was amazingly long (and there is an open world part eventually, even though it's slightly restrictive). But there, it's been said. The game Launched with no Custom Resolutions, so regardless of what Type of PC you were on, you were restricted to 720p. Even with a good computer, frame rates were iffy. (Sometimes at 60, and sometimes stuttering to 30) Thankfully, this is something that Square Enix Decided to Fix. And will be patched in later. As for how the game looks, even on a 4k Monitor, in 720p, I found myself a bit overwhelmed by the details in certain parts of the game. (No Spoilers, but close to the end Especially) The Cutscenes were very fuzzy though, and It was sometimes hard to stay focused on the action.While Many People Criticize the Story and Character development, (or as they say, Lack thereof) I have to say, that the story to me was both quite enjoyable, and the character development was, predictable, at times, but none the less, quite well done. (I have Only Played with Japanese Audio, so that may be one of the reasons.)Also, Thanks to Square Enix, the North American Versions of the game have Both English, and Japanese Audio. To me, Final Fantasy has always been a Subtitles / Reading game, seeing as my first owned Videogame was Final Fantasy VII on the PS1 and it really sparked my want to read. As For Gameplay, I can definitely say it’s different. For the first 20 hours of the game as I was playing it, I never changed the Characters Classes (Paradigms, as they are called in the game) Until I really had to. However, after getting used to the Role Switching, I can say that they made an easy to use battle system.Well I wouldn’t give this game a perfect score, but in MY opinion, (and that is what this is people) I believe the game is quite entertaining. I would recommend the game to people who enjoyed FFX, and FFXII.  "

												After completing the story (and a half of side quests) finally I can give my own opinion about this series.The thumb has already shown my support for this game. If you want to know why, you can read more here.- My first impression about this game is the graphic. I played Final Fantasy XII in PS2, and I thought that the game had great scenery to offer. After I come here, I was really amazed. Such effects and realistic scenery that I think deserve high rating for this, I can say the development is much better.- The challenge. Although this game doesn't offer ""full free roam"" feature like FF XII, exploring the area of each chapter is still giving interests. Sorry to say, that compared to FF XII, this version is much easier to complete. I really miss the time when I needed to defeat Yiazmat in 4 hours :(- The storyline. It seems that Square Enix did well enough to give the players ""feel trip"". Hard times, good times, all of them are expressed well. I give 8/10 for the storyline.- The last, but not least, the EPIC BGM. It seems that Final Fantasy Series offer beautiful soundtrack, and always related to the atmosphere the player in. I really like the final boss BGM, giving enough thrill to defeat him (lol)I don't regret buying this game for spending my holiday. Probably going to buy Final Fantasy XII-2 for Summer Holiday.			"

												Remember all that negative stuff people said about FFXIII years ago when it was released? You probably remember hearing ""Hallway Simulator"" being used a lot? Yeah it was all true. I guess I was curious to see if they were exaggerating, since I had never tried XIII until the steam release. If anything, they were too soft on this trash.Not only is this the worst Final Fantasy I've ever seen (and I've played all 1-12 preceding it), it's also a terrible port. This would be an embarrassing effort from an indie developer, nevermind a giant like SquareEnix. There are some excellent RPGs to be found on steam, so try not to waste your time/money on the likes of this.  "

The only downside is that it run in 720p only and picture can be the wrong format on your screen if you're too newb to set your graphics drivers correctly. +Great game, get less linear after a while (like after you leave Midgar in FF7)+Fast battles without loading+Item upgrading and crafting+Really good price-Lack some graphics option, 720p only video-50go download, videos are badly encoded (x264 doesnt exist in Japan ?!?)Still recommand the game, there's a lot of third party solutions to fix the problems not fixed yet anyway.

I've beaten it twice, and completed most end-game content on the Xbox 360, and looking forward to completing it a 3rd time.Negatives from launch:- No settings for PC, and no 1080p support (which I had to fix with something called GeDoSaTo which was easy to setup)- Combat is simplified for the majority of the game. (most of the time you can just press A to auto-battle)- Story is somewhat cryptic, and hard to follow at times.- Some of the characters can be annoying (Hope...)Otherwise, it's a very visually appealing game, with some great bosses, and a fluid fast paced combat system. If you are a fan of Final Fantasy, or just looking for some sweet eye-candy I'd definitely reccomend this game.  "

												This game is a nightmare.This is now an old game, I won't write here anything that has not been written before.But I need to write this message in a bottle. Because I bought this game, and I'll finish it, no matter despicable the experience is.I now feel like the bobsleigh team in ""rasta rocket"", carrying their sled to the finish line.After 16 hours of play : I can't stand the automated battles and the paradigm shifts.I can't stand these characters who cannot stand each others.I can't stand having to bear such a thin plot, while having SO MANY CUTSCENES which most of the time do not add anything to the progression of the plot.But dammit, I'll finish the damn game.

												So a quick ""review"". PROs and CONs first. Then some comments I have about the game.PROs:+Story presentation+Characters and development+Scenery / environment +Some nice architecture +Variety of enemies & bossesCONs:-Boring-Annoying item crafting / upgrading system (grindfest)-Linear (not really important though)-Uninteresting gameplay-Seriously... very boring gameplay.Comments:I played this game total of 16.5 hours or so. And first hour was somewhat interesting. Then it just became such a drag to play and was just painfully boring. Gameplay became such a drag that I even lost interest in cutscenes / story... because gameplay just utterly killed the mood to bother with anything. Gameplay in a nutshell is just run around, encounter enemy, spam A.. sometimes press R1 ...then sit in cutscene for 10min  and so on. It's just is not interesting at all.Even when game sessions / sittings where I felt ""I played this game quite a lot today. Prolly like 2-3 hours has passed"" then I look at the clock and only ~50min had passed.But I paid money for this game and constantly forced myself to ""finish"" it... at some point (6-8) hours into game? I just got so fed of it and figured to make it a bit more entertaining for myself by simply maxing my money (cheat it in) so I could upgrade my weapons and stuff. And thus it helped to play another 8 hours.But no... I'm done with this game. It's probably the most boring game I have ever played in my life. The gameplay.. is just painful... its a drag... Sometimes it became so boring that instead of feeling sleepy or yawning.. it just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.FF XIII-2 Is supposedly more fun to play. So I will check it out.. but I'm expecting same boredom.If you want to know story or so... just go watch ""cutscene movie"" on youtube or something.Score: 4/10 "

												Final Fantasy has certainly changed, for better or worse. In some respects, it's certainly obvious that the changes made were to make the game appeal to a large audience, simplifying some of the mechanics people have come to love to make it more approachable. FFXIII is a victim of this.While 13 does have a bit of RPG depth, it's mostly shallow and a bit false. To start off, the ""leveling"" system is pretty linear. In fact it's mostly linear. You have multiple different character ""classes"" to level up, but each one is just a stream of single graphs that only really go forward. There are a couple random branches, but you might as well fill all them up with the experience you gain from one battle anyway, so there's absolutely no reason to skip them. It's almost like they wanted to go for a Sphere Grid like system from Final Fantasy 10, but decided for the sake of simplicity to just make it a single line. The only real effect you have on the leveling is which class you want to level up first and when.The most character building depth comes from the weapon customization, but even that is almost too straight forward. You gain several little useless bits and pieces of monsters and electronics after each battle, which you can either just sell, or use to craft weapon upgrades. It's not as exciting as it sounds though. You choose one weapon to upgrade, and then choose from ANY of the components you've acquired. The only difference is the amount of experience it puts towards your weapon upgrade. Eventually you'll meet the number on the screen, and your weapon or armour's stats boost up a bit.I can also see what they were TRYING to do with the combat, but it still falls victim to it being too simple. You've probably heard that the game plays itself. Well, early on in the game, it actually kind of does. The game chooses the ""best"" combination of attacks toward and enemy, and then executes them without you having to touch anything. You CAN choose exactly which skills to use and in what order, but since the Auto-command chooses the best set anyway, you'll end up using the exact same thing. There is a bit of strategy with the Paradigm system, which basically changes the class of your characters in battle to different jobs such as switching from melee attacks to magic, or from magic to healing, but that doesn't come into play until a couple hours in.But really, I came for the story to be honest. Final Fantasy games have always had very interesting stories in my eyes, even if they are sometimes predictable. The story in this game isn't...terrible, but I feel like they wasted a bit of potential. Character progression is okay, even if it does sometimes go to that cheesy, over-dramatic line. Part of the problem is, the game is so linear you only feel like an onlooker rather than part of the story, so often it's hard to become completely invested in what happens. Overall though, it's not bad. Voice acting ranges from almost bad, to pretty admirable.Now what about the PC port. In one word, pathetic. In more words, at least they tried...later on.At first the port of a sad excuse and laughable. No PC options, abysmal framerates, and forced 720p resolutions. It's the whole reason I held off buying this game on PC.Then they decided to wait until they released the second FFXIII game on PC to patch the first game. And then they have the audacity to claim that they are features. 60FPS and 1080p are not features on the PC platform. They are what many consider to be the absolute standard.But good luck keeping the game at 60FPS. While there are a couple PC graphic options, it's still pretty hilarious how little there are. You get a resolution option, an AA option, and shadow resolution. That's really it. Outside of combat, my FPS ranges from 30-60 all over the place, causing pretty bad stuttering when doing so. It's never consistent. In combat my FPS tends to stay at 60, but does drop when there are a lot of enemies. (780ti OCAMD 8350 OC16GB 2300Mhz RAM)Despite all this, do I enjoy this game at all? Yes. Even with all it's simplified mechanics and poor porting, the game has gorgeous vistas, a great soundtrack, a decent story, and the combat can occasionally be exciting and even challenging. It's also not terribly priced. It should be less due to the awful port issues, but at least they aren't trying to get $30-$50 out of us.			"

Well o wellThis is a nice game, with pro and cons.ProsGraphics are niceMusic is goodSome characters are likableInnovative combat systemJapanese voicesConsStory is dullSome characters are annoyingCombat system will likely lead to mash your X button (for random encounters at least)The leveling up system is really dumb and unsatisfayingVery linear, like running in a tunnelSometimes capped at 30 FPS !?The lack (none) of interaction with NPCs, towns etc...The camera is a pain to move/manipulateAll the time you lose by changing stances. It might not seems much, but it adds up, a lot.The shops are really awkward, same goes for the weapon's level.tl/dr: 5/10. A nice RPG with HUGE flaws. I'll try to rush it to play the sequel. Hoping it's better.			"

												Having never played this game before and only hearing about all the crap people give it. (legit crap though...see later)  I enjoy this game a lot.  Once you get past the first few areas, the combat picks up a lot and you really start to get a feel for the flawed characters, how they mesh together...or not, at times.  Back to the combat though.  Yes you control 1 character, and yes if s/he gets down'ed it's game over, but that adds to the sense of urgency in some battles that you need to control the game very carefully.  Yes there's that silly auto-battle function, but you literally will not have fun with this game at all if you just rely on that.  Paradigm shifting and having good setups is essential to winning mid-late game fights.  Yes the ""exploration"" is quite linear, but once you realize that, it makes you want to see every nook, cranny, horizon, etc. for what it is.  And some places are just plain gorgeous, nearly on par with top level pc games.  Also that linear'ness means you can't go back to any areas at all, on Cocoon at least, so find every treasure chest/orb you can.  But yeah this is a beautiful game and stop and smell the roses sometimes.  The story?  People say it's confusing or convoluted or whatnot.  ...I found it fairly simple.  You just have to pay attention to what's happening, read the bits of dialogue presented to you, don't skip the cutscenes. (lol telling this generation of gamers that is folly, i know).  Don't let your ideas of a ""perfect story"" cloud what's going on.  Listen to the character's plight, how they interact with each other and the world around them.  Let the characters grow on you.  ...Yes even Vanille, though if you use her in the party after a certain point, try to keep the volume down.  Otherwise it'll sound like you're watching an adult film.  Not sure what her voice actress was thinking in that regard.  You don't ""level up"" in a traditional sense.  You gain points every battle you use to advance on the crystarium and increase the power of your roles and characters.  The crystarium itself levels up though almost every time you face a major boss.  The enemies do respawn in some areas, so grinding is possible.  though early in the game if you want to grind you have to save/quit/load.  Your weapons and accessories gain experience through using items gained by defeating enemies or buying at the conveniently placed shop consoles.  (there are no ""town hubs"" to go to like other Final Fantasy games)  Also your HP is restored after every battle.The visuals, sound effects and music/soundtrack?  All excellent.  Areas that Square/Square-Enix never fail to deliver.  In short, i'm only halfway through the game, and I enjoy the crap out of it.  Final Fantasy 13 has a reputation for being a polarizing entry in the series.  People love it, or they hate it.  ...I'm on the side of the fence that loves it for what it is.  A charming adventure with a cast of quirky characters in a desperate situation trying to survive and get to know each other and grow as people.  ...Who happen to have super powers.  My only gripes with this game are the quality of the port.  No grapics options?  Locked to 1 resolution?  Alt-tabbing breaks some of the visual functionality and sometimes crashes the game.  I wish i could go back to visit areas.  Vanille's battle sounds reminding me of ""adult content"".  The lack of being able to get gil without farming specific enemies in specific areas for sellable items.  ...The lack of use for gil until the endgame.  The game does lose framerate in high stress/action areas, even though my pc blows a PS4's specs out of the water. (this is a playstation 3 game, so...).  Right though.  Give the game a chance.  You'll either kick yourself for not playing this fantastic game sooner, or you'll hate it.  It's fairly cheap as well, so, yeah.			"

												This game was torture to play, but I had to see it through to the end to really understand.  The most frustrating thing about it is, all of the necessary parts to have made a very passable and enjoyable Final Fantasy game are here, but any gems were sunk deep into an ocean of bad design decisions and poor storytelling.  The gameplay is a complete mess driven primarily by random luck and twitch reflexes, and the game primarily plays itself.  Battles are needlessly and frustratingly long, and because the vast majority of control and configuration are taken OUT of your hands, you don't even feel like victories are the result of your actions.  Yes, Final Fantasy games have always had battle systems where you did the same thing over and over again and very rarely needed to change your strategy up, but once you've removed even THAT gameplay, you're left with nothing.  But in ""streamlining"" away the actual gameplay, Square-Enix didn't bother to REDUCE the amount of it.  In fact, they doubled down on making all of the post-game content entirely combat based.  Well, scratch that... half combat, half WALKING.  Out of my 40+ hour save file, easily 5 hours was spent watching Lightning's butt run across meadows.  And none of that was ""exploration"", it was needless backtracking.  There's a point in the game where there's a circle of stones that give you quests.  It is a 3 minute run across an open field away from the closest fast travel point, every single one of the missions it gives you is a 20 minute run away (or 6-8 minutes with fast travel you need to run ALL the way back to), and you can only accept one of the missions at at time, and they HAVE to be set from the stones.  They'll get added to your list of missions alright, but if you want to change your active one, you have to WALK to the stone you got it from.  This game has more senseless padding than a dozen freshman term papers.  If they'd pared down the crappy gameplay and tightened this to a 20-30 hour experience, spread out the exploration instead of trying to cram an unimpressive Monster Hunter clone into the middle, and fleshed out the story and characterization more with writers instead of character designers, they could've had something to be proud of.   Instead it's an incoherent padded mess that just frustrates you with squandered potential.			"

												[+] Looks great. Battle system is fun once you\'ve fully levelled up, and have bypassed the dozens of hours of tutorials.[-] Boring. So boring. Characters were boring cardboard cutouts. Dialogue was poorly written and acted (the game was basically a long string of boring exposition through poorly-acted dialogue - I do not blame the actors, this script was bad). The world was, while beautiful, extremely dull - no interactivity, and mostly just tubes of enemies. I have zero interest in playing the two sequels because I could not care less about any aspect of this world. Just a poorly-delivered experience. Basically a terrible anime series in game form. If you like anime, you might dig this. Otherwise, stay far far away.			"

												Despite there being many shortcomings onto the port, I for one, am incredibly thankful that this game even hit PC. Sure, the technical side of things don't look so good yet, what with the frame rate problems many are having, along with the 720p lock etc, I still am having a good time on this game.With maximize performance and v-sync along with triple  buffering, this game has become very much playable (not a constant 60 fps ofc..) and very enjoyable. The visuals are extremely appealing, the story is easy to follow for those who pay attention and it's rather immersive too. I definitely enjoy the casts very much, as they each portray significant character progressions and developments, which in my honest opinion, is what makes a bunch of good characters. Definitely an enjoyable time so far, despite only playing for a little, and definitely looking forward to playing this game for the next couple of hundred hours (replay and all that, since I like it). Here's to hoping that all issues with the port itself would be resolved and the experience would be a whole lot better!			"

												I'm lucky someone gifted this to me, because if I paid more than $5 for this it would be a ripoff, there's no towns from what I played of it, and the game feels like one giant dungeon where you just keep moving foward and fighting battles, and maybe once in awhile you get a cutscene but it goes right back to moving foward and even more battles. That's Final Fantasy 13 for you, battles & cutscenes. Go buy Final Fantasy 6, 7, 8 or 9 because it's miles better than this garbage.			"

												Having felt great excitement over the news of the PC port I found myself rather dissapointed at the effort put into the final product. Having recently played another console-born game brought into the realm of PC gaming, Valkyria Chronicles, I was astonished at how badly Square Enix has adapted this game for PC. The UI in particular is a hassle (esc quits the game instantly? Seriously??? Who the ♥♥♥♥ thought that would be a sensible idea????? (also the time for them to fix this and the quality of the fix itself are rather pathetic to say the least)). Don't get me wrong, the game's fantastic and I could not recommend it more if its interface was not copy&pasted from the console versions, but in the current state I found the game rather hard to enjoy. The very fact that some talented modders have already provided 3rd party applications to resolve some of these issues clearly highlight the sad truth that currently, Square Enix is simply not very devoted in bringing this franchise to the PC.

												So I decided to buy this again since I already have PS3, and as it is now its pretty much spot on, gameplay is fluid, graphics are very nice.Anyways, im quite a big FF fan and I remember this one getting alot mixed reviews, because the older ones were all about free roaming, open world, side quests everywhere. Yeah this one is linear but it doesnt matter in my opinion, there are some open world elements later on so the entire game isnt linear but theres plenty of upgrading to do, and challenges.The story it self is quite immersive, its action right from the take off, cinematics are great, the music is great, story-wise this is a no-problems all day. The only major downside I would mention is that its over 50 GB download, but even if your new to the FF games, or want to start I would say this one is a pretty good starter.			"

Posted: October 19, 2014
												I played and loved FF 7 and 8, so I was excited to have another FF game on PC (that is more or less ""fresh""). After playing about 15 hours I am disappointed. Beginning with the positive Points:- I like the graphical style, it looks quite nice- the story seems to be engagingNow to the more negative points- The Port is locked to 720p, which is unacceptable, not even because I am a graphics-fetishist (as seen in the positives), but because it messes up my Second Screen, which I use to watch Stuff while playing (I know, you should concentrate on the game, but that way I get bored).-not a big point, but I would like buttons on screen to reflect if I'm using Keyboard or Gamepad, but the controls are easy enough, so that's not a big deal- at first, the level-up system (crystals) seems to give you more choices as to how to develop your Characters, or have a more direct control over it like in ff7 and 8, but when you start backpaddling to grind a little more points you'll soon be at the point, where you just developed everything, so there's no real choice.-right now I have 4 Characters, maybe there'll be more, but it doesn't feel like these are enough. Also, I had at no point a choice which Characters I'll pack, maybe that'll change.-leveling up weapons is as boring as can get. In FF7 you had to find or buy them, maybe do a quest or something. in FF 8 you had to find a magazine and some materials, to build them (quite similar with limit breaks), in 13 you (as far as I see it) have no limitbreaks whatsover, you find weapons somewhere in the level or just buy them at the next save point. Also every weapon can be levelled up, but you don't need specific items. You just use whatever you have, because non-usable items just give you points, and leveling up the weapon needs X points. So you don't need to search for thos items, just grind until you have enough.but the 2 big points that just puts me off:-Every level is linear. No maze, no puzzle, nothing. For now I haven't even seen some kind of world map. I don't have a real option where to go except for like 10 meters left or right, where there's usually a box with a little item. Not hidden or anything, just in a little appendage of the original path. If I wanted to watch a movie, I'd watch a movie.-The fights. I kind of miss random fights, especially when I try to develop my characters and don't want to run for through the whole level again and again, because fights are kind of sparce, but that I can look over. Most of the fights are just to easy. You have an all offensive paradigm at start, and your Characters will get rid of every opposing force in 30 seconds (sometimes less than 10). But there are some bigger fights, that just go on and on. for the most part, it doesn't seem to make much sense to actually compose your attacks manually, because the automatic choses well enough, so except for some usage of items, you choose your paradigm (depending on situation) press ""A"" repeatedly until the situation changes or the fight is over. That's not very engaging, to be fair.			"

												[ REAL REVIEW ]_____________________________________________________________I got this game for the 3rd time in my life for free this time thru Steam.Already spent 140 hours of my life on xbox 360 version to get all the achievements.Bought this game for full price day 1 waiting in line for the ps3 launch.... Am I pis.sed off... yes.. is it the broken PC Port? .... no, it could be .... i'm pis.sed beacause this game was supposed to be the new-gen call to arms. something you can enthrawl yourself in and lose yourself in the adventure.This is nothing but a B-Movie. Let's face it. Skip EVERY SINGLE cinematic and you only get,roughly 40 hours of running around narrow made maps, dodging low level, mindless AI enemies and... OH!!! you get to repeatedly tap the A button..... now that sounds like fun, doesn't it Square-Enix? Do NOT dissapoint with FF XV... please... and stop with the Part II and Part III BS...Didn't you guys learn enough already from FF X-2 ??			"

												Most people that will buy it on the pc have already played it on the xbox or ps3, i have around 100 hours on the xbox and i still love playing it, if it isnt fast enough for u turn up the speed on the menu, or play a harder difficulty, the final fantasy series sells so well because there are so many people that love to play them, they are designed to take hours to complete.the graphics could be better but it is designed for the older consoles. there are mods that improve and nfix issues, just look for them.sorry for any spelling or grammer mistakes but i am dyslexic.

The mechanics is cool when you have to change paradigm to win a match when you think it's impossible to win it.But as many already mentioned, you'll either hate it or love it.Of course the PC version is a bit twitchy and laggy and dropping frame, but all in all, it's a cool game.Pro tip: controllers make your life easier with this game ;) they did to me			"

												Good story! But a horrible game.I just can't play this all over again, it's just painful.The story is quite good, awesome cinamatics! but c'mon, this is a video game we're talking about and as a game, it's just bad.It feels like it's JUST telling me a story rather than a regular RPG with exploration and character dialogs. There's basically one space of freedom exploring, but it still isn't enough.The entire game is just a one way passage...My advice for RPG first timers, don't let this game let you have an opinion about RPG genre, Pick other FF games but not this one...This game would've been better of a movie than a painful game.

												WHERE IS THE FIELD? WHY ARE THERE NO ITEMS OUTSIDE OF BATTLE? WHY MUST I KEEP RUNNING IN STRAIGHT LINES?! I tried really, really hard to like this. This doesn't even feel like a Final Fantasy game to me, besides the minor appearance of a chocobo here or there. The only redeeming quality about this game would be the beautiful graphics, which are indeed lovely... but not enough to make up for a boring convoluted plot, bland silly stereotypical (not to mention unlikable) characters, and a battle system in which you only control one member of your party at a time while keeping the rest on Auto.In short, if you loved the old school games, you will hate this, it is soul-crushing and depressing. This is Final Fantasy basically void of everything you loved about Final Fantasy (rich story, complex/engaging characters, dreamy music, and battles that actually required you to have half a brain). excuse me now. I must go cling to my PS1 until the sobbing subsides.			"

But after spending 5 chapters running arround stuck in the same boring battles and xp system nothing seem to matter. All you do is run and fight the same monsters over and over again. It takes at least 20 battles each time to get some story feedback, and when you get it its not even relevant.The good part of the game is that it looks awesome and the animations look good. But I end up feeling like a chicken pressing the same button over and over again until the end of the battle cause it wouldn't matter what attacks you use. The battles are too hard or to easy.			"

												Just reviewing the port, not the game.  If you want to use exclusively with a gamepad, you're going to run into issues.- No way to quit the game with gamepad, well you have to go into steam overlay and exit via that (force steam to kill the game)- Using a xbox one controller will have issues.  I tried using the wireless xbox one controller and the controller would just not respond at times, mostly when at menus (save menu, main menu, etc).  Had to switch to a 360 controller.Game looks nice (for its age), story is ok, but just a terrible port.			"

Final Fantasy XIII: My New Favorite GameFinal Fantasy has been around for a while, but this is the Final Fantasy game that introduced me into the series. In my opinion, Final Fantasy XIII is an incredibly amazing game. From the storyline to the dynamic characters, from the picturesque settings to the beautifully orchestrated music, this game is an easy favorite for me. As a fan of RPGs, I've never really tried a ""JRPG"" before, but Final Fantasy XIII has shown me a new sub-genre of gaming to love. Downside(s)Only one thing I found that slightly irked me about the game is the post-game or end-game Gil (the in-game currency) and item farming to get the coveted 100% completion. It can become mundane, but I've been able to push myself through. Another common complaint I've seen online is people are upset this PC remake of the PS3/XBOX 360 doesn't use 1080p but 720p for the graphics. Personally, I don't find it a concern big enough to not buy the game. Could it look more polished up, sure, but what couldn't? It still plays well and looks stunning. Good BitsOne of my favorite things about this game is the fact that it's incredibly easy to get the hang of battling monster (which is the main game-play mechanic). As you progress, combating enemies goes from something easy-breezy to moderately challenging to downright complex. The game does an incredible job though of introducing each new character, skill, ability, and game-play mechanic in a timely fashion which makes it easy to adapt to. Some battles will literally last you six seconds while others can have a ""target time"" of 30 or more.The characters are another thing I fell in love with for this game. The cutscenes that develop the plot further with well-spoken dialogue and an amazing array of people. Along the journey of Final Fantasy XIII you'll meet people ranging from the stoic ""Lightning"" Farron to the overly optimistic Oerba dia Vanille. It's an incredible array or personalities that collide due to fate, and how they interact is beautifully done.In summary, Final Fantasy XIII is a wonderful game. It offers a challenging game-play with easy-to-use controls, scenic locations, all wrapped up with an amazing storyline.			"

												Played the game half way through on 360 a few years back and I am happy to see it here. It is a poor port, meaning they obviously ported that without bothering anybody from the original team that actually wrote the game. The result is that the game still feels as stiff as a console game with no optimization whasoever for the PC.I didn't care much about the resosultion as I knew it would be fixed sooner or later by some mod - and it did. The most frustrating part for me were the keyboard controls that can't be fully configured and there is really no excuse for that. Of course that is fixable as well by mods. But hey a 2~3rd year Computer Science major could write a decent configuration why couldn't Square Enix do it?That said it's a beautiful Final Fantasy game. For PC. For $15. Which is good enough for me. It's a solid game as it is and don't let anybody's comments distract you from getting it. Now why they couldn't bother releasing this properly for the PC from the start and make some good money is something that escapes me.			"

No input issue. 720p resolution is not considered to be any problem when playing on 41"" TV screen.Please keep in mind that this is a new game. It has a unique storytelling and game play mechanic (even though its way is linear). I accept that this is not the best game in the FF series, but it's not the worst neither.At this rate of price, of course, it's very cheap. You might consider to buy it then you will get ""another experience"" of the Final Fantasy if you can ignore the memories of FF in the past.			"

This is different final fantasy games which is have more good story and simplified battle system. The battle system are using ATB Gauge segment, you're only controlling the leader party and the rest is up to auto battle AI system. Mostly the battle system are paced on the time so you have to defeat the enemies quickly to get higher exp. Most of all I love the soundtrack of this game it's just so beautiful heared.

Pro: -Graphic/Visual- even it is a game 5 years ago. amazing.-nice/great ability effect but still cannot compete with FF8. lel- good quality Soundtrack-Cool characters design. Tetsuya Nomura punya woo..-japanese audio. -high fps. no frame skip. -fast load-interesting myths and storyline.-menus are easy to be navigate.-CP for upgrading skills is not distributed between characters.-characters' health is fully restored after each battle.-enjoying the game so far. hope will not get bored later.Cons:-Confusing plot. need to read a lot about it in menus. so chill.-no native graphic options. means that u can play with preset graphic. cant get ultra setting.-.- but the environment looks great already. -control only one character as a leader in battle. if he/she is dead, game over. sucks when 5 enemies are targeting the leader. -battle system is not so creative. people will mash on auto-battle a lot. i wish it would be more tactical. -exploration seems easier than previous FF. need more adventure >.<Jadi, sapa2 yang minat game FF tu bole la try main kat Steam.

												If you like looking at corridors, this game's for you. People complain about the linearity of FFXIII but I put it to them that most of the FF games are just as linear and that works just fine for them.If you like Final Fantasy games, you'll like this one. If you're getting in to them, I'd start at something like 10 instead (maybe the HD port will come to Steam one day!). If you don't like them, well, why are you reading this review, this game is obviously not for you. :PThe scenery is beautiful, the gameplay is fun - even on easy bosses can be quite a challenge so make sure you have the right paradigms set up so you can switch to either aggression or healing whenever you need. Vanille's voice slips all over the world in terms of accent but as a bright and cheerful character she's a ray of light in the first 15 or so hours of the game. I'm about 17 hours in to the game at time of writing and I've only just been given the ability to change my party members - since it apparently takes that long to get the party together and for most of the game you're jumping between pre-determined groups. Which is fine for plot reasons though it is really nice to actually have a say in who I'm playing as. Not expecting too much from the plot, it's certainly not 13's most redeeming quality. But it's a fun game - especially if you just want to relax - I find this is the game I turn to when I want to mostly switch my brain off. Which isn't a criticism - it's good to relax with video games and the gorgeous scenery and indeed the game's contentious linearity are absolutely perfect for that.			"

 The Game Having played every Final Fantasy game since the start of the franchise I was excited to finally play FFXIII without purchasing a console. My impressions of the game itself are mixed but positive. Character development is phenomenal and the story is engaging. I would have been happy watching the first 10 chapters (instead of playing them). The paradigm system relies significantly on switching AI profiles to manage combat. While it takes away some strategy, combat is nevertheless fast-paced and engaging.The few low points are the extreme linearity of most of the story, slow then sudden character progression, and upgrade system. For much of the game you literally walk characters down hallways. Then, quite suddently, you are thrust into an expansive overworld! Character progression is slow and boring, but eases you into many of the non-obvious game mechanics. Upgrading weapons and accessories is pointless through most of the game, then only crucial post-game (apparently...).The PortHere is why I would never recommend this game: the port is terrible. I've stuggled through 30 hours of gameplay and have can no longer tolerate the laggy and stuttering graphics. My computer exceeds the recommend requirements (AMD Phenom X4 965 and AMD Radeon 6850) but still struggles to plan the game at 720p. I have spent hours going through every possible ""fix"" to similar problems and nothing works or even improves performance. I quit.			"

												Final Fantasy XIII is quite frankly, boring. I played 45 hrs before I realised that the gameplay was unlikely to open up enough to make up for the time spent on it. I stopped playing it for several reasons:1: This game runs like a turd, with an fps that goes up and down with more vigor than your favourite pornstar, terrible issues with stuttering ( it seems to be the in thing these days ) and very few settings to change. 2: The linear maps. I went through chapter after chapter in a straight line. No joke. There was a few obstacles to ""auto-leap"" over. Seriously? Most likely you will keep moving forward, come accross a very obvious floating orb, you cant miss it, open it to find loot, move forward and face an ememy and do it again.3. No side quests, no dungeons to get lost in, little to no customization, a level up system that is a straight line and the most challenging puzzle I played ammounted to turning 4 switches on which were only guarded by enemies that I had been defeating for the last 4 hrs - that's it. There is some upgrading to weapons and accessories, but it's overly complicated and not worth the hassle. You discover weird things like a microchip, electronic this and that but what it boils down to in the end is converting it to exp to level up your weapon in microscopic ammounts. I did this for a while only to find a better weapon in those very easy to access orbs. And by the way, the orbs are the only thing that have loot besides enemies. That being said the game does have some positives. Despite the issues, the game is very pretty and the cut scenes are epic. The story line is pretty epic, though I didn't want to finish it because the gameplay ruined that aspect. I think the only reason I put up with this game for so many hours was because of the interesting story line. I think I might just watch all the cutscenes on youtube or something.The combat system is moderately fun, and there is an element of trying to figure out what moves work and don't, and learning to chain with paradigm shifts is somewhat satisfying. Unfortunately, it's all you do... all the time.I have never really played Final Fantasy before, so unfortunately, this seems like a bad place to start. I'm not sure I can handle the graphics of Final Fantasy 7. So I guess I'll wait till 15 comes out.4/10 - + Great story, awesome cutscenes            - Performance issues, linear gameplay, a combat system that grows boring, no japanese?!.			"

												Did they even consider PC user when they released this game? The controls are extremely awkward for PC gamers. For example, I keep pressing the esc key naturally to open the menu but it SHUTS DOWN the game immediately. I haven't even played enough to comment on the game itself, but the graphics are nice as expected of FF. The battle system is strange compared to the traditional system of FF. Overall, I wish I could get past the awkwardness to play the game, but I cannot motivate myself to.			"

												NOTE: These are strictly my first impressions. I've played the game partway through Chapter 2, and had low expectations.This game is... Not as bad as people make it out to be. The music is godly thanks to Uematsu, the combat mechanics are solid, and the story... Well, that's my one problem so far. It's a case of ""let's use all these phrases, then only explain them once they're right in front of our faces,"" rather than previous FFs where you hear rumors and such, explaining what things are. Oh, and Hope is the most punchable character in writing.			"

												Let me get the good out of the way: Beautiful graphics, lovely environments and great character designs.OK, so I've played every FF from 1 to 10, plus Tactics and Mystic Quest. This one by far is the most boring one I've played. It's extremely linear, and the battles an absolute bore. You have these things called paradigms that are supposed to be used strategically to build gauges, take advantage of enemy weaknesses and heal your team. You're supposed to switch between them depending on the flow of battle. Wel I'm sorry this adds no strategy to the battles. Now apparently the game gets a littel more open ended around chapter 11(?) but I'm thirty hours in and I can't even bear to make it to that point. And don't get me started on the story. it's the most convulted mess I've ever had to try and follow.Sorry if I hurt any feelings but it literally has me dozing off in my chair.			"

												Enter Captain Excellence, some punk kid from the streets (suburbs) of the hood (central Virginia) who grows up playing masterpieces like Final Fantasy X. ""Final Fantasy XIII!

Man, I must love the next installment in this legendary series!""♥♥♥♥ me running, man. This♥♥♥♥♥♥was atrocious. If this game (or developers of this mutant abortion) was (were) on fire, I wouldn't waste a squirt of anthrax juice to put it (them) out. There are no towns, no shops, and sure as♥♥♥♥♥♥stinks, no open world. You get a linear map with puzzles/obstacles that could only stump a 3-year-old with a pitchfork impaled through his frontal lobe. You get a mediocre story that shoehorns poorly developed characters into a team that fails to display anything other than overused and cliche personality interaction scenarios. And then you get a battle system that is also GROSSLY OVERRATED, as it was designed to have ONE DEFINITIVE BEST STRATEGY. Seriously, every battle gives you limited options, and figuring out the best way to stay alive is not hard, as you can read the battle mechanics like a book. It's not turn based, but your characters can't move on the battlefield. Nay, you tell them what they should kind-of somewhat sort-of consider if they're, like, not mad at you or anything. And then they go do it, leaving you unfulfilled like it was your first time in the sack (hey, six seconds on a bull ain't bad, right?).Seriously, do yourself a favor. Don't buy this garbage. Instead, steal a physical copy, send it to the incinerator, take the incinerator residue, put it on a rocket, and send it to the ♥♥♥♥ing sun. Squeenix, everyone gets a mulligan.

												First for those that HAVE played the game before, the game is 60gb of awful as a straight port.  That said, the game looks amazing with the Durante fix that I'm sure you can find easily by googling.  FPS suffers a bit but not much with the patch, but does drop every now and then, but not enough to ruin the experience (for me at least).   Also, just to put this out there, the alt-tab issue is fixed with the patch, the steam overlay seems to slow down significantly, and hitting escape will still exit the game immediately.For those that HAVEN'T played the game before, DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN RPG.  Exploration is near non-existent, you have only a slight choice in building your characters, and during the 'tutorial' that lasts what seems like half the game, you don't even have control over your party as a whole.  There's only slight differences in the stats and abilities of all characters that you will have control over once everyone is fully built.  On the good side, however, i really enjoy the music and gameplay.   This is one of my favorite FF piano soundtracks, and even though it's not a true RPG, the gameplay is fast paced and does require a small degree of strategy (a little more so on the 'bosses').  The graphics deserve special mention as they are amazing.  Once again, you realy need the fix because the default steam version looks AWFUL compared to even the xbox's version.  And the story... oh the story... It has so much potential and is just a convoluted mess.   And don't get me started on the characters.  This may be a shoo-in for having at least some of the most shallow FF characters of all time, and easily has one of the most annoying.  So do I recommend it? Yep.  Just make sure you know what you're getting yourself into though!			"

												I tired my hardest to make it through this game again after giving up on it on the ps3, I made it just as far and just couldn't do it. It's too linear for a Final Fantasy game, having one chapter to explore near the end of the game is just unacceptable. The game also makes a huge focus on CGi and story like it was the second coming of christ, All Previous games have their cutscene moments, Having them all bunched together one after another is just daunting. Fortunately they are skippable, however this fact alone makes the base player-reward-system(A.K.A Check Points) in a large game undeserved.Having these two major flaws is what turns me away from this game yes there are chapters as check points, however your focus on skipping long cutscenes in order to play the game makes those chapters at times unnoticable.I can't recommend this game to anybody, Too long in development, Too many cutscenes, not enough gameplay.

												Played and beat this game on the ps3 a couple years back. I love the final fantasy series and this one is no exception. Loved it but not my favorite. This game has a very good battle system IMO. How it works is, you only control the leader of the part and the other two are on auto battle set by the setting that is chosen in the paradign. If you like fast paced turn based battles this game is for you. The game has a lot of cutscenes and boss battles. The story is not that great, but there are tons of battles. There is no puzzles to solve or any of that nature. My system is a I7 3770K, 8gb ddr3, and gtx670. The game runs just fine with ocassional frame drops. This game is only 720p, yes its a bummer, but it looks fine. There is a way to increase internal resolution, but not the fullscreen resolution.Overall a good buy and will be buying final fantasy xiii-2 and lightning returns when it comes out for PC.  I have not played xiii-2 or lightning returns yet.			"

												I play this game because it looks interesting. Im also curious from all negative reviews. Pros:I am fine with linear story and ""corridor"" somewhat simulator. Artstyle is really good, very FF just as expected. Battle system is really fun and fast paced. Characters not really interesting but still nice to look and hear at, especially with Japanese dub. The English dub is also good, but i prefer Japanese.PC port performance is not bad. At 1080p, set shadow and AA to lowest, games run fine with few stutter in weird places (not always in battle where lots of effect taking place).Cons:Story is too much, i don't even know even after reading those dialog-dictionary-something and read wikia. I dont care anymore. This is a let down. But the most biggest let down is the way you handle your party. From what i read around; You keep changing party until end game. Yes, you will ""regain control"" of your party in chapter 10. This game have 13 chapters. Have fun playing character that you dont like until then. People said 25hours in to the game is tutorial. And then thats where the fun start. 25hours? Thats just to long. I am now in chapter 7 and i can't/won't continue to beat this game. I really want to like this game but i can't.Other sequel like FF13-2 and LR:FF13 do not interest me anymore. Hope FF15 will redeem this franchise glory. Hope...ahhh Hope! you mopey boy!			"

												This game is not the best final fantasy game i have played. When i was 9 i started to play the first one and it stays my favorite. However, Final Fantasy XIII (13) is stilll a very great enjoyable game. At first, it may seem fairly linear and the combat maybe too easy but, it gets more complex and harder as your progress. Many pople say that Final Fantasy 13 is the worst final fantasy there is. I cannot say if this is true or not since i have only played these 2 games. But i believe this game is a good start for the series. Each one of the games have a DIFFERENT story so there is no need to play any of the other games to understand its story. Talking about this story this game has an amazing story line. It is filled with action, robots, and amazing pre-rendered cut scenes. I would give it a 8.5-9.0/10. If you are not a very hard core final fantasy fan then this is a great game for you to play.			"

												I love the early Final Fantasy series (1-9 in particular).  I have to admit that this is my first one since playing 11, but I was excited to get back into the series.  Needles to say, this game was a huge disappointmeant for me.  Boring story and characters that you don't care for at all.  It is extremely linear as well.  You get a 10 minutes cutscene and then get to control your character, run straight forward, and fight a few battles and then another 10 minutes cutscene.  The combat, which FF is known for some strategy, has turned into fast paced button mashing where you don't even have to think, but can just hit auto-battle and the computer does it all for you.  The camera is also horrible, but you do get used to it.  I tried and tried to give it a chance, but after putting a good 4 hrs in and then looking at some other reviews which revealed that it doesn't get any better until the end of the game, I decided to shelf it.  It was a chore to play, not fun at all.  Based on this game, I would not support the other two in the trilogy.  I would only recommend this for the most die hard FF fan.  I would not recommend this for a normal fan of the series or someone who enjoys the genre.  I felt like I was watching a really bad movie where I got to push go every once in a while.			"

The design and atmosphere of both shining utopian world of Cocoon and wild, dangerous and abandoned Gran Pulse is just so original, you will never know where to look first. Although the visual side of the game was apparently top priority for developers, all of the other aspects are not so bad as people like to claim. All of the characters have their own motivations and troubles, and even though i didn't enjoy unfolding their stories as much as i did in Final Fantasy VII, or Final Fantasy IX, it was in no way boring. From very start of the game, you must forget about how our world works and patiently absorb the atmosphere and working of Fabula Nova Crystalis universe. There is no explanatory intro and you are thrown into conflict between two sides you don't know, in place you don't recognize on a planet which is apparently freaking inverted (reminded me of standing on the inside of Halo ring). It comes slowly and I spent a LOT of time browsing through ""datalog"" (kind of in-game encyclopedia and journal) so the mild feeling of confusion is something you should expect from the beginning. I personally enjoyed the slow exploration of this strange sci-fi, fantasy, mythical world however.The combat in XIII is an interesting mix of direct action (your character) and indirect role selecting (two other characters in your party) which makes for a lot of ways to play. Just look at youtube and you will find that everyone uses quite different team compositions. Generally the combat is fast, stylish and definitely feels like Final Fantasy type, although you won't feel so much of control over the exact actions of characters, as you did in past games. Too bad the character development is kind of straightforward one (at least until over half of the game) and sometimes i felt like a machine putting experience points (""Crystogen Points"" or ""CP"" in-game) into the skills and attributes chained one after another with a little choice which one to prefer of leave behind. For example, for a mage caracter Hope, even if you want to max preferably ""magic"" attribute, you sometimes have to ""waste"" a lot of CP into strength attribute, even when you know you won't use it, just to get to those ""magic"" ones.I finished the game recently and the beautiful EPIC finale left me with no doubts about quality of this game however. Even though its sometimes more of a movie, than a game, its still a must for every fan of series and I would recommend it to every other player, who likes rpgs with strong story, fast action and japanese sci-fi world filled with strange but beautiful magic and myths.I personally had no trouble with graphics or other port issues as some people mentioned.

												Okay, people are not finding my one line review helpfull, I guess I have to edit it.This game is a horrible parody on everything that made FF series good.I was literally dying inside every second I played it.It's like you want to look at the photos of the cute kittens and puppies, but instead someone is R.A.P.I.N.G. them and forcing you to watch.Why this entire ♥♥♥♥ing game is a straight line where you cant make a single step away for HOURS? Why all the combat consists of only three (3) options, namely strike, heal and strike twice? Is this some kind of joke? Why there are no items and stats? Why enemies are not giving you nether exp no money?Why Hope's mother says ""Moms are tough"" three times in a row? Are we 8 year old?IGN, I'm looking to you, you gave this game 8.9 and at the same time criticize Life is Strange for bad writing. Or that guy is complayning that his gun is heavy and he is YAWNING? While people are dying around him?Vanille, you are standing in a pile of bloody corpses and you are LAUGHING? Seriously? People are ♥♥♥♥ing dying around of you, and you finding this fun?What the ♥♥♥♥ is this? How can we feel even some degree of emotion toward a characters who look like a bunch of cosplayers playing paitball and speeking in generic cliche phrases?What the heck is going on with the game, why so many posititve reviews? Has the world went mad? I may understand that some people never played a single FF game so they don't have a perspective, but that game is plainly bad, broken, and absolutely unredeemable from any point of view. I dont even know.			"

												It's definetly hard to be concise on such a controversial game, it's basically split, a lot of people like it, a lot of people hate it, I'd say I'm somewhere in the middle, but I think it's at least worth a shot. So here are my thoughts on Final Fantasy XIII, I think this will be a bit long, but I'll keep it spoiler free so you shouldn't worry about that. Also for those wondering about the PC port specifically it's gonna be in the last few paragraphs.>> STORY AND PRESENTATION <<The presentation is absolutely gourgeous, there are some great looking enviroments and the music is really good aswell with some really iconic tracks that you'll probably remember even after you play the game. The story is definetly huge, about 40-70 hours long depending on your playstyle and some people may find it complex, but you can really pick up easily, it's only a bit confusing in the start but if you're paying attention and reading the Data Logs which were surprisingly nice to read and explain / sets up and foreshadows some things really well you should be just fine.I think the problem here for most people are the characters, they really have some uhm... Quirks I suppose that people might not enjoy, like Vanille for instance, I can definetly see her not appealing to a western audience just by the way she speaks, and in combination with Hope's mopeyness it can get annoying, I will say that I think I have a higher tolerance for that sorta stuff, but it builds into some great moments for these two characters in the middle of the game and you can really see how these characters develop. The rest of the group is fine in my opinion, however I think Lighning needed more development... I am trying to avoid spoilers here but I'll say that a bit past the midway point of the game the story starts falling apart a bit, like an issue that a character already went through and grew upon is brought back and it seems like it's a step backwards and just repeating the same thing again but with much less effect, and the whole overarching goal is kinda lost, so the characters are just wandering around doing whatever, which doesn't help it one bit, but then the goal's randomly back, so it definetly seems like this point in between that, having no goal, is just to pad out the game's length more than anything, this arc I'm talking about here is about Chapter 10 and 11, they definetly could've been handled better, and honestly because of them they sorta set the game up for a trainwreck, which could've been fixed mind you in Chapter 12 and 13, the last chapters, but the ending is just really bad. Remember what I said about the Data Logs before and how they were good at explaining and setting things up? Yeah well the end chapter completely forgot that and it seems to just make stuff up as it goes along, manufacturing the most convoluted and unescessary plot holes in the game, plus they went for the generic happy / everything's alright ending but they handled it very poorly and left a lot of unexplained stuff. I think overall the journey IS worth it, but I think the last chapters will leave you a bit dissapointed because of what it could've been.>> GAME MECHANICS <<On the mechanical side of things the combat is a bit simplifyed, It's turn based but you can basically use the ""auto-battle"" button throughout the entire game and not put that much thought into it, the most that you'll do is just switch to a healing role when you need it every now and then with the paradigm system but that's about it, there is some optional content which is much harder though, so you could go for that if you're looking for a challenge.There's no level up system for your characters on this game, all you have is a linear upgrade web which uses points you earn by winning battles, but you can level up your equipment with materials you drop from monsters or buy from the shop, it's kind of a bad system in my opinion because you have to commit to one specific weapon just because of the sheer cost of upgrading, and there's no way to know that ""X"" sword is better when upgraded than ""Y"" sword, so you can end up wasting it and having an inferiour weapon, some people don't like it but I'd definetly say to just check out the wiki on this for optmal stuff, but you really shouldn't have to which is a problem.The game is very linear, you just have one path for most of the game, there are some very small detours to get collectables but that's about it, the game opens up in Chapter 11, providing some side missions but sadly they just feel like busywork, it's just ""Go to A and kill this monster"" and you can't accept multiple missions at the same time so there's a LOT of running around, I did them all for completion's sake but I honestly recommend you just skip them and move on with the story, in which the game becomes linear again in Chapter 12>> PC PORT <<I've bought this game a few months after launch and from what I've seen of release day it's definetly improved quite a bit, it's definetly playable now and you can change the resolution, anti aliasing and shadow resolution now too without using a 3rd party software, there's not a whole lot of customization but it worksI will say I experienced some frame drops in some areas of the game due to poor optimization and I hope it gets fixed with more patches, but it's not THAT frequent, and the majority of the game will run fine at 60 fpsThe controls are fine because it's basically all menus, and the camera in the game is pretty good for the most part>> CONCLUSION <<From what I've said here you probably expect me to not recommend it and say that I hate this game, but for some weird reason despite all the flaws I found it very compelling, I don't know how to explain it exactly but I just wanted to play more and see how the story unfolded, it was interesting enough and the Data Logs were really interesting to read, also putting points into the crystarium felt satisfying somehow, plus even though it's simpler I still enjoyed the combat system, and there are some really challenging optional fights that you can go through that I found quite fun to beat.In the end I just wanted more and more, and I think that's the reason I did all 64 side missions like a crazy maniac, hell I didn't even know you could go back and do them after you finished the game, so I did them all with an underpowered team, but it was really cool trying to find loopholes or strategies to beat these really hard enemies, some of which I shouldn't even really be fighting, and the soundtrack really helped make the experience that much better, and even though I didn't really like the final chapters I still felt satisfied with the journey overall and ended up wanting even more, I mean I'll even pick up the sequel and play that aswell because of this gameSo to summarise... Final Fantasy XIII is not a masterpiece, but there's a LOT of content here, enough to keep you playing for at least 40 hours or even more than that, I genuelly think people should give this one at least a chance, grab it on sale if you're unsure about it, it'll probably be 75% off next time which will be very cheap, I think it's a compelling enough game that you'll end up enjoying at least on some level, but if you're really put off by the characters you will have a bad time, ultimately I think it's all about your level of tolerance for that kind of stuff or if you have any at all			"

												You walk in a straight line, get into a fight because they're all impossible to avoid, and then choose the ""auto attack"" option for the one character you actually control. Sometimes you watch dumb cutscenes. Plus the UI sucks. It's a bad port of a bad game.			"

												Characters - 7/10Great mythology behind Vanille & Fang.  No char development in late-stage for the others.Environment & Graphics - 9/10Immersive worlds & in-game graphics.  Smooth for me, but maybe I have a good PC.Gameplay - 4/10Maps are very linear.  Thought it suits a complex story that might unravel if I roam and deviate often. 1 or 2 maps were unfinished with a lot of secondary paths with no treasures or monsters.  The battles are much simplified now.  Some battles are over with just pushing the X button 6 times or so, no joke! The hard battles are more fun and involving.Story - 1/10A lot of 'deus ex machina' especially in the ending.  No, you're NOT supposed to know why the the chars turned back from l'cieth into humans at the end.  They haven't fulfilled any focus then (either destroying Orphan / saving Cocoon).  Another example is Cid Raines helping & training the chars under the order of Barthandelus (main antagonist) to make them stronger ... as a team!!  Defeats the purpose of having a SINGLE ragnarok.At the end, I still don't know if the 'focus' was to destroy Cocoon (completely covered with magma, before turned into ice) or save Cocoon (humans and creatures were evac'ed into the much larger Pulse world).Conclusion - 5/10This is a game like the Transformation movies.  Top-notch visuals & slick presentation, but cheesy emotions (cringe-worthy in the final against the story bosses).  Coupled with a bland pop song 'My Hands' by Leona Whois.Huge budget and talents poured into FF13, yet soulless.  Especially compared with the giants in the Final Fantasy series.			"

												Final Fantasy XIII, what is left to say about this game that hasn't been said already? Plenty, actually. This game is by no means a flawless game, it is not the best game in the franchise, it represents change and risk; something we gamers fear even when we demand it. Final Fantasy always changes, if they game a good game or a bad game you can be damned sure they're not going to make it twice, the beautiful thing about Final Fantasy is that if you don't like this year's version you can always look forward to the next one which you can be sure will be 100% different in mechanics, story and writing.GAMEPLAYThe game starts off like an empty bag waiting to be filled, or maybe a tree waiting for the rain. They give you almost nothing. But slowly after the first major plot point in the game they feed you the combat system piece by piece, a strange mixture of the classic ATB, Final Fantasy X's spheregrid leveling and finally a touch of Final Fantasy XII's Gambit system. In Final Fantasy XIII you control only one character but you can change the AI behavior of your allies making them tank, heal or set you up for devistating staggers and chains. The combat has you thinking ahead on the fastest way to defeat your enemies and which paradigms you should switch to inorder to accomplish these means. Having your allies set up staggers and then watching your team tear enemies apart with bonus damage and chain attacks is incredibly fun and rewarding. The better you do in each battle the more Crystal Points you are given, which means you can level up your characters faster and further. Don't be contempt on letting the Auto-Battle AI do everything for you, Final Fantasy XIII's combat is deep but only if you let it.STORYBy far my favorite story in any Final Fantasy game, but each to their own.CHARACTERSThanks to the incredible voice acting and incredible animations the characters come to life like no other Final Fantasy before. The characters themselves are very human, very flawed and all have their own personal agenda and concerns with what's happening to them. Don't be fooled into thinking Lighting is the main character of the story, each character gets almost equal development and you'll play as every one of them at some point or another.Oh, and Hope stops being a whiny little ♥♥♥♥♥ after a certain point. You'll probably hate him the most, so I'll just leave that word of 'hope' for anyone wanting to punch him in the face for crying over his mother so much.EXECUTIONWhile I might personally love the game, I have to admit that there are things it does wrong. Plenty. The worst offender is the execution of the core ideas. The problem with Final Fantasy is they hand you the game but don't hand you any meaningful gameplay until chapter three. You have to sit though two hours of the game for it to finally begin and get good and that is a serious problem. While it might take longer for older Final Fantasy titles to click with you at the very least they don't limit you to a linear hallway and a single attack for the first two hours of the experience. This makes the game hard to get into and leave the player little reason to come back. If you're like me you probably play the game an hour at a time. Anyone who spends two days playing this on and off is probably going to get more invested in their other games over Final Fantasy XIII and by the time they finally muster into Chapter Three they'll probably forget all the momentum of the story or forget how good it feels to finally be able to do something with the combat system.

												Review after update:I played this game on the console a while ago.  I was kinda disappointed when it first got ported to the PC.  I have a high-end PC and was expecting some improvements.  I searched some forums and put in my complaints - for once SE listened.  I waited to play this until the DEC 11th update and I am very pleased.  On max settings, the PC version of this game makes the best console version look like the original Mario...almost no exageration.  I can't say enough good things about how it looks.  They made many improvements and it all flows great.  Although my PC is high-end (to me anyway), it isn't a $2k beast.  I run a 4770k with a gtx770 and I get no lag on max settings.  It only uses 1 core that I can see, so even if you have an i5 it shouldn't make a difference.If you haven't played it - the game was a great addition to the Final Fantasy series.  Everyone has their favorites, mine were FF9 and FF10, but this wasn't a disappointment by any means.  Unlike most Final Fantasys, this game rushes into the story and uses language that will take some getting used to.  It won't take long for you to catch up.  I'd say within a few hours into the game I knew what was going on.  Another few hours later you can't stop playing.  Worth grabbing it on the PC whether you've already played through it or not.  Hope this helps.			"

												The port's keeping better and better. But I just used the GeDoSaTo tool ever since it supported FF XIII. I was biased through my catastrophical experience with FF X (... you where suposed to be the chosen one!!! D:) and so I skipped every FF for 12 1/2 years. I read about the hate upon FF XIII and giggled. But now I felt the urge to try it for myself - especially after seeing how damn nice it looks with the GeDoSaTo tool. And what can I say? Love isn't the correct word. But I have a great time. Despised from the very anime'ish style of storytelling and art design it's a nice game. Sure, story is weird and I still don't get everything in it, but somehow the game manages to keep my driving more and more deeply into the story. And to develop something like feelings for the characters. Something, which I didn't felt like FF VIII. Don't get me wrong: As a FF VI (or in US FF III) veteran I am still very disappointed. But I made my peace in the fact, that there wasn't any real FF after VII or maybe VIII, too. Also I am not into Anime anymore. But still ... besides of all those Anime'ish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in storytelling, animation, movement and so on ... I am getting entertained very, very well. And so - half through the story, I already convinced myself to get XIII-2, too. And also Lightnings Return, if XIII-2 can keep entertaining me, too. But from everything I heard about it, I am pretty sure it will do the job.What great time to have ... enjoying a title which states Final Fantasy! Even when the series died after VII or VIII ;)			"

												I don't understand how this game can have such a high amount of negative ratings. The story: 9/10I really enjoyed this one, even though it can't compete with the story of FFX. Yes, the game is linear and yes, it's not anywhere near of other FF titles in terms of open world. But there is a nice set of different characters that go through different situations simultaneously and deal with the problems that occur throughout the game in different ways, which I found very interesting to follow. But there were some parts, were you simply jump from one cut scene to another without doing anything which felt a bit... sluggish? Game mechanics: 7/10Only one character can be controlled In-battle. Most of the time it's simply pressing auto attack and that's it. What made it dynamic was the whole thing around the paradigm shifts and that you need to adapt you're strategy due to sudden  changes in the enemies attack patterns (even tough they are mostly 100% predictable). Environment: 10/10Fantastic.Enemies: 7/10I was a bit disappointed when I discovered that most of the difficult mission bosses did exactly look like the normal enemies that you encounter all the time. I was hoping to see some badass looking Ultima weapon like enemies instead of killing the same imps over and over. On the other hand, the story bosses are well made and quite challenging. Overall, I really recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the series. I am and I am totally satisfied with FFXIII.			"

												Two words I would use to describe this game: linear and grindy. I'm a fan of the FF series, but more specifically 6-9. After a break from JRPGs, I decided to give FF13 a try. The first about 20 hours consist of you running down a linear path. All this time I wondered when I would get to a town or some kind of hub, some place where you can interact with the characters and people in the world - but there are none of those. What made it worse is that through out this journey, you have to watch the characters stumble about and listen to a dozen motivational talks, since the cycle of hopelessness and renewed hope seems to repeat itself. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I found myself thinking: ""Didn't we just go through a motivational talk, now you're really upset again? Why?"" The setting and lore for the game seemed really interesting, but the execution was terrible. The flashbacks were particulary the worse, they felt insignificant and failed to draw any kind of emotion from me (besides boredom). I really had to push myself to complete the game. At one point you reach a large open area, which is refreshing at first. But then I realized that there isn't much depth to it, besides grinding and making your characters stronger. I know some people enjoy mastery and combat challenges, and if you are one of these people, maybe you would like FF13. The game is also very pretty - but that's something I think that newer FF games are: beautiful graphics, but at the cost of depth and gameplay freedom. The last negative is that if you're in Asia, you're stuck with Japanese audio. It's not a huge problem, but I would have liked to understand the battle comments the characters made...as well as have that choice to pick English audio. So, if you're someone that's looking for a world that can fascinate and intrigue you, non-linear story and gameplay, you're better off looking somewhere else.			"

												When other reviews said that this game was linear, I didn't realize they meant LITERALLY LINEAR. I played for an hour, and I have yet to turn left or right. The game is literally a series of straight lines interupted by boring combat (press A to win) and cutscenes that transition you to the next straight line map section.			"

While it might take longer for older Final Fantasy titles to click with you at the very least they don't limit you to a linear hallway and a single attack for the first two hours of the experience. This makes the game hard to get into and leave the player little reason to come back. If you're like me you probably play the game an hour at a time. Anyone who spends two days playing this on and off is probably going to get more invested in their other games over Final Fantasy XIII and by the time they finally muster into Chapter Three they'll probably forget all the momentum of the story or forget how good it feels to finally be able to do something with the combat system.

												You walk in a straight line, get into a fight because they're all impossible to avoid, and then choose the ""auto attack"" option for the one character you actually control. Sometimes you watch dumb cutscenes. Plus the UI sucks. It's a bad port of a bad game.			"

												Let's get this straight:People complain this is a linera game. and yes for the first 20 hours of the game (about the halfway point) it is. The game holds your hand to learn the mechanics of fighting until you've mastered it. Then suddenly you're overwhelmed with places to explore and quests to take.So if you're not gonna sink in the hours past the halfway point, you may find a dissatisfactory experience. If you do play past the halfway point (chapter 11), you'll love it. The lore is incredibly vast and complex. If beautiful CG cutscenes and standard in game cutscenes aren't enough the lore you can read in the databook is amazing! Probably takes a couple hours to get through. Voice acting is fine (vanhille is borderline cringe worthy but that's it). Combat is reptitive, but challenging. If you're not fighting at 90% efficiency or higher on boss fights and difficult enemies, you will likely lose.			"

												An impressive and lenghty fantasy-dystopian semi-realtime JRPG with an interesting story, some nice characters and great lore.The (up until halfway through and near the end) lack of free exploration is criticized by some, but that's actually one of the strengths of this game. The story, drama and lore is rather strong for guiding down the player an often narrow path. More open RPGs would lose themselves in trivialities instead. Those who feel dulled and aimless in let's say Skyrim will feel much better with a game such as FFXIII. People who may have been used to different ways in previous FF installments could see this as a disappointment, but those who understand the value of this design will know to appreciate it.Sometimes things get very cheesy though with the characters more often than once - despite being in a hurry to merely save an entire planet - babbling (after overcoming initial conflicts and misunderstandings) about their wonderful friendships and lecturing the player on equally cheesy life themes like to take responsibility and to trust others and yourself and whatnot. I read some compare the characters to Shonen fighting anime which is funny but has some truth to it: They have their interesting sides but also some looks, habits or thoughts which can feel artificial or forced for the sake of drama or conflict or to highlight certain points they make for those players who perhaps wouldn't get it if it were more subtle. I couldn't resist rolling my eyes at times or thinking ""Yeah, yeah, I know, get on with it.""The fighting system is interesting. I think I still prefer traditional round-based JRPGs over this semi-realtime thing but it's fun nevertheless. On my difficulty setting - ""Easy"" - I could for many parts basically keep pushing the ""auto-attack"" button and let the A.I. decide what attacks to use while certain other enemies and bosses fell out of line and actually required me to use my own brains. Shifting the paradigms back and forth - skill presets used by the A.I. defining the role of your three combatants in the field (like tank, healer, buffer, damage-dealer), pounding the enemies with magic to ""stagger"" them (putting them into a specifically vulnerable state) and then do regular high-damage attacks to finish them off is a fun pattern to follow even if it can feel messy at times.What has it's good and bad is how the roles play out in conjunction with the personalities of the characters and their individual stories, and how the combat situations are designed alongside. For like the first half of the game you have up to two or three characters out of 7 or so go different story paths, meet different enemies and have different paradigms (roles) for them to choose from at a time. The strong confident character X has a guardian and damage-dealer role at first, the shy and indecisive boy is about magical buffing and staggering, the little cheerful shamanic girl can do healing and staggering and so on. As the story progresse more characters find their way into your party pool and more roles unlock until the very end when everyone can have all roles, even atypical ones, at the cost of increased XP points needed to level up the corresponding skill trees.However this role-play also makes things a little predictable. For all the drama along the way one can tell that the characters eventually will have to group up towards the end in order for it all to make sense, to have these mechanics unlock their full potential. This is where the otherwise great story and immersion themselves are staggering a little.The leveling and crafting sometimes feels a little dumb and like eye-candy. Per paradigm (combat role) each character has this huge tree of mostly passive stats and some active skills to go through but it could very well be displayed in a more simplified way instead and as such is a bit artificially glorified like it is in Path of Exile or Child of Light.The crafting is minimalistic. You level up gear by infusing (?) raw components into it gained from mobs or bought through equally minimalistically presented ""online"" shops. Different components eventually give the item an XP boost when infusing (which I never understood, looked all rather random to me). You level stuff up until it can't go any higher and then keep the item or (which only works for some it seems) transform it into a higher-tier version which can be leveled further again. It's very unspectacular, just a bar filling and some names and values changing. Weapons do look differently when wielded by the characters in combat but sadly you can't properly examine the weapon models and some paradigms (magical ones) have your fighters use their bare hands and not their tools of trade. I never really became much interested in the crafting, I basically started with it only halfway through in the hopes that some bosses wouldn't be as tough to beat. Completionists and those who want to flesh out their characters fully may dabble with it more.			"

												First of all, if you're a final fantasy nostalgia fanboy/purist who keeps saying blah blah this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥its not turn-based, not that open world, blah blah never gonna be the same again. then i wouldnt go for this gamebut if you're like me who played lots of final fantasies before (though im not saying that it's a requirement to play other final fantasies if you want this game) and is also extremely open-minded and not a judgmental ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, then i would really suggest playing this game :) Things to do when wanting to buy a game.-Like the art/design of the game? then buy it-DON'T listen to other's opinions and thoughts about this game, specially if they're the ones who tend to hate a lot of things and are close-minded-IT is more fun to not think about what others are saying and just experience the game for yourself, you may be even surprised with the experience you will get :)-soak it all in, don't stress, have fun :)This game was a blast to play! and i'm still not even close to finishing it, the story is amazing! characters, i love 'em all! i've played lots of final fantasies before and i really dont get why people tend to hate on this game, they're just harsh and close minded, yes the combat is different which is a good thing. unlike other final fantasies before, you CAN'T break the game with the combat for example in the other FF's before this, you just get the ultimate weapon and then spam attack dealing 99999 damage, which is no fun and utterly boring, the combat in this game is so satisfying everytime you get a victory because it really requires strategy and knowing what to do with your characters roles, plus the paradigm shifting during the battles are fun to master and to experiment with. YES this game is not perfect, there are some flaws, but there is more good things than bad things, MOST FF fans just dont see that because they're too stuck in nostalgia who thinks every final fantasy above X is♥♥♥♥♥♥if you're a RPG/JRPG fan that's looking for a great story, soundtrack, sceneries, characters, fun and enganging combat system, open minded and not a judgmental prick like most people then i would really love to recommend this game to you. if you dont get the story right away, just hold on, things will open up, and you can even look and read at the datalogs to understand it a bit more, because it is such a great story and i really would like everyone to experience the same thing that i had when i was playing this for the first time, i even shed a tear in an intense moment in chapter 8 cause its just so great, anyway im still not finished playing this game, and im still working my way up getting the ultimate weapons and upgrading my characters. so have a good day :DAs Lightning Farron (main protagonist ffxiii) said in game, its not a question of can or can't there are some things in life you just DO... in this case, just DO it, just play the game, its great, trust me :)			"

GraphicsA lot of people seems to hate this game because of the graphics issue. Yes, I agree that the resolution issue is the most annoying thing happened right now, considering most of us already using 1080p or multi monitor setup. But really, apart from the resolution issue, the game's actually pretty good. Even without the graphic settings, The visual is decent enough.ESC key instantly exit the game sounds ridiculous, but I don't think it's a big issue, unless you keep forgetting and accidentally pressing the ESC key before reaching save point.Durante's mod is really a saver. I can enjoy the game is 1080p, but really, what a shame for Square Enix if they don't bother to fix this themselves.Gameplay it's good enough for me. The mechanics seems to keep expanding as the story progress, which is good, to prevent us from starting to get bored with the combat system.SoundsI'm playing the Asian version, so I only have the Japanese audio. Love the sounds of the characters. The subtitles are not really good though. Sometimes the timing's off, other times, what the character says and the subs meaning is quite different, so it's better to play without it. Seems they only put the English audio script for subtitles instead subbing the Japanese audio.The music are masterpiece. I really enjoyed listening to all of them.VerdictAt this moment, I won't recommend the game IF you're the guy that thinking graphics is very important. No, it's better for you to skip this game or wait until it goes on sale before biting it.But if graphics is not really an issue for you, I'd recommend you to play this game.Sadly, I don't think I'm gonna instant buy FFXIII-2 and Lightning Returns when they're on store, since Square Enix seems to not giving any effort with this port. I'll just wait for heavy discount before grabbing them.			"

												So you will read mixed reviews on this title, and complaints about thin story and it running poorly. Disregard those reviews. FFXIII has quickly become one of my favorites of the series. I first started playing Final Fantasy with the original on the NES. I got it two days after launch, brand new, from the rack at our local walmart. Me and my mom (who also enjoyed RPGs) got it on a whim because the coverart looked really rad. We were pleasantly surprised by an amazing game, and have played the franchise ever since. This game's story is involving, evolving, and deep. You will get attached to the characters before you know it, and will start having emotional responses to the trials they encounter. The gameplay IS a bit linear, but if you have been playing Final Fantasy long, you will be accustomed to that and it will not feel odd. This is not World of Warcraft, this is not Final Fantasy XIV ARR. This is a single-player Final Fantasy title that lives up to it's namesake. The music is moving, and me and my wife have since downloaded the soundtracks for this, and the next two titles. We have gotten real-world merchandise from the game, and have become involved in the canon about the characters. So to make a summation: The game is lovely if you enjoyed previous Final Fantasy titles such as FF7/9/X, etc; you will love this one just the same. The game runs perfectly great if you are playing on a gaming computer, and not some Lenovo laptop you borrowed from work. The art, music, and combat system are all the quality you would expect from a Final Fantasy title. If you liked Final Fantasy 10, get this game. It's really just a newer version of that game with a different story; it's very comparable.			"

												First thing: PC port. On GTX 960 and I5 4450 with 8gb rams i expreince a lot of fps drops down to 10 o 15. Other wise 60 fps.I hoped that this could get me in FF at least a bit but i miss gameplay. Camera is mess your character is on centred on left side of your screen making me feel wierd when i try to look around. Combat system is like this: You bump to someone then you teleport and combat starts you press one button then the enemy die (unless its boss then you need to think a bit) after EVERY battle you will see a summary on how did you do the game will rate you and you will see if you got any items. For me seeing summary after EVERY DAMN FIGHT is iritating. You can probably just go and look at all the cinematics in order and you basically play the game since this is more a movice than a game.

												The game is fun for what it is.This game is basically just a 3D version of any Final Fantasy game, not everything about it is great including the linear feel of it, it feels like you're definitely forced to move in one direction and the game also has an interesting difficulty spike, even as I'd been increasing my characters abilities throughout the game, there were still points where it was near impossible to kill simple enemies but all in all the game is fun for what it is, it has a nice little story to go with each character and every character has a use including Vanille (who is adorable and useful). I can see why this is a disliked game by the FF community but personally, I enjoyed the game and story and I'd recommend giving it a shot.Something I certainly suggest doing, however, is cloud saving, this is something that I hadn't started doing until recently and it's an extremely useful feature if you're somebody like me because I've had to restart this game 4 or 5 times purely because I lost saves (computers breaking or upgrading), I'd certainly suggest cloud saving so you don't have to do what I did and restart 4 or 5 times. Another thing I'd suggest is possibly changing around the exit and ""go back"" keys, this is something that I often found frustrating because I'm used to using ESC for going back in menus etc. and every time I'd accidentally tap it and the game would ask if I wanted to quit, that's just a suggestion however and if you're used to the default setup of backspace being go back then I'd say keep it as is. From what I've played so far of FF13, I'd definitely suggest giving it a shot because it can be quite a fun game and if you can get past the first section it tends to become very fun and interesting, especially with the summoning aspect that's added when you meet the Shiva Sisters, The game is stunning graphically and the humour in it is brilliant from what I've seen so far, it also has that FF combat system that we all know and love and a nice little tree for upgrading abilities which I personally love. The story isn't the best and the soundtrack is always drowned out by game-play but all in all I'd suggest giving it a shot because in my personal opinion it's quite a fun game and worth the money I spent on it, even if I did have to restart a few times, I'm still enjoying the game and trying to get further in to get a full opinion on story and character development, from what I've seen so far, the story is okay and the characters are all quite interesting, Vanille is especially a nice little character in this game. I suggest giving it a shot. 8/10 - Vanille's Belladonna Wand.			"

												This pc port is really quite awful. The game runs like crap and the options available are limited.  I experienced terrible stuttering until i connected my controller. Apparently the game is polling like crazy for the controller at some intervall which caused the stuttering. It is really quite amazing that the port can still work so badly this long after release. This is cause enough for me to thumb this game down but how is the actual game?Well overall i did not like it. The game have some good moments. It looks nice and the combat can be enjoyable in a ""i am tired from work and want something simple as hell"" kind of way. The problem is that you are going to spend a very long time with the combat and it gets repetitive really fast. Most battles can be won by simply spamming the auto attack and changing your role set up every now and then. It is not very interactive and i got very tired of the absurd amount of trash mobs the game kept throwing at me.But there are times when the combat gets a bit harder and you are required to change your role set up with a pretty high intensity. But since you are limited to only controlling your main character it doesn't really get all that more complex and you are left to hope that your ai companions do their role well enough. Few enemies require any interesting tactics and the combat basically consists of you swaping between offensive, defensive, healing, etc party set ups.What i found really frustrating is that you lose if you main character dies. Some enemy parties can deal very large amount of damage to a single character if the RNG god dislikes you and i can not begin to describe how frustrating i found it when my main character with 90 % + health died in a couple of seconds. Some boss battles are insanely long and several times i almost decided to uninstall the game when my main character got killed by some super attack 10 minutes into a boss fight.This game is also very stat heavy and it is certainly possible to grind in it. I tried to stay away from that but after i got my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me by a boss i threw away my pride and grinded a bit. So how is leveling system? Well it is very basic. You get a bunch of skill trees if you can call them that that consists of three attributes and skills. It is very shallow and very much pretend. All roads lead to rome so to say and in most chapters i managed to fill out every skill tree available.The items are basic as hell and i found it really disappointing that you only get to swap weapon and accessories. I also wish that i would get items that would change the characters apparence but that never happened.  So what do you do in the game? Well you follow a linear as hell level and initiate combat with enemies and loot chests.  There is a chapter with something some may call an open world but there is really not much to it. Yes you get ""quests"" which consist of initiating combat with certain enemies but that is it. So this is what you get gameplay wise and i do not think that it is all that interesting. The majority of the games gameplay felt like complete filler to me and i kind of expected more.So what is left is the story. Is it any good? No it is truly awful. A lot of games have awful stories but it is often obvious that they do not really care about it, this game can not get away with that excuse. The plot does an awful job of communicating basic world info to the player and the game keeps on throwing terms at the player. It was really confusing at first but it never became much better when i started to understand what was going on. The overall plot is just completely nonsensical and i did not care about it one bit.The characters had some good moments here and there even though they certainly are a bit high on the drama. But very little actually happens and even though the games cast is really small for a rpg of this size i never started to care for anyone expect perhaps Sazh. The antagonist of the game is also a joke by the way.But the thing about the plot is that it is really nonexistand during the majority of the game. This game does not combine gameplay and story and the majority of the game you are simply traveling to a place because the plot tells you so. It is a big roadtrip and i found the story to be a big waste of time and in my opinion the plot did not bring up any topics, themes, details about the setting, characters or whatever that i found remotely interesting. Overall i did not enjoy the game and i would not recommend it even if the pc version worked fine. Which it does not.			"

												So you will read mixed reviews on this title, and complaints about thin story and it running poorly. Disregard those reviews. FFXIII has quickly become one of my favorites of the series. I first started playing Final Fantasy with the original on the NES. I got it two days after launch, brand new, from the rack at our local walmart. Me and my mom (who also enjoyed RPGs) got it on a whim because the coverart looked really rad. We were pleasantly surprised by an amazing game, and have played the franchise ever since. This game's story is involving, evolving, and deep. You will get attached to the characters before you know it, and will start having emotional responses to the trials they encounter. The gameplay IS a bit linear, but if you have been playing Final Fantasy long, you will be accustomed to that and it will not feel odd. This is not World of Warcraft, this is not Final Fantasy XIV ARR. This is a single-player Final Fantasy title that lives up to it's namesake. The music is moving, and me and my wife have since downloaded the soundtracks for this, and the next two titles. We have gotten real-world merchandise from the game, and have become involved in the canon about the characters. So to make a summation: The game is lovely if you enjoyed previous Final Fantasy titles such as FF7/9/X, etc; you will love this one just the same. The game runs perfectly great if you are playing on a gaming computer, and not some Lenovo laptop you borrowed from work. The art, music, and combat system are all the quality you would expect from a Final Fantasy title. If you liked Final Fantasy 10, get this game. It's really just a newer version of that game with a different story; it's very comparable.			"

												It's Not worth your time!First, the technical issues: Need third party software to make a playstation controller (or even normal input controller) work on this playstation game. And the audio is terribly out of sync in half of the cutscenes. Since beauty is really the only saving grace of this game, you can't even enjoy that.Every time you save the game, it tries to get you to save in a new slot, so you have to always find the slot you actually want to save in. And save/reload have an extra annoying and unnecessary dialogue box that you have to close after it actually saves/loads.You can't choose your party or even change the leader until you are over halfway done with the game.I'm fine with classes only being able to use certain abilities, but only the commando can actually use a normal attack. which means you have to keep switching paradigms to heal-attack-heal-attack, etc. And switching Paradigms makes you sit through a stupid animation in every battle, while you are getting beat up by monsters watching the animation. And you have to watch that animation every time you switch, and you have to switch often. Battles take a seemingly long time, and they aren't real clear how you are supposed to do many things so you don't really master the battle system until the end of the game. This means you will die constantly and pull your hair out trying to figure out what you are doing wrong (I've died more in playing half this game than all the other ff games combine). Toward the mid game, if you don't level up the right classes in the order the devs thought you should, you could be at a severe disadvantage. They give you the allusion of freedom to level how you want and choose your own strategy, but really you have to do it a certain way.The battle system, other than switching Paradigms is boring. Just Libra the enemy and use autobattle to let the ai decide the most impactful abilities.The leveling system is kinda stupid. If you have more lvl points than you can spend, you can't spend them until you unlock the next level by advancing in the story, which means grinding won't help you at all. As if you could grind, the game is so linear that you often have to save/load or walk long distances to reset the enemies. It's just not worth the time. And then the leveling map eats up random and seemingly unfair amounts of lvl points so you can never tell how much you actually need. And when you hit your lvling cap, and powered up your characters as much as you can, some normal battles (not to mention boss battles) are still ridiculously hard, or at least take a long while. And the game even gives you less than 5 stars to say that you didn't do it good enough and miss out on some possible rewards. This is stupid because it encourages players to save/reload to refight boss battles to get 5 stars. The game even tells you that you should avoid certain enemies (which you will never come back to fight) because they aren't worth it (so why put them in there in the first place). At least in ff 12, the powerful enemies had a place later in the game when you came back stronger. There is no real exploration, or customization. It's all ""follow a straight line and level up how we think you should."" Really all you are doing is watching a poorly audio-synced movie and pressing a few buttons inbetween scenes. And then there's the chocobo chick chase, where you have to find a chocobo chick. But the game points you in the exact direction you need to go so all you have to do is walk forward after each cutscene. And there is no point to it. They could have easily made that into a quick 5 second cutscene and it would've been the exact same thing. This game is so watered down and linear. And so restrictive and frustrating that I just did not have much fun playing it as much as I have. Really the only thing I enjoyed about it was the cutscenes, which I still didn't get to fully enjoy because the audio was out of sync for half of them. This game was beautiful graphics ducttaped to a mediocre story, dumb character designs, lack-luster battle system, and terrible game coding. Even if you get the game on sale, I just can't recommend wasting your time.			"

												My initial review is outdated so trying this again;Fixed things:This game now supports any res. Esc doesn't auto-close the game anymore, now it gives a prompt. Bad things: This game for some reason is 60 GB. (FFXIII-2 is 30GB by comparison.)This game is a linear experience. You go from point A to point B then fight a boss, watch a cutscene. Repeat.---First off although this game is linear, I find it fun as all your characters are not stuck in a simple healer/tank/dps scenario they can be switched up fluently which makes combat alot of fun.  The characters backstories will grab your attention in a way where you will despise some characters and love others.   The graphics are gorgeous making for some very pretty screenshots that in some cases make you want to screenshot & wallpaper it.  I use an xbox controller to play with no real problems there.  Some of the conversations that go on while you're traversing the linear path have made me stop and go ""wait did I actually read that?""   and often keep me amused (one such screenshot:

												=Gameplay 7/10Like-The different kind of battle systemWell, I always like something different. I've heard some people say that they want the old battle system just like the previous FF series. I like the previous battle system as well, but trying something different is not that bad. I ain't even mad. I like the unique paradigm shift system that let you change the job combination of your team during battle and the Crystarium system (reminds me of FFX Sphere Grid).-The open world part started from chapter 11.I've been waiting for this after 10 straight chapters. Finally, I can do something else beside following the story. I enjoyed doing Cie'th stone quest, Chocobo treasure hunter (reminds me of FFIX), CP grinding and exploring the open world.Dislike-The so damn straight gameplay from chapter 1-10.I can't deny that It's kinda boring when you just follow the story and can't do anything else. It's even worse when it takes 10 chapters to play like that.-Can't control other characters except the leader.I want a full control to all of my characters.=Audio visual 9/10Well, SE did put a lot effort on this just like if they're making a movie.=Story line 8/10This game has a beautiful storyline and quite complicated too. Even it's too complicated for some people and they mad for getting confused. Well, you just need to follow the story as you play it and... the answer is pretty obvious right there. I enjoyed the storyline offered in this game.=AdditionalThe locked graphics at 720p for this PC ported version is bothering me at first. It's even worse when there're no graphics option. But, It's fixed with the new patch. The game runs smoothly on my PC.===o0o===At last, I'm so sorry for my bad english. English is not my native language.			"

												There are many reasons to hate this game, as you may read in other reviews both here on Steam and elsewhere. The thing is that, if you are a Final Fantasy fan like me, you won't care about that. You'll still feel the need to try it out yourself. Just make sure to waste your money when it is on sale.If you are still unsure about the purchase these two points may help you in you decission:- Many who like the game claim that it gets better after a while (e.g. the awful linear gameplay) and it does. It doesn't make that much of a difference, though, since there isn't much of the story left after that. Sure there are other things still to be done; missions to be completed and achievements to be unlocked - but it will mostly be grinding. Take that from someone who spent ~300 hours completing every aspect of this game (just to be able to say I really did do everything), which is about as much time as I spent on TES: Oblivion, where I did every quest, visited every location, heck I even collected every book in that game.  Out of the 300 FF XIII hours played, 50 - 100 hours were related to the storyline. The rest were leveling and farming the same items from the same enemies over and over again.- This game stays true to the FF ""lore"". It is a genuine Final Fantasy game. The story is one where your party fights forces of evil to save the world; the backstories of the characters are cliché and the dialog is so simple and naïve that is seems out of place; it's semi-turn-based; you level your characters to get all the usual spells such as ""Life"" and ""Quake""; you get to fight against the same unimaginative ""slime""-enemies as you did in the first installments and the bosses are epicly designed to the point where you don't know what's the face and what's the rear; you get to summon powerful beings to your aid; and you get to ride chocobos.Finally, I will warn you that this game will require a lot of patience - the wrong kind. I hardly enjoyed any of it. This could be the worst game I've ever played but, considering that I played many weird console games back in the 90's, that is unlikely.			"

												The new battle system using the crystarium and paradigms was a great change to the series. The battles are very exciting and fast-paced now with this new combat system. However, you only ever have control of one of your party members in battles, and the use of ""auto-battle"" is often necessary, so the battles are quite automated. Therefore, while the battles are more exciting with the graphics and visual aspects, the battles usually consist of you just pressing the enter button 5 times and watching. Other than the great battle system, the rest of the game is pretty disappointing. Compared to FF7 or 8, the story is very short and simple, with few, if any, cliffhangers or twists that make you want to keep playing. I enjoyed the interactions between the characters, but only a couple of the characters themselves were likable. Unlike the freedom you have in previous titles in the FF series (the world maps, ability to explore the world throughout the game, finding hidden items, completing side quests) this game has none. You have no freedom to explore the world or go back to areas you were in previously, no hidden items, no side quests, no mini-games, and the list goes on, It is completely linear. You literally run down one long hallway for the entire game and fight the same 10 monsters repeatedly for the whole 30 hours of game play. A huge drawback to the boss battles is that if your ""leader"" dies, it does not matter if your other two party members are alive, it is game over. And when you die, you have to rewatch the longer-than-necessary cut scenes before you can retry the battle. Many of the cut scenes run at over 5 minutes, and are not very entertaining. With the automation of the battles, excessive number of cut scenes, and complete linearity and  lack of mobility freedom, the game is essentially a 30-hour movie where you have very little control over anything. Strengths of this game:1. Crystarium/paradigm battle system2. Character development and interactions3. Visual appeal and graphicsWeaknesses of this game:1. Battles are extremely repetitive with high HP monsters 2. Battles are highly automated with control over only one party member3. Story line, lack of plot depth4. Linearity5. No world map or ability to explore other places or regions6. Inability to revisit places you were in previously7. Excessive number of cut scenes8. Having to re-watch cut scenes if your party leader died in battle9. Game over if your party leader dies in battle, even if your other two party members are still alive "

This is cause enough for me to thumb this game down but how is the actual game?Well overall i did not like it. The game have some good moments. It looks nice and the combat can be enjoyable in a ""i am tired from work and want something simple as hell"" kind of way. The problem is that you are going to spend a very long time with the combat and it gets repetitive really fast. Most battles can be won by simply spamming the auto attack and changing your role set up every now and then. It is not very interactive and i got very tired of the absurd amount of trash mobs the game kept throwing at me.But there are times when the combat gets a bit harder and you are required to change your role set up with a pretty high intensity. But since you are limited to only controlling your main character it doesn't really get all that more complex and you are left to hope that your ai companions do their role well enough. Few enemies require any interesting tactics and the combat basically consists of you swaping between offensive, defensive, healing, etc party set ups.What i found really frustrating is that you lose if you main character dies. Some enemy parties can deal very large amount of damage to a single character if the RNG god dislikes you and i can not begin to describe how frustrating i found it when my main character with 90 % + health died in a couple of seconds. Some boss battles are insanely long and several times i almost decided to uninstall the game when my main character got killed by some super attack 10 minutes into a boss fight.This game is also very stat heavy and it is certainly possible to grind in it. I tried to stay away from that but after i got my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me by a boss i threw away my pride and grinded a bit. So how is leveling system? Well it is very basic. You get a bunch of skill trees if you can call them that that consists of three attributes and skills. It is very shallow and very much pretend. All roads lead to rome so to say and in most chapters i managed to fill out every skill tree available.The items are basic as hell and i found it really disappointing that you only get to swap weapon and accessories. I also wish that i would get items that would change the characters apparence but that never happened.  So what do you do in the game? Well you follow a linear as hell level and initiate combat with enemies and loot chests.  There is a chapter with something some may call an open world but there is really not much to it. Yes you get ""quests"" which consist of initiating combat with certain enemies but that is it. So this is what you get gameplay wise and i do not think that it is all that interesting.

												If you are a J-RPG fan or just looking for a great game buy this game!Don't pay attention to all those people complaining about this game being a bad port.This game is great and after 45hours I still haven't finished the main story (wich is a great amount of time for an rpg).The battles force you to think up of better strategies how to handle the game.Some seamingly undefeatable enemies might be easely defeated by using the appropriate strategy.Graphics are still very nice considering that this was a ps3/xbox 360 game.The story is also well thought and worth to follow.Not to mention the music wich is absolutely enchanting.Final fantasy XIII RULES!

												I played this extensively on the PS3 and loved it, so I'll go ahead and recommend the PC version after a dozen hours of play.   First of all, the PC version looks fantastic. With hours of gorgeously detailed cutscenes, this game is definitely story-driven. I certainly enjoyed that aspect of it, but your mileage will vary greatly depending on how you feel about the characters. The combat becomes fun once you get a decent ways into the game, but unfortunately it's a bit too slow in introducing new mechanics. It's also very linear, with the exception of chapter 11 (of 13). Overall, it's a big game with a great story and a slightly different take on the traditional Final Fantasy gameplay. A couple notes on the port. I haven't experienced any major bugs. There are a couple of graphics options, but these can only be accessed from the launcher. There are no sound options at all. And the control scheme takes some getting used to, especially the escape key which brings up an ""exit game"" prompt.			"

												So you will read mixed reviews on this title, and complaints about thin story and it running poorly. Disregard those reviews. FFXIII has quickly become one of my favorites of the series. I first started playing Final Fantasy with the original on the NES. I got it two days after launch, brand new, from the rack at our local walmart. Me and my mom (who also enjoyed RPGs) got it on a whim because the coverart looked really rad. We were pleasantly surprised by an amazing game, and have played the franchise ever since. This game's story is involving, evolving, and deep. You will get attached to the characters before you know it, and will start having emotional responses to the trials they encounter. The gameplay IS a bit linear, but if you have been playing Final Fantasy long, you will be accustomed to that and it will not feel odd. This is not World of Warcraft, this is not Final Fantasy XIV ARR. This is a single-player Final Fantasy title that lives up to it's namesake. The music is moving, and me and my wife have since downloaded the soundtracks for this, and the next two titles. We have gotten real-world merchandise from the game, and have become involved in the canon about the characters. So to make a summation: The game is lovely if you enjoyed previous Final Fantasy titles such as FF7/9/X, etc; you will love this one just the same. The game runs perfectly great if you are playing on a gaming computer, and not some Lenovo laptop you borrowed from work. The art, music, and combat system are all the quality you would expect from a Final Fantasy title. If you liked Final Fantasy 10, get this game. It's really just a newer version of that game with a different story; it's very comparable.			"

												It almost being me actual pain how corny and cliche the dialog in this game is, my brain hurts after just the first few scenes.  The combat system is just push one button over and over while your support heals and takes care of everything else and there is literally nowhere you can go but the intended path.  It seems in their attempt to be unique but still recreate FF8 they just made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game.  For one, it is very linear.  Start here, fight until you get here and repeat.  This gets old very quickly because you feel like you aren't accomplishing anything.  At the same time, the plot is okay.  My biggest gripe is the difficulty.  You start out and it's really easy.  Like REALLY easy.  Everything is fine until you hit this one enemy who is the hardest thing you've ever seen.  You fight it, get wrecked and repeat.  Once you defeat it, everything goes back to normal.  BUT THEN THE♥♥♥♥♥♥HITS THE FAN.  Once you start chapter 11 (Gran Pulse) you will find yourself getting torn a new one every step from here until the end.  I hated it.  Even after grinding the c'ieth stone missions up to 30, I was still getting a new one torn in chapter 13.  The enemies would have ridiculous buffs and attack speeds that my party (nearly all level 4 ranked) wouldn't stand a chance.  As a matter of fact, the amount of grinding  needed to be done was so off putting that I stopped playing on the final chapter.			"

												The game has some flaws, like weird pacing or poor optimisation. It's also very linear, and you will spend most (with one MAJOR exception) of the game running in corridor-like locations. But it also has a great storyline, a satysfying and original battle system and convincing characters, each facing their own personal dilemmas. And because of these reasons I absolutely loved playing FF13- especially because it made me care about every single one of its heroes to a Mass Effect-level degree. I'd actually recommend it to all RPG fans. It's not perfect, and will just not work for some people- but it's a unique experience that certainly worked for me.			"

												Been wanting to get this game in a very loooooooong time (since it came out actually, for the ps3) but lacking a console, couldn't really afford it. I think the port is very well made and runs really smooth. Content-wise, I was not disappointed up to now, really love it :D haven't finished it yet, but I already knew the story from when it released and I love it all the same :)If you are a fan of the FF franchise, this is a must have for the collection, its different and won't appeal to everyone, like for example, even though I love the FF franchise, I never really enjoyed FF12 (the one with Vaan, Penelo, and Balthier, and Fran, and Ashe) so yeah, keep in mind that Final Fantasy changes completly the story base on each number and not all the stories will appeal to everyone (nor all the combat systems, etc).

												This game is horrible.Pros:-ArtworkCons:-The port from console to pc is really bad, no graphic options, weird key layout, heavy fps drops-Story is not understandable if you don't visit a wiki-Combat system was made by people who think buttonmash is an acceptable way of combat.-The characters are so bad, they have zero brains, zero logic, i don't even know how they could survive till now, they have ambitions which i can not understandOverall:I love grinding and turn based games like FFXII, Persona 3, hell even Pokemon, but this game is the bad kind of grindgame where you just want to finish it as soon as possible and don't enjoy grinding. And to me it felt like the tutorial was the first 20+hrs of gameplay because thats when the world opens up from the linear 'just go straight ahead'.Story:The story is big scale with lots of made up words about 6 people who are not really likeable. I hate like 4 of them because they are no-brains and do stuff a person never would. One is hunting the other for revenge because in his oppinion he killed his mother ( he did not, he was not responsible by far) the other is looking for his only love in the world, i have to mention here that the guy is like what? 20-24 years old and the girls seems less than 16 and they are even engaged these are things that make me feel frustrated. Also if you want to understand the story and watch all cutscenes you won't understand what is going on you have to visit a wiki page to get the story. In my opinion the story is very bad because they use fictional words and their meaning is not well explained, and the characters backstory is bad.Combat:My best guess is that the one who invented this combat system was the local janitor. It is bad, really bad. It is kind of a turn based combat system in real time, sound fun right? No its not. Every character has roles in which they can fight, like heal, tank, damage and some other. You only controll one character but you can switch between the combat roles in combat and the other two guys in your party will do stuff according to their role. Your main character with which you play can be commanded as you wish or can be put on autocombat which makes the game a button mash but it is not playable otherwise, because the combat is in real time and if you want to strategize and choose your attacks without the autocombat system you will miss out on many opportunities to attack which. The other thing is that once you select your party you have to kind of program the AI what roles they should do in what combination this is kind of like the gambit system in FFXII but not as deep. What i noticed is that once you make a perfect role combo which you would use guess what? It resets after some cutscenes which makes you reprogram them very often.If you would have been able to controll all characters to full extent and stop time while you make the choices, basically if this would have been a turn based combat system it would have been much better, as the combat is very limited this way and i often feel like i am just mashing buttons instead of doing some strategizing. An option to flee from a fight is also missing but if you die you are able to retry before you engaged the enemy you are fighting.World:The world is pretty massive but it takes you like 20+ hours of gameplay to be able to go where you want and pick up sidequests. It would have been much nicer if you could have picked up some of them in this 20+ hours of gametime. The world is also really linear in these first hours of gameplay, there is no real exploration or anything like that you will find yourself following passages with only one direction to go. "

												Having never played any other FF games, I played this first on X360 until chapter 10, but now on PC on Chapter 8 w/ a 360 controller I find its pretty enjoyable, though now there's guides making it easier plus easy mode (dont wanna regrind 10 chapters).This is a pretty solid PC-port. I pull consistent FPS, the only time it stutters is after a cutscene for a few seconds until I guess it loads the area. Also there is no save limit like on the X360 so thats nice. I guess by the time I bought and played it they fixed a majority of the graphics issues but a few remain though not game stopping nor annoying.Only bad thing I see is the 50gb install size, guess in Japan they expect every to have 200-300gb free (though this was installed on a freshly installed 2TB but still 50gb is way too large). Mainly the videos make up 30-40gb or so which is sad.In the end I give this game 8.5/10, the port a 8/10.I plan on buying FF13-2 and if it comes to Steam Lightning Returns.			"

Pros:+Innovative and stratigic gameplay+Beautiful music and graphics+A well-written setting and world+Good character developemntCons:-The game is very linear, so not much replay value-Story may be confusing to some people-Characters may not appeal to some peopleOverall, it's a good game, and not deserving of all the hate it gets.

The fighting and paradigm mechanics actually get pretty cool once you learn it,  The story is average at best.Pros:  Boss battles can be brutal -- really make you think or google the strategyGraphics are great.  I found myself doing the stop and just scroll the camera to look around often.Music is top notch,  Some tracks are absolutely beautiful.Cons:Story is average, hard to pick up at firstWeapon and accessory upgrade system really confusing.  You need to look at guides I feel to have a clue what to do.Some of the goon monsters are pretty lame.  There is a common enemy that I would compare to  a bouncing trashcan in this game.Chapter 11 -- i think i've been in it for 20 hours.I'd give it a 5/10, but just can't recommend.  Hoping the sequels fare better.  "

												Guys, I really don't understand why almost everyone speaks bad about this game...THIS GAME IS AMAZING. the graphics are incredible and the story is... wow... I don't know how to say that... amazing.The combat mechanics are well done and it's pretty cool to kill everyone on a turn based combat with magic and... yeah, nice characters :)And all this for 13 euros! C'mon! (I got it at 6 euros, but never mind... xD )The only problem is that yeah, you need a big pc, or you'll get a lot of frame problems, wich can bring your pc to have a lot of ""nice"" lags.But if you pull the resolution down, u will be able to play it with no problems :)Trust me guys... BUY IT!			"

												This review relates to the game post 4th December 2014 patch.Notes on the PC port:Looks better than the PS3 version and runs quite well on a (1st generation) Core i7 870 + nVidia GTX460 at 1920x1080 screen resolution, 4k shadowmaps, x8 AA and x16 AF. Currently running it on a (6th generation) Core i7 6700K at 4.4ghz + nVidia GTX1070 at 1920x1080 with everything maxed and performance is...roughly the same. Most of the time you get 60 fps but framerate appears to be locked to refresh rate and certain areas result in dips down to 30. I don't see any way to avoid this and buying better hardware doesn't seem to help.You must have a controller plugged in or you will have severe hitching problems. The hitching issues have something to do with the way the game checks for the presence of a controller and it is amazing that unplugging a 360 gamepad suddenly makes the game unplayable. I have no idea why it is coded this way but if you are playing with mouse + keyboard on a PC with similar specs as mine and you are experiencing terrible framedrops/hitching, try plugging in a control pad.Cutscenes are a little grainy but it could be that I don't notice this on PS3 + television. The download is about 58gb, the majority of which is comprised of cutscenes. There are no options for adjusting sound levels and changing keyboard controls is limited. Overall, it is a decent enough port in its current incarnation and I can live with the flaws.Notes on the game:First, this game is narrative driven and exposition is handled mainly through cutscenes, of which there are many. Like most Final Fantasy games, it is a melodrama which means characters and plot are often highly exaggerated in order to appeal to your emotions. You don't start getting the emotional resolution until a good 15 to 20 hours in and at times you may find certain characters insufferable and certain plot points ridiculous. FF XIII walks a very fine line in this regard.The story is confusing because it drops you in medias res and the creation myth of FF XIII's world is never explained in the course of the game. You get most of it from text dump datalog entries. This is a shame because the world of FF XIII is well realised but it is not revealed to players in an order that makes sense and it relies on you reading codex entries. If you don't read the codex entries, this game won't may any sense.FF XIII is quite linear and it is true that for large parts of the game, you run through straight tunnels but linearity isn't the problem. Games like The Last of Us and Half Life 2 are also linear but both of them are brilliant at creating the illusion of the gameworld being much bigger than it really is. At times the illusion is so well accomplished, you don't even try to break out of the glass tunnel. You are simply lost in the world before you. You have a clear sense of a journey and where locations are geographically in relation to one another and you never feel the need to stray from the correct (and only) path.In FF XIII that illusion is not very well done and the overhead map + invisible walls are a constant reminder that for most of the game, you are running through a glass tunnel. Linearity to some extent is necessary in games with structured narratives but there are points in FF XIII where the immersion breaks. There are no towns and few interactive npcs which is ok since you spend most of the time as a fugitive on the run. But the first time through you won't know where you are going or why. You won't know where Bodhum is in relation to the Hanging Edge. You won't know what the difference is between Sanctum Fal'Cie and Pulse Fal'Cie except they are in opposition. For some reason. When you, the player has such a lack of purpose and direction, you will start testing the limits of the gameworld which is when you run into an invisible wall and the illusion breaks down. The levels in FF XIII feel very small.The battle system is well done and works due to the game's linearity. Square Enix have balanced it to the point where its really unbreakable, something that cannot be said of XIII-2 and to a lesser extent Lightning Returns. At no point can you completely break the game by overleveling. Combat is strategic and stays that way right until the post game and where you have maxed every weapon and accessory. There are no useless abilities, items or characters. Everything is important, its just a question of when you should use them. The game spends about 10 to 12 hours introducing you to combat mechanics and forcing you to play in 2 man parties but once you get past this extended tutorial, fighting becomes really fun.Items and upgrade systems are somewhat disconnected from the battle system. It requires a spreadsheet to calculate the exp required to level up items without wasting money and money is strictly limited until near the end of the main story part of the game. Due to the lack of money, you probably won't be maxing anything until you beat the final boss and move into post game content.Post game content involves tying up all the optional fights, superbosses and treasure hunts from Chapter 11. This chapter differs from the others because it is geographically much larger and instead of being singularly composed of a linear story path, it takes the form of a large central hub with different areas branching off it. A first playthrough of the main story only would fall into the 30 to 40 gameplay hour range. If you do all the optional chapter 11 stuff and go for all achievements you can more than double that time.The biggest issue to overcome is how disconnected its gameplay systems are and at times how visible they are to the player. Having finished the game 3 times now on PC and once on Playstation, I still don't skip the cutscenes because story exposition for me is the reward mechanism for playing. You run, you fight and then you get treated to an extravagant cinematic cutscene. Sometimes the fighting gets in the way of experiencing the story and vice versa. The item system is disconnected from everything, hidden in a sub menu from a save point. You won't have the resources to fully develop items until long after you have finished the main story.Despite it flaws, I thought FFXIII's story was a powerful emotional journey that I continue to revisit. Recommended if you have a control pad, you are willing to give the game more than 10 hours to pay you back and you can stomach melodrama. Otherwise, you might find FF XIII's failings get in the way of the things it does right. Overall I think it is a good story, told in a jumbled and sometimes unintuitive way.			"

												I've seen a lot more positivity for this game recently, when it first launched on steam a whole lot of people hated it because it wasn't a good port. I'll keep this review short though, as that recent positivity has surely shown you that FF XIII is actually a really great game. Also I do have 56 hours into the game, I played offline ;)Pros:+Fun combat especially once the game turns you loose letting you choose your party members.+Great story. A little confusing at first, but it's still wonderful.+Good progression system that rewards grinding a little but will halt your progression at certain points. This means each boss fight is still somewhat challenging, even if you grinded for hours. To clarify: grinding isn't required until late in the game. (Side quest show up once you need to grind, making the grind fun.)+Music. It's Final Fantasy. Duh.+Some characters are kind of annoying at first, but each character evolves by the end of the game. Love this gang.Cons:-Still not the most optimized game you'll ever play. I have an i7 at 2.8 ~ 3.6 ghz, 16gb of ram, GTX 860m. Ran at about 30-40 fps. Sometimes hit 60 fps in smaller battles. 1080p-Voice acting is hit and miss. Sometimes it's excellent, sometimes it makes you cringe. (I have high standards for voice acting though. The Last Of Us ruined me.)-VERY linear. Now given, the game is linear because of the story, but a few branching points in earlier chapters would've been nice.All in all I'd give this game an 8.5/10. If you're a fan of JRPGs or Final Fantasy then go ahead and pick it up. If you're on the fence, I still do recommend it.Thanks for reading.-Tave			"

												Aside from the very lazy porting this is still one of the best JRPG's on PC.While its just lazy on SE's part most of the problems with the port can be solved with a little modding and tweaking, but we enjoy that right? Cause we are PC gamers ;)Also think before you hit the ESC key xDPorting aside the game it self is still pretty great in my opinion. The characters are great for the most part and I enjoyed the story. Also this version comes with Japanese dabb :DThe big drawback on this particual entry over entries in the seires is its linear nature.Would recommend if you are a fan of the series and don't mind a bit of tweaking.

												This port is extremely disapoinging.  The game does look amazing when it runs at 60fps in cinimatics, but it falls apart the second you gain any form of control.  On a computer with 32 Gb ram, 4.0 Ghz processor, and 8 Gb vram, on the lowest settings possible, the game runs at: 60 fps cinimatics, 30 fps walking with dips, and 15 fps while fighting.  This is ironicaly, the same fps I got at the highest quality.  The game is not optimized well at all, and is generally just a crappy port.  Unless you have a lot of patience, stay away from this awful port.  I will say that I did play the original release on ps3, and loved the story, and it ran much better on there.  If you have a ps3 definitely pick up the game on there if you get the chance!			"

												Does this game have decent storyline? I don't know, i didn't make it past prolog. Why? Well, for exact same reason i would not recomend that game for anyone other then hardcore FF fan:FFXIII is probably most linear game i ever seen as even loot cheasts conviniently placed on your only way from one pre-rendered 720p cutscene to another. Combat system straight awful mix of real-time and turn-based and almost punish you from trying anything other then pressing Auto-battle button. Whateven happening in first two hours have no explanation or whatever, you just run the only way available while game through some bizzare therminology at you.Maybe game is fun sometime later in progress but so far i've spent two hours and got nothing other then frustration from lack of explanation and combat system.

												While I am enjoying the game, there are several flaws that jump right out from the get-go:-It is a corridor simulator. 7 hours in and I have not once made a single choice in where to go that was not forward.-There is as much cutscene as gameplay. Every five steps you take some character has to say something to someone else and by god we have to pause everything to find out what it is.-You can die within the first 10 seconds of a fight if you're not using the right setup.Despite this, I'm going to continue playing for quite some time. The story is interesting, I like most of the characters, and combat is fairly engaging.			"

												Final Fantasy XIII is a controversial entry in the long-running JRPG series and the reasons behind the backlash it received have a lot to do with some radical choices the developers made. This is a JRPG that removes almost all the adventure and exploration elements associated with the genre. Instead, it chooses to focus on the story-telling and combat.The story is told mainly through cut-scenes and the combat is a fast-paced variation on the classic active-time battle system found in older titles like Final Fantasy VII. The cut-scenes are very impressive and the story being told does maintain a strong sense of pacing throughout the entire game. Combat is fluid and intense, with enough variety to keep demanding players interested. However, the absence of ""towns"" and similar combat-free spaces makes the experience feel somewhat repetitive once it becomes clear that the game is just a long series of battles interrupted with cut-scenes every now and then. Overall, I feel like this is a good game for what it is, but it is flawed in many ways. The UI doesn't really help the player at all and using the Shops and the Weapon Upgrade System is a chore because you end up having to get in and out of menus numerous times. The end game feels rushed and, the further you go, the more it becomes just a long grind. I gave up on it after realizing the last two special bosses are almost unbeatable without reaching the level cap in all the classes. If I were to score FFXIII, I'd give it a 4/5. Despite the problems I found, the game's quality is impressive. Graphics and animations look amazing, soundtrack is beautiful, combat is mostly great and the story is actually pretty cool once you understand what the hell is going on.			"

												So basically this it how it goes: If you are not a fan of any of the final fantasy games, you will love this game. If you are a die hard final fantasy fan you will more than likely hate it. Being someone who has never enjoyed any final fantasy game I personally  thought this was the best one. The protagonist is SUPER HOT, the battle system is fast so you dont have to deal with a boring slow paced crappy turn based game AND it is the first final fantasy to have a non sterotypical black guy partake in the story. There is also a character who most would define as jail bait in the game. Hopefully she grows up in XIII-2 so I can finally fantasize about her as well as Lightening.			"

												Everything is fine except the 720p which Durante fixed it for us(Still waiting for official Square Enix statement though).Also waiting a patch/fix for the fps drops/stuttering*, i personally didn't have a problem without GeDoSaTo, but without it i can't play the game because my monitor can't handle any resolution other than 1920x1080p without being a muddy hell.My recommendation will be positive as i believe this game will be patched soon, if it won't i will change my recommendation to negative, i am very forgiving with this one, as i can't even play it atm, i could easily bash it and ask for a refund but i will be tolerant for a little while.Edit: No news, nothing from SE not even an announcement, so i will just judge the game as i supposed to.*For some people(actually a lot).-11/12/2014-Edit v2: Ok the patch came out and i am more than satisfied, the fps got better and the graphical options are good enough at least for me, rocking up msaa x4 and 1080p i get around 60-55 fps and 30 locked on combat i would like to see the combat on 60 fps but it's ok i can deal with it.Changing my recommendation to YES.

												I had never played Final Fantasy XIII on any of the cosoles prior to playing on Steam, so I have no complaints about the graphics.  That said, I did not really start playing this game until the December updated was available, which I've read has at least improved some of the issues noted in the early reviews.I find this a very acceptable entry in the Final Fantasy series.  The battle system is different, with much of the strategy going into what role the party members have while mostly letting the party members actions within that role.  One complaint, despite the ability to revive other party members with items and later abilities, if the party leader dies it's game over immediately.  This is not a huge problem, as in this game you can retry from just before the fight rather than the last save.I do like the Crystarium system for leveling up and gaining abilities, which allows you to give the characters a measured boost in HP, Strength, or Magic every few battles.The story so far, about 26 hours into the game, is good.  There are a lot of threads, that seem unrelated at first, but they've started coming together in interesting though generally unsurprising ways.  That said, it took quite some time to get into it, and at first there doesn't seem to be much story beyond the characters needing to survive whatever The gameplay is very linear, which I only mind in comparison to other Final Fantasy games that were less so.  From a story perspective I like this - as I'm always looking to unveil more of the story and since it's linear, any action gets you closer to the next story development.I do recommend this game.			"

												It's taken me several years to finally try this game out.  I had read all the complaints about it and I am one of those annoying historic fans who is very precious about the turn based system (woe).  With the remake of VII coming out and watching the trailers, I have to accept that turn based is never going to make a come back in this franchise.So I set out to get used to it.  What I learned, however, is that the Final Fantasy franchise is no longer worth investing in if this is what they come up with these days.The story is atrocious.  Clumsily told and they must realise this, because they keep a summary of everything in the datalog and also recap what's happened as you load up the game.  It's just mega confusing.  I read everything and played through everything, and yet when it came to the final boss, I had no clue as to what was going on.  Final Fantasy stories are tradtionally a bit complex but this was truly flimsy writing.The game play - it seemed rather awesome.  For the first 20 minutes.  Then it got tiresome.  You soon learn that battles are rather long and no amount of grinding will shorten them because  a) they cap your development for each chapter and b) you have to ""stagger"" an enemy before you can really get your teeth in, and for many enemies, this takes a very long time.  I was very resentful battling an ordinary fiend for the same amount of time I would spend on a major boss in previous installments.  It would be okay if the battles were fun, but they aren't.Side quests.  There's not many - the side quests essentially centres around 64 missions given to my Ci'eth stones, so unless you find that a barrell of joy, you are not going to enjoy this normally fun aspect of a Final Fantasy game.  And it's not enjoyable.  Again, I was getting really annoyed going through these missions where you spent more time hunting down the stone, and then hunting down the mission.  This involves a lot of running.  A lot.  I cannot convey how much running this entails.  This is what makes the missions take so long - not the missions themselves!  WHO THOUGHT THAT WAS FUN?  I challenge anybody to tell me that they honestly enjoyed running around doing those missions.You basically have to complete the game before the ""world"" opens up to you and the stat development completely opens up to you.  That is incomprehensible to me.  Why do you have to go through the whole game before you are free to explore with your maximum potential?I'm a completist.  I'm one of those people that has to stats maxed out, all super bosses completed every item found, every side quest completed... it's this characteristic that made me play on, not the game and I got so fed up with it, I used cheats.  That's right.  For the first time ever in my life, I used cheats, just to get through the battles quicker, just to finish this game.  AND IT WAS STILL A SLOG.Positives?  Lightning is cool and the game looks pretty.  Was also pleasantly surprised by the music.  I knew Nobuo Uematsu wasn't involved so really wasn't expecting much, but I really enjoyed it and so bought the soundtrack.I know it's late to say this and nearly everyone who is going to play this has already done so, but if you are on the fence, I do not recommend this, especially if you cherish the golden age of VI-X - it really has nothing in common with them.

Change someone to a medic, and hopefully everyone is still alive by the time your teammate casts a spell. Summons transform into stupid vehicles for some reason.

I didn't even bother trying to play XIII-2 (though I purchased it). I searched the internet and forums. Looks like this game doesn't generally play well with AMD graphics. I got a full refund for both games within 24 hours.If you're running an NVidia setup you're probably fine. If you're running AMD, beware. If this game ever gets its compatibility fixed I absolutely will buy it again. I've watched a friend play it on PS and it was great.			"

												Anyone who actually has a halfway decent PC, beware of this poorly executed port. My GTX 980 should more than be able to run this port of a PS3 game, but Square Enix clearly didn't bother to test this port with any modern software or halfway decent graphic cards. In windowed mode at 720p res settings with MSAA at minimum and shadows at a low setting, the game ran consistently at 30 fps in most areas, until a battle or cutscene starts, where the framerate jumps between 60 and 15 in a matter of seconds and continues to fluctuate in this manner, dropping whenever any movement or spell effect occurs. Not only does this make battles impossible to keep track of or even look at without wanting to barf, it causes a slight de sync in cutscenes that can be annoying at times and just awful at others. Also, the game does not look good. The higher resolutions are okay, but the AA is consistently ugly, even at 16x. Lightning's hair can look very pixelated at times from it and it effects the other characters and the surroundings as well. It's distracting and it makes the PS3 version look like heaven in comparison. And if your performance requires you to lower the shadows, enjoy them. They turn into blocky messes at anything below the two higher settings.As for the game itself, it's Final Fantasy XIII. Go look at everybody else's opinion. This port just goes even further to highlight what a let-down this game is, as well as Square Enix's performance as of late. My only hope is that Final Fantasy XV gets a better pc release. Or at least that Lightning Returns does.The game itself is a 7/10. This port is a 4/10, being barely playable for those with high pc gaming and RPG standards.Note: Some people have no performance issues with their systems and I understand that. But that's some people. The others have a right to know what they're getting into. That's why I'm downvoting it.			"

												While this is certainly not the best the Final Fantasy series has to offer, it is still a very good JRPG. The story is interesting, but feels predictable most of the time. Gameplay can feel a little repetetive, but overall the menu/battle systems have a nice feel to them. I personally am a big fan of the visuals. While texture resolution might be a bit low, the design and detail that went into the artwork is impressive. The music is amazing, fitting perfectly with the ongoing narrative. The PC port might have some performance issues depending on you configuration, but mostly it will run just fine. I encountered zero crashes or errors while doing a full playthrough, just some occasional framerate drops.Pros:- Good visuals, detailed design- Gameplay is smooth, menus responsive- Music is amazing- Plenty of contentCons:- Can feel repetetive- Story is predictable- While offering 60 fps, the PC port is not the best- A huge download (if you have slow internet)			"

												This review is rated P, for Positive.While many reviewers of this game have given it a giant negative review, for various reasons, I have found the game to be an absolute delight.While the game certainly carries on the ""passive"" feeling of Final Fantasy 12's combat system, the paradigm shifting add-on feels kind of like ""Dress sphere changing"" without the needlessly long cameos.The ""leveling"" system, rather than going by character levels, involves leveling up individual classes, which you then slot in to Paradigms, to get access to their abilities.The graphics in this game are decidedly breathtaking, with but few exceptions, and in contrast to a great many Final Fantasy games, all of the characters are not only well written in to the story, but even the whiney one, who has a vaguely Vaan/Tidus/Zidane feel to him, is neither useless, nor feeling particularly unnecessary to the story(Vaan). While some of the characters do borrow elements of their dress style(Lightning - Ashe + Squall), or general attitude(Hope - Zidane + Squall + Vaan), they aren't a direct one to one rip-off, and all have interesting motivations for being part of your story.Snow's punch-punch-punch battle style gets over-rated, eventually(As most monk-esque characters do, late game), and I would definitely nominate him for the most unnecessary feeling character in the game, but that doesn't mean his parts of the storyline aren't interesting; just his combat style is vanilla-monk feeling.Overall, this game is not as overrated as most of the reviews seem to make it out to be; though it is linear, and doesn't ""Open up much"" for most of the early game, the same arguments could be made for FFX. Perhaps the only major drawback that I would offer this game is this:If you are on a metered bandwidth, I suggest buying the disc for your game console.The game download smacks in at a 1 star dropping /FIFTY/ Gigabytes.4/5 StarsBeautiful GraphicsInteresting StorylineInteresting game mechanicsInteresting charactersShiva is a mother-♥♥♥♥ing Motorcyle(♥♥♥♥ YEAH!)-1 Star for obnoxious download size(Though it will generally feel worthwhile, as the loading screens are exceedingly minimal.)

												Heyyo,[Update December 29, 2015]So Square Enix never fixed this port and still suffers 30fps and below framerate issues in combat because for some reason every HUD element of this game messes up the frame pacing sigh... so I'm putting my review to not recommended.Yeah they added more resolution support... but promising 60fps and the game never keeping 60fps? Lame. Don't buy Square Enix PC ports they're all messed up apparently. [Original review]yes it's true, the port is sloppy due to resolution locked at 1280x720, framerate fluctuates depending on the HUD and USB devices and some cinematics are poorly rendered despite the steep download size due to pre-rendered cinematics (39GB of the 50GB download is cinematics).As for the game itself? It's still amazing. A fun experience with a good, albeit confusing storyline still shines... even at 720P the game still looks gorejous.I'm sure there will be patches (official or not) that will help resolve the issues mentioned above. The game runs on ""Crystal Tools"" Engine which powers Dragon Quest X and Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Rebon so it has the potential to run perfectly with even just one GPU... so it's obvious that this was a console to PC port that didn't quite get the work it needed so hopefully Square Enix gives this game a good patch or two and help fix the release date's marred public view.The game is quite linear compared to previous Final Fantasy games but there's so much storyline that it didn't use a lot of filler like old Final Fantasy games with the necessity of grinding or other methods to pad the gametime which was nice. There's also auto-heal after combat so you don't have to keep wasting mana or potions (speaking of mana, there isn't any, only Tech Points (TP) for special magic abilties / summons). So the game was built to not be slowed down by tedious tasks such as grinding which is something many jRPG's are critisized for anyways. Plus? you replenish TP by score-attack results screen at the end of combat which makes you feel challenged to defeat your enemies as efficiently as possible. So the game gets bonus points for a little modernization.Keyboard and mouse controls? They work fantastic! It's compatible with QWERT and AZERTY keyboards off the bat which is great!!! The mouse is smooth and effective for combat-use too. Left Click is your confirm, Right-click is your cancel/decline and the scroll-wheel is for cycling menus if you don't feel like using W or S. My only complaint? 0 is your Pause menu and ESC is ""Quit to Desktop"" which can be an upsetting surprise if you're not careful or know about the dreaded action of the ESC button. :POverall? The gameplay is still solid despite the port not being properly optimized on PC (performance and graphics wise).[EDIT1]Btw? For combat being stuck at 30fps? There's a problem with the HUD and the Power settings on Adapative. Here's my results either upscaled to 1080P and 4k downsamped to 1080P.http://imgur.com/a/fCXq3 "

												So did I beat Final Fantasy 13? No, I didn't. The final boss essentially you do chip damage to the entire time, which literally took 45 minutes to get his health down to just half. I think I had a quarter left when he did this insta-death spell that literally came out of nowhere. After being in that battle for over an hour, and having to repeat it, I promptly exited the game and uninstalled it.I tried to like this game. I powered through this monstrosity of a title up until the very end. However, during that time I was ridden with linearity, obnoxious difficulty spikes, awful overly conveluted story, and some of the most drawn out battles I've ever played in an RPG. The game still has tutorials 25 hours in and it takes around 30 to get to an open world area where you can do this one specific type of side quest that is just the same thing you were doing anyway. This game is the video game form of Hell.Will I ever finish this game completely? I doubt it, but anything's possible. My save is in the cloud and isn't going anywhere, so I'll have to be in the mood for it.Also, this PC version sucks. It dips frames for no reason and has no graphical settings outside of AA and shadows.Do not attempt this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.			"

												Update: With the latest graphic Patch Square listened and gave the game some proper graphic options. The FPS drops are also gone for me so all I can say is, good work and I can change it to recommended! The Steam overlay is still kinda buggy and some Sound Options would be still good, but it's still a huge improvement and the game is finally enjoyable without mods.I like FFXIII and was happy as it hit the PC and Steam. But I have real often a hard time to decide for a yes or maybe. Pros:- Story, Lore and World - Music- The Art/Deisgn- Interaction between the Team/CharactersCons:- Close to zero interaction with the world- No exploration for a huge part of the game- Corridors (linear is totally fine done right, but it just feels empty sometimes) - ""Side-Missions"" are walking, fighting, more walking and fighting, nothing else. 64 of them. - Hope>Update above< (I bought it the day it was avaiable. If you are willing to spend some time in fixing then you can buy it in this state, otherwise I would recommend to wait til there are more patches. But in that state I can't really recommend this game to anyone. The lack of any graphic or sound options is just not accaptable. I even could live with the 720p lock since the GeDoSaTo mod works awesome. But things like stuttering cutscenes and gameplay almost every second, massive fps drops an no fix for that just kills the fun. Also no Soundoptions.The lack of any communication on the side from Square is also a big hit in the face. Just a little heads up that these problems have been noticed would be enough.)The game itself is great, in some ways. It isn't as bad as some might say, but it also could have been so much more.  The story is kinda hard to get into and you need to to a little bit of research and reading here and there to get the complete focus of it, but it's good and enjoyable. Not the best ever but sure solid and interesting.  It holds a lot of lore and keeps you interested to get behind the events going on. The overall style is a good mix between Sci-Fi and Fantasy. The lack of explanation at the beginning of the game makes it hard to get into, but from a character views kinda understandable cause they have no need to explain it.Now there is the point which almost destroys this great story. The missing open world. And I don't mean an open world like Skyrim, there is no need for that. What is missing, is a world that feels alive where you feel part of it. You are hunted and wanted I get that, but there is close to zero interaction with the world outside of your party. The world and people are just there. There is no connecting feeling, even the ""dungeons"" have that shallow feeling.And this blows it for most people, you just rush through it, it comes more open later in the game but the world still feels somehow lifeless. There is almost nothing to do in the later open world, the only missions are to walk there and fight that monster, again and again. The characters itself, well I think that's someone everyone has to make up their own mind. I like them, the interaction between each of them, and their actions and motives. Sure a lot are archetype characters but as the game continues they get more depths. Sometimes is kinda silly, over the top and you wan't to punch Hope now and then, but that is a jrpg thing I guess. The Design and Music is great, no question about that. If you can live with that kind of linear gamedesign and the lack of Interaction you get a nice story, music and world.			"

												First of all: I played this game with a controller, and didn't finish it yet, but there are just two of 13 chapters left, so there isn't much to see except of the end of the story. Also, this my personal view and opinion on the game.. :)+ Pros: > Graphics: The game looks just awesome with nice special effects, especially on the cutscenes!> Setting: A steam-punkish / Sci-Fi game style, that i enjoyed personally, even if some monsters were a bit weird> Character-Design: Characters with their own individual personality that are not like the old hero-stereotype char, even if they sometimes annoyed me because of all their ""what should i do?"" moments> Fight-System: New fresh system, something like the ATB system, which is based on different ""classes"" which you change during the fights> Leveling-System: > Port: Pretty okay, played the game with a controller and everything seems to be okay; sometimes the camera doesn't turn properly while running in one direction though- Cons: > Gameplay: Very, very linear (!!) gameplay: Slay down enemies, follow the only path form one cutscene to the other. In between some changing of gear and buying of items, bet except that, nothing you can do ""on your own"". :P> Story: The story itself is pretty okay, a classic jrpg story with a modern kind of taste, if i understood right, you have to play FF-XII-2 too, to experience the whole story. So you practically have a half story with this game..> Story-Telling: Like i said, you just watch the cutscenes for the story part of the game. So its like a semi-interactive  movie which was cut into pieces.. > No classic overworld: There are no cities, no npcs no real sidequests (except the cieth mission at the end of the game), and especially no exploring!! Also you can't get back to old levels, because there isn't something like a open world, its more a kind of journey (like i said: very linear)> Summons: Cool looks, but too long animation, also often they doesn't help you out thaaat much (i think personally)> Music: Not from Nobuo Uematsu the genius man, which made many of the popular ff music.. :( Instead there ist just background music, that is quite amtosspheric but in my opinion ""Meh"" (especially one jpop-like song ._.)> Weapons & Items: There are many Items that I didn't even use once, the weapons-skilling system is new and okay, if you know how it works (a bit confusion in the beginning). There is no armor, just weapons and accessoires, didn't like it that much..________Conclusion: I'm a big fan of Square and the Final Fantasy series, but this one is the first that didn't impressed me. (Have played five FF games yet, six with this one). For instance, FF7 is my favourite one, with much more love for detail and better over-all style, even if the graphics are pretty bad. So I'ld rather wait for FF7 remake or FFV if graphics are important for you. :) So I won't buy FF XIII-2.. :P			"

												After having this game in my library for over six months, I resolved the crash-at-the-very-beginning issue by upgrading to Windows 10. I have played about five hours of the game so far and all that I can say with certainty is that it's not engaging.The characters advance in a linear path that doesn't leave much to exploration except for a hidden object or two every now and then. Every once in a while there is a cutscene where the characters mostly follow one of three patterns, or even all three in quick succession: A) blame each other for things that aren't absolutely their fault; B) try to deliver exposition to the player, mostly unsuccessfully due to the absurd quantity of things that are established but not explained; C) get separated by the most unrealistic expedients possible (the most hilarious is when one of the characters is about at shouting distance from the others and they all decide that they don't wanna waste their time waiting for him and move on leaving him alone).The combat system is certainly innovative, but that doesn't mean it's good: you can have up to three characters in a party but can control only the main one while the other two are handled by the AI and you can only change their behaviour to match pre-determined battle schemes, and even your character is basically controlled by the AI because there is a convenient ""Auto-battle"" button that you can press to have the game select the best abilities to que up and the enemy to unleash them upon. You can, of course, try to select manually the abilities you want to use, but there really is no point when they all seem the same and the computer already chooses the ones that mostly suit the moment. So the combat mostly feels incredibly boring, and you end up just mashing the ""Auto-battle"" button for about 90% of the time.			"

												I couldn't make it past the first level of this game because of how painfully linear it was.I kid you not, the first level is consisted of you and another character WALKING IN A STRAIGHT LINE FOR AN HOUR.I'm so disappointed how un-Final Fantasy that hour was. I would've rather been playing CoD. At least then I can also crouch whilst walking in a straight line.			"

												I have major technical problems with this game. Initially after the install it would not launch at all. Had to google search some solutions, and managed to get it to work for about 70 hours, now it does not work at all.  I would not think it is worth the risk for people who are considering purchasing this game.The game itself, when able to run, is quite entertaining, definitely not the best in the series but then again not the worst. Out are all the side quests and hours of exploring towns, having time to breathe. I was able to play until Chapter Five (at which point my game failed to launch again) and it's been nothing but running away from some Government-type evil baddies. Baaaad technical support.			"

												Well, It's been since FFX (Back on PS2) that I've had the itch to play one... and although very beautiful on my PC... doesn't miss a beat, framerate and all is great looking... I feel like I'm in a tunnel... with a bit of sticky tape to hold the analogue on forward run and pressing 'A' every now and then... this game would play itself... there is 0 exploration... it's like 50GB of movies and 2GB of gameplay... I don't think I'm that enthused about it... glad I payed close to nothing for it on sale... I don't even know how far through I am, and I'm bored... skipping the movies and sick of fighting the same enemies with the same powers and the same weapons to get somwhere that no longer holds my interest as I can't even explore it... just keep on going down the tunnel....I don't know if I'm a straight NO... maybe a MAYBE... as some people like playing 'easy' games with no effort needed... so for some of you FF Fans... go for it... I just. got. really. bored.Visuals 9Gameplay 2Music -7			"

												This game deserves a maybe for diehard fans.Pros:-battle UI involving new strategies that can be customized out of battle-lots of great cutscenes and visuals-average to great dialog at times, fun new comments throughout the game-selectable resolution up to 4k-works with wireless xbox 360 controller-decent to good story at timesCons:-wonky camera that is slow and refuses to turn at times-no look speed sensitivity control-extremely linear game, it opens up more later on but is still very linear with little exploration involved-constantly sifting party members during the story is annoying as it happens extremely frequently-battle UI is somewhat repetitive in that you really need to only switch between medic and attack stance for most enemies-control over characters in battle is awkward and unenjoyable in real time battles-battles now have scores and reward you for killing enemies within a certain amount of time, this feels very out of place.-lots of items that can be upgraded but never have enough funds to rank anything besides key items, discouraging-overabundance of save points at times is odd-summons are bizarre and just plain ridiculous.  shiva turns into a motorcycle?  ugh.-no random battles, you can sneak up on enemies for back attacks but they are annoying if you do it to large groups as you must watch the visual of you hitting every single enemy in the group for no damage everytime....yeah really.It's unfortunate.  Slap in the old FF7 battle UI and random battles and this game would be much more passable.  It is horribly linear but with a wierd battle UI and enemy encounter system it makes the game so much more difficult to enjoy.  I stuck with it for quite a while because the story and characters were still interesting but this is a very forgettable game that I would never play again. "

												FF XIII's biggest flaw is its script. It's a mess. It's convoluted, confused, inconcistent, has major pacing issues, and is ultimately nonsensical. How nonsensical? The game's overall arc, and all of the conversations between the main characters & the big bad, boils down to the following exchange (Spoilers!):BIG BAD: ""You will do my will, and destroy me & because that's what I want to happen and it will trigger the creation of a new world.""CHARACTERS: ""No! We have free will, and will never do what you want! We'll fight you & kill you instead!""BIG BAD: ""…That's literally exactly what I wanted you to do.""As a result, the story kind of doesn't make any sense at all, and the problems with it are apparent at every turn. It's a shame, because the core themes of fate & free will are interesting ones. Aside from the major problem of having an arc that is self-contradictory nonsense, the script also fails in smaller ways at almost every turn. It's just bad.While FF XIII's linearity is the complaint that is at the top of most people's reasons for not liking this game, I actually don't think that's a big problem with the game. Yes, it's very linear but, really, all FF games have linear stories: the difference is that in most FF games you can decide to ignore the story for a while & go grind or just explore. The lack of a big open map does sometimes make the world feel a bit hollow, but I can understand why they decided to go in that direction, and design-wise I admit I'm a fan of an RPG that makes grinding almost impossible for most of the game and, therefore, unnecessary.The game's brightest spot is probably the combat system. it seems simplistic when you're first getting introduced to it, but as the game proceeds it opens up a lot of depth. At first I wanted to go back to the old days of specifying exact actions of every character at every turn of combat, but the combat is so much more fast paced in this iteration that I can see that wouldn't have worked. The role system enables a bunch of different strategies, and the crystarium leveling system is an interesting way of mapping XP directly to specific stat/ability changes.Ultimately, if you're a huge FF fan you may very well enjoy this game. I'm not saying it's an awful game, because it's not: it can be fun. But in the end I don't think it's worth the time you have to put into it to finish it. "

												I played this game back on the ps3 and did not get to really get into it. I havent played a Final Fantasy game in years. I am really looking forward t othe new title that comes out on the ps4 this year in the summer. I have to say this is not the best one but its pretty good. The graphics and music is very nice. The characters are very good design. I would love to play the older ones but the graphics are out of date. This one has grphics that are more up to date. I really am glad they decided to remake Final Fantasy 7, I think thats the one. I get them confused with the roman numerals and all. The one with Cloud and the guy with the gun arm. I really liked that one on the ps1. They should do that with some of the old ones. This game starts off slow but later on you get magic and level ups and everything. it starts to get better later on as the game progress. The movie scenes are all through this game. I like them but it gets kind of frustrating there is a movie scene all the time. Once I finish this one I will purchase the Lightning Returns sequel to this story.			"

												Some people complain about the linear gameplay in this game but i feel the story is what you pay for its been a while since i have been so in love with the story of a game. I baught this on the holiday sale and picked up xiii x2 as well and im already looking forward to that game. since its got the open world rpg feel i feel that this game is warming up to that one and im excited. as far as performace goes i noticed the issue everyone is complaining about with the framrate/sync/stuttering. i have a 8 core amd and a 7900 gpu, i created a profile in the catalyst control center and it all disapeered no more issues. the profile seemed to auto correct the problems. i love the game i highly recomend it, if you enjoy a great story			"

												I asked for a refund. After playing for 113 minutes, I was so bored I almost fell asleep. This game is not what I seek in a FF game.Supposedly it gets better (great even) near the end, but I don't have the time for that. Too many other games to play and books to read.			"

												I would only recommend this game on sale. The cutscenes are amazing, but that's pretty much it. The rest of the game are corridors between cutscenes. The combat systems seems promising at first but then it reveals to be very shallow. It comes down to cycling through paradigmes, there is no resource management to consider and the attacks feel very generic, not rewarding.			"

												Execellent game, strong storyline, the paradigm system is a fluid continuation of character building from the earlier final fantasy games. The summons a much harder to use. Some people will not like the linier nature of the game in the earlier stages. There is a lot of content even with that problem. This game is the total oposite of games like fallout and skyrim. Also whoever wrote the AI for the team members should be commended, it is amazing			"

												This game gets alot of stick but I have enjoyed it from start to finish. Yes the PC has had some troubles but it is a beautiful game great colour pallet and art style looks amazing in 1080. The soundtrack is second to non and could be easily included in a big budget film. Simple gameplay nothing taxing which is good, chapter 11 is where the game picks up though and you get more freedom.Great storey it does help to read the database when you get new unlocks as the storey progress doesn't do it justice.Varied characters all with unique personalities and stories which intertwine with each other.I do recommend it but it isn't everyones style buy it when it's in a sale give it ago if unsure.

This game is awesome to play and explore fully with the beautiful environment and touching story! I recommend this 100%   -FF fan			"

												The combat system is fine, but, in general, combat feels like an impediment to continuing the storyline, rather than helping it along. I found myself actively dodging enemies not because I couldn't fight them, but because I didn't want to - it was boring, tedious, and was more busy work than actual game progression.After three hours of playing, I just found myself completely uninvested in the game. That's unfortunate, because the world seems neat and with a lot of potential, but it just fails to capture your interest.			"

Posted: March 19, 2015
												I am going to give you my honest opinion of this title and the PC port. I'd just like to preface that I am not a Final Fantasy diehard/fanboy, so this review will not be influenced by rose-colored glasses or nostalgia. I'll start with the good:The Good-Amazing soundtrack-Amazing CGI-Vibrant and diverse worldI've only played two Final Fantasy titles: FFX and FFXIII. One thing they both did amazingly well was the soundtrack and the CGI for both games. Square Enix really knows how to make an incredibly engaging fantastical film out of these games. The music also is addicting and you can't get the tune out of your head. The world is also rich in detail, variety, and diversity. Unfortunately, for both titles, those are the biggest compliments I can give this franchise.The Bad-Awkward turn-based/real-time combat system-Cheesy, forgettable story-Annoying, stereotypical character personalities-Incredibly linear for 80% of the game-Virtually no graphical settings to manipulate-Horrible keybindings (controller is a must with this one)-Poorly optimized-Obnoxiously large download (Japanese VO should be a separate download)-Progression seems in-depth yet lacks executionSquare Enix has received an overwhelming amount of criticism over the years for Final Fantasy's combat system. The diehard/fanboys love the turn-based system. The more mainstream crowd doesn't find it nearly as attractive and rather archaic. FFXIII tries to please both parties by still keeping the turn-based combat, but also having more real-time elements. It's a clunky, awkward mixture that doesn't make a lot of sense and leads to a confused system. It's also incredibly redundant and there isn't a lot of depth or complexity in fighting. The most interesting aspect is being able to change your roles and abilities while in combat to accommodate different enemies.The story is generic at best, cheesy and forgettable at worse. I won't go into spoilers here, but Lightning (main protagonist) is your typical strong but silent type and many of the other characters in the roster have the same stereotypical personalities. Square Enix tries incredibly hard to make the player care about these characters as they are put through quite a few challenges and their lives are at risk, but fails due to awkward character development and an embarrasingly predictable and uninteresting story. If this game actually attempted to do anything original and not have the creativity of a five year old (too harsh?), it might be worth talking about. Not to mention, what's up with everybody's names?The game is incredibly linear for 80% of the experience. It eventually opens up in the last few chapters of the game, but the pseudo-open world is largely pointless as there is cookie cutter questing with little value to complete. This is NOT a game for those who enjoy exploration. As far as the PC port is concerned, it's an absolute joke. Square Enix didn't even bother to provide adequate support, nor did they apparently even give us the PS3 textures of the game, which were superior. You will also be waiting to play this game for quite some time as it requires almost 60GB of space due to installing both English and Japanese VO without your choice... The FFXIII-2 port is apparently better, but I am hesitant.The game has an interesting, yet convoluted progression system in which you can really build your team however you'd like. What's kind of irritating early on is you can't even choose who is in your party, so you want to make sure you have a well-rounded group. Otherwise, there seems to be so many limits with respect to what each ""role"" can do, that you probably want to have as many different roles for each character as you can. Progression with gear and crafting was also rather underwhelming. You had to find materials in the world in order to bolster your gear or purchase items. The system wasn't incredibly intuitive nor did it seem to have much depth.Final thoughts:If you can disregard everything that is wrong with the game, it is decent. I wouldn't recommend purchasing it unless it is heavily discounted given the terrible PC port. Again, the CGI and soundtrack (gets really repetitive as there really is only one memorable tune) are really the only things that stand out with this game. I'm no Final Fantasy expert, but this seems to be a trend for all of the games. Great soundtrack and CGI. Lackluster gameplay and typically a generic story with uninteresting characters. I'll play the sequel at some point as it supposedly gets better, but my expectations are extremely low.			"

												This review is rated P, for Positive.While many reviewers of this game have given it a giant negative review, for various reasons, I have found the game to be an absolute delight.While the game certainly carries on the ""passive"" feeling of Final Fantasy 12's combat system, the paradigm shifting add-on feels kind of like ""Dress sphere changing"" without the needlessly long cameos.The ""leveling"" system, rather than going by character levels, involves leveling up individual classes, which you then slot in to Paradigms, to get access to their abilities.The graphics in this game are decidedly breathtaking, with but few exceptions, and in contrast to a great many Final Fantasy games, all of the characters are not only well written in to the story, but even the whiney one, who has a vaguely Vaan/Tidus/Zidane feel to him, is neither useless, nor feeling particularly unnecessary to the story(Vaan). While some of the characters do borrow elements of their dress style(Lightning - Ashe + Squall), or general attitude(Hope - Zidane + Squall + Vaan), they aren't a direct one to one rip-off, and all have interesting motivations for being part of your story.Snow's punch-punch-punch battle style gets over-rated, eventually(As most monk-esque characters do, late game), and I would definitely nominate him for the most unnecessary feeling character in the game, but that doesn't mean his parts of the storyline aren't interesting; just his combat style is vanilla-monk feeling.Overall, this game is not as overrated as most of the reviews seem to make it out to be; though it is linear, and doesn't ""Open up much"" for most of the early game, the same arguments could be made for FFX. Perhaps the only major drawback that I would offer this game is this:If you are on a metered bandwidth, I suggest buying the disc for your game console.The game download smacks in at a 1 star dropping /FIFTY/ Gigabytes.4/5 StarsBeautiful GraphicsInteresting StorylineInteresting game mechanicsInteresting charactersShiva is a mother-♥♥♥♥ing Motorcyle(♥♥♥♥ YEAH!)-1 Star for obnoxious download size(Though it will generally feel worthwhile, as the loading screens are exceedingly minimal.)

												I don't understand why all the hate on this game when it came out.. this is my 3rd time finishing the game (twice on ps3 and once on pc) I found myself aching to play it again every two years or so. one thing  to put in mind for pc version is that it has some problems with the frames BUT there's a solution for that so look it up. my recommendation: if you're going to play the FF13 series, play this one only!(FF13-2) and (FF lightning returns) ruined the whole story for me. FF13's ending was good, and should have stayed this way. but if you don't mind the story that much then give the other FF13s a chance .. still FF13 gameplay is better than the other two.P.S. IF you're going for the achievements, there are some missable ones, so check them out before it's too late... best way to avoid that is to (NOT SELL ANYTHING) have fun.			"

												Heyyo,[Update December 29, 2015]So Square Enix never fixed this port and still suffers 30fps and below framerate issues in combat because for some reason every HUD element of this game messes up the frame pacing sigh... so I'm putting my review to not recommended.Yeah they added more resolution support... but promising 60fps and the game never keeping 60fps? Lame. Don't buy Square Enix PC ports they're all messed up apparently. [Original review]yes it's true, the port is sloppy due to resolution locked at 1280x720, framerate fluctuates depending on the HUD and USB devices and some cinematics are poorly rendered despite the steep download size due to pre-rendered cinematics (39GB of the 50GB download is cinematics).As for the game itself? It's still amazing. A fun experience with a good, albeit confusing storyline still shines... even at 720P the game still looks gorejous.I'm sure there will be patches (official or not) that will help resolve the issues mentioned above. The game runs on ""Crystal Tools"" Engine which powers Dragon Quest X and Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Rebon so it has the potential to run perfectly with even just one GPU... so it's obvious that this was a console to PC port that didn't quite get the work it needed so hopefully Square Enix gives this game a good patch or two and help fix the release date's marred public view.The game is quite linear compared to previous Final Fantasy games but there's so much storyline that it didn't use a lot of filler like old Final Fantasy games with the necessity of grinding or other methods to pad the gametime which was nice. There's also auto-heal after combat so you don't have to keep wasting mana or potions (speaking of mana, there isn't any, only Tech Points (TP) for special magic abilties / summons). So the game was built to not be slowed down by tedious tasks such as grinding which is something many jRPG's are critisized for anyways. Plus? you replenish TP by score-attack results screen at the end of combat which makes you feel challenged to defeat your enemies as efficiently as possible. So the game gets bonus points for a little modernization.Keyboard and mouse controls? They work fantastic! It's compatible with QWERT and AZERTY keyboards off the bat which is great!!! The mouse is smooth and effective for combat-use too. Left Click is your confirm, Right-click is your cancel/decline and the scroll-wheel is for cycling menus if you don't feel like using W or S. My only complaint? 0 is your Pause menu and ESC is ""Quit to Desktop"" which can be an upsetting surprise if you're not careful or know about the dreaded action of the ESC button. :POverall? The gameplay is still solid despite the port not being properly optimized on PC (performance and graphics wise).[EDIT1]Btw? For combat being stuck at 30fps? There's a problem with the HUD and the Power settings on Adapative. Here's my results either upscaled to 1080P and 4k downsamped to 1080P.http://imgur.com/a/fCXq3 "

While I only have a little over 12 hours into the game, that is more than enough for me to write a review. Everything from the gameplay to the cutscene is completely linear. The game is incredibly boring, and the characters are awfully designed. None of the characters stand out, unless you enjoy remember whiny and bratty. 5/10			"

												If you are an old school FF fan, do not buy this game. It will disappoint you.If you are an FF XII fan, do not buy this game. It is nowhere near as good as that game.If you are new to FF, do not make this one your first.As many reviews have said, it's ""on rails,"" much like an arcade FPS like House of the Dead back in the day. For an RPG, this is about the worst game design choice you could make. I know a lot of newer RPG fans (i.e. idiots) think that a role-playing game is all about story and boring cutscenes, but it is really about the battle system, crafting, classes, and exploration of a huge world. Final Fantasy XIII fails on most of these, although the battle sysem is great in my opinion. Instead of specific commands, you focus more on paradigm shifting, changing classes on the fly. It's fast-paced, fun, and strategic. I didn't like the Retry option at first as a purist, but you really need to use it because there is no ""save anywhere"" function and any battle can wipe you out in seconds, if you are not really careful.The first half of the game is all story, no exploration. I began to dread the cutscenes that popped up every two battles or so. If you thought the second half of Xenogears was bad, have the cyanide pills ready for this one. Eventually you get to Pulse, and it opens up a bit, but the sour taste is already in your mouth and it doesn't leave.As a port of a console game, it also fails, mainly because the console version is better. Even with more than the recommended specs, the camera is floaty, the framerate skippy. I had to lower the resolution so it looks bad and use a third-party app.If you want to play a decent Square RPG on Steam, I recommend The Last Remnant. It doesn't have the optimization problems, the world is much more open to explore, and the battle system is good in that one too, although different. It's strategic again, and you can't control your team individually (you can't in FF XIII either.) It is a cool system though, and keeps ATB alive.			"

												A different kind of final fantasy, it's long, it's linear, and a lot of people hate it. Personally I love this game, despite it's ungodly length, i've played through this three times, twice were on the PS3. That characters have some of the most cringeworthy lines, but if you can look past that, you will find them to be pretty decent, and the story and world is very very facinating, although it will require you to do a lot of reading in the datalog. The game has very limited freedom when it comes to places to go and explore, but at least I can say the combat is good. Most people will dismiss it as mash ""A"" to win, but there is so much more to it then that, sadly it takes many many hours for it to ramp up to that point. The difficulty curve is as slow as it can possibly be, but when you get there (Around chapter 9), you really begin to feel where this battle system's complexity lies. Anyone who tells you this game is easy and requires no effort or prebattle preparation, has never truely made it to the endgame. I assure you this game will hand you your♥♥♥♥♥at some point, and luckily it's very forgiving on game overs. It was clearly designed to encourage you to experiment and find the best way to deal with certain threats.And on to the best part of this game, the visuals. This is one of the best looking games you will see. Even years later it still beats out pretty much any other game I've come across. The animations, the effects, they are all spectacular. Playing this game is like watching a really long and pretty movie, at least until the endgame where it demands your full attention to win fights. All of this is at a cost however, this game is very demanding on your system, stay far away from this game if your computer is lower end.tl:dr It's a pretty, linear, and action packed RPG that strays a lot from other final fantasies. Do some research before you pick it up, liking final fantasy doesn't garantee you will like this game. And if you have a low end computer, don't bother with it.			"

												This was my first Final Fantasy game and I just finished the story. I'd recommend the game if you have been interested in the series for a long time and want to get into the story. If the story isn't that important I'd say the game isn't for you.Cons:-Linear gameplay. Later you are allowed to have some free range in the game, but by that point I just wanted to finish the story already-Beginning of the story's combat is very slow, boring, and repetitive-Lots of 'trash' mobs that become a nuisance. Nuisance is an understatement. To me they just felt like hellish obstacles I needed to trudge through in order to get to the next boss/cutscene.-Combat System. It's a mixture of turn based with live action. It works well for bosses but for 'trash mobs' it feels like a waste of time-Lots of grinding (personally I just used cheat engine here, it wasn't worth it imo because I hate the combat)-Shonen-esque charactersPros:Amazing cutscenesHuge worldGreat artGreat musicCharacter progression existsThe boss battles are fun "

												Love this game. I originally played it on the PS3, and now that I've been able to play the PC port, so far I'm loving it, and there's nothing wrong with it! Honestly, it should have just gone more in depth with the Lightning aspect of the story, rather than Serah and Noel in FF XIII-2. The storyline here is great!			"

												8/10 I do greatly recommend this game, especially if you plan on playing the 2nd and 3rd game but also becuase it is a solid and well rounded RPG. It does have some flaws like most games but the good out ways the bad.THE BAD: FInal Fantasy has always been about deep and rich story telling, this game falls a little short of that expectation. The story does grab you from the word ""go"", but it leads you forward with little in the way of background information on the common enemy of the game, and when you have an enemy that has played a log lasting role like this one, you need that history to better soidify the events of the story. The biggest downer is that most of the story is spent going from one place to the next with no freedom of ware you are going and there is no going back.THE GOOD: The game itself has a lot to offer. The battle system is an engaging expierence that takes ""know your enemy"" to a new level. It requires you to plan ahead and to quikly react with more agresive monsters while still keeping the gameplay itself on a casual level. Items and weapons equiped are a big part of the battling process, along with the usable items that you keep on hand. The shopping system is brand new to this game. The shops can be accsessed at any of the save points. The shops themselves are obtained in battle by progressing in the story but there are a few secret shops that are not linked to the stroy missions. This game also brings back monster hunting missions that are optional but are also fun and can be quite the challenge. the leveling process is also a newer feature to Final Fantasy that features a growth tree of roles that you add ponits to to increases the character and the roles effects in battle. On a graphics level that game itself is one big piece of eye candy. From the scenery to the battle ground the screen is filled with collor and life that never getts dull to look at.			"

												Anyone who actually has a halfway decent PC, beware of this poorly executed port. My GTX 980 should more than be able to run this port of a PS3 game, but Square Enix clearly didn't bother to test this port with any modern software or halfway decent graphic cards. In windowed mode at 720p res settings with MSAA at minimum and shadows at a low setting, the game ran consistently at 30 fps in most areas, until a battle or cutscene starts, where the framerate jumps between 60 and 15 in a matter of seconds and continues to fluctuate in this manner, dropping whenever any movement or spell effect occurs. Not only does this make battles impossible to keep track of or even look at without wanting to barf, it causes a slight de sync in cutscenes that can be annoying at times and just awful at others. Also, the game does not look good. The higher resolutions are okay, but the AA is consistently ugly, even at 16x. Lightning's hair can look very pixelated at times from it and it effects the other characters and the surroundings as well. It's distracting and it makes the PS3 version look like heaven in comparison. And if your performance requires you to lower the shadows, enjoy them. They turn into blocky messes at anything below the two higher settings.As for the game itself, it's Final Fantasy XIII. Go look at everybody else's opinion. This port just goes even further to highlight what a let-down this game is, as well as Square Enix's performance as of late. My only hope is that Final Fantasy XV gets a better pc release. Or at least that Lightning Returns does.The game itself is a 7/10. This port is a 4/10, being barely playable for those with high pc gaming and RPG standards.Note: Some people have no performance issues with their systems and I understand that. But that's some people. The others have a right to know what they're getting into. That's why I'm downvoting it.			"

												I bought this game and the sequel over the weekend. Frame rate issues for XIII while running an AMD R9, 3.6Ghz AMD FX-8150, 64 bit Win 8.1, 8GB Ram rig. I didn't even bother trying to play XIII-2 (though I purchased it). I searched the internet and forums. Looks like this game doesn't generally play well with AMD graphics. I got a full refund for both games within 24 hours.If you're running an NVidia setup you're probably fine. If you're running AMD, beware. If this game ever gets its compatibility fixed I absolutely will buy it again. I've watched a friend play it on PS and it was great.			"

												My first game on FF was FF12 and it was an epic game never forget how many times and hours i've been playing that game and the story is great with the hunt mission make it even greater. but wtf is wrong with FF13? for the first time in my life i've been playing an RPG game without knowing whats wrong with the story! what the heck with I'cie, Fal'cie or everything like that? I don't know why the cocoon people hate them so much, I'm on chapter 10 so far and guess what? I still have no idea about what's going on with the story on this game.And for the gameplay it's not hard to control your character with keyboard but the battle system is iritating why can't I control the character while the battle is on? and your character must do something when the paradigm changed? i've been hit so many times when the paradigm changed, luckily non have cause death. the battle system is just like the story of this game ""THERE'S NO FREEDOM FOR PLAYER!"".the graphic was really good but again whats wrong with the battle system? this game is just like a middle class food made out of high quality ingridients.One more thing about this game 50% of the storyline is cut scene, the heck with this? Don't buy this game unless you are someone who like to hear story telling before you go to sleep.			"

												I have major technical problems with this game. Initially after the install it would not launch at all. Had to google search some solutions, and managed to get it to work for about 70 hours, now it does not work at all.  I would not think it is worth the risk for people who are considering purchasing this game.The game itself, when able to run, is quite entertaining, definitely not the best in the series but then again not the worst. Out are all the side quests and hours of exploring towns, having time to breathe. I was able to play until Chapter Five (at which point my game failed to launch again) and it's been nothing but running away from some Government-type evil baddies. Baaaad technical support.			"

												Well, It's been since FFX (Back on PS2) that I've had the itch to play one... and although very beautiful on my PC... doesn't miss a beat, framerate and all is great looking... I feel like I'm in a tunnel... with a bit of sticky tape to hold the analogue on forward run and pressing 'A' every now and then... this game would play itself... there is 0 exploration... it's like 50GB of movies and 2GB of gameplay... I don't think I'm that enthused about it... glad I payed close to nothing for it on sale... I don't even know how far through I am, and I'm bored... skipping the movies and sick of fighting the same enemies with the same powers and the same weapons to get somwhere that no longer holds my interest as I can't even explore it... just keep on going down the tunnel....I don't know if I'm a straight NO... maybe a MAYBE... as some people like playing 'easy' games with no effort needed... so for some of you FF Fans... go for it...

												I have to say, I have only played FF I, II, VI, X and X-2The first part is very linear, you have a goal, there is nothing to explore but the path to the objective, but, with that negative side of the game, I am enjoying while I playEDIT# Now I only have 25 hrs or so in-game and I'm just not captivated, yo have to spend 10 min to fight a monster which otherwise will block your way, really? Not that is hard, but is so time demanding jeez, I can only play for about 5 min and then I get bored and I close the game. Why? I don't know the game is so fancy that it failed to captivate and motivate me to play, unfortunately.IMPORTANT FOR NEW BUYERSYou may face a problem, like I did, this one is the only I got so farWhen initializing the game, it sets up a launcher, if you launch, the game might not even load, this is because DEP (Data Execution Prevention) is active, to put the game to load well and normally do thisGo to System, on Control Panel, Advanced Settings, go on Advanced tab, Performance and click on the last appearing tabSelect the 2 option out of the 2, then click on the add button and search in this directoryD:\SteamLibrary\SteamApps\common\FINAL FANTASY XIII\white_data\prog\win\bin (whatever directory you installed the game and only 1 file should appear, click it and DEP now opens an exception for FFXIIIHope this helped ^^			"

												Haven't beaten it yet but I think I have a pretty good feel of the game at this point.5 - excellent4 - great3 - good2 - fair1 - badCharacters: ExcellentGameplay: goodStory: fairFlow: badThoughts: I really like the characters. They are all unique and add a ton of flavor to the story's progression. Unlike 10, 9, or 8 (one's I've played), I don't feel like there is a ""main"" protagonist in 13. All the characters are very relevant and lightnings role is maybe only slightly more than the others. That being said, story was very poorly presented. I still feel very confused as to what is going on even after 25 hours of and being maybe completing 2/3s of the game. For example, I'm not totally sure if cocoon is a planet, a city, or an island in the sky. All I know is that cocoon and gran pulse are different. Overall, I recommend it but probably not my favorite Final Fantasy.			"

												Rating the game in its final form without any mods, the game is poorly optimized for the pc. The game looks visually ugly on my 1080p monitor. I currently suffer from frame drops on a r9 280x and i5-3570k during fight scenes and I am highly disappointed in this product. Mod makers do soften the blow on this ugly product however. Though less inclined pc users will find it difficult to understand among the tech jargon.My suggestion is to save your money and use it to buy other games like alien:isolation.12/12/2014 *UPDATE*Developers listened to the consumers and so I will raise this thumb up once more for squareenix. It looks great.			"

												Everyone who says ""the game is rubbish"", ""it isn't Final Fantasy"" and even those who say ""it only gets good after 10 hours"", in my opinion, are wrong. I enjoyed the game from the start. I've not played FF since FFX cameout and although things have changed it still has all the components I expect of a Final Fantasy game. I ESPECIALLY don't get the complaints that it is too linear as FF has always been relatively linear, with most freedom of choice having no real impact on the game. Even one of my favoutie games ever, FFVII, is pretty linear in my opinion. If you are looking for an epic, cinematic, JRPG then you will probably enjoy it. Some of the characters are a bit annoying or ""teenagery"" but that is often the case with JRPGs and Final Fantasy in my expereience, sometimes it is endearing but more often an annoyance that can easily be overlooked.As with most FF games the game is beautiful (not the best graphics but the artstyle itself is gorgeous) and great music. I also really like the animations and movement in the turn based battles, makes them more interesting to watch than in the older games. The setting and story are pretty interesting. I really like the setting and the story is quite good.Is it the best Final Fantasy in the series? No, not at all. Does it feel like Final Fantasy? Yes. And I was happy with the price I paid for it in the sale. I would recommend to a fan of the series but point someone new to FFVII or IX (my favourites of the PS1-onward era of FF games). I really feel like many of these reviews saying it is not-final fantasy like because it is linear must come from people who have clouded memorys, have became used to Western action RPGs or are just crazy.I have experienced none of the graphical or FPS issues reported by some users. I have a quite good but not super PC.			"

It didn't even feel like a FF game until I got to Pulse.Cut scenes are in random places.Characters are shallow for the most part.Battle system is unnecessarily complex, so you end up using Autobattle most of the timeLevels are capped for most sections of the gameCharacter classes are not straight-forward (e.g. only one character can learn haste for the majority of the game; a different character developing under the same class can't learn the same spells/abilities) and some classes are largely useless (e.g. Sentinel)Paradigms that you have used successfully for 99% of the game are completely useless in the last few boss battles.

												Despite many of my friends giving negative comments on this game, I bought it anyway. This is what I found after I finished  the game:First of all, the battle system is really badly desgined. Only 1 character in the party is controlled by the player and the others are operated by AI which the problem is, sometimes the way they casting spells seems like trolling. For example, medic keep on healing while what you need is removing some nasty negative buffs; Commando hitting the monsters that isn't your primary target, you target monster A, they will hit monster B. But if you switch target to monster B, they will hit monster A instead. I've lost countless battles because of this.second thing, the gameplay is really bad. 1 skill from the monsters will make you get all the negative buffs but Esuna can only remove 1 negative buffs while it cost a lot of time. Those who played final fantasy series know that Esuna cures all the negative buffs, I don't know why this one is exception. Death skill has only 1% success rate, this is really joke. It will take you a whole afternoon just to kill a monster if this is your last resort while a boss I met at late game have 100% success rate of death. The party leader gets it and its game over. Not to mention the last stage of crystarium can only be unlocked after you finished the game which is really stupid design.The strongest weapon can only be obtained through hack. No matter how strong you are, there is always a tortoise out there who can kill you in 1 shot, am I playing Tortoise Fantasy XIII now?? for me, this game is strongly not recommended unless you want to find some time of frustration.

												The combat system is fine, but, in general, combat feels like an impediment to continuing the storyline, rather than helping it along. I found myself actively dodging enemies not because I couldn't fight them, but because I didn't want to - it was boring, tedious, and was more busy work than actual game progression.After three hours of playing, I just found myself completely uninvested in the game. That's unfortunate, because the world seems neat and with a lot of potential, but it just fails to capture your interest.			"

Get ready to do a bit of work just to get this to run properly, etc. Other than that, the game is fun. Decent story (somewhat forgetable), decent characters, awesome visuals, and a pretty fun battle system make this a worthy investment. There is a nice challenge to the game, but it doesn't feel overtly difficult. I liked it. I had fun. Its worth a shot.			"

												It's a very  underrated game in my opinion . It has a pretty tough combat style but it gets easier when you get used to it .Its story is extremely complicated  for no reason at all  and doesn't make much sense , to me at least ...(maybe i'm stupid).Its graphics are amazing , that makes up for the complicated story  , all one needs is pretty colours and beautiful scenery  , f*ck the story . I guess it's worth if you re a hardcore  RPG fan  since this one will keep you occupied for a fair amount of time , escpecially if you want to complete everything in the game .Lastly FFX/X-2 remasted HD now available  on steam just go and buy that one if you re  not sure about this one .

I would've rather been playing CoD. At least then I can also crouch whilst walking in a straight line.			"

												FF XIII's biggest flaw is its script. It's a mess. It's convoluted, confused, inconcistent, has major pacing issues, and is ultimately nonsensical. How nonsensical? The game's overall arc, and all of the conversations between the main characters & the big bad, boils down to the following exchange (Spoilers!):BIG BAD: ""You will do my will, and destroy me & because that's what I want to happen and it will trigger the creation of a new world.""CHARACTERS: ""No! We have free will, and will never do what you want! We'll fight you & kill you instead!""BIG BAD: ""…That's literally exactly what I wanted you to do.""As a result, the story kind of doesn't make any sense at all, and the problems with it are apparent at every turn. It's a shame, because the core themes of fate & free will are interesting ones. Aside from the major problem of having an arc that is self-contradictory nonsense, the script also fails in smaller ways at almost every turn. It's just bad.While FF XIII's linearity is the complaint that is at the top of most people's reasons for not liking this game, I actually don't think that's a big problem with the game. Yes, it's very linear but, really, all FF games have linear stories: the difference is that in most FF games you can decide to ignore the story for a while & go grind or just explore. The lack of a big open map does sometimes make the world feel a bit hollow, but I can understand why they decided to go in that direction, and design-wise I admit I'm a fan of an RPG that makes grinding almost impossible for most of the game and, therefore, unnecessary.The game's brightest spot is probably the combat system. it seems simplistic when you're first getting introduced to it, but as the game proceeds it opens up a lot of depth. At first I wanted to go back to the old days of specifying exact actions of every character at every turn of combat, but the combat is so much more fast paced in this iteration that I can see that wouldn't have worked. The role system enables a bunch of different strategies, and the crystarium leveling system is an interesting way of mapping XP directly to specific stat/ability changes.Ultimately, if you're a huge FF fan you may very well enjoy this game. I'm not saying it's an awful game, because it's not: it can be fun. But in the end I don't think it's worth the time you have to put into it to finish it. "

												This game deserves a maybe for diehard fans.Pros:-battle UI involving new strategies that can be customized out of battle-lots of great cutscenes and visuals-average to great dialog at times, fun new comments throughout the game-selectable resolution up to 4k-works with wireless xbox 360 controller-decent to good story at timesCons:-wonky camera that is slow and refuses to turn at times-no look speed sensitivity control-extremely linear game, it opens up more later on but is still very linear with little exploration involved-constantly sifting party members during the story is annoying as it happens extremely frequently-battle UI is somewhat repetitive in that you really need to only switch between medic and attack stance for most enemies-control over characters in battle is awkward and unenjoyable in real time battles-battles now have scores and reward you for killing enemies within a certain amount of time, this feels very out of place.-lots of items that can be upgraded but never have enough funds to rank anything besides key items, discouraging-overabundance of save points at times is odd-summons are bizarre and just plain ridiculous.  shiva turns into a motorcycle?  ugh.-no random battles, you can sneak up on enemies for back attacks but they are annoying if you do it to large groups as you must watch the visual of you hitting every single enemy in the group for no damage everytime....yeah really.It's unfortunate.  Slap in the old FF7 battle UI and random battles and this game would be much more passable.  It is horribly linear but with a wierd battle UI and enemy encounter system it makes the game so much more difficult to enjoy.  I stuck with it for quite a while because the story and characters were still interesting but this is a very forgettable game that I would never play again. "

												I enjoy the Final Fantasy games and this one is no exception, but I have to suggest that you play this on a game console not the PC if that is available.  It has crashed a number of times while playing it.  I have up-to-date drivers and don't have issues like this with other games that I own.Its not unplayable.  It crashes infrequently enough to play but still frequently enough for me to call the game unstable.  I've never had that issue on any console versions of any Final Fantasy game on PS, PS2, or Xbox 360.   The issue might be limited to a particular graphics effect that some bosses use or some kind of leak in the reloading system because these crashes usually seem to happen when I have to keep retrying a boss fight that I have failed.  Currently I am fighting Barthandelus the second time in the game and it has crashed three times in about 3 hours as I keep retrying this fight.			"

												It's hard to reccomend a game where the first 20 or so hours are full of awkward cutscenes and hand-holding tutorials however, FFXIII's mid to late gameplay make up for the (very) slow start. One of the biggest problem with the game is the inconsistency in preformance with the port. You must have a controller plugged into your computer or else, the framerate will be terrible. There is also an annoying glitch at resolutions greater than 720p where no flavor text is shown when you libra a target. On the character front, the japanese voice acting adds a lot compared to the english however, this only slightly changes the way you percieve the characters. Yes hope is still annoying and lightning is just a female cloud strife however, you don't have to deal with fang and vanille's english voice actors so that's a plus. I would actually reccomend whether this is your first time playing or not to import a save file that simply puts you in the very beginning of the area known as ""gran pulse"" and just to start playing from there. Any information you want to know can be gleamed by looking at the codex.			"

												Brilliant game! Loved it on console and now loving it on PC :) many Final Fantasy Fans don't seem to like it but this one is my favorite (yes I played Crisis Core and some others). Sure, the combat system is not as actively engaging as in others FF parts but it appeals to me and you have to plan with lots of strategy sometimes. The story is lovely as always. The game takes you by the hand until chapter 11, then you can pretty much do what you want in an open world. Then you can spend hundreds of hours in this game. I recommend it but if you're not sure, watch some gameplay and decide :)			"

												Final Fantasy is my second final fantasy game that I've played, with the first being Final Fantasy X-2. While I only have a little over 12 hours into the game, that is more than enough for me to write a review. Everything from the gameplay to the cutscene is completely linear. The game is incredibly boring, and the characters are awfully designed. None of the characters stand out, unless you enjoy remember whiny and bratty. 5/10			"

												If you are an old school FF fan, do not buy this game. It will disappoint you.If you are an FF XII fan, do not buy this game. It is nowhere near as good as that game.If you are new to FF, do not make this one your first.As many reviews have said, it's ""on rails,"" much like an arcade FPS like House of the Dead back in the day. For an RPG, this is about the worst game design choice you could make. I know a lot of newer RPG fans (i.e. idiots) think that a role-playing game is all about story and boring cutscenes, but it is really about the battle system, crafting, classes, and exploration of a huge world. Final Fantasy XIII fails on most of these, although the battle sysem is great in my opinion. Instead of specific commands, you focus more on paradigm shifting, changing classes on the fly. It's fast-paced, fun, and strategic. I didn't like the Retry option at first as a purist, but you really need to use it because there is no ""save anywhere"" function and any battle can wipe you out in seconds, if you are not really careful.The first half of the game is all story, no exploration. I began to dread the cutscenes that popped up every two battles or so. If you thought the second half of Xenogears was bad, have the cyanide pills ready for this one. Eventually you get to Pulse, and it opens up a bit, but the sour taste is already in your mouth and it doesn't leave.As a port of a console game, it also fails, mainly because the console version is better. Even with more than the recommended specs, the camera is floaty, the framerate skippy. I had to lower the resolution so it looks bad and use a third-party app.If you want to play a decent Square RPG on Steam, I recommend The Last Remnant. It doesn't have the optimization problems, the world is much more open to explore, and the battle system is good in that one too, although different. It's strategic again, and you can't control your team individually (you can't in FF XIII either.) It is a cool system though, and keeps ATB alive.			"

												A different kind of final fantasy, it's long, it's linear, and a lot of people hate it. Personally I love this game, despite it's ungodly length, i've played through this three times, twice were on the PS3. That characters have some of the most cringeworthy lines, but if you can look past that, you will find them to be pretty decent, and the story and world is very very facinating, although it will require you to do a lot of reading in the datalog. The game has very limited freedom when it comes to places to go and explore, but at least I can say the combat is good. Most people will dismiss it as mash ""A"" to win, but there is so much more to it then that, sadly it takes many many hours for it to ramp up to that point. The difficulty curve is as slow as it can possibly be, but when you get there (Around chapter 9), you really begin to feel where this battle system's complexity lies. Anyone who tells you this game is easy and requires no effort or prebattle preparation, has never truely made it to the endgame. I assure you this game will hand you your♥♥♥♥♥at some point, and luckily it's very forgiving on game overs. It was clearly designed to encourage you to experiment and find the best way to deal with certain threats.And on to the best part of this game, the visuals. This is one of the best looking games you will see. Even years later it still beats out pretty much any other game I've come across. The animations, the effects, they are all spectacular. Playing this game is like watching a really long and pretty movie, at least until the endgame where it demands your full attention to win fights. All of this is at a cost however, this game is very demanding on your system, stay far away from this game if your computer is lower end.tl:dr It's a pretty, linear, and action packed RPG that strays a lot from other final fantasies. Do some research before you pick it up, liking final fantasy doesn't garantee you will like this game. And if you have a low end computer, don't bother with it.			"

												This was my first Final Fantasy game and I just finished the story. I'd recommend the game if you have been interested in the series for a long time and want to get into the story. If the story isn't that important I'd say the game isn't for you.Cons:-Linear gameplay. Later you are allowed to have some free range in the game, but by that point I just wanted to finish the story already-Beginning of the story's combat is very slow, boring, and repetitive-Lots of 'trash' mobs that become a nuisance. Nuisance is an understatement. To me they just felt like hellish obstacles I needed to trudge through in order to get to the next boss/cutscene.-Combat System. It's a mixture of turn based with live action. It works well for bosses but for 'trash mobs' it feels like a waste of time-Lots of grinding (personally I just used cheat engine here, it wasn't worth it imo because I hate the combat)-Shonen-esque charactersPros:Amazing cutscenesHuge worldGreat artGreat musicCharacter progression existsThe boss battles are fun "

I don't know why the cocoon people hate them so much, I'm on chapter 10 so far and guess what? I still have no idea about what's going on with the story on this game.And for the gameplay it's not hard to control your character with keyboard but the battle system is iritating why can't I control the character while the battle is on? and your character must do something when the paradigm changed? i've been hit so many times when the paradigm changed, luckily non have cause death. the battle system is just like the story of this game ""THERE'S NO FREEDOM FOR PLAYER!"".the graphic was really good but again whats wrong with the battle system? this game is just like a middle class food made out of high quality ingridients.One more thing about this game 50% of the storyline is cut scene, the heck with this?

												8/10 I do greatly recommend this game, especially if you plan on playing the 2nd and 3rd game but also becuase it is a solid and well rounded RPG. It does have some flaws like most games but the good out ways the bad.THE BAD: FInal Fantasy has always been about deep and rich story telling, this game falls a little short of that expectation. The story does grab you from the word ""go"", but it leads you forward with little in the way of background information on the common enemy of the game, and when you have an enemy that has played a log lasting role like this one, you need that history to better soidify the events of the story. The biggest downer is that most of the story is spent going from one place to the next with no freedom of ware you are going and there is no going back.THE GOOD: The game itself has a lot to offer. The battle system is an engaging expierence that takes ""know your enemy"" to a new level. It requires you to plan ahead and to quikly react with more agresive monsters while still keeping the gameplay itself on a casual level. Items and weapons equiped are a big part of the battling process, along with the usable items that you keep on hand. The shopping system is brand new to this game. The shops can be accsessed at any of the save points. The shops themselves are obtained in battle by progressing in the story but there are a few secret shops that are not linked to the stroy missions. This game also brings back monster hunting missions that are optional but are also fun and can be quite the challenge. the leveling process is also a newer feature to Final Fantasy that features a growth tree of roles that you add ponits to to increases the character and the roles effects in battle. On a graphics level that game itself is one big piece of eye candy. From the scenery to the battle ground the screen is filled with collor and life that never getts dull to look at.			"

												8/10 I do greatly recommend this game, especially if you plan on playing the 2nd and 3rd game but also becuase it is a solid and well rounded RPG. It does have some flaws like most games but the good out ways the bad.THE BAD: FInal Fantasy has always been about deep and rich story telling, this game falls a little short of that expectation. The story does grab you from the word ""go"", but it leads you forward with little in the way of background information on the common enemy of the game, and when you have an enemy that has played a log lasting role like this one, you need that history to better soidify the events of the story. The biggest downer is that most of the story is spent going from one place to the next with no freedom of ware you are going and there is no going back.THE GOOD: The game itself has a lot to offer. The battle system is an engaging expierence that takes ""know your enemy"" to a new level. It requires you to plan ahead and to quikly react with more agresive monsters while still keeping the gameplay itself on a casual level. Items and weapons equiped are a big part of the battling process, along with the usable items that you keep on hand. The shopping system is brand new to this game. The shops can be accsessed at any of the save points. The shops themselves are obtained in battle by progressing in the story but there are a few secret shops that are not linked to the stroy missions. This game also brings back monster hunting missions that are optional but are also fun and can be quite the challenge. the leveling process is also a newer feature to Final Fantasy that features a growth tree of roles that you add ponits to to increases the character and the roles effects in battle. On a graphics level that game itself is one big piece of eye candy. From the scenery to the battle ground the screen is filled with collor and life that never getts dull to look at.			"

												Final Fantasy is my second final fantasy game that I've played, with the first being Final Fantasy X-2. While I only have a little over 12 hours into the game, that is more than enough for me to write a review. Everything from the gameplay to the cutscene is completely linear. The game is incredibly boring, and the characters are awfully designed. None of the characters stand out, unless you enjoy remember whiny and bratty. 5/10			"

												This was my first Final Fantasy game and I just finished the story. I'd recommend the game if you have been interested in the series for a long time and want to get into the story. If the story isn't that important I'd say the game isn't for you.Cons:-Linear gameplay. Later you are allowed to have some free range in the game, but by that point I just wanted to finish the story already-Beginning of the story's combat is very slow, boring, and repetitive-Lots of 'trash' mobs that become a nuisance. Nuisance is an understatement. To me they just felt like hellish obstacles I needed to trudge through in order to get to the next boss/cutscene.-Combat System. It's a mixture of turn based with live action. It works well for bosses but for 'trash mobs' it feels like a waste of time-Lots of grinding (personally I just used cheat engine here, it wasn't worth it imo because I hate the combat)-Shonen-esque charactersPros:Amazing cutscenesHuge worldGreat artGreat musicCharacter progression existsThe boss battles are fun "

												FF13 is different from the rest of the series. The graphics are amazing, the character designs look crisp. The music is different from Nobuo's work, but it grows on you like any other soundtracks. The gameplay is different, very different. It's extremely fast paced and a lot of the time you feel like you are just ramming one button. Most people complain about the linearity of the game but I'm glad that's the case. For someone who doesnt like to explore but just to get absorbed into the world and progress through a story without much effort, this is the type of game for you (and me).			"

												I always hear that Final fantasy is a great franchise and perhaps it is, but sadly I had to start with the worse game in the franchise. Pro. (no s at the end because there was only one)The graphics are pretty nice and the game is aesthetically pleasing but I am not sure I found anything else going for the game.-game looks niceConS. (capital S because there are a lot)I didn't get any sort of customization until about 2 hours into the game, (I watched all of the cutscense, mistake). I found it a bit dissapointing that I couldn't name my charcter but I could understand that because they actually said the characters names, (even though the acting is not good). The game starts off entirely too slow, I can't even really do anything wrong because they gave me a whole bunch of items to heal and revive my characters. I don't even get to make little choices that have no effect on the story. The battles aren't even close to fun, the game decides what I do in the battles and then I win with almost no thought. And when I finally got to do some sort of customiaztion with their leveling, it was ridiculous. I don't get to pick what classes they go into and even the leveling is linear. -very slow start-crappy leveling system-very boring story that if you don't watch makes the game pointless but if you do watch you are just bored.-no customization of characters (in an RPG I can't customize my characters at all, really?)-too easy-no choices can be made to effect the story.Needless to say. don't get this unless you are a child that likes bright lights and likes games that aren't too hard. Perhaps some of these things would have changed if I had kept playing but I am not gonna force myself through a  1/4 of the game just because there is a small chance I might like the other 3/4's of it, P.S.How is it possible that the reviews are mostly positive?? If you gave this game a thumbs up, you just love other FF games too much to be honest or forced yourself to fall in love with this game by playing it all the way through to be loyal to the franchise and at the end said, ""Well I could have spent all my time cyber bullying someone but since this game kept me from doing that, it must not be too bad.""

												This game gets alot of stick but I have enjoyed it from start to finish. Yes the PC has had some troubles but it is a beautiful game great colour pallet and art style looks amazing in 1080. The soundtrack is second to non and could be easily included in a big budget film. Simple gameplay nothing taxing which is good, chapter 11 is where the game picks up though and you get more freedom.Great storey it does help to read the database when you get new unlocks as the storey progress doesn't do it justice.Varied characters all with unique personalities and stories which intertwine with each other.I do recommend it but it isn't everyones style buy it when it's in a sale give it ago if unsure.

This game is awesome to play and explore fully with the beautiful environment and touching story! I recommend this 100%   -FF fan			"

 A story so convoluted, I bet the characters are still wondering what’s going on There are some games I like, this is not one of them. There are other games that I hate; this is not one of them. There are few games which I will defend to the grave – Final Fantasy XIII is not one of them. This game falls into an unusual category. It is a game which I feel I am not allowed to love. Why you may ask? Well it is simple, and it explains why I must write this review with a huge amount of caution. The reason I have to make such a drastic statement before getting to the heart of the actual review is because I am 100% aware of the criticism this games receive, and I won’t disagree with most of these criticisms. In other words, there are very valid reasons for criticising the game, but It is for you to decide whether you view these criticisms as actual criticisms or strengths of the game. What I must point out is that this game is not fundamentally flawed or broken in its game design.Large amounts of the game’s criticism surround three main areas: story, characters and gameplay. I’ll tackle each in turn. There is a brief separate comment to be said about the quality of the port itself: essentially what I can say is that there have been reported framerate issues and stuttering. However, I experienced very few noticeable problems, especially considering I played the game when it was originally released for the Xbox 360. What I would say is to double check that your PC is close to the recommended rather than minimum system requirements. *No spoilers* Story There are two main types of story driven games: those which take the player through a chronological journey from start to finish with very few disturbances in the ordinary sequence of events. This is a safe route to use, particularly for a JRPG which relies on using more creative conventions and methods of storytelling. The second main type throws the gamer in the middle of things. Instead of showing the player the background information leading up to the main events within the story, the game throws the player in the middle of an already chaotic situation. Final Fantasy 13 takes the second form. The game begins in the middle of conflict between several conflicting sides of society: The oppressive government known as the Sanctum on the one hand and the ordinary citizens on the other who are being purged by the Sanctum for coming into contact with a Pulse Fal’Cie. Final Fantasy 13 is the kind of game which requires you to be willingly engaged and interested in the story. Not being so will result in you as a player losing the plot (and I mean that literally). Playing this kind of game requires attention to detail which typically is not present in the majority of Final Fantasy games which take the standard beginning-middle-end format. Whilst the game may be linear, it does not hold your hand with its story.  Characters Lightning: Not one to bring to parties…One of the criticisms of the game is that the main protagonist, Lightning, lacks character and personality. It’s easy to understand why people would have that view. My cat expresses more emotion than Lightning ever does across the three games in the series – and my cat sleeps all day. Ironically I argue that her cold-heartedness, the monotone aggression, the bitterness she expresses against Snow all add to her character, and that character is a seemingly fearless woman who ends up being overcome by the one thing she lacks… her emotion. Dramatic monologue aside, the supporting cast are quite varied in personality, Sazh being one of my favourites and Vanille being… Have you ever heard the sound of a young child trying to play the violin for the very first time? Well that sound describes Vanille's character... Okay I confess I liked her by the end of the series. Gameplay The final criticism that the game has been flooded with is fundamental issues with the game itself. A huge criticism is that the game is largely linear. This is a fair criticism if the defining feature of Final Fantasy games in your opinion is the open world and the focus on exploration, or if you dislike linear games in general. Personally, my attraction to the characters and my enjoyment of other things such as the music and the gameplay enabled me to overlook this criticism, but again, I understand and accept this to be a valid criticism of a game within a franchise which is so reliant on freedom and adventure. It worked for Final Fantasy 10, but 10 had a certain humility about it which 13 admittedly lacked. I personally felt that 13 was too adamant on expressing the huge cinematics and beautiful graphics which Final Fantasy games have never really been so dependent upon. I often hear arguments that the turn based battle system is dying. I actually felt 13 attempted to reinvigorate and give the system a fresh look. I would even go as far to say that it has kept the turn based system alive. Whilst it may not have been as complex as previous systems, it had its own uniqueness. In short, 13’s paradigm system involves switching between different combinations of magic that you can freely alter throughout the game. As the game progresses, character’s gradually unlock stronger magic and various stat upgrades. It is a far simpler method of levelling up character stats and abilities, but requires some planning in order to overcome difficult bosses.  Music Say what you want about the quality of the game itself. If you argue that the character’s sucked, I’ll accept it; if you argue that the story sucked, I’ll accept it, but if you argue that the music sucked… Well I’ll have to unleash the Behemoth within me. Whilst the soundtrack was not composed by my beloved Nobuo Uematsu, for once it honestly did not matter. Masashi Hamauzu did an incredible job of capturing the sense of isolation, oppression and the emotional complexity of characters such as Lightning in a diverse soundtrack. Whilst there were pieces which were played incredibly frequently, the quality of the soundtrack made up for this. The battle theme ‘Blinded by Light’ was particularly able to recreate the intensity maintained throughout the game whilst continuing the bass motif’s found in every battle theme in the franchise. Other incredible pieces include: ‘The Promise,’ ‘Sazh’s Theme,’ ‘March of the Dreadnoughts,’ ‘Hope’s Theme’ and ‘Vanille’s Theme (not to give any credit to Vanille by the way).’ Conclusion  Final Fantasy 13 is one of those rare games which I still struggle to explain why I love so much. Whilst it would fail to reach my favourite Final Fantasy games, that does not retract from the genuine enjoyment I experienced playing this game 3 times over. I’m in the process of doing a Final Fantasy marathon (FF1 – 13) and I am looking forward to replaying the 13 series. Even if you didn’t enjoy 13 itself, the sequels are amazing games in their own right but I’ll save those reviews for another time. In summary, I do love this game. Perhaps I was literally blinded by the light of a franchise which I adore, but as I mentioned, there are genuine reasons to love this game, just as there are reasons to despise it. I do believe the game receives way too much criticism than it actually deserves but those criticisms aren’t found on some imaginary basis. I once honestly believed I was the only person who actually liked this game at one point. The ultimate question however is should you buy this game? For the first time, I will copout and leave the decision up to you, the reader, taking into account what you like in a Final Fantasy game and what you dislike. If I attempted to score this game, I fear I would be giving some arbitrary number which does not actually represent anything at all.			"

												Being a newbie at JRPG's I had a steep learning curve, but quickly found myself wondering how the clock got so late. I made the mistake of first playing FF XIII-2 and was extremely confused. If you have not played XIII yet, I highly suggest playing the first one before moving on to the second. I normally prefer being more involved in my RPGs, but this is a completely different genre with its own appeal. After completing the second chapter the game gets more involved. Think of the first few chapters as training. FF XIII is the first FInal Fantasy I have played (other than the MMO) and I think it is here to stay!			"

												Great Game for kids, except the mix-up with mild themes of things; needs to be sorted out. But other then it is ment for children very easy game, as so far it is very captavating, drawing you in. Of course I like how the hero's don't die. But fall when they ""die"". and then it let's you start right back where you were right before the battle. Also I enjoyed the item's and leveling unquie system; and such very rare games; such as Pokemon. You can view you enemy's weakinesses. It's a kid's game. But yet adults who have played it for from beginning such Final Fantasy the first editon or III-XII and even X-II and X. Works quite well. As they are adding it sutitle changes to each new game; to see what their player-base people like and dislike. And yes. There are ONLY two modes to play on Normal and Easy. Adults and children. If following the tutorial; Is a part of the game; which greatly helps. But for adults there are many options to find. Which should be explanied to both(Children and Adults); as my kids would like to play as I do. They would like to know the enemy weakness, yet it's not in the tutorial. The tutorial can be skip through. Which I don't like, yet the ones that stick with the tutorial on going to do much better; and play longer. And of replay value so far seems pretty intersting as seems to be randomized. Which I do like. Such number of this number that. Of course one major thing, I do and somewhat not use to. Is playing different character's. Such as each character has an AoE, and if you wait long enough for the attack, and the enemy's to line up correctly; or perhaps gather then, that's when you strike. Much movement with the enemy or computer; is quite nice. As it's adds a spin to when to attack, and when to defend; if done proplely. Of course your allies also move around; which in old Final Fantasy games. Wasn't allowed they would line up and take turns, which I throughly enjoyed linning up my attacks. Of course I've played less then 3 hours of the game. and it's about 50gb game. I know short time playing just reviewing from start to beginning. And some options should be switchewd. Such as subtitles; Also who speaks should be there automatically. I don't like when I know who's talking, so far it's great, of course there are many things, in the game. And I like how each battle rated. Normally I get 4 or 5 stars. Normally 5. A couple 3's if not a little bit more. That helps the player if an adult player think ""hmm""; How can I improve my skills. I play on normal. So far after 3 hours. I already came across a bangle. Which is very loot is rare yet, imported. Because I don't know if I should save or sell. Of course. It would be nice; EXRTA. if Item's could level up. I do like the datalog and amongst other things. If items could level up then, the Player could deal with quite the dilema of saying well I have leveled through this item 2 levels' it's now level 3. Yet it's better then a level 4 item, yet If I level that level 4 item. Of course that would be the the breaking point, of what do I do; adults playing. As kids, would mostly buy the new item, and not worry about leveling items, unless they knew that leveling is fun, yet not important. THAT'S YOUR DILEMMA, whether or not you want items to level. Maybe try it out to see how it scales with the game, or if infact. It's already been tested, to see that new Items, new items. Which are quite handy. Next is making a the next game. I would like to sometimes set up the member abilties and way they work, of course a good gamer would too. Except kids wouldn't really about, unless they knew about past video games; AND HOW ONE POINT OF DAMAGE COULD MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. or how one potion. About potions, yes. Not quite I think drug reference. But following video game standards it is, because you drink it. But techinnally as if seen 3 hours. As I see it. It could be thown or tossed. And I still potions aren't drugs. Yet clearly that would be talked about how to use potions. AND I DO NOT LIKE THE MILD LANGUAGE. it's a kid's game and yet adult game. There is no need for the ""D"" or ""F"" word. One thing I did notice was the actually game over part. Which they don't die, they fall to the ground. Both Languange's maybe. Yet to the player that means they have to work harder. Of course potions are necessary yet; the tutorial doesn't teach how where to find them. It should hint; to use items. And of course since you own the rights and make the game. You should put tickers' on everything to see what they use most of. Such as Blitz, Hand Grenade, or do they use the Auto-Attack. And yet again, I've only played less than 3 hours and do play and will let my children play if, IF my partner agrees'.  The enemy just goes. No blood so far after 3 hours. Just fades. Love story too. Role-Playing-Game. Some minor fixes with the rating, language and potions and how they are used, better clothing boom. YOU HAVE A E GAME. Nearly impossible to do. BEST PART, THE ENEMY JUST FADES AND TURNS BLACK OR WHATEVER COLOR, AND NO GORE, GREAT JOB! KEEP ON DOING!			"

												It's a inovative battle mechanic. All depends on the leader (You control it) and if you it dies, it's over. It make things difficulty at boss battles and with multiple enemies. You'll have a good time if your Focus is facing challenges.If you came for the music, you'll have a good time.The plot is not that good tho... I'll repeat. Light is a male Cloud - clichê.The port is badly optmized and heavy btw.At least, the game guarantee at least +50h for those who dont seek speedrunning or are too young at Turn-Battle games such as FF series.I give it a 6/10.

												This has been one of the worst combat systems I've played in a Final Fantasy series.  Aside from the plot being all over the place, it was very difficult to get imersed into this world.  Square Enix seems to be trying too hard to push Lightning as their next awesome heroin.  The entire game is filled with cut-scene sequences at the end of each path.  This leaves little room to the randomness and just playability of the game.  Instead of every step taking you into combat, you will find yourself in a cut-scene.In the end I would give it a 6/10.  The game looks beautiful, but really is missing true Final Fantasy heart.			"

												FF XIIIIdeal audience: - Those who enjoy JRPGs and will not be putoff or entiely deterred by linearity or moderate difficultyPros: - One of the more challenging FF games- great graphics- In my opinion, the best combat system final fantasy has seen to date; the game could benefit from slightly quicker transitions between paradigms - Overall, great gameplay- Weapon UpgradesCons:- Framerate seems to fluctuate; never below 30, but frequently approx. 30 and then back to 60 on 1080p and 4x AA- Crystarium is too simple and hinders choice of character development - linearity - lack of towns and poor interactions with other NPCs- IMO, the cast of characters is lacking and overall not very likable. I did like Lightning, considering her character wasn't constantly spewing extreme meladrama (unlike Snow)- More meladramatic than other FFs- Sub-par story in comparison to the other FFsSummary: Get this game if you think you'll like a fast-paced and engaging combat system. You may want to avoid this game if you are picky about story..it's not bad but definitely not FFs best			"

												Rating: 8/10Final Fantasy 13 introduces a new type of combat that is both turn base and realtime strategy. Though slow at first, the game gradually picks up in gameplay. The progression system is very similar to FFX sphere system, but instead you spend Points to make your characters stronger. The story has an amazing plot however, can be very overwhelming and confusing at first. Thus requires much focus on dialogue and lore. However to the general census, many people do not seem to enjoy the game as much as I do.Overall I think the game is great and would recommend it to any Final Fantasy fan who wants something different. If you are unsure, you should definitely look up some gameplay footage and other reviews.			"

IT WAS GREAT!! SALUTE FOR BATTLE DESIGNER, YOU DID A GOOD JOOB!!Solutions :- Wiat until chapter 10 until you unlocked team members full potentials- Hooligan battle system reinvented, battle was more intense than ever.NO ENGLISH VOICEOVER FOR ASIAN REGION!! NOT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS JAPANESE ESPECIALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF INTENSE BATTLE!!!AT LEAST GIVE US SUBTITLES INSIDE THE BATTLE!!No solutions!BUT NOT A SINGLE THING FOR MORALE OF THE STORY!!DID THEY FORGOT THAT FINAL FANTASY WAS STORY DRIVEN!!Story was totally confusing up until chapter 10!

												The game itself is good, provided it hasn't been changed from its PlayStation 3 release. But this is a horribly optimized Windows port. On a high-end rig far above recommended specs, which, for reference, runs the game's successor, Final Fantasy XIV, an MMO, at maximum settings with minimal difficulty, this version of Final Fantasy XIII lags so badly the whole game experience plays out like a running-through-molasses nightmare. No apparent options for resolution, framerate, etc. -- again, not that one should especially need them if the port weren't so lazy.			"

You spend the entire game walking down either one of two linear paths to reach your destination (this repeats until end of game).AlsoA girl in your party cums every time she attacks. (Trust me, it gets old fast.)On the bright side, you will love other FF games after this. (I take back everything I said about FF8 in the past).			"

												The game runs really well on PC, even though sometimes the sync between the voice actors and sound gets knocked off but that's just my PC being dumb on occassion, very rarely does it occur otherwise. I enjoyed the story on PS3, and was happy to replay it, but if you are looking for something that is nonlinear, you are looking in the wrong place. For about the first 10-11 chapters (there are 13), you are constricted to hallways that determine your path, with the occasional offshoot (which deadend and force you to go back). In that sense it lacks the feel of some final fantasy games like FFVII or VIII. However, the character development and world building are very interesting, which is honestly the reason I keep going in the first place at this point. The normal mode is certainly brutal to those who cannot adapt to the ATB Gauge type of battle, where some battles seem impossible, which is why strategizing is key once you can switch people in your party. Like most people have said, the game is heavily tutorial-based, where 5-7 chapters are strictly teaching you how to play with the system and how to strategize with the mechanics. If you cannot deal with the mechanics or just want the story, there is an easy mode, which makes the battles easier to endure and grinding quicker than in normal mode. Also, once you get to a certain point, the open areas are really beautiful and give missions for you to do so that you can get better gear or more CP to level up. Overall, I feel it is a good game, though it lacks in some aspects.			"

												Where do i begin with Final Fantasy XIII?This game gives a very love hate relationship. I'll try my best to split the good and bad because i find it easier to point out the bad rather than what i actually like/love about this game. (SPOILERS AHEAD)Good:-Square Enix hardley ever dissapoint when it comes to delievering a lore and setting for a Final Fantasy title. The whole L'cie concept and how it can result is to me, original. The design of Cocoon and Gran Pulse feel very natural with the story arch alongside the whole Fal'cie and L'cie idea.-Music. Now this i can say whole heartedly that Square Enix NEVER dissapoint when it comes to scoring a Final Fantasy game. If i were to give you a taste of why i think it's amazing then listen to this song. 


YouTube™ Video: Final Fantasy 13 OST - Disc Four - 22 - Ending Credits 

			Views: 75,558		

			FULL PLAYLIST HERE http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=7C498688F14F6A0D The complete and original 4-Disc soundtrack for Final Fantasy XIII, the hit role-playing video game developed and published...		

The music in every big Final Fantasy title always make the lore feel very alive and rich, this part of the series that we all know and love is fortunately carried through in this title and i'm sure you'll all enjoy it.-Game length. While i have 102 hours on my record i truly completed the game in 83 hours and the rest is where i left the game on and fell asleep but Final Fantasy only tracks time i've been actually playing. Final Fantasy is never usually a short game, especially because these titles are in development for many, many years. Don't worry about not thinking you might not get your money's worth out of this game because trust me, you will and there's still another 2 titles ahead of this that you have to play still. -For the overall goodside i'm still not sure on what makes me love this game even with all of it's flaws (which i state below). I think the character i love the most is Sazh, he's the one who seems like he's the only one who's slightly true to the objective of the game. Getting Dajh back as a father figure is his biggest drive, even though he doesn't seem very driven throughout most of the game because he proclaims himself as ""old"" and ""tired/fed up"". Like i said, this game gives a very love/hate relationship between itself and the player.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bad:-Snow Villiers.-A lot of the characters just moan throughout the game and a lot of the lines are pretty tacky/cheesy/cliche. Snow Villiers is the biggest example. Not only is he a cocky character but the majority of his lines are super far fetched about being a ""hero"" and if it's not that then he's always screaming and crying about Serah and holding that damn crystal tear. I also find Hope to be very annoying throughout the first half of the game, yes he lost his mother but he bottles his emotions towards Snow and starts to give of the vibe of an annoying little emo kid that only has character development because of a dead mother.-The last boss, Orphan. Not only do you fight barthandelus for the third time in the game but you then go on to fight Orphan straight after without any preperation and by then you might have used all of your TP to even have any left against Orphan. My biggest complaint about Orphan is the attack it uses and it's name ends in ""Wrath"". I can't express how ******* ANGRY that move makes me. That move has a chance, yes, A CHANCE, of instant killing either you, your party members or nobody at all. I want to put my keyboard through my ******* monitor when i'm close to killing Orphan and i get instantly killed by ******* CHANCE! To put the very final boss fight to rest in review, After you defeat the annoying Orphan you go on to fight Orphan's ""final form"" which is literally the easiest boss fight ever. Spam buffs and debuffs and Orphan II goes down in like 1-3 staggers. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall:I do recommend this game a lot as it is one of my favorite Final Fantasy titles and because in the ending i felt nothing but relief and i cried tears of joy, but i do warn you of the bad things about this game, seriously.

												I LOVEEE FINAL FANTASY.if you're searching for good graphic J-RPG with good music. this should be it. nothing more nothing less.eventhough the story rather boring i can say because the linear story line, and a really confusing story at the first moment you play. (i cannot understand a bit if i dont google it)im not finished yet on this game, but if u like square enix production, you should try this one. "

												I like the cinematics and character development but the story is a fluffy cringefest, as with most FF's in general but this..just lacks substance. The battle mechanics is horridly lackluster but the one thing I like is the Crystarium system. I yawned many times during the game and found it to be an effective sleeping pill. Half of the hours I put in the game are afk hours to be honest. I bought this in a whim due to nostalgia..and also it was on sale. I recommend if you 1. Like being on auto pilot and linear storyline. 2. Want to torture yourself 3. Just want to complete the trophies in the Steam version (Me)I don't recommend this for long time FF fans because just..no unless you have nothing else to play. I revisited IX on console lately as it's great. Will try the Steam version when I feel like it in the future :) On the flipside the game helps my insomnia in several occasions. So I will put Yes for anyone who has problems getting some peaceful sleep because XIII WILL send you on an express train to Dream Land.			"

												Rating: 8/10Final Fantasy 13 introduces a new type of combat that is both turn base and realtime strategy. Though slow at first, the game gradually picks up in gameplay. The progression system is very similar to FFX sphere system, but instead you spend Points to make your characters stronger. The story has an amazing plot however, can be very overwhelming and confusing at first. Thus requires much focus on dialogue and lore. However to the general census, many people do not seem to enjoy the game as much as I do.Overall I think the game is great and would recommend it to any Final Fantasy fan who wants something different. If you are unsure, you should definitely look up some gameplay footage and other reviews.			"

												I'm about 8hrs in the game is meh. Completley linear, terrible characters, gorgeous visuals, plot that is all over the place. I was captivated by the game at first as the combat system was likable and the graphics were stunning. Hours in you begin to realize that the gameplay has nothing to do with the story. Your characters don't grow and develop, you make no choices and are not involved in the plot, you just do flavorless battles and as a reward get to watch an anime.I think if you converted FF13 into a straight up CG movie, nothing would be lost. You are not the story.			"

												This was the first Final Fantasy game that I played and while it had its moments I cannot recommend this game.  My main two issues were the mouse/keyboard controls and the repetitive nature of the second half of the game.Controls:  Probably the laziest effort put forwards on a console port that I've experienced.  Limited ability to rebind the keys, poor mouse utilization, and terrible camera functionality.  I did eventually get used to them, but there could have been so much improvement in the interface displays when using a mouse.  Essentially the mouse is turned into two buttons and there's no cursor.Repetition:  A personal issue but I don't want to have to grind in a single player RPG.  All of the enemies are simply reskins of the same few dozen models.  I ended up limping my way through the end of the game with 5 minute after 5 minute fights since I didn't feel like going out of my way to fight fodder enemies for fractional amounts of EXP.  Boss fights are obnoxiously long and several will take longer than 10 minutes of hitting a button twice every ~5 seconds.  Enemy levels/difficulty are a mystery leading to one shot deaths.  It took me around 35 hours to finish the game.  After the first 15 hours or so I just wanted it to be over.  The last few chapters are quite long.  If you're a fan of excruciating repetition, there are plenty of 'achievements' and completionist objectives.  But I'm glad that it's over and I can free up the 51gb for a new game.			"

												Being a newbie at JRPG's I had a steep learning curve, but quickly found myself wondering how the clock got so late. I made the mistake of first playing FF XIII-2 and was extremely confused. If you have not played XIII yet, I highly suggest playing the first one before moving on to the second. I normally prefer being more involved in my RPGs, but this is a completely different genre with its own appeal. After completing the second chapter the game gets more involved. Think of the first few chapters as training. FF XIII is the first FInal Fantasy I have played (other than the MMO) and I think it is here to stay!			"

												Great Game for kids, except the mix-up with mild themes of things; needs to be sorted out. But other then it is ment for children very easy game, as so far it is very captavating, drawing you in. Of course I like how the hero's don't die. But fall when they ""die"". and then it let's you start right back where you were right before the battle. Also I enjoyed the item's and leveling unquie system; and such very rare games; such as Pokemon. You can view you enemy's weakinesses. It's a kid's game. But yet adults who have played it for from beginning such Final Fantasy the first editon or III-XII and even X-II and X. Works quite well. As they are adding it sutitle changes to each new game; to see what their player-base people like and dislike. And yes. There are ONLY two modes to play on Normal and Easy. Adults and children. If following the tutorial; Is a part of the game; which greatly helps. But for adults there are many options to find. Which should be explanied to both(Children and Adults); as my kids would like to play as I do. They would like to know the enemy weakness, yet it's not in the tutorial. The tutorial can be skip through. Which I don't like, yet the ones that stick with the tutorial on going to do much better; and play longer. And of replay value so far seems pretty intersting as seems to be randomized. Which I do like. Such number of this number that. Of course one major thing, I do and somewhat not use to. Is playing different character's. Such as each character has an AoE, and if you wait long enough for the attack, and the enemy's to line up correctly; or perhaps gather then, that's when you strike. Much movement with the enemy or computer; is quite nice. As it's adds a spin to when to attack, and when to defend; if done proplely. Of course your allies also move around; which in old Final Fantasy games. Wasn't allowed they would line up and take turns, which I throughly enjoyed linning up my attacks. Of course I've played less then 3 hours of the game. and it's about 50gb game. I know short time playing just reviewing from start to beginning. And some options should be switchewd. Such as subtitles; Also who speaks should be there automatically. I don't like when I know who's talking, so far it's great, of course there are many things, in the game. And I like how each battle rated. Normally I get 4 or 5 stars. Normally 5. A couple 3's if not a little bit more. That helps the player if an adult player think ""hmm""; How can I improve my skills. I play on normal. So far after 3 hours. I already came across a bangle. Which is very loot is rare yet, imported. Because I don't know if I should save or sell. Of course. It would be nice; EXRTA. if Item's could level up. I do like the datalog and amongst other things. If items could level up then, the Player could deal with quite the dilema of saying well I have leveled through this item 2 levels' it's now level 3. Yet it's better then a level 4 item, yet If I level that level 4 item. Of course that would be the the breaking point, of what do I do; adults playing. As kids, would mostly buy the new item, and not worry about leveling items, unless they knew that leveling is fun, yet not important. THAT'S YOUR DILEMMA, whether or not you want items to level. Maybe try it out to see how it scales with the game, or if infact. It's already been tested, to see that new Items, new items. Which are quite handy. Next is making a the next game. I would like to sometimes set up the member abilties and way they work, of course a good gamer would too. Except kids wouldn't really about, unless they knew about past video games; AND HOW ONE POINT OF DAMAGE COULD MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. or how one potion. About potions, yes. Not quite I think drug reference. But following video game standards it is, because you drink it. But techinnally as if seen 3 hours. As I see it. It could be thown or tossed. And I still potions aren't drugs. Yet clearly that would be talked about how to use potions. AND I DO NOT LIKE THE MILD LANGUAGE. it's a kid's game and yet adult game. There is no need for the ""D"" or ""F"" word. One thing I did notice was the actually game over part. Which they don't die, they fall to the ground. Both Languange's maybe. Yet to the player that means they have to work harder. Of course potions are necessary yet; the tutorial doesn't teach how where to find them. It should hint; to use items. And of course since you own the rights and make the game. You should put tickers' on everything to see what they use most of. Such as Blitz, Hand Grenade, or do they use the Auto-Attack. And yet again, I've only played less than 3 hours and do play and will let my children play if, IF my partner agrees'.  The enemy just goes. No blood so far after 3 hours. Just fades. Love story too. Role-Playing-Game. Some minor fixes with the rating, language and potions and how they are used, better clothing boom. YOU HAVE A E GAME. Nearly impossible to do. BEST PART, THE ENEMY JUST FADES AND TURNS BLACK OR WHATEVER COLOR, AND NO GORE, GREAT JOB! KEEP ON DOING!			"

												I do not understand why people like this game.I put 300+ hours in FF12 on the PS2 a long time ago, so I figured I'd finaly give it's succesor a chance. But first of all, this game is, or at least the beginning of it, incredibly linear. Now that wouldn't be a bad thing if the dialogue was any good, but no, it is not. Seriously, the dialogue is just filled with stupendous clichés. The story might be oke, I did not play enough to form a reliable judgment about it.And then there's the combat. I hoped for something along the lines of FF12 where (in my remembrance at least) the combat involved some degree of tact in order to succeed. But in this game all I had to do was mash the auto combat button, and couldn't even do that for my allies, they were completely controlled by the AI.All in all, this was a rather dissapointing experience.

												The game runs really well on PC, even though sometimes the sync between the voice actors and sound gets knocked off but that's just my PC being dumb on occassion, very rarely does it occur otherwise. I enjoyed the story on PS3, and was happy to replay it, but if you are looking for something that is nonlinear, you are looking in the wrong place. For about the first 10-11 chapters (there are 13), you are constricted to hallways that determine your path, with the occasional offshoot (which deadend and force you to go back). In that sense it lacks the feel of some final fantasy games like FFVII or VIII. However, the character development and world building are very interesting, which is honestly the reason I keep going in the first place at this point. The normal mode is certainly brutal to those who cannot adapt to the ATB Gauge type of battle, where some battles seem impossible, which is why strategizing is key once you can switch people in your party. Like most people have said, the game is heavily tutorial-based, where 5-7 chapters are strictly teaching you how to play with the system and how to strategize with the mechanics. If you cannot deal with the mechanics or just want the story, there is an easy mode, which makes the battles easier to endure and grinding quicker than in normal mode. Also, once you get to a certain point, the open areas are really beautiful and give missions for you to do so that you can get better gear or more CP to level up. Overall, I feel it is a good game, though it lacks in some aspects.			"

												It is hard to recommand this game since i gave up on getting through it for now.I got 15 hours in and lost interest because of the very locked groups.15 hours in and I am still not allowed to choose which group of characters I want to use, neither am I allowed to use a full team, and from what I gather it will take another 5 hours before I am actually allowed to play the game.So at this point I am just giving up.However it was 15 hours of ok fun, so for the price it is I would still recommend it, and who knows maybe I will finish it another time.So now for how the game is:Combat is quite well functioning, you control 1 character and the other characters are auto controlled, although you control which roles they should be in, you do this from preset roles you set before combat. It is actually a good fun system which allows you to feel a lot of nice action while not having too much stress.The camera however is a plague, it jumps all over the place, is too far zoomed in so you sometime miss important skill clues getting you killed because of it, and you got little control over how your other characters use their skillset in the class, so they don’t always makes the smartest moves.The game is very linear, for the 15 hours I played I have done nothing but moving in one straight line without any ability to deviate from it.The story is quite good, but it seems to be Very short for what it is, without all the “wasted time” I think the story could be summarized until now in less then 15 min. even so it is enjoyable, and it is Very awesomely voice acted.I was quite impressed with the dialog, due to the names “snow, lightning, fang, hope, etc” I was expecting quite childish dialog but they were actually quite good and I found most dialog to be positive experiences ^^The progression system is sadly leaving much to be desired; there isn’t much progression choice to speak of, again everything is linear and because the cap on each role is so low you max them all out so easily, that there is no choice to be made.This is far from what we are used too in most ff games, but even so it does not take too much enjoyment away from the game.So well, this is my experience with the first 15 hours of the game.I would recommend it for the story and general feel; however, you need to know how linear everything is.

												It's my favorite FF game. The story is definitely confusing the first time you play; they could have done a much better job of explaining the worldstate throughout the intro. The overall story, however, is some quality♥♥♥♥♥♥The leveling system is cool (all characters have some degree of access to all combat roles) and it doesn't take forever to grind out levels.The best part of this game is easily the combat system. I've never had so much fun in FF combat before. It's fresh, enganging, and unlike other FF games.But of course, the massive downside here is the performance of the PC port. Your computer will not consistently put out more than 50 fps during most of the gameplay. I have the best AMD gpu on the market and a freesync monitor, but still my framerate suffers and I see a lot of stuttering/tearing in the game as I pan my camera. Battle fps is locked to 30, world fps is locked to 60.			"

												I'll first say that I've played the game through several times on my XBox, that's why my playtime here is so low.  The only problems I can say this game has is that it is unoptimized for PC, it may not run well on low-spec computers, and that it is ""lighter"" than most Final Fantasy games.  It still has a great story and fun gameplay and a huge world to explore, which is made to feel even bigger since there is no ""overworld"" screen and you're always traversing on foot in real time.

												I'm about 8hrs in the game is meh. Completley linear, terrible characters, gorgeous visuals, plot that is all over the place. I was captivated by the game at first as the combat system was likable and the graphics were stunning. Hours in you begin to realize that the gameplay has nothing to do with the story. Your characters don't grow and develop, you make no choices and are not involved in the plot, you just do flavorless battles and as a reward get to watch an anime.I think if you converted FF13 into a straight up CG movie, nothing would be lost. You are not the story.			"

												This was the first Final Fantasy game that I played and while it had its moments I cannot recommend this game.  My main two issues were the mouse/keyboard controls and the repetitive nature of the second half of the game.Controls:  Probably the laziest effort put forwards on a console port that I've experienced.  Limited ability to rebind the keys, poor mouse utilization, and terrible camera functionality.  I did eventually get used to them, but there could have been so much improvement in the interface displays when using a mouse.  Essentially the mouse is turned into two buttons and there's no cursor.Repetition:  A personal issue but I don't want to have to grind in a single player RPG.  All of the enemies are simply reskins of the same few dozen models.  I ended up limping my way through the end of the game with 5 minute after 5 minute fights since I didn't feel like going out of my way to fight fodder enemies for fractional amounts of EXP.  Boss fights are obnoxiously long and several will take longer than 10 minutes of hitting a button twice every ~5 seconds.  Enemy levels/difficulty are a mystery leading to one shot deaths.  It took me around 35 hours to finish the game.  After the first 15 hours or so I just wanted it to be over.  The last few chapters are quite long.  If you're a fan of excruciating repetition, there are plenty of 'achievements' and completionist objectives.  But I'm glad that it's over and I can free up the 51gb for a new game.			"

												7/10, would maybe play again.The story is great while the writing can be poor at times, they removed a lot of what made Final Fantasy games special but also added a lot that can be considered innovative and valuable. The battle system was new, interesting, and kept me involved for some time. I was still learning new strategies at the very end of the game. The graphics, of course, are flawless, and since the update for PC they're even better. I never experienced any problems in terms of functionality. I didn't 100% the game because the incentives to complete the side missions were relatively nonexistent and traveling back and forth to complete them became tedious.Overall, I would recommend that someone play through this game at least once. The story really is thought-provoking, and the character design is great; I grew attached to most of the characters and I really cared about the outcome of the game. It has its flaws, but if you know what they are going into the game and can appreciate it for what it has instead of what it doesn't, then you'll have a good experience.			"

												I honestly have no idea why this game has had so many negative reviews. Sure, at the beginning it puts you on rails and the battle system isn't that interactive...at the BEGINNING...just like most FF games. Play it longer! It definitely pays off...probably my favorite FF story of them all! I had zero problems with graphics, controllers, studdering video, etc., and between console and PC I've played through the game start to finish 3+ times. I find the battle system both engaging and even paced. Maybe it's not for everyone, but for me...it is one of the absolute best games out there!			"

Posted: December 21, 2014
												I will start off by saying that I used to be a big fan of the FF series and Square's JRPGS of the 90's in general. After Squares PS1 era, I never had the chance or interest in playing any of the later installments in the FF series, mainly because I was exclusively a PC gamer. Then one day I notice to my surprise that they've released this on Steam, so I figured I'd go ahead and try the latest game in the series that I used to be such a big fan of in the past. At first I have to comment on filesize of the game. When installed, the game takes 58 gb's of HDD which is insane!The filesize is that big because the game includes both Japanese and English audio in the game and in the cutscene videos. It really would of been a nice if the original Japanese audio/video was an optional download. That way you would save up about 20gb worth of download time.Now for the actual game:Gameplay:I found the gameplay incredibly boring and repetive. It doesn't have the ATB turn based combat of the previous installments, which I was aware of before I bought this game. Instead it has sort of real-time battle system where you only control one character. You can perform 3 moves in 1 turn and sort of chain different abilities and spells together. Or alternatively, you can just hit the auto-battle and it will automatically choose the best chains for you.Seriously, every battle is the same: Auto battle -> Auto battle -> Auto battle -> Heal -> Auto battle -> Auto battle -> Auto battle -> You can unlock new abilities and attributes for your characters with the Paradigms. Basically, your characters have these roles you can choose for them which include offensive, defensive and healing roles. Each of these roles have their own ""skill tree"" which you can climb to unlock more abilities. The skill tree is as linear as it can get, so theres no actual options to choose from at all. You will simply unlock everything in one order over time. You can also change these roles in combat at anytime when you need to go from doing damage to healing. Its also good to point out that you can't change roles for individual characters in battle.The game doesn't really have any actual RPG depth to it at all. Theres only 2 different stats (Strength and Magic) and only 2 different types of items that you can equip (Weapon and accessory). Can't get much more simplified than that.As for the difficulty of the game. Theres two settings, easy and normal. I played the game on normal and thought it was incredibly easy. None of the boss battles gave me any challenge whatsoever (but then again, how could it with such a simplified gameplay mechanics). The game also recharges your health back to full everytime you win a abttle.Graphics:The graphics are quite alright. The game is about 4-5 years old with initial release on 360 and PS3, so you can't realistically expect anything spectacular. Now that SquareEnix actually managed to get the game to run at 1080p, it looks even better. The game also runs at 60fps, but it has difficulties in maintaining it, so fps drops to 30 are pretty common. My GPU had max GPU usage of 10% when I played the game, so its simply bad optimisation.The art design is where the game actually shines a bit. The characters are all well designed and look good. Most of the areas, landscapes, machines, bosses etc look great.Controls:With the game being a console port, you can expect some not-so-great controls on the keyboard. My biggest gripe was that Esc actually EXITED you out of the game without saving the game (Its now fixed and it asks you if you want to exit instead). I'm pretty sure that any PC gamer will automatically assume that Esc is the menu, not the god damn exit button.Just goes to show that the people at Square Enix who were reponsible for this port, had no idea how a game plays on a PC.Music:The music in this game sounds quite dull in general. Almost like elevator music, with the exception of few tracks in certain parts. They really need to hire Nobuo Uematsu again.Also, theres no final fantasy fanfare. Thats equivalent of not having the blue policebox in doctor who!Story:I'm not gonna go into much detail about the story, but on a personal level, I found it to be quite uninteresting. For the first few hours of the game, I had no idea what the hell was going on at all. It starts you right in the middle of the action and doesn't explain much till later on. I can't comment on the entire story as I have yet to finish the game, but I'm about 12 hours in and it has pretty much failed to spark my interest yet.Characters:I don't really know what to say about the characters in this game. Lightning was ok, though she sort of represented your very standard JRPG pragmatic soldier archetype. Sazh was a funny sidekick with his very handsome afro.Vanille and Snow on the other hand made me want to hit the Esc button more than a few times.Conclusion:The game is INCREDIBLY simplified to the point where it felt like I was watching a mediocre visual novel, rather than playing a game. The game is very easy and offers little challenge. While the game has some redeeming qualities in certain areas, like in the visual design and certain aspects of the story, its not enough to make this game worthwhile at all when the only actual gameplay taking place in the game is you continuously pressing AUTO BATTLE and sometimes switching to heal mode when taking damage.

												(This review will mainly be based on the technical side of the game and is made by a normal mortal with common understanding of computers and graphics; AKA the average buyer)This is a long review. Summary at the bottom.--------------- | Graphics: | Score: 9.5/10---------------Okay, first of all, you all need to understand something. I know very well that some reviewers say how the graphics only are at 720p, but it's not that bad at all. After reading several reviews on here waiting for the install to finish, I was scared that it would look messy and laggy on my laptop (read: laptop!), but it far from did. I might not understand much about computers, especially when it comes to graphics, but I do know this: I was breathtaken. Square Enix has done a great job yet again. There's being constructive, and then there's being whiny (Though I suppose that some people only play a game for the graphics, so if you're that person, this game might upset you, apparently). No one ever promised you anything over 720p. You havent been conned, your money hasn't been stolen. It's the same great story, the same great graphics. If it can run this beautifully on my Asus S550C, then I'm sure you'll be just fine - graphics wise, at least.--------------- | Gameplay (Technical): | Score: 7/10---------------If you read the previous section you know that I'm playing this game on an Asus S-series laptop. I suppose this has its challenges prior to a PC (seeing as a PC is bigger and therefore more capable of running big games like FFXIII), however, it hasn't crashed on me yet. The only big issue is the fact that my game froze near the 2nd save station in the beginning when I tried saving, and since I haven't tried again just yet, it could be a one-time error only (I played in Windowed Mode, too, if it helps anything). On the other hand, if it is a recurring issue, I could end up losing a lot of play data from being unable to save, but I'm not going to cry wolf just yet. In fact, this game is running smoother than Skyrim is for me, so I'd say they've done a pretty good job. Some lag, yes, but that's on me. With hardly 10GB left on each drive and the game running alongside a good 150 processes, I wouldn't expect otherwise; the fact that the game is even able to run so smoothly is impressive.--------------- | Gameplay (Battle/combat): | Score: 10/10---------------Everybody knows the classical FF combat system. Although this isn't the exact combat system as the one in FFX (as an example), it's still a lot like it. If you're too slow at striking, your enemies will strike you instead - and you can even strike at the same time. No turn-based combat like that, other than an ATB (attack bar) working the same way as stamina would do with a melee-weapon in any other (J)RPG. Generally easy to control with a keyboard (Unless you've got a controller, which is recommended in the system info). Personally I like the combat style they used for the Kingdom Hearts games, but seeing as this is a game of the Final Fantasy series, it would almost be a shame if it didn't have the CS it has. Either way, it's alright for me.--------------- | Overall impression: | ---------------I've always liked the FF-series, and this game is no exception. Even if the PC version disappoints some, my eyes still lit up like a Christmas tree when I heard it was coming to Steam. I still haven't played it alot (i.e: Look at recorded play time - like you should on any other Steam review), but I know I will. This is one of the only games on Steam that I've bothered reviewing properly, only because I think it's a shame how much it's being downvoted due to its graphics. I'm not saying it was wrong of people to do, as some people genuinely play a game mostly for great graphics, but if you're a fan and usually like the story and the classical turn-based combat (which it isn't quite, but it is), then don't hesitate buying this. However, if you're in doubt, I do recommend buying it when it's on sale to at least tell for yourself if you enjoy it or not. If you don't, you haven't spent as much money as you could've, if you do, then it's a win-win situation. But if graphics is the least of your concerns and you know that your computer can handle running it, then what are you waiting for? ;) SUMMARY: Graphics score: 9.5/10 - Not bad at all, runs fine on a laptop, graphics are really beautiful even though some think it's a downside with ""only"" 720p (Most likely because they know it's that low prior to the fact that it looks just fine).Gameplay (technical): 7/10 - A few general issues here and there, nothing too buggy but still up for fixing.Gameplay (battle): 10/10 - Final Fantasy style as you know it, with a twist of a more ""autonomous"" enemy attack system.I hope you found this review useful. And remember, try to not judge so hard just because it's a game of the FF-series.- Lucy.			"

												To lock keyboard controls with 'esc' key as FORCE EXIT is an awful idea. 3 times I started the game and three times I accidentally hit 'esc' to exit menus. Japanese managers who authorized this decision have weird sense of humor or are on heavy drugs. I'm tolerant to graphics (playing roguelikes simplifies the taste), so I didn't pay much attention to the fact that graphics options are locked as well.Stiil I'll try to play it, as an old fan of the series, though it spirals down several last times.

												I understand those who gave a negative review based on the port and resolution. I also understand those who did not like the ""change"" in this game as compared to the others.Port and resolution isn't a problem for me. Mainly coz Final Fantasy is beautiful as a game, the sweet graphics is just a bonus. I would still play FF3 and FF4(not even the remakes) now despite it looking all box like lol.I won't lie, I do miss the older versions:-The fighting systems that used HP,TP and MP.-The fact that you can actually flee from an enemy during fights(which is shockingly not here).-Controlling all characters in battle(Here you can only control the leader of the party).-You not being able to see the enemy on the map: You could be walking anywhere then...BAM!!!Fight!!-Most of all, the non-linear aspect: In FFXIII there's a map AND a compass that tells you where to go, and the game is too linear. No one can get lost in this game it's impossible. As for the older games.....they may be a map but there's no compass and it's not linear....your only clue at times to your destination is some old woman saying ""Head East....""Yes I do miss all these things, but FFXIII is something new. Whats wrong with something new?You want to play another Final Fantasy Title that has the same mechanics over and over again?its part 13 for Christ's sake a change was needed!!The paradigm fighting method is sweet. It makes you more involved in a fight than the other FF. The constant switching of tactics opens you up to more possibilities to protecting your allies and taking down enemies. The storyline is fine as well. Why are people saying it's confusing?EVERY FINAL FANTASY STORY IN THE BEGINNING IS CONFUSING!!!!It only makes sense when your deep in the game and you know what is really going on.As a long-time Final Fantasy fan, I tell you that this game is totally worth it. The 60GB size may be crippling, but $16 for over 80 hours of playing time sounds like a good deal to me.Final Fantasy XIII is a great game, If you give it a chance you won't regret it. Take my word for it, Although remember I'm just one voice.8.0/10FYI.....Lightning is badass!!!!!!			"

												who cares about 60 fps and 720p locked, the game itself is awesome and thats what counts, thats a fact ! story is really nice, character dev. is okay-ish, combat system is great, a lot of variety and skills plus techniques to use. If you dont like 720p and all that stuff, you shouldnt bought it tho.			"

												I bought this game for about two years ago on Xbox. Then I thought it was one of the best ''new'' games. So when it came on PC I was like - Oh yeah I have to buy it now! - so I did it. While I installed it I had nothing to do so I just read comments. Everyone was like - Don't buy this game. You're locked in 720 blablabla. - b.u.l.l.s.h.i.t. If you are really fan of Final Fantasy, and regardless if you played FFXIII on Xbox before you should be happy that you can play on PC. If not, then go play on Xbox/PS. Nothing is stopping you.Only thing I'm dislikes is that game requires 60GB+. It took about 1 hour to just download and then came the patch part. Patching took one extra hour because I had to uinstall some♥♥♥♥♥♥ why? _Because patch needed extra space, only for installation time.When installation was complete, I plugged in my Xbox Controller (recommends) and then finally I could play the game. And you know what? I just enjoy it. Because it's still one of my favorite games.Btw. the ''ESC'' problem. Well, If you're playing with controller it's more positive than negative.			"

												About the story, it s too linear, not like another ff series and also another rpgs, so i think not every player gonna finish this game after he/she bought it. Well, you can only go straight till you reach a specified chapter.About the graphic, yeah it s said that ff 13 is the first ff series that use HD graphic, it s nice, but for low-spec pc users needs more graphic settings.About the soundtrack, steam tagged it as a game with great soundtrack, yes it s approvedSo, I recommend this game because you don t need to buy a ps3 to play this game, you will also must buy the game again. Then 10$ for HD graphics game, why not?			"

												  I haven't completely played through this game; merely a sliver of time in it really. The Final Fantasy series of games has had  a celebrated history of amazing stories, rich and fully fleshed out characters, and soundtracks that put most every other game to shame. Unfortunately since Final Fantasy VI The stories have become more and more confusing and with trying to make a more complex story they continue to bog down the player with trying to find a meaning of it all. This would be wonderful if there was actually hidden meanings written into the storylines. It all started in Final Fantasy VII. Although I'm still hard pressed to call it my favorite (Final Fantasy VI being the best in my opinion.) The story of it started alright and then took a huge turn into the ""WTF Zone."" Trying to figure out who Cloud was, if he was even in SOLDIER, and what relationship Sephiroth had between him and Zack.   Final Fantasy VIII was a cluster ♥♥♥♥ of WTF moments and I still don't think the ending for that was even a proper ending. IX and X had great stories but with X you had to wait until almost the end of the game to understand anything. XII; while I loved the new MMO play style and the story, the ending was so lackluster I felt like I had just watched Neon Genesis Evangelion when I got to the ending. That being said; I can only PRAY that FFXIII redeems itself to me. It's pretty damn confusing so far with the factions(?) having such closely resembling names. *praying*			"

												Final Hallway XIII - The greatest casual auto-pilot JRPG in the entire Final Fantasy library.Well this game is a million years old now [obvious hyperbole]... let's talk about it.On to the game play:The first 20-25 hours of the game, depending on how much you love upgrading weapons and accessories, is basically a tutorial that eases you in to the battle system and crafting features.... Once you realize how easy it is, you'll wonder why they even bothered pacing you.It's a FF game catering to mainstream JRPG casuals, just like FFX did years before it... flash some graphical T & A and the bro's come a running. Then they claim to think they know stuff about RPG's and believe they're diverse because they're playing a game outside of their realm of EA sports titles... *sigh* whatever... let them have their piece of candy.This game basically combines the story telling and gameplay progression elements of Final Fantasy IV and the graphical boner inducing glory that was FFX, put them both in a blender and yeah, you get this... a great looking FF game with autism.For the first 25 hours or so you are introducted to our motley crew of characters, their backgrounds, obnoxious personalities and how to set the game on auto-battle and leave it there until you gain some kind of control over your party. The game also introduces the crafting system, albiet a bit briefly and never really explains much other than telling you that you can upgrade your gear and dismantle it or sell it for gil... Bringing me to my next gripe, you never earn gil in this game, only components and computer parts that you can sell for gil... kind of ridiculous in a FF title, no? So needless to say this game is artificially extended by the GRIND. Seriously the game is only about 50 hours long but you'll be grinding materials for over 80+ hours if you expect to get everything in the game maxed out... be warned.The game's maps consist of linear hallways for roughly 80% of the game with only a few area's giving you some room to explore. Nothing is really hidden either, there are literally zero secrets in this game, everything is incredibly obvious and in your face. The map never lies to you either, every area is mapped out properly so once you hit the edge of a map, that's it... there are no hidden path ways... It doesn't leave much to the imagination unfortunately but at least you know you're not going to need a guide book to hit 100% completion.FF13 sets out to tell a story, and that's exactly what it does, it's like the Metal Gear Solid 2 of Final Fantasy games... The game consists of very little game play and mostly cutscenes moving along the drama and unfolding the convoluted and confusing plot. At some point you'll just start disregarding everything everyone is saying so you can auto battle the next colossal, gorgeously rendered monster.It's a great looking game, I'll give it that, it's just not a great Final Fantasy title... they stopped being great after FF6... it's just a sad fact. They all have way to many flaws in them to be considered great additions to the franchise and this is just another one added in to the mix of mixed bag RPG titles. Although I must admit, after playing FFXIII-2... it makes this game seem incredible in comparison.I recommend this game for someone looking for a story to just disappear in to for a few hours a day but as a gamer who enjoys to actually play their games and delve in to things rather than just run back and forth grinding out materials... I'd have to say meh. Thankfully I've already beaten this game years ago and felt like experiencing it again, so I'm in a good mood... other wise I would of just trashed it but in retrospect the game does look beautiful... and I think that's what SquareEnix's original intensions were... to just show case how powerful the new generation of consoles could be.Either way, ""bad ports"" aside (what did you expect? I mean really?) It's like a 6.5/10 overall.			"

												So ff 13 is an upgrade in terms of models and textures but a downgrade in terms of gameplay. Truly one of the worst, if not THE WORST final fantasy game I've ever played.(Note: my cons could contain possible spoiler alert.)Pros:- Graphic details and CGI.- weapon upgrade system.- Perfect character model.Cons:(Boy oh boy get ready for this one.)- No more mana system. Now you get to cast infinite magic with no worries of mana management.- You control only one character in a party. Thats right. JUST ONE. Rest are automatic AI control.- During battle, 90% of the time you don't play the game, the game plays for you again because you control only one character.- Hp, Strength and magic. That's it. That's all the attributes you have in this game. No defense, no magic defense, no agility or luck.- Certain negative status effect are gone like blind, confuse (I can see why since this game has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ battle mechanic), silence (still there, just that its name is changed to ""fog"". Like wow.)- Near impossible Eidolon battle. Had to actually look at walkthrough.- Eidolons could morph into ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mounts. (e.g Odin transforms into a god damn horse instead of him riding a horse. Shiva sisters transform into a bike!?!?!?!? WTF really!? This is ridiculous.)- Shiva sisters. Yes, that's right. Suddenly shiva had a twin sister.- No more limit break system like trance of ff9 or overdrive of ffx.- Super long tutorial + boring area. The graphic detail of the levels are no doubt high quality BUT I actually don't give a♥♥♥♥♥about exploring and just rush on through as the level design is boring AF. This is something I never do in a final fantasy game. I rather farm for dark matter from dark yojimbo in ffx then doing this.- Last but not least, the NUMBER ONE bad thing of ff XIII. HOPE. No I'm not talking bout hoping for a miracle, I'm literally talking about the character Hope. A whinny blame everyone for everything little as.11 cons compare to 3 pros. Take note that I loved to 100% the final fantasy series ff4, ff7-ffx including max everything but for this game I just don't bother. The only thing that keeps me going in playing this game is staring at the chick Vanille.I'm not going to say don't buy this game. I'm just going to say this game is NOT WORTH your time and money.

Story: 7/10 Soundtrack: 10/10 Characters:5/10 Graphics: 10/10 Gameplay:9/10As expected of Final Fantasy game it dominates with addictive gameplay and good soundtrack, when it comes to characters however it gets complicated because some characters are very original and lovable but others are full of cliche and have generally boring personalities.However this port is very high quality (if we ignore the lack of graphics settings) and graphics looks even better than it did on the console.What the game lacks in characters it makes up with addictive gameplay in which you can easily lose hours just killing monsters and barely making progress in the story.Some people reported low performance and FPS but i've had no similar experience since the game ran flawlessly.All in all this game is very well worth the money if you are into JRPGS and RPG's in general.It was also announced that sequels will be coming to PC too so if you plan to play it for story be prepared to get the sequels too, for me this is a must have game.

												Ok, after reading the endless waves of rage on the steam forums I decided to buy it and give FFXIII on PC a whirl. So far, very pleased with the ""not so wonderful port"", and SquareEnix, you have my money for XIII-2 and Lightning Returns! Beats the hell out of dusting off the old PS3 to play...Now on to the nitty gritty...-Pros-Final Fantasy XIII on PCLooks quite good visually for what it's worth (see cons)Controller support (port duh!)FPS of 55-60 constant JPN VA (Vanille = eargasm)-Cons-Locked at 720p   (honestly fullscreen with nVidia tweaks @ GPU Scaling, 16xAF, and 8xSQ AA isn't that bad)Random frame drop to like 2fps (seems only on zone load)Needs audio options, Voices are muffled out by ambience/music-Not Really a Con-60GB DownloadSo those looking to buy, keep in mind, FFXIII is a pure console to PC port, but by no means the best... or worst for that matter... So if you have ever wanted to play FFXIII and never owned a PS3/360 then this PC version (with issues) is worth the buy.Current Specs (just a tiny bit outdated...)Intel Q6600 @ 3.0GHz4GB RAMnVidia GTX 460 1GBScore CardGame: 8 / 10Port: 5 / 10 (future patches will raise this *fingers crossed*)Overall: 7 / 10			"

												FF13 is great RPG put in an amazingly beautiful environment. The graphics are hands down some of the best at the time and the visuals are very nice in a lot of areas. Character models and Voice Acting is probably the best in this game (the english voice is kindda weird but its still okay, kudos to the japanesse version definetly worth the extra 25gb). What's ruined is that most areas are mainly narrow paths which I feel is a step back from FF12. Battle system is unique. Square has been trying to keep Final Fantasy's fresh ever since 1 by adding new elements in every game and the Paradigm battle system is one of the worst idea's I think they've ever come up with. It becomes stressful and confusing mixing , matching and switching these to fight certain enemies, bosses and marks. What was wrong with the whole Attack Magic Item Defend style that they felt they needed to get rid of, although it makes the gameplay more exciting rather than passive turn based system. The story is pretty good and the characther are brilliantly develloped eventhough I had trouble getting into it for the first 15 hours or so which was about half of the game for me. Everytime i play a Final Fantasy games the 1st thing i always look forward to is the music but this time I was highly disappointed, it seemed like they used about 4 tracks in the whole game each had some form of rehash or remix, which I felt got old after a while.I agree that Final Fantasy 13 is not as memorable as the older FF but it is the prettiest and probably one of the best looking games in the jrpg scene.Overall i'd Give it 8/10			"

Posted: October 15, 2014
												I was asked to write a honest review of this game. So here I am.Short disclaimer: I haven't played any Final Fantasy games for PSX, PS2, PS3, though I played FFVIII and FFVII. Also be wary that I use this ""yes/no"" option regarding recommendation as a way to answer the question ""are you ok with the purchase?""As usual I will start describing the gameplay/game feel. I was expecting a jrpg similiar to any other FF game I've played. Story, party, exploring the word, kinda linear but open world style of gameplay, turn-based battle system.It's really hard to say if I'm happy with that. A lot of people are mad about the part when you get a really extended introduction part where you can't really adjust your gameplay and that really is annoying I have to admit. Game drags you through a lot of tutorials, some of them are helpful, other are completely redundant. This could've been done in a much simplier way, or via a seperate tutorial system. So be wary, you will not feel ""freedom"" for a lot of time.Let's talk about the battle system/leveling system. It really is different from what I've seen. You're pretty much controlling the leader and the other guys in your party simply follow the AI schema. I'm not saying it's totally wrong since you can just control them with ""Paradigms"" (AI schemas?), but sometimes it's more of an annoyance. Normally if you wanted to heal a party member using a Cure spell you would just queue a command, choose a target. Here you kinda have to switch your paradigm so your party member actually behaves like a healer and not a damage dealer. He might also just not heal the party member you'd like to heal, which is kind of a problem. Keep in mind: being inefficient about this (letting one follower be a medic 100% of the time) will result in lower battle rating, which is quite crucial as the higher it is, the more of your Technical Points are regenerated (points used to use some special abilities). This enforces a lot of switching, and strategizing as characters may have different roles. You can also setup your own paradigms so that eg. 2 of your fighters will deal damage and 1 will heal, etc.There's a minor issue with leveling I guess. The good ol' ""you leveled up!"" system was removed. Instead you get Crystarium Points (correct me if I'm wrong), which allow you to get more stats or new abilities. The character development is not linear so you don't get a warning ""hey, you can unlock this!"", and sometimes checking your Crystarium page so often might be a good (and annoying) idea.The story is a story, it's quite hard to follow, but unveils after a while and you really get the feeling of immersion, which is... good? I mean, usually at the beginning of Final Fantasy games you don't really know what's going on, and then you find out. I think the game is ok in that departament. Some moments and dialogues are pretty cheesy, but well whatever, it's a Final Fantasy game. If you're an anime fan you will be wondering ""what the ♥♥♥♥ is he talking about, it's perfectly ok"", provided that you play through the game of course.Time to talk about the audio/visual stuff. I will also talk about the PC port here. Music and voice acting are good. Audio fits the atmosphere/area, it's dynamic or slow and calm when it needs to (dialogues/drama/battle). Nothing to worry about here. As mentioned before some of the voice lines are cheesy but it's not like it ruins the game for you.As for the visuals I'll be honest with you: it doesn't really seem that bad to me, though I understand people's concerns about game being run in 720p out of the box (there are some fixes I believe). The areas are very detailed, there's a lot of variety regarding enemies/allies. It's all beautiful. I'm running the game on my laptop and all I was worried about is the performance. I was shocked when I found out THERE ARE NO VIDEO PREFERENCES.Quick rant about the port here: Well I've played older FF games, DMC3, and many other games just butchered by Japanese devs (talking about ports here). This is no different, I could be mad, but I'm not anymore after these years. Game will close if you press ESC (as in quit do desktop without asking). There are no video settings as mentioned before. There's a lot of checkpoints/savepoints in game though so at least you won't be losing much of progress if you accidently quit the game. Also you pause the game with 0 key. Yea, to skip the cutscene you've already seen you need to press 0 on your keyboard, then 1 on your keyboard. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ were they high?After all playing the game feels good. It's certainly no GOTY. It's just... good. I would rate it at 7.5/10, maybe even higher. It's not exactly addictive but you don't quit the game raging after a while, it's totally playable and considering the low price I'd recommend it even more, if you just love the FF beautiful stories, turn-based system games. Well actually, if you don't have a console this is most probably your best bet when it comes to jrpgs (or other FF games released for PC). It's so much better than Last Remnant, that's for sure.			"

												I'm trying to write down my first impressions here. Tested the game an hour ago.Yesterday I went to work at the time the game content has been unlocked, so I wasn't able to test it immediately. In work, I started to read the reviews and the forums. I've never experinced such hate around a game, ever. We all know the common technical problems, so I won't state them. What's important: I won't defend the flaws, which are definitely there, but I won't take a part in this riot as well. So let's go. First, the positives.I gotta say, the in 720p is not THAT bad. I have a high-end PC, and a monitor with a 1920x1080 pixels resolution. Some have problems with the cutscenes - they're beautiful for me. In the gameplay, it's clear to see that this can be better, but it's not as disturbing as everybody states it.About the FPS: with a GTX 780 videocard, and an i7-4770k CPU, with Win 7 x64, and I have 60 fps every time. When there's a change from cutscene to gameplay the FPS drops down to 40 - for less than a second. Cannot even notice.The Nvidia control panel has great advantages about this one. I feel sorry about AMD users - they NEED a fix. Period.So it is playable, it looks good for me. The major problems I had has all been fixed. There were two.-Immediate crash at the first startup. I had to disable DEP, reset the machine, It works since then.-There was a non-disturbing, but noticeable lag in the game, always. The solution is weird, but this is the only one - you need a controller. The game desperately tries to find a controller in every second, which causes the lag. I have a Dualshock 3 connected, and calibrated as an XBOX360 controller (XInput). It works with the game, and there is no lag anymore.Still, the game needs ingame graphics options, and to support at least 1080p resolution, to meet the VERY minimum of todays PC gaming requirements.I don't think S.E. will do anything about this. The only hope can be Durante, and his awesome work. I tried his early pre-alpha GeDoSaTo fix, it is great already, and it will be more awesome later.Last words: try to think about this another way. This game wasn't meant for PC, unfortunately.If you ever tried to emulate PS2, you know that it is really hard to make everything work, even on a high-end PC.I'm looking at this game as a PS3 emulation, and as we all know: we are ages away from proper PlayStation 3 emulation, and for this price, it is worth for those who wanted to try it, have a powerful PC, but never had a console.A tip: I'm not being the big guy here, I know where I'm came from, I only have built my high-end configuration around three months ago, so my advice is honest and sympathetic here: if you have a low-pc, don't buy it. If you have a mid-pc, you should wait for fixes.			"

This game wasn't meant for PC, unfortunately.If you ever tried to emulate PS2, you know that it is really hard to make everything work, even on a high-end PC.I'm looking at this game as a PS3 emulation, and as we all know: we are ages away from proper PlayStation 3 emulation, and for this price, it is worth for those who wanted to try it, have a powerful PC, but never had a console.A tip: I'm not being the big guy here, I know where I'm came from, I only have built my high-end configuration around three months ago, so my advice is honest and sympathetic here: if you have a low-pc, don't buy it. If you have a mid-pc, you should wait for fixes.			"

												Good game i have only played the game for around 50 minutes.(note: im a fan of the ff series)First off I'm quite impressed with the graphics.Gameplay wise i feel its quite interesting, it has a mix of normal JRPG elements and ff:crysis core, action is fast paced and very well animated making battles look amazing and really smooth.Controls simple and easy to get used to.Despite somewhat confusing story(yep even at the start),I would recomend this game to people that like RPG's in general and some who is interested in trying out the genre for the first time.Overall a good game i would give it a 7/10Last note quite laggy on my laptop (around 30 fps) so i tried my desktop and clocked 60-135 fps so you will probably need a decent pc to run it at playable framerates.

												So it's locked at 720p. There are no graphical options whatsoever.It's 50 gb and the cg sequences are worse quality than the ps3 original.Oh and it's 4 years old, and you know what? it's still better than a lot of triple aaa titles that have released on steam in those four years.The combat is excellent and challenging at times. The music is still some of the best square have done.The voice acting is top notch and the story is decent.If you have a decent pc and gpu you can crank up the graphic options with your gpu's control panel and along with the 60fps in combat and exploration, it looks fantastic.And all that for the price of a 12"" pizza? I'll have 2 sir!Bottom line is it's dirt cheap and loads of fun. What more do you want?			"

												I don't know why people seem to hate this game so much. I agree the game is very linear in the beginning but what I find fun in this game is the strategy in the combat. Paradigms are what make this game fun, paradigms control what role/skills your characters use when you select that paradigm. Creating/changing your set of paradigms to take down unique bosses and then successfully executing your plan feels awesome. In the beginning of the game it sets what characters you use but once you get through the main story your options really expand. You can select your team members and take on different challenges as their roles are unlocked. You can create new paradigms and gain bonuses from leveling roles. Leveling roles is linear sadly. Not too many options other than what role you want to level even though it may feel like you have options within the roles tree (or should I say vine?). Leveling weapons, I recommend reading and understanding how it works before you ""put all of your eggs into one basket"". It is very confusing at first but understanding it will help you make the most progress in leveling them.If you give the game some time and pull through the linear-ness and enjoy the story you can have some good fun with it. Especially late in the game.			"

												Super Epic. This is Final Fantasy regardless of whether the haters say so or not. Final Fantasy games always change up, some things you like, some things you might not. The characters are the best since Final Fantsy VI. Just like Resident Evil 6, you have to take the game for what it is, not what you want it to be and you'll enjoy it. It is linear for the first parts of the game, but it opens up on Cocoon and lets you quest and grind. Overall I'm enjoying it. You can see I've played 60 hours so far and I'm not even done with the game.Yeah, it is a straight port. It's not cool that you have to mod it to get higher resolutions, but once you do, it looks much better albeit a bit less stable than I'd like. I save whenever I have the opportunity.Well worth the money, but with all the HD remakes going around, it's a bit disappointing Squeenix didn't make this the definitive version, just by tweaking the code a bit and allowing higher resolutions.Edit: After finishing the game, I still want to go back to Cocoon to finish the C'ieth stone missions. Too bad they didn't let you go back to Cocoon as it changed however. Still, best Final Fantasy yet and I'm aware it could get better AND could have more things like a more open world, etc. Can't wait for FF XV, hope I don't have to wait another 6 years.I also have to add, just like any other PC game, people don't realize resolution goes hand in hand with dpi. I have a 1440p monitor, but it's only slightly higher dpi than my old 1080p 21.5"" monitor. If you were to play this on a TV you'd be sitting alot further back and the aliasing would be unnoticalble. Being that this game was mastered for TVs, I find sitting further back from my monitor really makes the details seems alot smoother and more crisp. Either I'll get a lower resolution TV to game on to go easier on my GPU or when GPUs are powerful enough, I'll get a 4K monitor with at least twice the dpi.			"

This is my first time playing Final Fantasy game, so I don't really know what happen on the previous Final Fantasy game. The graphic is great and it runs smoothly on my tablet. The music feels like orchestra but very repetitive. And the gameplay is very relaxing, it's almost like watching a movie.

												The world of Final Fantasy XIII is stunning. Sadly, we don't get to see enough of it. Calling XIII linear would be an understatement. The game has a deep story with some really interesting characters, watching these characters develop as the story progresses is what Final Fantasy is all about. XIII doesn't fall short in this area.The Visuals and the musical score are beautiful as always, it's a Final Fantasy game after all. For a game released in 2014, the visuals hold up very well against games in 2016.The Crystarium levelling system, while also beautiful to look at, again feels linear. Another sucker punch to the hardcore Final Fantasy fans like myself, is the inability to power level. The Crystarium system locks to each section of the story and puts a halt to over levelling your party. I absolutely recommend FFXIII to hardcore Final Fantasy fans and users that are entirely new to the franchise.A fantastic game yes, but a fantastic Final Fantasy game?			"

												Great storyline and the character development is very realistic in the sense that the character's have conflict. Seeing how each characther's conflicting emotions and need to overcome differences and create a connection to overcome various hardships make this a great story. The gameplay is a bit linear but the battle system and challenges for fighting tough monsters make this game pretty good. You might have more difficulty with drops from enemies but this game promises hours of gameplay if your not just after the story. i would say to 100% complete this game it would probably take about 120 hours at least gameplay.

												Most of us already played it but whatever: Here is my review on Final Fantasy XIII:+ Good optimization (no lags, 60 fps).+ Nice characters who have their individuality.+ Battle system. (But it's only my opinion, depends on your tastes)+ Absolutely, capital B - Beautiful orchestral soundtrack.+ Graphics (not like ""wow"" but still good).- Story, no solid start, feels like you (player) have joined the team in the middle of the game. Most of the time you can't undestand what's going on. They're talking about some places like we already supposed to know most about'em.- Lots of cliches.- Kinda too big cinematic-like black lines, no option to get rid of them.- No option to change screen resolution.Verdict: 8.5/10 I totally recommend you play this game, it's story may not be that good, but that's the only problem with this game while everything else is really good. P.S. To those who complain about ""bad pc port etc"" - speaking from my experience, I've seen worse.________________________________________________________________________________Большинство из нас уже играли, но все-же:   Вот мой отзыв на Final Fantasy XIII: + Хорошая оптимизация (без лагов, 60 кадров в секунду). + Хорошие персонажи, которые имеют свою индивидуальность. + Боевая система.  (Честно говоря на любителя)+ Прекрасная оркестровая музыка. + Графика (не супер, но и не чуть не плохо). - История, нет твёрдой завязки, такое чувство, что я (игрок) присоединился к команде где-то в середине игры. Большую часть времени вы не можете понять, что вообще происходит. Они говорят о происходящем, будто мы в курсе дела. - Киношные чёрные полосы на пол экрана и их не убрать.- Разрешение экрана изменить нельзя. Вердикт: 8,5 / 10 Я полностью рекомендую вам играть в эту игру, c сюжетом может быть ""завернули"" сильно, но это единственное на мой взгляд, что тут из минусов, всё остальное сделано качественно.

												Before I started to play, I read the dismal reviews and I went ahead and prepared myself for profound disappointment. I don't have a great system; I'm playing on integrated graphics with a processor that barely exceeds the minimum requirements. I've had a few FPS drops, but whatever. I was expecting an ugly mess, and I got a game that looks a little dated, but hey, it's five years old and still really pretty. The controls for keyboard were well mapped (except the notorious ESC key that exits the game immediately), and I didn't have any issues getting my Logitech F310 to work. Technically, I haven't had any major issues with the game.Next comes the reviled linearity. Personally, I adored Final Fantasy X in all its linear glory, and I'm not finding this any more restricting. There's even a later game area (I'm not sure how late; I'm not finished with the game) with vast areas for open exploration and many side quests. Where it's linear, I haven't felt uncomfortable or boxed in. Rather, where it's opened up, I've felt a little agoraphobic even.The story is perfectly sensible. If you pay attention, things will make sense when they're supposed to (and they won't make sense when they aren't, but rest assured that everything so far has been given a perfectly reasonable explanation). You're dropped into the middle of a confusing situation, the narrative is nonlinear, things are explained very slowly and only when it's necessary, and that's all fine and good storytelling. I personally have not felt confused except where I knew I was supposed to be, and anything that felt out of place or like some ridiculous deus ex machina device has been explained in a totally believable way.I expected the characters to be annoying. I heard that Lightning was intolerably selfish, that Snow was basically a cross between Seifer and Zell from FFVIII, that Hope hopelessly whined all the time, and that Vanille was just utterly obnoxious. I haven't gotten that impression yet. I'm spellbound by the characterization because it's all about how the protagonists are processing traumatic events. Every ostensibly annoying thing each character does is a perfectly realistic response to trauma and the narrative does nothing to hide that. In that sense, it's carrying on the tradition of characterization in nearly every Final Fantasy game since IV -- creating strong characters out of their responses to past and present trauma.I know I haven't really covered everything about this game, but I can definitely give it my highest recommendation despite not having played all the way through yet. If you're hesitating because of negative reviews, I say give it a try -- it's very inexpensive compared to the original price on the PS3. If the graphics bother you, there are apparently unofficial fixes, though I haven't even thought to look them up yet. It's a great game with good pacing, compelling characters, and a fast-paced though expansive storyline.			"

												I was expecting a visual improvement to at lease support 1080p. Videos could use a better encoding algorithm... Graphics optimizations could be a lot better. Camera rotations are too slugish and no vsync makes it even worst in occasions. I'm hoping for an update patch to address these issues and continue to pass it on to the next releases that are suppose to come out soon. One should not depend on third party programs or force it using graphics panel utilities. I still recommend the game due to the complexity of the engine and some aspects of the game that I personally like.			"

Being locked at 720p is no problem for me and the only real downside is the enormous download. Other than those two very small problems, there is no problem with this port, the game runs fine and if you liked it on ps3, you will like it all the same here.tl;dr-The game is a perfectly fine port, all the ♥♥♥♥♥ing and moaning is people with low specs/hardware.

												Solely addressing to critics~- Don't like it cause FF changed?That is because video game fandoms are often extremely close minded. FFXIII was not what you would expect from a normal FF game due to it's altered combat system and linear gameplay; True, but many often fail to see it as the game it really is which is a beautiful, in depth and intense story driven one.- Don't like it cause it lacks severe gameplay?Everything has its reasons. The entire battle system is bad just because you CAN auto attack? A little more work needs to be done on that criticism. Are the animations weak? Are the moves choppy? It's no where close. It's there to help those that can't select moves fast enough in the live action and who wants to use it. And to base one's stance on that alone is just a pile of cow manure. There's MOBA and FPS games for that. -Bad graphics and resolution?720p and 30ps is not enough? really? that demanding? Yes the game is locked at 720p but is it really that bad? no. It is not as if you play it on a cinema sized screen anyway. Not to mention this was back in 2009. Does the game have any graphic options? no, not in-game but you can force things like AF and AA through Nvidia control panel if you are that desperate.-Game progressing too slow?It is a ''final fantasy'' afterall, sure you would want that fantasy to last longer. (puns intended) Not to mention, the best way to admire something is to do so slowly. Example: No one rushes and speed glance through artworks in a exhibition gallery or museum.			"

Apart from that this is perfect, and i would really hope that all the perfectionists out there would just shut the hell up because if you were a fan of Square Enix you'd at least appreciate that they brought the game to steam anyway.

												The port is not perfect but the game is incredible if you're willing to give it a chance and not listen to the hate brigade. It has many more strong points than weak and at $16 you'll get dozens and dozens of hours of playtime, which is hard to argue with.I come from playing a long list of JRPG's of all shapes and sizes. Final Fantasy XIII has a gripping and unique story that's one of the best ever told in my eyes. The battle system is fun and while it's stripped down it's more focused. It flows nicely and is more engaging and less boring.Most features can be seen as a modern take on the JRPG genre. Obviously some might not like that but if you have an open mind there is a lot to love.I'd say it's a must play if you're into JRPG's or have wanted to try one, even just for the story.			"

(Честно говоря на любителя)+ Прекрасная оркестровая музыка. + Графика (не супер, но и не чуть не плохо). - История, нет твёрдой завязки, такое чувство, что я (игрок) присоединился к команде где-то в середине игры. Большую часть времени вы не можете понять, что вообще происходит. Они говорят о происходящем, будто мы в курсе дела. - Киношные чёрные полосы на пол экрана и их не убрать.- Разрешение экрана изменить нельзя. Вердикт: 8,5 / 10 Я полностью рекомендую вам играть в эту игру, c сюжетом может быть ""завернули"" сильно, но это единственное на мой взгляд, что тут из минусов, всё остальное сделано качественно. П.С. Кто говорит, что порт ужасен - по своему опыту видал куда хуже.			"

												Great storyline and the character development is very realistic in the sense that the character's have conflict. Seeing how each characther's conflicting emotions and need to overcome differences and create a connection to overcome various hardships make this a great story. The gameplay is a bit linear but the battle system and challenges for fighting tough monsters make this game pretty good. You might have more difficulty with drops from enemies but this game promises hours of gameplay if your not just after the story. i would say to 100% complete this game it would probably take about 120 hours at least gameplay.

												Let me just start by saying, the port is perfectly fine. Anyone who is having framerate troubles or drops anywhere must have pretty old hardware because I have no problems whatsoever. Being locked at 720p is no problem for me and the only real downside is the enormous download. Other than those two very small problems, there is no problem with this port, the game runs fine and if you liked it on ps3, you will like it all the same here.tl;dr-The game is a perfectly fine port, all the ♥♥♥♥♥ing and moaning is people with low specs/hardware.

												The port is not perfect but the game is incredible if you're willing to give it a chance and not listen to the hate brigade. It has many more strong points than weak and at $16 you'll get dozens and dozens of hours of playtime, which is hard to argue with.I come from playing a long list of JRPG's of all shapes and sizes. Final Fantasy XIII has a gripping and unique story that's one of the best ever told in my eyes. The battle system is fun and while it's stripped down it's more focused. It flows nicely and is more engaging and less boring.Most features can be seen as a modern take on the JRPG genre. Obviously some might not like that but if you have an open mind there is a lot to love.I'd say it's a must play if you're into JRPG's or have wanted to try one, even just for the story.			"

												Best Final Fantasy hands-down. The visuals are spectacular and the music is in a class of its own. The story-line is amazingly enchanting despite being a little difficult to understand at first. The characters all have unique backstories and personalities, though I do wish they didn't include Sazh as a character since he had no business in being in a Final Fantasy game. I just thought he was unnecessary and took away from the splendor of the game. The battles are amazingly fun and visually pleasing. I LOVE the paradigm system and despite people saying the fact you can only control one character is bad, if you did have control over them, this game would not work, since the battles are way too fast paced for the player to be inputting commands for every character.Pros:- Beautiful visuals. In a league of its own.- Superb soundtrack. Nothing can match. Almost every piece custom orchestrated.- Fun, fast-paced battles.- Thrilling storyline.- Very replayable game.Cons:- Sazh and his son.- Very hard to get gil in this game. And when I say hard, I mean prepare to dedicate a lot of time into farming.- Serah is kind of annoying. Snow too.			"

												Great music with very soft lyrics that are hard to understand but pleasing to the ear. The characters all look absolutely amazing. There are a lot of cute scenes and personalities. The battle format is relatively simple, to the point of frustrating due to the lack of control you can exert over it.The game itself plays out very similarly to Final Fantasy X on Playstation 2. Some key differences are the lack of swapping during battles, and there is absolutely no backwards exploring possible at any point during the game(unless you count the 'license to hunt marks' quest, which TBH is excessively long, clunky, boring, and thoroughly unrewarding aside from some ocassional monster battles). This in my opinion oversimplifies the game itself and makes it hard to appreciate it through remembering what you've done in the game, since you can't 'physically' take your characters back through the game and revisit various parts of the story. You literally have to either replay the game from start to finish or load up various save points that you made along the way, or else you can't go back to try to jog your memory at all. This is not the same as FFX because at least in that game, with admittedly a great many exceptions, you could backwards explore to jog your memory.The side questing is very limited and totally unrewarding. It also feels forced, as if you have to do the 'side quests' in order to win the game. Well, not all of the quests feel this way. And part of it depends on your attachment to the characters. Still, I felt like most of the fun was in the game's story itself and the side quests just got in the way. It's a far cry from my favorite FF games in that regard. I guess half the problem can be traced back to how incredibly restrictive the game was and how time-consuming it is as a result to actually complete the quests. You literally have to spend like 20 minutes going across terrain just to get started on a quest if you making good time, another 20 minutes embarking on the quest, another 20 minutes completing the quest, and another 20 just getting back to where you started in some cases. That's easily over an hour if you hurry and don't mess up just to do one tiny part of the mark hunting quest.By the time you're able to win the game, you probably powered up your characters just about as much as possible. And then you get to make them even stronger. For what? For more incredibly mind-numbing side-quests? No thanks.One pretty neat thing that could be easily overlooked is the attention to detail with the weapons. You could appear to be holding a completely different weapon depending on what sort of elemental buff your weapon might be enchanted with, if it was indeed affected by a Synergist's spell. And the summons are somewhat entertaining, although you can only have the character you control do the summoning and only for whatever power they have access to. Also, the summons are basically your limit break. You can also use your limit break bar(it's called  Technical Points for whatever reason) for other stuff, but anyway you really have to use it wisely because it's not easy to regenerate at all once you start using it.The game might be worth it for the story and the beautiful music as well as amazing graphics but when it comes to battles and quests it just doesn't deliver fun. Furthermore, if you play the game on your computer, you may experience extremely annoying glitches. One in particular that has plagued me from start to finish is this one where I can't exit the game when I wish to. There is a massive delay most of the time for that. Another one that is probably related is the trouble with alternating between programs while it is running. This can even mean that I have to hit the Start menu button before pressing the function key on my keyboard to either mute or lower/raise the volume. Coupled with the extremely time-consuming side quests, the glitches make this game suck up way too much time.			"

												With the December update, XIII looks better than ever. Just like in The Last Remnant, the attention to detail in every wall and floor and lush plant is amazing. They have an extremely talented group of artists that make every battle a delight to witness, and every step you take filled with intricate little details that are easy to overlook, but amazing to study once noticed. You don't control every move for each member in your group, you assign them class roles and let them do thier thing. Usually it's helpful, sometimes they do things that make no sense in the moment, like casting a lightning protection spell on each member becuase the single creature you are fighting uses lighthing, even though just adding water to everyones attack would take it out within half a minute. I'm playing on easy so I can get through the story line and start on XIII-2, so every battle is fun and slightly challenging, but not frustrating or needing super studying and planning and perfecting your loadout. I prefer it that way. The last detail I made sure of was to use Japanese voices with subtitles. Just like in my anime, I find the Japanese voice actors to be leagues ahead of the English speaking talent. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to any RPG enthusiast, especially anyone that loves Final Fantasy and Square Enix.			"

												I've enjoyed this port, but, as so many other posters have said, without Durante, this would've been a very problematic port.The graphics hold up significantly better than games made significantly more recently than FFXIII, so that's certainly a positive.  The characters' stories are better than are advertised overall.  The linearity is only an issue if you've become used to open world games.  If this is your the first FF game you've played, a lot of the complaints by FF series veterans won't really apply.			"

												I was going to wait until I completed the game to review it but I decided over 30 hours in is enough time to give it a fair assessment. So how is the port, and more importantly how is the actual game? I'll start with the port itself.A lot of noise has been made about this port if you haven't done any searching around the steam community page or checked the user reviews much. Raging nonsensical rants asside a lot of what is said is true. The lack of resolution settings, graphical settings and sound settings are not available at this point in time. This does bother me and I don't want to say I am thrilled with them being ommitted from the game. All I can really say about it is for the future FFXIII titles they bring to Steam I will hope and expect them to add these options and perhaps maybe even patching this game to add them. On my end though I have had zero crashes, bugs and only on one occurance have I had major frame drops (a quick restart of the game and all was fixed).As far as the game itself goes, I really don't have anything but positives to say about it. First of all, the music is fantastic. I am a fairly novice FF gamer (I've played 10 fully, 11, 14 and parts of 9 and Tactics) and the music is usually one of the best parts of the game. This one does not dissappoint and might even be my favorite of the games I've played. Next I would like to talk about how beautiful some of the zones and scenery are in this game. There have been numerous times throughout the game where I stop just to look around and soak in the environment. For a game that came out in 2009 the graphics still hold up very well and have really impressed me. A few standouts to me were Lake Bresha, Nautilus, Sunleth Waterscape, Gapra Whitewood and Sulyya Springs. There is still more game for me to play so I wouldn't be surprised to see more beautiful areas.The characters are also a positive for me in this game. It seems to be a polarizing topic but to me all of the characters show great development and it is very interesting to find out about how the characters are connected to each other (trying to avoid spoilers here, of course). Lightning is probably my favorite of the chracters to progress. She starts out very closed-minded and standoffish but opens up into a great character.The story is also another positive for me. There have been a few twists and outside of the first 30 minutes or so I've never felt lost. I would definitely recommend reading the data log to fill in any holes the cut-scenes may leave out or just to reassure what you just saw or heard from the characters.A part of the game that you will either hate, like or feel indifferent to (it's impossible not to have an opinion on it) is the linearity. It is definitely a restricted game (for the most part) as to where you can go and how you get there. If you are just interested in a heavily story focused game that doesn't involve tons of exploring you will likely enjoy the game. Personally, I don't mind the linearity of it at all because I am playing for the story and have never been a fan of grinding or getting lost in huge zones with random fights popping up every few steps.When I originally looked into the game for the console I thought the lack of control of all the characters in the combat system would be a turn-off for me. How wrong I was. The combat in this game starts off slow but really picks up the further into the game you get and is an absolute blast. Boss fights always leave me thinking how much fun it was and the need to constantly switch paradigms quickly is chaotic at times. The dificulty level heavily picks up when you get to a completely new location (again, avoiding spoilers) and has challenged me a lot. I wouldn't say the game is overly difficult to the point where you want to throw your controller at the screen but it is far from an easy game. It has a nice balance of very tough and easy fights in-between.Anyways, sorry for the ramble but I just LOVE this game and would definitely recommend it for the price of $15.99 or more power to you if you can get it cheaper. This seems to be a polarizing game but from my end I couldn't be happier with my purchase and hope you will be happy as well if you end up purchasing this title. Can't wait for to finish the game and the series.			"

												This game is getting a bad rap but...-It's fun-There is plenty of polish on the overall presentation-I'm not having any graphical issues playing on a 55"" LED TV-XBox controller auto configured perfectly without me having to change anything.The game is getting slapped by reviewers because the resolution is locked to 720p but it looks better than the PS3 and XBox versions.  The file size is large but... so what?  It's considered a subpar final fantasy but in reality if you drop the FF name, it's great as a standalone game.  It is linear but simple enough you can just relax and enjoy the ride.  Have some FUN!  That's what games are all about.			"

												Solid but unspectaculary. An attractive and slow moving game that really really eases you into it's moderately shallow world. Long areas that overstay their welcome in some cases. Long expository conversations that overstay almost always. A very poor script undercuts characters that could have made for interesting dramatic moments, even if there are one or two very well made moments in there.Having said all that, the game is relaxing to play for the most part. The battle system really gets going late on, and if you're a completionist then I think there is a lot to sink your teeth into. I personally loved the latter third of the game and taking on the optional bosses. The battle system being relaxing as I said previously helps the grind that the bigger challenges require prior to taking them on.There's about 10-12 hours of decent game in here. Which is worth the €10-12 investment. It may be among the worst of the Final Fantasies, but it is by no means a bad game. It is merely a slightly above average game.All in all, it's the 'Michael Bay - Transformers' version of a Final Fantasy game. It's got pretty explosions, it runs a bit too long, and it has tainted a brand.But that battle music is worth the money alone!			"

First of all, the music is fantastic. I am a fairly novice FF gamer (I've played 10 fully, 11, 14 and parts of 9 and Tactics) and the music is usually one of the best parts of the game. This one does not dissappoint and might even be my favorite of the games I've played. Next I would like to talk about how beautiful some of the zones and scenery are in this game. There have been numerous times throughout the game where I stop just to look around and soak in the environment. For a game that came out in 2009 the graphics still hold up very well and have really impressed me. A few standouts to me were Lake Bresha, Nautilus, Sunleth Waterscape, Gapra Whitewood and Sulyya Springs. There is still more game for me to play so I wouldn't be surprised to see more beautiful areas.The characters are also a positive for me in this game. It seems to be a polarizing topic but to me all of the characters show great development and it is very interesting to find out about how the characters are connected to each other (trying to avoid spoilers here, of course). Lightning is probably my favorite of the chracters to progress. She starts out very closed-minded and standoffish but opens up into a great character.The story is also another positive for me. There have been a few twists and outside of the first 30 minutes or so I've never felt lost. I would definitely recommend reading the data log to fill in any holes the cut-scenes may leave out or just to reassure what you just saw or heard from the characters.A part of the game that you will either hate, like or feel indifferent to (it's impossible not to have an opinion on it) is the linearity. It is definitely a restricted game (for the most part) as to where you can go and how you get there. If you are just interested in a heavily story focused game that doesn't involve tons of exploring you will likely enjoy the game. Personally, I don't mind the linearity of it at all because I am playing for the story and have never been a fan of grinding or getting lost in huge zones with random fights popping up every few steps.When I originally looked into the game for the console I thought the lack of control of all the characters in the combat system would be a turn-off for me. How wrong I was. The combat in this game starts off slow but really picks up the further into the game you get and is an absolute blast. Boss fights always leave me thinking how much fun it was and the need to constantly switch paradigms quickly is chaotic at times. The dificulty level heavily picks up when you get to a completely new location (again, avoiding spoilers) and has challenged me a lot. I wouldn't say the game is overly difficult to the point where you want to throw your controller at the screen but it is far from an easy game. It has a nice balance of very tough and easy fights in-between.Anyways, sorry for the ramble but I just LOVE this game and would definitely recommend it for the price of $15.99 or more power to you if you can get it cheaper. This seems to be a polarizing game but from my end I couldn't be happier with my purchase and hope you will be happy as well if you end up purchasing this title. Can't wait for to finish the game and the series.			"

												I've enjoyed this port, but, as so many other posters have said, without Durante, this would've been a very problematic port.The graphics hold up significantly better than games made significantly more recently than FFXIII, so that's certainly a positive.  The characters' stories are better than are advertised overall.  The linearity is only an issue if you've become used to open world games.  If this is your the first FF game you've played, a lot of the complaints by FF series veterans won't really apply.			"

												So, I am a big fan of Final Fantasy. I have played every single version from the original released way back in the nintendo generation before sega. First off, I do have mixed feelings. I loved this game when it first came out. And I still somewhat love it.Pros: Really great graphics, low load for graphics pull on GPU, and of course the in-depth material that allows you to spend day on end completing C'ieth quests and/or missions.Cons: Really obvious emotional extremes, such that characterisation is both typical and stereotypical, the lack of in-depth characterisation makes one feel like they are in a soap opera, the story line is linear but instead of that compelling urge to complete the next step you feel as if you want to drag your feet, Insane storage requirements (50+ GB), and horrible porting system that does not allow you to change brightness, sound, and or framerate. Other issues: the overall scalability between the heroes and the enemies is vast, even maxed you feel desparate. Also, I normally beat all of my RPG's that I own save for a few, where I really don't wish to know the ending. For X-2 I used a gameshark or codebreaker to see the ending back in the day. For this one I watched youtube and/or waited a year to actually beat the game after putting it off on the side because I had found something better. Overall: A graphic designer's dream come true with sappy characterisation that hurts the audiences and/or player's disinterested goodwill, unless the player is imature and/or unable to process emotional understanding.

												This is my first time to play FF Series and this is my review from my HEART!!!I play until Chapter 11 and I feel bad with the game so much because of !!! ****ING BATTLE SYSTEM !!!- When switching role during battle ****ing camera focus on each character and they will get heavy damage during they are doing a pose AND DIEE!!!.- No formation, it depend on LUCK!!!! that how character standing if luckily they are separate they will not take serious damage by enemy AOE magic or physical attacking. if not DOOOOOOM!!! - Condition of game over is annoying a lot, if leader is die then game over even other member is survived or not(With my comments above)- Not fair magic skill, I observe for a long time during I play the game some of AOE magic (for example, Thundera, Fira, Watera) For player them they just doing damage while the enemy side can make INTERUPT!!!! Some battles I engage with 6-7 monsters and all of them have this AOE magic skill. I always get interupt and cannot even to heal myself and finally DIE~~~ because I always got interupt.- Potion is useless in the endgameI play until chapter 11, I have only healing item [Potion] only which can heal for 150HP.I never found greater grade one. Does it have only point?????- everything in the game looks very linear and limitation of resourceIt is very different from other RPG games that I cannot farm or leveling my character. Beating monster just receive only Skill point no money and items (it also drop but very low chance)- I cannot distingush between useful spoils and useless spoilsWhen I receive some spoils from monsters.I don't know which one is for crafting, which one is for selling, and which one for upgrading gears.

												First and foremost, it's an extremely bare-bones port. No graphical options, no resolution changes, no nothing. You're getting a direct copy of the PS3 version that just happens to run on your PC, although it does come with the Japanese voice acting, the difficulty setting option from the JP re-release, and it runs at 60 FPS instead of 30 like the console versions. Also, the required specs (and the recommended ones, for that matter) are really low and you'd need a pretty terrible machine to not be able to run it.Aside from that, it's FF13 and you probably already know whether or not you're going to like it. On one hand, it still looks gorgeous even for being 5 years old, the music is pretty good, and the combat's fun. On the other, the story is awful, the pacing is terrible, and it's excessively linear, so if that matters to you stay far away. I like it, and for $16 you could do a hell of a lot worse. To be fair, you could do a hell of a lot better too, but I think it's at least worth giving it a shot.			"

Just like all previous games in the series I can't stop playing.  It may be linear but I could give a fat rats♥♥♥♥♥about that, as I've said a good story trumps all that.  The combat system is engaging.  Story done in FF fashion, I like the characters, they have there flaws.  I alway's look forward to see what is gonna happen next and happily hack away at enemies to get there while trying to progress my characters.  Square Enix made a very well rounded game, they deliver a experience like none other.			"

They want to step on Final Fantasy XIII. The game plays really well even without a controller (it is better with one). Even though you can't change the graphic settings the game looks amazing. You don't need graphic settings for every game that exists. The combat is better than almost any JRPG on Steam. The voice acting is great (I've only played with Japanese audio with English subtitles). I would also like to point out that many of the top reviews do not have very much play time so they can't judge the game correctly.The Final Fantasy XIII port isn't the best port possible but still deserves a 7.5/10			"

												Love this game.Just to throw it out there, yes, this is a linear Final Fantasy but the story & characters are beautiful, well, most of the characters. The story can throw you off at times (a little bit confusing) but overall it really does consume you.Battles are fun & fast paced but are heavily automated. You only control 1 of your 3 party members in battle, and even then you're mostly just going to be spamming A (auto attack). Strategy is added to the game however with the introduction of the paradigm system, at least for boss battles anyway, you're gonna need a plan.Don't play easy mode, normal mode isn't rediculously difficult, plus your drop rates are downgraded on easy mode & you can always switch between difficulty if you do get stuck.The resolution & shadow/AA additions are also a sweet new addition to the PC edition, making the version look noticeably better than just a console port. Frame rates aren't the best, even on a high-end PC like mine, but it should never drop below 30hz (which is faster than what you could achieve on the consoles!).Great soundtrack, but do I really need to remind you that it's a Final Fantasy?Buy this before 13-2... or any other game for that matter!

If you want to be indulge in a Final Fantasy story and you don't mind the game's linear system.  I would recommend this game.  It sounds a little bias since I myself am a Final Fantasy fan.  I don't like to look at the bad things about Final Fantasy.  Just appreciate the game for what it is.  But if you think you're 60+ hours is worth more for doing other things, I won't stop you.  If you want good gameplay, I recommend you play the Final Fantasy XIII: Lightning Returns (Third installation to the FFXIII franchise).			"

												I dont understand the negative reviews on the game altogether and now that I am almost 20 hours invested into the game, here is what I would like to share. I have never owned a console after PS1 so my last Final Fantasy game was FFIX and the open world concept was what I have been very used to. Even though there isn't an open world concept, I feel fully immersed in the battle system and the storyline with awesome cutscenes.Perhaps it is due to my lack of history with the original version on the PS3, many people complained about the cutscenes and/or audio which I dont see a problem.The only 2 issue are with the Esc button which I dont face personally as I play it on a controller and the lack of graphical options by forcing the awesome game on a 720p resolution. But if you check online, you will find a way pass the 720p issue and I have been playing it on 1080p from day 1.I look forward to the other ports from Square Enix and hope they do port over the FFIX and other FFs like FFX which I have read that also do not offer the open world concept.

												I don't really care if they say this is a bad port from ps3 or xbox360 because it doesn't have Graphic option which is common to all PC game and we can only enjoy it in 720p (there's a mod to make it up to 4K), at least it runs in 60fpsIf there is anything i hate in this game, it is battle system.I spent over 80 hours to play this game, all i did was building characters and paradigm (roles in battle). In battle, i just kept hitting Auto-battle, an option to automatically choose abilities to fight against your enemies base on what you had learnt about them (their weakness, immunity, resistance,...). If their info remains unknown to you, choosing Auto-battle will randomly choose abilities which allow you to learn more about them and sometimes give you disadvantage (there's also a technique called Libra and an item called Librascope, by using them you can learn everything about your enemies immediately), there's also Abilities option which allows you to choose abilities manually if you know what to do, when you face enemies who you learnt everything about them, Auto-battle might be the best option to beat them faster, but it just make the game easier and more boring, it feels like you're not actually the one who play the game but the system itself.Despite of battle system, i still many things in this game like story, soundtrack, cinematics,... Some people say the story is confusing but i don't think it is, cause i don't want any spoiler here. If you want to know more and even enjoy the game, buy then play it.			"

												People complain about the linearity of this game, but is it really different than any other Final Fantasy? An open world gives the illusion of choice, but the plot of every Final Fantasy game is linear. Rather than letting us ""decide"" whether to get lost on the world map or not, Final Fantasy XIII gives us interesting tactical choices. Every weapon you find can become an ultimate weapon. Every character is different and useful. The great feeling of trying out parties made up of different roles has been boiled down the core mechanic and we can make this decision many times per battle. I don't think the linearity hurts FFXIII in any way. Rather, I think the useless decisions have been removed and we're left with just the interesting ones.			"

												I personally enjoy this game! The graphics are nice the environment is beautiful great soundtrack. Some people dislike the new combat system and gameplay, I personally think it adds a really fun twist to it. The paradigm makes this game like no other FF series. Would i still prefer the old system of jrpg turnbase of course! but the paradigm system is also very fun and very very strategic. Theres a lot of strategy that goes into formulating your paradigm etc. The only con i'll say are the edolons (summons) without spoiling too much lets just say there isnt many summons in this game. The story can get confusing in the begining but as you play on it'll all make sense like a puzzle! Lastly i want to add is that the game do however have a very slow start from teh into ~ chapter2 but once you get pass that it'll start to pick up. I read a lot of people says it pick up after chp 10, I can honestly say thats not true for me once I reached chp3 the story started picking up and the game had me playing for hours because like a great book I wanted to discover more about the story. In the end of the day FF is mainly popular for their amazing story telling which this game has!			"

												The game is epic and hard to stop playng it if you start.for a player who dont know the other FF series its a BIG CONFUSE STORY at the begin without kontext and anything, but early you get a feeling for the story and the character and it rocks more and more.The graphics sucks if you dont configurate it but if you have it.. its WOW (Configurate it with GeDoSaTo to 1080p,high res and fullscreen).And for 13€ for this long cinematic epic movie/game by far fairpay BUY IT!

												I personally enjoy this game! The graphics are nice the environment is beautiful great soundtrack. Some people dislike the new combat system and gameplay, I personally think it adds a really fun twist to it. The paradigm makes this game like no other FF series. Would i still prefer the old system of jrpg turnbase of course! but the paradigm system is also very fun and very very strategic. Theres a lot of strategy that goes into formulating your paradigm etc. The only con i'll say are the edolons (summons) without spoiling too much lets just say there isnt many summons in this game. The story can get confusing in the begining but as you play on it'll all make sense like a puzzle! Lastly i want to add is that the game do however have a very slow start from teh into ~ chapter2 but once you get pass that it'll start to pick up. I read a lot of people says it pick up after chp 10, I can honestly say thats not true for me once I reached chp3 the story started picking up and the game had me playing for hours because like a great book I wanted to discover more about the story. In the end of the day FF is mainly popular for their amazing story telling which this game has!			"

												The game looks incredible on my laptop.  Easily prettier than when I played it on the PS3.  I have i7 quad core processor 2670QM, 12 gb ddriii ram, with an nvidia gtx 570m 3gb gddr5.I suffer no slowdown or pauses.  The game plays flawlessly.  I know there are ways to force the game to play at a resolution higher than 720p, but I find the game gorgeous as it is.I must also confess that I enjoy the story, characters and mechanics of the game while some do seem not to.  This will be my second time to complete the game, the first being on the PS3.It's not a bad price to try if you have never played.			"

												Love this game.Just to throw it out there, yes, this is a linear Final Fantasy but the story & characters are beautiful, well, most of the characters. The story can throw you off at times (a little bit confusing) but overall it really does consume you.Battles are fun & fast paced but are heavily automated. You only control 1 of your 3 party members in battle, and even then you're mostly just going to be spamming A (auto attack). Strategy is added to the game however with the introduction of the paradigm system, at least for boss battles anyway, you're gonna need a plan.Don't play easy mode, normal mode isn't rediculously difficult, plus your drop rates are downgraded on easy mode & you can always switch between difficulty if you do get stuck.The resolution & shadow/AA additions are also a sweet new addition to the PC edition, making the version look noticeably better than just a console port. Frame rates aren't the best, even on a high-end PC like mine, but it should never drop below 30hz (which is faster than what you could achieve on the consoles!).Great soundtrack, but do I really need to remind you that it's a Final Fantasy?Buy this before 13-2... or any other game for that matter!

												This game kinda ruined my childhood. How, you ask? Well I waited for this game since 2005. Square made this game as an experiment. Square ENIX THAT IS. They wanted to go next-gen after squaresoft failed by investing too much in the spirits within. Eh, anyway. Square enix made this game it's not as good as everyone wanted it to be. As a final fantasy game it kinda fails because you don't care that much about the characters. Sure, I might be wrong but at least I kinda cried when ff10 ended. Uh, why do I write this review?

												As a port, I have no complaints, it does everything I could want.  As a game, I have a couple.I started it up and thought while playing it ""Why did I hate this on PS3?"" Then it got to Snow and I thought ""Oh yeah, that guy.""  It's not just Snow, there are too many characters for me to actually care about any of them, I liked FF 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10-2, 13-2 and Lightning returns because there were only a few main characters and they weren't sad all the time.  Not to mention the terrible writing, the cleverness of NORA's motto (""The army's no match for NORA"" <- that is supposed to motivate people?) is indicative of the game's dialogue in general.  Combat, I like it, I like XIII-2 and Lightning Returns better but I like the combat in this game.Exploration, there is none.  Example, in FFIX as soon as the game starts you get to explore the city as Vivi, talk to people, find hidden treasures, play the awesome card game. 7 and 8 and 10 and 10-2 and 12 might not all have the card game, but they have exploration and mini games almost from the start.  13 doesn't have any until you get to Gran Pulse and even then it isn't comparable to past titles. I can deal with the terrible writing and sad and numerous characters, but the lack of exploration ruins it for me.			"

It would get a 10/10 if there was a FF7 movie based on the original game. The Final Fantasy movie sucks.I feel like I am Cloud in real life.Sometimes at night I dress like Cloud and go into Tokyo city swinging my big aluminum Buster sword around. I feel like I could beat any boss.Now stop reading my review and buy this game.

Posted: December 3, 2014
												Of course this game is a type of ""Like it or hate it"", and i'm one of the guys to choose to like this game, so the reason beyond that choice, i'm going to tell them all below:Pros :- Characters, yea i'm not going to lie, i really like the characters, and my favorite is Snow, serah, and Noel (XIII-2). i just dont know the reason why people hate those characters. They are well made by SE for me.- Story, people say the story is confusing, not good, hard to understand, mediocre, bla bla blah... well it's just for people who just play it and didn't really try to think with how to blend the story for them, they just judge it with a flash. well for me, first while playing this game i don't understand what is it about, l'cie? cieth? fal'cie? what happened? well after playing and playing with trying hard to understand, i can finally know what's the meaning of the story, and it's great. in a rating maybe it's 7.5/10 though, but still great for story, especially seeing that Snow's story haha.- Combat/Battle system, yea it's just fun great battle, it's more fast paced unlike the older FF where it's a little slow and a little unlogic battle (anyway it's still fun, i'm not hating the older FF) while this one's battle system is more active like on a real fighting battle and more of a logic for fighting ( for me ). well anyway if only SE could make a little challenge for the battle system like adding maybe some MP, so using magics will be limited, so items are usefull in the game.- Graphic, damn you all can see it the graphic for a 2009-2010 era graphics, it's an eye candy and the motion of their face are like very lively.- Music, well i don't know why people didn't get soooo much interest in the OST of FF XIII unlike on the older FF, maybe because the FF XIII name got like ugly on public that makes people not trying to touch some great feature on FF XIII like the music. It's cool you know, especially i really love the prelude ( opening ), the battle themes ( almost all of them ), and some other themes.Cons  :- The gameplay linier from the beginning chapter to chapter 11 ( the end of linierity ), this game just keep on forcing you to just rush all way to the front while fighting the enemies again and again sometimes boring enemy repetitive.- No towns, like this is not an usual RPG that have been played by people, cuz people expected RPG to have some towns, shops, different shop location with different items each placed or maybe some hidden good shop, instead an all-in-one shop in a save point that doesnt really make sense ( even though it's a fantasy..) and the upgrade on the save point, really -_-- I hate the idea of no COOL CHALLENGING BOSS!! oh c'mon that's some thing that MUST have on RPG, well for me haha. i know there is Cid Rayne, but that's just a normal boss, not really challenging. What i mean by challenging is like a post game boss that's is humanoid and a little cool, just like you make for Kingdom Hearts :( aw cmon, like Vanitas remnant, sephiroth, Lingering Will (Terra), Roxas (KH2FM+), and some other ones..- The Ending Cutscene of the game, well the stories and cutscenes in the beginning and middle game is good u know, but after hours of playing to see the ending, it's kind of dissapointing, like it's just like that ending, especially on the later game (FF XIII-2 i mean it)..- The equipment and status uncomplexity, well maybe for you guys this doesn't really bother, but for me it really bothers me for realll. Look the equipment, only weapon, and accessories?? wazaaa????? cmon where is the little complex equipment for them, for each char, and i'm complaining the status too dude, only STR MAG HP and ELEMENTAL/STATUS RESISTANCE. For what is that resistance if the equipment isn't that much complex, like at least add armor, or something for more customization equipment, so each character have VERY different statuses. oh god SE you ruin one of my very favorite FF series T_T i really love the chars and musics actually ...- From what i know, this game FF XIII is an anti mini game game.. The mini game in this game is where hope use the juggernaut for cleaning the way. But that's not a repeatable mini-game, like for what is that, not really important with that juggernaut mini-game, i hope for more detail on it, like you got some badass good important item for destroying a certain amount kill. I forgot which is the other mini-game or maybe only that...- Eidolons not very useful throughout the game, oh really like how much do you rely your fighting using eidolons...especially bosses, cuz eidolons is just a crap weak being -_-That's the pros and cons of the games i wrote based on MY opinion, as you can see the CONS is more than the PROS, but but but, the pros is  more complex from what you see unlike the cons, and i still would recommend this game for real, if you are a type of someone who loves cool characters, stories, battle though..That's my opinion, sorry if there is some hard to understand sentence on my review, so... What's your opinion?? Hope it's some positive :D			"

												After graphics options where added, I could honestly say, this is indeed a port I wish it would have been released way earlier than it did (hoping the same for new releases). Square Enix is doing some amazing work with all the games they have been releasing/porting for PC so far. I will give this a 10 out of 10 not only because the game is good (underrated as well) but also because of the novelty decision of bringing FF games such as this series to PC. This is a huge step forward to the removal of game exclusivity.Keep up the good work.			"

The story line is alright it could be a little more solid, The fight system is good I really enjoy it. The Crystarium System took some time to get used to later in the game and I would suggest paying attention when it comes to making your choiced with it because it could hamper what happens later with fights.

The biggest issue is if you used any resolution other than 720p important gameplay text doesn't render.At the point I'm writing this I haven't played enough to have an opinion about the game itself. But, like, come on, seriously, in the patch notes they seem so proud of themselves that they added resolution options, which don't actually work.			"

												Look, this game has a good graphic i give you that however this is not a good game. Yes, the battle concept was unique and intresting however this game is missing the core that makes final fantasy a good game. The world concept was not as it was used to be, previous FF have the concept of open world and let the players roam free however this game did not offer the same concept. If you are the type of gamer that only see games based on the graphic, easy gameplay, and unappealing story then this game is for you. All the ""positive"" reviews i see is based on the graphic, but im here to give you the hard truth. Compared to it's previous game, this FF sucks. Just face it, the hardest game mode was on normal (even normal was easy, compared to ff 7 fighting omega), the HP back to full whenever the fight is over, using ""skills (ie. Heal and magic)"" does not cost you mana, it is just not a good game.Overall i would rate this game 6 / 10			"

												TO play this in its current state with reasonable settings got a modern PC requires several additional tools and ends up like playing it on an emulator rather than a solid end product. I assume that it was merely short sightedness on the Developer's side, rather than anything else.No complains about the SOundtrack Artstyle or Story. These have never been the weakpoint of Final Fantasy. In fact, these are the only reasons I am clicking to recommend the game.			"

												This is a very good and solid jRPG title that has been awfully ported to PC. It is a real shame that SE released a broken and unplayable game that community managed to fix within two hours from the release.Yes, the community fixed the game with GeDoSaTo and you can play it with 16:9 resolution. Texture quality is still 720p, but lets be honest, we all played worst looking games then this one; and with this price tag it is not that bad of a deal regardless.As for the other issues:Frame rate is dropping below 60fps.It is dropping below 60fps, but never below 30fps, and given the nature of this game, the frame rate doesn't really matter. This is not a first person shooter that requires high precision, this is a turn base combat game, for crying out loud, and as long as you are above 30fps you'll be fine.ESC quits/crashes the game without saving.As far as I can tell there is a working solution to this issue, I have never tested it, I am using a controller.There are no tool tips for Xbox controller.Wrong. There are, you just have to go to the in game settings menu and turn them on. The game does not switch automatically when the controller is detected.Is the game worth it?Yes, it is. But be advised:First two chapters are boring and annoying. You are thrown into the middle of things, you have no idea who your character is, who the other characters are, you have no idea what is going on, and the game tries really hard not to explain you anything whatsoever and to confuse you even further. Also, majority of that time you will spend on controlling Snow and Vanille, because playing as Lightening is too mainstream. During those two chapters you are constantly interrupted by cutscenes and battles. Battles are especially annoying because you have one fight every 5 seconds, the battle is one hit = one kill so it is usually over after (literally) 3 seconds and on top of that you are forced to watch unskipable intro and unskipable statistics screen every single time which adds another 5-10 seconds to each battle.After 2-3 hours you are in the 3rd chapter gaining access to Crystarium (magic) and the fun begins. Battles are longer and more challenging, killing monsters is more rewarding and the game finally starts to explain the story. Unfortunately, the game insist on being painfully linear to the point where you cannot even choose your team and the party leader.Aside of that, it is a solid title, grab it if you enjoy this genre, you'll not be disappointed.Also, shame on SE for this laughable port. If the community managed to fix the game in two hours there is no excuse for releasing it in this miserable state.			"

												If you download and play the game as is, it's still plays and looks great. In fact, it's the exact same experience for the most part as everyone got on PS3 and XBox (720p upscaled). As of the writing of this review there are Resolution and graphics fixes linked on the community hub page that does 1080p beautifully with added effects. If you download and use that (GeDoSaTo), which is super easy, then you get the full PC experience that really should be available by default. Game companies do need to understand what PC gamers expect and adding some graphics options is just common sense...that has eluded SE for the most part.This game has an awesome story and the gameplay is fun and addictive. The battle system is traditional JRPG for the most part and is very accessible for all gamers. It's also a very deep combat system if you explore the nuances. The cut scenes are top notch. The voive acting is great in english and japanese. Keep in mind that due to the inclusion of Japenes audio it's a 60GB file. Also has to do with the vast number of HD cutscenes.The game opens up around Chapter 11 for all you looters and grinders. The character trees upgrade stats and earn you spells based on CP points eraned through combat. Weapons are upgraded through components, some more rare than others. This is where the game shines and allows for hours of maxing stats and hunting. Get the Gamefaqs and get it going!All around definitely worth getting, even considering the resolution issue. I understand why people put pressure on SE to do this right, but this is an awesome game regardless, especially at less than 20 bucks.			"

												The pc port has a lot of mess. I have been spending the last three days to figure out how to make the controller work. Also, the game uses your INTEGRATED GPU by default. I use pinnacle game profiler to overcome the controller problem and set my nvidia gpu to run this game. Since I play this game on 14 inch laptop screen, I don't see major difference with 1080p setting. however you should be aware that gedosato and pinnacle game profiler might conflict each other. I cannot run both of them running at same time without messing up my controller scheme.after that, it became a very acceptable port. Not the best but it could have been better.			"

												Its a good game.., and for the !cheap! price on steam I picked it up for the PC.Cons:  Lack of Video settings, and locked at 720p.  Also the super non-prompt quit ESC button is hardcore evil... EDIT: this has been fixed so thats awesome!Pros: Amazing story.. i really loved it.  Graphics are still beautiful.People Bash on FFXIII all the time, but i fell in love with it, and enjoyed it even more as soon as the story progresses after Cocoon.EDIT: I've been playing this game for awhile now, and have had zero issues running it.  It runs smooth, and with some forced Anti-aliasing it looks pretty damn great.  Haters gonna Hate, but Im liking the game.			"

												Will preface this saying that it isn't a BAD port, but it is a bit of a lazy one. It operates almost indentically to the console version and for all intents and purposes works perfecly well, but the resolution lock and the bizarre rarity of framerates above 30fps let it down. You can do some manual tweaks via your GPU control panel to bump the framerate a bit, and GeDoSaTo can be easily applied to increase the resolution to your liking, but really options like this should be in the game's graphics settings already.That being said, if we're to judge the game on its merits, whilst it's seen as a bit of a black sheep of the FF family, it IS a well made game with some properly stunning visuals and an interesting fast-paced combat system. The game world has some very intriguing lore and the story in general is quite good, but do keep in mind that it's quite a linear game and you don't really get to explore much.So yeah, a good game that got a serviceable, if lacking, port.

												I grew up with this game and so far i've played FF VIII, IX, X and XII. I would say that im a fan of the series, just maybe not a fanatic one. FF XII its different from the rest of the series, if you played all of them you know that SE its always trying to improve the FF series and trying different things its always risky. FF XIII its not a perfect game, but its a good one. The combat system its a improvement but i'd rather choose what all my characters do it. This doesnt mean that the combat system its bad, it just has space to be better. The port its a bad one, 49gb download with low resolution and bad on keyboard controls. Luck we have a mod to fix the resolution and i have a controller to play just like in the console. Considering that this game was one of the first games on PS3 i didint get mad about it but id rather see a better job next time.Im still playing so i will not tell anything about the story just yet. I think this game worth it buying, just low your expectations, the other FFs are better.			"

												The port is subpar, but okay. It goes to 60fps, has dual audio, and windowed mode. Far from the worst port in existance. More graphics and window size options would be nice, however.I like this game. I like the characters, story, and setting. It's flawed in it's execution, but it's fun nonetheless. Takes a little while to get going, but once it does it's good. It lacks a lot of Final Fantasy qualities, but it is by no means a bad game in and of itself. They work on fixing the flaws in the later games, which I, as a longtime consumer, appreciate. Square listens. They care.  "

												The port as its sold isn't that great. Very limited resolution, no video options, and controller schemes are a little confusing at first.   Download a program called GeDosAToTool - this will allow for much nicer resolution and effects.  After I got that set up and my xbox controller working the game has been great. Looks much better than 360 / ps3 did and I have ran in to no crashes.    "
