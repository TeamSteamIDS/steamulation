												I don't know if I have played enough to write this review but I'll try.At first I like to say this, I wanted to give a positive vote for this game but I can't. Why? Because of things that have been happening in last few months.What is positive, neutral or negative in Dragon's Prophet (EU)? (At least, how I see it.)Positive--->+ Hundreds of tameable dragons (or you can hatch them from an egg and get better stats).+ Purchasable dragons are not any better than dragons you can tame.+ Most of the content can be done solo but of course it's much more fun and rewarding with friend(s).+ Combat system and how you can fight side by side with tamed dragons.+ A lot of things to do if you are bored to do quests and such things.+ You can easily pick up your fashion style with costumes. All equipment can be used as a costume.+ Small but friendly community.Neutral--->> If you want to have useful dragons for an end-game, you just need to use huge amount of time or € for that.> PvP (+classes are pretty balanced if you really know how to play with one you use -PvP community is small, so there are just few guilds to join if you are interested to play PvP).> A lot of quests to do, If you are bored with Main/Side/Daily quests you can try find some hidden quests.> Farming and grinding but I am pretty sure this is nothing new in MMORPG scene.> Many ways to get Marketplace items for free. Of course not as effective than just go and buy those.> A lot of purchasable dragons, loot pets, costumes, housing items and so on...> Small but friendly community.Negative--->- G****o... Since G****o took over Dragon's Prophet (EU), all prices has gone up and you have a lot less things to buy. They destroyed VIP System, Insignia Market, Marketplace and pretty much everything that let you have fun without using hundreds of € to the game.- Engine, it's not possible to play with stable FPS, crashing and such things...- Small but friendly community.End result--->If you want to give it a try, just do it. It is still a great game even it has it's problems but as a long time player I really don't have reason to play it anymore.Yea, I know. I am not that good with english.HucKa			"

												Having played for well over 100 hours now I figured it would be OK to write a small review. First of all let me preface this by saying that if you do not like the idea of microtransactions of any kind in your games, then you should stop reading and go away right now. Have they gone? Good, then I'll carry on. I've been a gamer for a long time, and an MMO player for over 10 years with most of that spent in the harsh online world of EVE Online and the rest divided up between Guild Wars 1, AION, Lineage, Lineage 2, LOTRO, Perfect World, Rising Force Online and more recently Star Trek Online.I figure that fairly extensive list of both old and new MMO's has givn me a reasonable insight as to what makes a good MMO, a bad MMO and what can support or kill both. One thing that should be kept in mind when starting to play any MMO is that if it is good, then you shouldn't be handed everything super quickly and super easily within the first few days. A taster, sure, but some MMO's have made the mistake of spoon feeding the player far too much of the ""Good Stuff"" far too soon into the game and left nothing for later. Kinda like some movie trailers do.Dragons Prophet, like many other MMO's, has to reach a balance between reeling in new players, and then keeping them playing. In my opinion (and that's all it is, I'm not a professional or anything) this game suceeds quite nicely in drawing the player in with some shiny things, and then proceeding to mete that shiny out at a nice gentle pace without over loading anyone. The beginners areas are well laid out, logical and easy to navigate, with progression being fairly linear throughout the first half to two thirds of the starting island. This ensures that players are given the chance to get to grips with all of the main areas of play, the controls and some of the subsystems such as the crafting mechanic before diving off the deep end. By the time the first island is complete, most players should be champing at the bit and eager to get out into the rest of the world. Here is where I should make something else clear; I have only reached level 56 with my main character and so I am limited to discussing only up to that level. As you can see I have over 150 hours of play time registered so far, now for some people that might have gotten them to a much higher level than me, but I tend to like exploring games like this when the chance is offered and Dragons Prophet offers up some amazing vistas for the screenshot happy among us, especially when you throw wild Dragons into the mix. There are day/night cycles (though obviously they are not full day/night cycles), god rays, cloudy sunrises and sunsets, beautiful moonlit cliff tops and golden sunlit beaches. While the graphics are not perfect, and there are many instances of texture glitches, I feel able to overlook that at least for now as I ride round in the skies on the back of a dragon. Gameplay, for the most part is good and solid with a (so far) pretty decent storyline woven throughout, but still leaving the player open to choose what else he/she wants to do in each area of the world. Some people have said that just sticking to the storyline mission is not enough to ensure you are a high enough level to complete certain things, and while I would like to disagree I cannot. Dragons Prophet is the kind of game where you really do need to partake in atleast some of the side quests if you do not want to struggle later on in the game.The other point people like to make is that there are certain parts you cannot do solo. This is where I tend to bury my head in my hands and mutter curse words about their parentage. You may see plenty of reviews making comments like ""This boss/dragon/monster is too difficult to beat solo, the game is broken"" etc etc. Ignore them. These are the people who have forgotten (or perhaps never knew) what MMO means. Dragons Prophet really is a game where you need to be part of a group in order to progress past certain points, though if this seems weird, broken or stupid to you then perhaps you should be playing something else. I have come to roughly 6 places so far in my travels around the game world where I have absolutely needed the company of my fiance and her dragon in order to advance any further, and I am in no doubt that without her assistance I would either have stayed stuck until I was at least 15 levels higher than the monster I was fighting (which would have meant possibly days of low level mob fighting to level) or I would have stopped playing.Thankfully I am lucky and have a fiance who is even more of an avid game player than me and so I have not had to worry about being stuck for too long. If you start this game you will need to make friends, or bring some with you (which is what I would suggest trying to do) though thanfully the community seems to me to be very friendly and quite willing to answer almost any random question in the games chat channels.Down to some brass tacks I think. I'll start with the interface. As far as they go, the one here is pretty good, if a little simplified. The layout is great with everything you need easily accessible via the mouse or keyboard commands, though the need to hit the escape button to bring up the mouse cursor and access some of the sub menus can be quite frustrating at times. Graphically things are pretty good. Buttons are clear with a pretty good visual distinction between the various skills you pick up along the way, along with the ability to move said skill around on the skillbar. It should be noted that skills are activated by keyboard commands and not mouse clicks, at least I haven't found a way to use mouse clicks yet if there is one. Whilst not game breaking, some may find the extensive use of the keyboard a little uncomfortable at first. Sub menus are accessed through ctrl + key presses and easily memorised. Next up the character creator. Coming from places like EVE Online and Star Trek, where customisation (especially in EVE) is incredibly extensive, Dragons Prophet can feel a little limiting, however with a little patience and practice, good results can be achieved. In fact, I managed to make a fairly passable resembelance to Sean Bean as he appeared (facially at least) in the LOTR film, much to the annoyance/amazement of my better half :)Now for one of my favourite things, crafting. Almost all games these days seem to feature a crafting system of one kind or another. Some are better designed and implemented brilliantly, such as in EVE Online, and others not so much. At the moment the crafting system in this game is a bit hit and miss for a few reasons. I can't go into great detail because this review space is apparently not very big :/ but I can say that it still needs a lot of work.Lastly; Dragons.They are everywhere. Dragons of all shapes and sizes. Flying ones, gliding ones, crawling and running ones. Every colour in the rainbow and with more skills than you can shake a stick at. The capturing system is easy to use and getting to watch a dragon hack and slash at your foes is brilliant. Kinda like Pokemon, but way more awesome. :DThe single biggest issue I can see people having with this game, once you set aside the usual plethora of bugs, glitches and hardware compatibility issues that almost every game ever made has, is that the micro transaction market is very much ""In Your Face"". This is a free-to-play game though and people who do not spend a penny can still have a great experience. It just might not be as great as those who have and choose to spend real money.Overall I love this game, even with its many flaws and the in your face cash shop. It has Dragons, magic and big frikken swords and if you can see past the current flaws, you will have a great time.Remember these are just my opinions and experiences, yours may differ.EDIT: Fiance is now my wife. Nothing to do with the game, but there you have it.			"

												Dragon's Prophet is a pretty good MMORPG  - and if you know where to look and/or what to do, completely free to play.It has extensive character customization, ~15 different types of dragons that come in a seemingly endless variety of colours and shapes (especially colours) - with new variations added regularly, a great story, dragons, a great community, oh, and did I mention DRAGONS?The game itself is obviously still in development, even though it is no longer in beta. The current level cap as I write this is 102, and new zones are still being developed, new dragons being added and the level cap is still being raised. I don't know what the future will bring, you will have to ask Runewaker (the developers) about that. It has bugs, yes, but those are - if Runewaker knows what they're doing - getting fixed. And honestly, what game-in-development does not have bugs?The community in-game obviously depends on whether you decide to play on the German, the French or the English server, and I can only speak for the English server, but it's a great community, with great people that are often ready to help anyone and offer you a place in their guild. Or you can look on the official forums for guides, FAQs and what not, or make a thread yourself in Community Support to get the help or opinions of those who frequent the forums.Back to the game itself. Leveling up is fairly easy up to level 90, with plenty of quests and dungeons that may or may not be challenging, depending on your playstyle and the class you play. Guardians are not just melee tanks, they're also suitable for melee DPS, although they never will outdamage classes like Sorcerer or Ranger unless you really know what you're doing (and got some pretty good gear + shards). Rangers and Sorcerers/Mages don't need much explanation, and Oracles can be likened to Priests/Healers with certain builds, or a close-range magic DPS class (again, if you know what you're doing, like with Guardians). Oracles are also, in combination with the ""priest/healer"" build, very suitable for a build which has by some been dubbed the Beastmaster - where your dragon becomes your main source of damage, rather than your weapons and attacks.The housing system also allows you to have your own personal hideout in special zones known as Sky Islands. With plenty different building styles to choose from and even more furniture, you can decorate your housing plot, apartment or private little island (Secret Apartment) to your own preferences - or even turn it into a daycare for dragon eggs by placing as many incubators as you can. The crafting system in the game provides many options: weaponsmithing, armorsmithing, tinkering (accessories & dragon armor), alchemy (potions - mainly health potions), chef (several types of food, from buffs to friendship gifts) and carpentry (housing furniture & incubators). The most profitable crafts are usually weaponsmithing, tinkering and chef; the others are currently not quite worth the trouble. But what about the dragons, you wonder? It is, of course, possible to play the entire game with just a random dragon caught in the wild, with random stats and random skills. Or... you can customize your dragon. Level it up, teach it skills, allocate stat points. Evolve it, and find the strongest combination of skills and stats for your dragon. Equip it with dragon armor. And if you want to see if your dragon is the strongest, there's the Dragon Arena for you. One thing I'd like to say though: do not expect to instantly find the (stereotypical) dragon that you want because you want a ""badass"" dragon right away. There are plenty of other dragons types: small, fast and deadly Swiftfoot raptors, skytouched dragons (often nicknamed ""birds"" or ""chickens"") with overwhelming magical abilities when trained right, sturdy Stalwart (""mammoth"") dragons, cool Paragons (""lizards""), the list goes on. And honestly: though the Fabled class may look cool, and might be good for mounted combat, their attacks are sluggish at best and they are absolutely not the strongest. Not to mention the Ancient (""balge-type"") dragons that are for many people just too huge to conveniently use in combat. (Fabled and Ancient are some of the more ""stereotypical"" dragons: 4 legs + a pair of wings.)Side note about the Quests: Some can actually be quite tricky, and require careful reading of the entire quest text in order to obtain some clues, which are often just the things you need to understand the quest but which aren't mentioned in the short summary. A small warning: If your PC has an Nvidia video card, be wary of crashes. Those are easy to prevent by using an overlay though: some players experience less crashes when they play this game via Steam, while others, like me, prefer to get the client from the official website instead and use a program like Dxtory. Closing Note: Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ this was much longer than intended. I hope not too many of you went ""tl;dr"".			"

												This game looks good at start. Pets, quests, seems like there's lot to do. After first 30lvls you will notice it's all the same from first hour to the last. Nothing changes, worst part are long grinds where rewards are RNG-boxes. You literally waste hours for a chance to be lucky and advance. They say there's 300 different dragons. Most are only recolors of existing models, in reality there are 15 different families with few different looking dragons,but they differ only from mounted combat skills and their stat distribution. Most of the dragons are useless. Once you get the 6 you like to use in combat or as mount, rest become obsolete. Well, 3 more for arena if into that. Rewards for winning dragon arena are just nothing. Combat seems pretty fun at start,in the end its repetitive. The game uses free movement,dodgerolls and teleportation/flashing to let you get out of the attack zone of the enemy. Skills are used the same as in other games, pushing same skill repetitivily gets you to the 2- or 3-hit combos. Classes currently are unbalanced and rangers favored. Many glitches favor ranged classes too.Support in this game is very unprofessional as a word of warning. The game has also taken the way of emphasizing cash shop and removing options from f2p-players.Open pvp is bad. Its too laggy for some to even be able to see the enemy before dead. Also its mostly who hits first,wins, with all stunlocks and such. Rangers shine in this.Open PVP is done in sky islands at territory wars,which are cross-server, they just are too laggy to actually work. Even when you go there alone, its lagging. Your computer or connection doesn't matter.In territory wars you go and beat,MONSTERS, to win the war. Not your opponents from another clan or anything.Of course they will come harass you while you kill the monsters required for the win. New players are shorthanded in this unless they spend lots of dollars/euro's in cash shop to upgrade their shards in equipment. Old players have overpowered shards which new player simply has no chance at all to fight against.Game is also pretty easy,offering very little challenge to any good gamer. The game also suffers from constant crashing and this bug hasn't been fixed in over a year. That is the worst gamestopping bug it has. Each patch of the game tries to fix something and usually breaks 10 other things. Patch note's are incomplete.What the game has for you to do?Tame dragons. After the few you need,you'll notice rest aren't usefull.Level up. Goes fast and easy to the current max lvl98. For some reason they only raise max cap for 4lvls rarely and it takes maybe day or two to cap again if level cap raise comes.Gear up. The game has only two sets of gear worth getting. Rest of the dungeons are mostly useless. All other gear drops anywhere.Crafting. Mostly useless because you need too much materials to craft anything decent while you level up, so you pass the item you were trying to make and got one decent enough from quest rewards. Mostly this is used to only craft friendship gifts. At max lvl, you will craft cloak and jewellery,since these still don't drop anywhere in game,except cloak at last 10-man raid,which can be soloed. No changes whatsoever in a year to this.Dragon arena. Lvl up a dragon to lvl100,if you dont use cash shop it takes around 1-2 months unless using alts,when it needs big amount of ingame gold grinded. Reward for winning is a trophy to your house.Housing. You can have a house visible to all in Sky Islands,which are really,really laggy. You can also have a private secret island,which isn't that laggy but to get there,you will have to pass through the laggy sky island. Placing furniture and decorations is pretty well done and allows placement anywhere within your land plot/house. No previews of the houses that you buy from marketplace.Endgame. Well,there really isn't one.You get the last set from the last raid and you are done. Takes only few days. Only option at this point is the Open PVP at Territory War, which again doesn't give you much any rewards. All you can get elsewhere.Cash Shop. This has got more emphasize now as the game is 1 year old. The changes towards this has also made many players to leave the game for now. You can play free, but in the end you will notice that you need more bank space,bigger inventory,more slots for your dragons and these you can only buy with real money. Many of the dragons are also sold in the marketplace.			"

												The game has potential, but it feels somewhat cumbersome to play.Things I like:- Every dragon you tame is different - even if they are the same type and look exactly the same.- Tamed dragons can both fight and be mounts. They can also be geared.- Combat mechanics feel good.- Moderate amount of looting- Hack'n slash, lots of AOE attacks- 1-man dungeons- Plenty of quests- Public events- Secrets hidden away in the environmentThings I don't like:- You are very quickly faced with ads.- Limited options when custmizing character. Limited realistic options, like no blonde hair, no realistic eye colors, limited choice of colors for clothing (most options are locked with no explanation), only 4 choices for class\type\role.- When you first get talent points you are not allowed to use them, too low level....- It's impossible to stand still while attacking. You are moving through the enemies while attacking them. It's annoying, and the tooltips don't even tell you.- Explanations are somewhat lacking, in spite of pop-ups with tips.- The compare dragon window does not highlight differences.- Can't find a way to rename your own dragons.- Backpack is awfully small unless you pay to enlarge it. It does increase automatically when you level up, but not enough.- Quest items take up space in the backpack.- The maps for city hubs are messy, because you can't zoom in enough.- I can't find where I should deliver a quest, because the ""Show NPC"" button sends me inside a dungeon. I have no idea where that dungeon even is.- About half of every battle, my dragon refuses to help\attack.- You cant fly over mountains.			"

												Truly a great game in my eyes, although it occasionally stucks at a loading screen, that doesn´t bother me at all anymore when I´m flying around and battle dungeons solo on my dragon! You can tame a wide arrange of dragons from fast running to fast flying and to great defending dragons. Storyline is great and although I´ve played it alot already I´m not seeing the end of the possibilities and skills by far. Just try this game, if you like dragons, you´ll love this game!Need I say more?			"

												Having played WoW for over 8 years and various other MMO's, I highly recommend this game to anyone who love the MMO genre. At first I found this game quite a challenge as it's play style is different to what I was used to. It does have a shop which allows you to purchase various items and dragons (I've already bought my third dragon hehe) for real money. People can find that off putting however when you look at the game as a whole and the market they are in, most MMO's follow either a sub, which this game does not have and or a cash shop. Having paid for various WoW expansions and the subscription for over 8 years I don't mind putting real money into a games cash shop that has no sub. I have only been playing a short time but I'm already in love. Yes it can be glitchy at times and laggy but so are other games that are in the big market. No game is faultless. I'm in a lovely guild and the people overall who I've come across have generally been helpful or nice. So far my opinion is that I think the game could be improved somewhat but overall it's highly enjoyable and there is plenty do to. It's like how to train your dragon MMO style :)			"

												If you have ever played Runes of Magic, well this game is just the same, only with free flying mounts, that is, dragons. Game mechanics are almost entirely identical, except that this game contains, from the start, everything that RoM developed through its beta. Gameplay itself is moderately fun, quite repetitive after a while, as once you encounter all the monster types, you'll find that they change only in terms of level and colour. Graphics are good, but character movements are sometimes weird. There's a lot to do in-game, and some of the quests are well-written, but most of the game is still about tedious mob grinding. Also, the most annoying part is how the game appears to be nothing more than a money well. I don't usually mind microtransactions as long as I can have fun with the items I get, but if you want a decent character in this game, that'll cost you a real fortune. There are tons of different ways of upgrading your hero, but you'll find that to get the most of all of these, you have to pay, and not small amounts, but quite a lot. First time you see such a microtransaction message in-game, you go like ""ok, I can afford this"". Second time it occurs, you still say ""ok, I can manage that"", for the third time you get suspicious, and around the fiftieth such message you simply quit the game. Cool mounts are also terribly expensive, worth the price of a top steam game (check out dragon dlcs to see what I mean). This game is good for a few hours of casual (and free!) dragon RPG, but not worth serious investments.			"

												All in all its a pretty decent game. Split between 4 classes that are either range or melee like most game. You also get the chance to capture a dragon or even more than one from the hundreds in the game. Some of the dragons fly and some don't.One thing i did notice about this game though, DO NOT make an account on the website if you are going to use the game on steam. The steam version will make you start a new account regardless. In other words, wait till its installed. It is possible to use an account made on the website though but you would need to go to your steam folder, steamapps, common, dragons prophet and use the launcher from there.			"

												If you like pokemon and MMORPGs, then this is game for you... Cause the most original and really fun side of this game is catching and training your dragons. Regular combat is just regular... nothing special. But the dragons.... mmm... Those delicious epic dragons. That feeling when you are visiting one damn cave for whole week over and over just to find the rare dragon and after a long time finally catching and riding that epic dragon.... Unforgettable moment!!!! Yeaah!And also, its free.... but if you wanna really cool dragons you have to pay for them with REAL money so... ehhh... I mean.... They have to get money for development somewhere right??  "

												Not mind-blowing but fairly good combat and starting you with the flying mount is great. But then comes the payment model...The main gimmick of the game is to capture/tame dragon-like creatures which assist you as battle pets and mounts at the same time, with each different dragon having its own benefits. Yet they limit the dragons that you can have with you unless you pay... which is the main point for wanting to play this game because the rest of it is fairly generic.Maybe that doesn't sound too bad because you can just leave one temporarily in order to capture a new one, right? Wrong! This is almost like selling you an extra slot to switch weapons when needed and you just don't do that...This might sound like nit-picking and I won't deny that it is, but they have a part of the main gimmick of the game behind a pay-wall. They have some of your fun locked behind a pay-wall and you can never get it unless you pay. Let me repeat myself I suppose: A part of the main point of the game is behind a pay-wall.			"

												Everything good in the game you hawe to pay (teleporting, inventory, dragons, cosmetics... Game is too easy, im lvl 50 and newer used dragonshards or crafting or wear a helmet. Quests are so boring and all the same. Somethimes you will do the same quest for 3 npcs standing next to ech other. Game looks so bad (npcs are all over the map, everywhere!, leave a city and on every step there is some mouse, bird, monkey or something stupid like that want to kill you) Going to other maps takes so much time becouse if you want to get to first map you hawe to go through all maps you hawe already been(sometimes you need to go through 5 huge maps just to get where you want to go) If you want to teleport you will hawe to pay.  You think you will ride a dragon in this game, wrong, you will ride a chiken. Iv been searching for dragons whole time in this game and only chikens, lizards, and duckface raptors (ugly as♥♥♥♥♥♥. They may say its 300 diferent dragons but its just diferent colors of chiken, lizards, mamoth and raptor. All enemy dragons, boss dragons (cool dragons) you cant ride. It may be 300 dragons in the game but you can ride few, the only diferent is color. You can ride dragon if you buy it or join a guild at lvl 60 and get 1. And you only can hawe 2 dragons (if you want more you hawe to pay) if you want to capture new dragon you will hawe to let 1 go. Your caracter will look like♥♥♥♥♥♥becouse every piece of armor you find will be from a diferent armor and you hawe to pay for cosmetics. Good idea on capturin dragons but you should hawe made that we can capture all dragons and leave out big, ugly, stand there while i kill you dragons (some boss dragons will do nothing while you kill them). And capturing other creatures would be a good idea (like wolfs, bears, big spiders...) There is more to say but just this is enough not to like this game...			"

												There are some good things about this game, and a whole ocean of things that COULD'VE been good, all pretty much outweighed by the bad. Although I enjoyed most of my playtime, I wouldn't recommend any long-term commitment to this game at all.Perhaps the worst and most important thing, so I’m pointing this out at the beginning- microtransactions are a huge part of this game. Almost EVERYTHING you do can be made much easier if you have money. For example, you can wait 11 real-life days to hatch a dragon egg- or, if you have $20, you can hatch it instantly. You can play the entire game owning only 4 dragons, or, if you have the cash, you can unlock more slots and have as many as 12 at a time. You can enhance a weapon to make it stronger using the in-game currency (gold), or you can use diamonds (purchased on the website) for a higher chance of success. Long story short, if you want your character and your dragons to be strong, you're going to have to pay A LOT of money, and this becomes increasingly more obvious the higher your level gets.If you can bring yourself to ignore the paywall, the best thing this game has to offer is the dragons you can capture. All of them can be used as mounts- some can swim, fly, or simply run faster than the others and get you where you need to go quickly, and all of them can fight beside you in combat (though, obviously, some are better than others). Each one comes with different skills to aid you in combat or just in the field- there are way too many different effects for me to talk about here- and even two dragons of the same species will have different abilities.However, even the dragons could’ve been better- as much as the game’s marketing loves to draw attention to its hundreds of different capturable dragons, the vast majority of them are simply recolors of the same few models. That isn't as bad as it sounds- some of the palette swaps look nice, especially on rarer dragons, and it would be unreasonable to expect five hundred totally unique dragons from a game like this, but what REALLY pushes the limit is that there are more than just a few dragons that share the EXACT same model, but are ~totally different~ dragons because they're under different names. Unfortunately, you won't want to capture as many dragons as the advertising might make you think.And then, everything else about this game just fades into mediocrity.The combat can be fun at times, but nothing revolutionary compared to other MMOs. Even playing from the U.S. with constant 170 ping (the U.S. server for this game was shut down years ago), for the most part, fighting felt rather smooth. However, you can approach every enemy with almost the same strategy, and things definitely could've been balanced better- some dungeons, in the same area and on the same difficulty setting, were far too easy, or way too difficult for their level.While the combat can be repetitive, nothing is more repetitive than the fact that, no matter what level you are, level 1 or 100, the only way to level up is through doing NPC-given quests to kill a few enemies or fetch an item. Sounds like it would be the dream of someone who likes story in games- but that’s not true here in the slightest. Even the main storyline is shallow at best, with laughably bad voice acting and clunky cutscenes that half of the time won’t even play their audio correctly, and there are plenty of quests that are just flat-out poorly translated. If you were hoping for a halfway coherent story about dragons, you won’t find it here.All in all, the game is somewhere between bad and average. Considering the tiny team that still works on it, the dying playerbase, and the few and far between updates, it’ll likely never get any better. It’s probably best to steer clear of this one if you’ve never tried it.			"

												I absolutely and resplendently recommend this game. I am sort of a MMO serial hobbyist, finding myself sampling all the different ones that continue to expell from the different and enigmantic developers all around the world. And while the majority of MMO's available today, especially the F2P ones, tend to be unfinished and glitchy and simply too raw in it's development to enjoy, this game actually seems much more well cared for and tended to on a regular basis. The graphics and visuals remind me of the first PS3 games that came out, and maby a little less impressive, but the atmosphere is very well done. the atmosphere and overall feel of this game reminds me of Fable. The battlesystem is more action oriented and intuitive and you execute different combos with the left and right mouse button, wich feels very refreshing for an MMORPG. And...you can tame, capture and summon tons and tons and TONS of different dragons to your side. You cane train them, have them learn battle skills that aid you in the heat of battle and you can adorn them with different armor and fly..jesus, the conceptual premise for this game is actually quite good. Batteling with dragons and training them is the heart of this game and the notion in wich made me feel affinity towards it at the outset. and as i said, i have sampled a substantial proportion of the available MMO's today, and this game feels refreshing, not innovative per se, but absolutely refreshing...and you can tame dragons...so...what the hell are you waiting for? If you don't mind aged graphics at all, but want to explore a VAST world with fun and simple combat and befriend a bunch of interesting looking dragons inspired by a vast culture of real life mythology and such...bloody go for broke. At the moment i am too early in the game, and to speak of the finer points of the consequences of playing a modern F2P MMORPG is not my job at the moment, if you have played games like these before, you allready know the gist. F2P with a bunch of things you can buy in the in-game-store, though at the moment it does not feel like it is pay to win, it's more like pay to win earlier if you are inpatient. I am loving it so far. It feels much much older than it actually is, but that is one of it's finer charms i think. and as i said, if you want to befriend a plethora of different dragons, name them, train them, fly them, love them...prevail upon thyself to play this game. that's all :)			"

												I've read quite a lot of reviews that say there is a huge emphasis on cash shop items, which limits the player base and enjoyability of the game if they dont want to spend real life currency on the in game currency ""Diamonds"". I'd just like to mention that in game, there's a currency exchange merchant in most cities, that lets you trade in game gold for diamonds, so if there's something that you feel you ""desperately"" must have then you have the option of farming in game, questing or a little auction house pvp to obtain the currency for whatever you want.I have had zero issues with the steam version or the launcher, and I know some people were saying there was no sound at the launch and downrated it cos of that. Maybe they should have checked their settings on the game because on launch the in-game sound slider was down at zero and it took all of 2 seconds to rectify the sound issue and turn it on.There's the option to play solo or team up with others so really it caters for most playstyles. Most instances/dungeons ,(call them what you will), have an explorer option which allows you to access the content and solo it, there's also party play that lets you plough through with a group of friends and on some a ""hard mode"" ( I forget the exact terminology QQ).  Some people appear to be having issues with the quest system, such as ""go kill 8 of x mob"" or ""gather 6 of x item"". I don't actually know of any other MMO in this particular genre that doesn't contain those quests, I could be wrong though. :) However, the writers do a good job of keeping them relevant to the storyline so they dont get too tedious if questing is your thing. The daily quest system also lets you earn ""Dragon insignias"" which has its own marketplace to spend them in. Theres also the public events and randomised world events that let you earn Adventurer insignias which can be traded in for blue quality gear, housing items, & gear improvement stones.LOVE the dragons, yes there are lots of different types (some of which are recolours) but how many times have you seen stuff that you think would look great in other colours hmm? I for one, cant get enough of taming, levelling and plan to hit the dragon arena at some point too. They're invaluable for ploughing through the higher level instances solo as well.Player housing & crafting are the other things that really sell the game to me. I love the option of not having to choose 1 0r 2 proffessions to level, because I can level them all :D As for player housing...well.....what can i say. Awesome stuff :3As of December 2014 I can't get enough of this game. Current level cap is 102 & with frequent updates, in-game events and new content I can see myself playing this for a hell of a long time to come. But don't just take my word for it, at least give it a try up to level 40 or so, as thats when the game really starts getting interesting and the difficulty increases slightly. Much more satisfaction when you clear content imho. :3			"

												As my first MMO I really liked DP, I played it for 2 1/2 years now and it really was fun! I enjoyed the idea of taming and riding dragons so it was even more frightening. Apart of all the failing, waiting, and the pathetic tries to camp for a dragon, it has been an amazing gaming experience.I can't tell you If it's good or not, you have to decide If you like it or not ;) Sounds weird, I know, but I ended getting the dream. Dark Flame will always be my partner. (^-^)			"

												Let's just say, i do like this game. I find it's mechanics quite interesting, the loot system is okay, but in the end i must say - this is not free to play.It is free to test, basically.. and it is not even reasonable with it's Item Mall pricings. Basic reasoning: The player base is to small for ingame currency - farm trades.You have to pay for any row of inventory, besides the first page of inventory. You have to pay for bank space, for dragon store space.. For carrying dragons space, for dragons at work space.. You can't play this for free. And overall - it is overpriced. I would rather pay a 10€ moth subscription fee to get everything! Then be forced to spend more just to start. Yes i am forced.. As every pokemon generation kid - i feel compelled to say - ♥♥♥♥ you publisher. Not because you are bad, but because with my income I CAN'T PLAY. -.-			"

												It is an extremely simple game and does feel like a Dragon’s Prophet Upgrade. I give it a 7/10. Graphics are alright (nothing special) but combat it’s just lame. Every time a game tries to have a hybrid combat system (Tab targeting with an option of action combat mode) it fails; I am no fan of tab targeting so I did feel the combat was horrible on action mode (Tab targeting plays better but as stated I am no fan of such combat style).The game is not an open world game as it claims, is divided into territories and each territory is its own shard with mini shards inside. You will find invisible walls almost at every Conner.  Even when you get on your flying mounts.The mounts should have been the strongest aspect of the game (because of the title) and it is, but it does feel simple and lacking on possibilities. There are no interactions with mounts, no management (training, breeding, etc.) The mounts are extremely limited (for a game which its main focus are mounts). Most of the mounts are just re-skins of another mount. The variety is almost none existent, maybe if they did thought on some type of breeding system with variate results depending of the “mix” when breeding; they would have achieved a more enjoyable experience and adding some type of interactions between “owners” and mounts and management like training and care.Is a free to play game so you will not lose anything for trying it and if you have nothing better to play (or you just waiting for a new game release) the game will help you to enjoy few hours.

												Firstly, do i recommend this game to anyone else?YesI am lvl 30 so far, and i really enjoyed the game, from the start.I have to note, this is a f2p game, and it has a few limitations (like bacpack expansions etc.), but the catchy thing here, is that even if you don't want to pay for Marketplace (real money stuff) items, you can easily obtain them free, via other in-game items, currencies and so on.(I have a ton of Marketplace items already, which i did not pay a penny for entirely.)This is the main reason this game caught my eye in the first place.And also, if you like dragons then you are at the right place.Crafting is also very good, there are a lot of different types of them too. (Weaponsmithing,Armorsmithing,Carpentry etc. )There is Player Housing in the game too, for example you can craft your own furnitures for yourself, via Carpentry.The combat system is a combination of hack n slash, and a type of dodging, jumping out of attacks, you know what i mean.I play a Guardian, which is an equaliant of the Warrior in many MMOs, and fighting is really enjoyable.I would totally recommend this game to anyone, the lvl cap is 94 right now, so you will have a lot of content to go with till you reach max lvl.If you are interested in the game, you can message me whenever you want, i am an active player, i am usually online whenever i can.(server:Osira player:Myrtara)			"

Each one you tame has its own set of skills, abilities. You can cross train them, and they can gather materials for crafting for you. Theres a housing system which is pretty decent and the combat is very fun, especially since you fight along side the dragons you collect throughout the game. Theres definitely not another MMO like it.			"

												I had high hopes for this game, what with it having a lot of dragons and dragons being rather cool. i was very disappointed. i should say that i've only played the tutorial at the time of writing this, but in the first three mintues of the game i killed four dragons and i felt no sense of achievement. i stood one step out of reach of one and spammed it with arrows that felt like i was firing matchsticks for about ten seconds and it died. it never occured to the dragon to step closer and hit me.So, my problems with this game are as followsThe script makes no sense, the cutscenes are terrible. example: 'the dragons are attacking from above!' cut to three wingless dragons crawling around at the bottom of the flight of steps that the character that made that remark is standing at the top of.example 2: 'good to see you can still stand by yourself' your character's POV is still from ground level, evidently still lying down.The combat feels insubstantial. i chose an archer, i expected to fire an arrow every second or so, for each one to have a clear animation and set of sounds. what i instead got was legolas-speed arrow firing with each arrow feeling like i've fired a matchstick (i'd point out at this point that my character doesn't actually have a quiver of arrows, he's just pulilng them from thin air)my game started with no sound, and unless you decided to use the launcher to check that the sound wasn't, for some reason, muted, the first time you'll have a chance to fix that, and the resoltion, texture quality, etc, is once you've made a character and started  the tutorial. there is no main screen settings menu. On that note, the animations, the textures, and just about everything else graphical, is rather lackluster. If you take neverwinter as a benchmark for what can reasobaly be achieved in terms of character models and terrain quality, then this game massively disappoints.in short, i think that this game looks and feels like something from five years ago, and personally i couldn't make it through that to see wether the dragon riding, taming, battling mechanics are any good.

												I played this game a long time not once beeing bored, the sheer number of possibilities, quests, events and dragons to catch makes it impossible to be bored. it's also has good learning curve, making you first try some task then if you fail try another way. It's free so why wouldn't you give it a try? Tt doesn't have cosmic requirements either while still looking gorgeus. If you worry about 'only 4 classes' then know that there are 120+ levels to be farmed, multiple masteries (ultimate ones are badass), flutes, eggs, powders, MANY dragons, every year events like christmas or EasterIf you like dragons and fantasy climat then you'll be in love with this game			"

												This is probably one of the most entertaining games i've played lately, it takes the gameplay of TERA: Rising and mixes in the ability to tame dragons & ride them, train them and fight with them, only downside i can see to this game is for the f2p users, you only get space enough for 4 dragons to start out with, atleast it isn't too expensive to unlock the rest of them.

												Although the initial concept of the game is pretty brilliant actually, Dragons Prophet fails to deliver.The combat mechanics are yanky and simply float around, the graphics fail in the way theres a lot of graphic glitches to be found and seen, animations are poor, and the game overall is simply a let down.A promising game on 2013 but in my opinion, it simply climbed and let it self fall down the cliff.I had many hopes for this game, but it only took me a few minutes from the character creation to the starting area to realize and simply shut the game and uninstall it to never play it again.Iam not a professional game reviewer, iam simply a gamer, so you can take my word for it, or just install the game and see it for yourself.Just believe me when i say, this game is not for everyone.

For me it's just a cluster♥♥♥♥ of lags, graphic glitches, not so great storyline, and some animals pretending to be dragons.The good sides- well, the egg hatching system and overral dragon catching/training are kinda nice.But hey, it's your life, you can try DP, it's free.

												pretty good when it actually works, cause I ussually find myself at about 3500ms in something like a solo dungeon run or whatever and the funny thing is that actually with other players my ms rides well and the game behaves as nomal, also every update the general performance of the game drops for some reason, also who even thought of the combat it is just so static that it is hard to bear aiming while attacking is hrrible and you just do nothing sometimes like when some 10cm tall spiders send you flying about 1m back when noramlly you can easily get up when getting knocked back by a dragon or whtever thats about 3 meters tall. the flight is also quite annoying because it feels so unsatisfying also the landscape is just linear, though it has good variation, btw every map is pretty much hust a dungeon becuase it is divided by landscape themes and some average looking mountains or whatever weird barrier they might make. ultimately I just don't even want to think of it anymore, well at least the dragons and crafting keep you interested,even though there are only really about say 25 or so dragon races which are just recycled and have swaped scales, fee,t heads and colour I give it a 6/10 just because the story and such is sorta cool but I didn't wanna bash on it too much cause nobody really even cares about that in mmos anymore    -_- minigames and such could be managed a lot better but it seems they were given little thought :( , also i'm very dissapointed that the game got corrupted on it's own, well not that you or I should even expect any good performance sppeds (lol that time I had 9000ms or those about 8 times that I got disconected while doing solo quests which seem to just wreck the game performance)			"

												This game just amazing, read why!It's a MMORPG openworld game with mostly is about the many dragons.The story is good, the character creation is unique and that you can capture dragons and train them is just more amazing! You can also build your own house!!! The only bad thing about this game is that you will have some trouble with the quest system, if  you new.The game could  use more classes. The combat system looks amazing, and i will believe you gonna like this game after getting in to it. The game is really fun with friends, that means i haven't tried without.I will recommend this game to you if you like open world, mmorpg games and just think that dragons are awesome. Dragons is the special thing about this game and they can be very useful when you get a good one and some good armor to it too. Dragons have their own unique combat abilities and with some armor you can make them strong, but you need to train you dragon to get more abilities to it. The game have 4 classes, that isn't so many, but they are some of the basic mmorpg classes, so you would be fine finding one. You can make 8 characters so you can have 1 female and 1 male of every class, if you want. Leveling is going fast in the start and you will learn many abilities. There is alot of side-quests to do if you want to level a bit faster when anyone else.Try it, it's free!			"

												So far, it's a good game, i hope time will be in it's favour and the devs will continue to improve it, cuz there's still a lot that could/should be improved (like login rewards and special rewards).The game itself is good, but i recommend NOT using the steam version. Download it from the original website, and add as non-steam game if u please, but steam compatibility isn't the best, quite frankly, the steam version sux.I'm still fairly low level (40, or something like that), but it has an interesting story, the mechanics are kinda like TERA (rising), but with a lot less requirements, and lot better quality. It has an interesting storyline, and is highly recommended.Just stay away from the steam version.Here's a link to the website:https://www.dragonspropheteurope.com/en/ "

												Combat and leveling:Combat is really fun, combos are nicely done and real skill comes into play. Gear and build plays a huge part ofcourse but it's not just a matter of who has a better gear, its a matter of how well you can play. Even while doing PVE you can see the difference if you are playing carelessly. I just love the combat system, if you want a good gameplay video watch ""Dragon's Prophet PvP: Housing Area Fight""  in youtube, you can see how skill plays an important part, in the last part of the video, a sorcerer holding his ground alone agaisnt 2 players, it really impressed me.Like in any other mmorpg lvling might get boring. But if you get a group of players, it gets really fun and you get rewards for playing with friends, you can increase your friend points with those players and eventually start earning a currency used for a ""slot machine"" called kindred compass, that gets you premium stuff.The dragon system, capturing, training, skills really complement the game, you have to carefully breed your dragons to get the most out of them, it makes a huge difference on how you can build your character build, because you can use dragons to cover for the weaknesses of your character.Microtransactions: It is true that microtransactions are almost a must if you want to play more confortably, because sometimes the inventory might feel too small, same goes for the bank space. But It is manegeable with some effort. As for the rest, most things that can be bought with real money in the market can also be bought with ingame currency that you get from doing daily quests and daily achievements. The only real issue is the inventory space to be honest. And even if you decide to pay, 5€ is enough to get 2 of you chars with confortable space. I did the maths and for 3 or 4 rows in the bank and 4 rows in inventory, 1 dragon stable slot you only need 246 diamonds. 5€ gets you 500. Daily login rewards usually give you premium stuff including stable space, lair space and enhancement stuff. As i said you can still get them for free in the market from daily mission currency. Sorry for the long review, but the only thing i can say is, try it!  And try to join a guild or talk to high level players, so you can learn more about the game (after you learn alot about it, it gets 100% more fun, speaking from experience. Don't be afraid to ask questions.)Have fun!			"

												Dragon's Prophet is a really good game and I think every fan of MMOs should try it. It has really interesting dynamic style of combat. It's not quire as skill-requiring as TERA,C9 or Vindictus, but it's more dynamic than the typical combat offered by MMOs. It features a sort-of auto-aim but it still requires precision instead of just selecting the target and having your character home-in on it automatically.The character creation is very expansive and you can really tweak your character to your liking. The classes are not gender-locked, which seems to be a suddenly common occurence in many MMOs, however, the class choice is rather poor. You have Guardians, which are typical warriors, who can serve as both DPS and tanks, depending on your build. Then there are Rangers, but their relation with Rangers lies only within the name; while most MMOs offer an assassin and an archer path, the former is nowhere to be seen in this game. You can either become a bow-wielding ranger whose main focus is long-distance combat, or a gunblade-wielding ranger, who offers a bit of melee as well as ranged combat and is more resilient due to the ability to wear a shield, so he can act as an off-tank. Following, there's Sorcerer, the spellcaster of the bunch; not much to say about him, mages are totally out of my world, I've never really played one. Finally there are Oracles, who are a sort-of do it all. You can end up as a support class, a melee magic-DPS, a ranged magic-DPS and this class is also best suited to becoming a summoner.The ability to tame a dragon is what distinguishes this game from other and also an idea which really appeals me, as I feel there's a lack of summoner-alike classes in today's MMOs. Dragons' development is almost as complex as the development of your own character, but the important thing to realize is that there is a trade-off between the power of your character and your dragon.A lot of people seem to be bugged about Cash Shop items and how they're necessary, but I don't think that's the matter, at least as much as I played (up to lvl 55). Also, when I played players were awarded a ton of cash-shop items for free, through various events, challenges, log-in gifts etc. so there was really no need to invest any money in the game. As the game was developed by the creators of Runes of Magic, I was really worried that the gameplay would become Cash Shop dependent, but I'm pretty sure that is not the case and you can get around without using the cash shop or at least using only Dragon Insignia. I'm not sure what the situation is right now though, since I'm not able to play the game at the moment, which leads me to another point.This game has one huge drawback. It is terribly, terribly optimized and it has been the case since the game was released. While my laptop is not a powerful machine by any means (integrated GPU ftw!), it is able to handle other games and MMOs at a stable 30+ FPS while having a better visual quality. I tried playing it at the lowest settings and I get around 10-15 FPS when standing around, which is not justified by anything that can be seen on the screen. When I played it on my PC, which can easily handle TERA at max settings in 30+ FPS, I had a problem with a very unstable framerate, which was also pretty low, regardless of the chosen graphical setting. I really dare you to give me any game's name, and I can guarantee you that it's better optimized than DP (ugh, that's a really bad abbreviation), even GTA IV looks like an optimization masterpiece compared to this game.Once again, I truly recommend the game to any fan of MMOs and dragons, but be prepared, that the game might act weird and give you unstable framerates, because the game engine just sucks.

												Awesome game, TRUE free to play. And you can tame more than 2 dragons, you can tame them all and hawe 8 with you at any time. Cash shop currency can be bought with in game gold. So you can get everything that game hawe to offer without paying anything with real money.			"

												Three major reasons to give this game a negative review:1. Infernum doesn't really seem to be willing to fix & support their game. The FREE starter pack is broken since June 2014 and still not fixed. Infernum tells on the forums here that they'll look into it but so far (December 2015!) it's still broken.2. Cash shop is heavily Pay2Win, but I'm not surprised about that with a RuneWalker game. The other RW game (Runes of Magic) is also heavily Pay2Win, and when not using the ca$h $hop you just can forget about achieving anything in that game. I know for a fact that this game has the same issue (I played it on the old $O€ servers as well).3. Action combat & MMORPGs just don't mix. 99 out of 100 quests will end up in 'Kill 10 rats' and if I want to kill hords of monsters one after an other I'd play Diablo, which I have not even installed on my PC...Aside from that, the game has nice graphics and sound is okay as well. Gotta say though that UI is a pain (prolly also because of the action game it is)			"

												Crashes at end of each cutscene, can't even ctrl-alt-delete to get to task manager to kill the process so have to switch power off to recover, not good. Achieved level 3, no deaths, without trying. Just stand next to monster and hold mouse key down to spam attacks. Bored and fed up with crashes after about 20 minutes total in game (steam reports 45 minutes played). If it's this buggy just trying to do the tutorial part, which you would expect to be pretty solid to ease players into the game, then how bad is it going to get in the rest of the game, so not recommending.

It could be big, like BIG, but with the low sales and lack of incentive people start to quit, friends went away, and then u see that the reason you were still playing was just cause you had those friends there with you, now there's no reason to continue.Dont get me wrong, the game is amazing, get some friends and play it cause its a nice game.

												Pretty cool. The first 20 levels. Then it gets into a loop of kill- and gatherquests.  I cannot tell much about the endgame on highlevel because I'm only around 50.Pro's of this game:- great balance between item shop and free2play - you can play easily without paying- dragons. OMFG, I SAID DRAGONS!!!- great mounting and pet system (the Dragons... ;))- much content for free2play- many active players- many free shop items through newslettercon's:- many, many killquests- boring story- many useless features, g.e. many different skilling functionsI would suggest you to just download this game and give it a try. It's worth it. IMO it's the best free2play MMORPG available. It's not as good as a paid MMORPG (I play WoW ;)), but it's great for free.			"

												I personally love pretty much any game with a good  mount system, and in DP its all about that. Getting that awesome dragon you wanted so much is a real quest (besize all the other quests you will find during your adventure). The lore is linear, and besize questing there isnt really any other way to think out of the box, so for levelling, follow the quest and get your dragon(s), gear and all you need. Having a larger party for quest/levelling will speed up the process. The game mechanics are ok, you get used to it after a while (Feels a  little like GW2 mechanics).There are some frame rate issues and some bugs and glitches that are hopefully fixed in the future.Overall this game is very playable, for a Free to Play game its worth trying it.

												Best review ever, read my pain and why you shouldn't waste your time like i did installing it. I started at 9:09 - 9:11 PM with the installation from steam, it took about 40 min to install it. I started the game, made an account 12 seconds. Then the hell of updates started. I said to myself, well more then 1 hour updates plus installing them won't take more, lets watch some stuff. After 1 hour I looked at the game and saw it was still updateing, downloading a 20MB update, then i saw how it installed it, it took on the clock 15min to install it then another update. At that point I watched more stuff untill the whole patching took about 2hours and 30 min. So the complete installation of the game took 3 and a half hours. Now you will say, your pc is bad, my friend did the same thing he waited 3 hours and 10 min.Now lets get to the in game stuffGraphics - wow, i was amazed at the detail of the characters. NOT. Look up Tera online gameplay, Look up Dragon's Prophet gameplay, and look at the difference of the graphics detail. Character customization, few choices from what to pick in terms of colour.Fighting - now here was the real deal, i waited 30 sec for a loading screen just to get me in to a cut-scene that you can skip, then jump back into another cut-scene that you can't skip, cuz hey they have some sort of story to tell you. While i was watching the quality of this game at full graphics it looked to me like i was playing Soul River the very first game. I said to myself: ""lets hope it's worth the combat mode"". I started to move and realised i had imense lag or my processor is to high, because i couldn't control my character how i wanted to, when i had to kill something, i couldn't see the sword, lucky thing i could see the dmg or i would be dead at lvl 1. I don't know how, but i played Tera Online at high resolution, Ascend: Hand of Kul at high resolution, i can play allmost anything, but an ugly ****ing 2013 game with a low detalied graphics that i waited 3 and a half ****ing hours just to see that i can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥in what am i doing and can't control my character. Don't waste your life on this stupid free game.Now you will say, no man it's your pc, your connection to the internet. I say to you: don't trust me, read the other Negative reviews and see how others encountered other problems.If you really wanna see♥♥♥♥♥♥ dragons, monsters, story, mmo, combat mechanics, pvp, pve, raids, harder difficulty dungeons go play Tera, it has all this♥♥♥♥♥♥stored in to it. JUST DONT INSTALL THIS GAME!			"

												I tried to love this game, i really did.. i love dragons and i really had my hopes up for this.. Sadly, i was very dissapointed in this game, and that was after tons of bugs trying to get it to even run properly!! (and it crashed quite a few times in the short time i played).. In the beginning i thought, hmm this looks ok.. i guess.. The gameplay was pretty standard, lot of options etc, but nothing out of the ordinary for any experienced MMO player.. Even though the targetting seemed to be based a little too much on luck. And the 'chase zombies out of town' beginning was a little cliché,.. i managed.. The game could still prove to be awesome... Right?Anyway the horror went on.. The graphics are so-so (2006-ish), and the characters seemed somewhat bland and out of sync. Also the subtitles did not match what was said, which got on my nerves from the start. The dragons look pretty nice and you can fly from very early on in the game. That was pretty fun indeed. I caught a dragon the first minute i walked out of town, and 5 minutes later? Another dragon! How Cool is that!? And wow!.. you can FIGHT while on the dragon!! that is very very cool..!  Only to find out you can't really collect them! Not the way i would of wanted to! You can only have a few dragons with you, that is fine.. However your 'stables' are very limited in space, and you have to BUY upgrades.. which is sort of ok, if they werent that expensive and the rest of the gameplay made up for having to pay for the best part.. But it did not.. Also, you appearently can't buy enough upgrades, to catch all availeble dragons.. which was the ultimate dealbreaker for me. Gotta Catch Them All! Right?Conclusion, a bland MMO with dull characters that is not even good looking.. The only fun part of the game is pay to enjoy it to its (not even full) potential. I do not often call a game horrible, as there is always something to enjoy.. However, the only fun thing in this game was so utterly overpowered by its plain dullness and horror.. It is just that.

Well, if you don't mind these things then go ahead and play the Game, but I'll say it straight away you can't even play with all these errors. If you want a good MMO then play Trove rather than this."" -RottePlays 2015			"

												Yes looking at the time i've played some people might complain about the fact that i'm writing a review.Just so you all know i will return to the game in a while and test what they update and such.Now onto the review...Good parts+Plenty of options when making the character+A better fighting system than most mmorpgs (Left click for normal attack, Right click for special)+There is still the option of using the 1-9 keys for specials when fighting (This leads to an amazing amount of combinations you can make)+You can climb up on roofs of buildings which is really funBad parts (Which i can see and i think is bad)-Game trying too hard to look realistic (They've pretty much created these creepy characters when it doesn't matter how realistic things are)-Death zones (Walking down into a ravine with fog will instantly kill you when you reach the fog) (This is to keep people away from there but why put all of these stones which makes it possible to walk down there?)-The character controls and movement just isn't flowing (Test jumping and you will see that the character is almost teleporting up and then down) (Then using blades have the problem that you can't run and hit at the same time)-Quite stupid lines from the npcs (""Great you can stand"" is what a npc tells you before you can rise up from the ground)-Bad looking map (The icons on the map are large detailed pictures which covers a large chunk of it) (""Oh these two cities are so close to eachother..."" A moment later im being chased by a army of mobs through the city because they were within the 1 cm area between the cities)-The first big dragon i fought during the tutorial showed a attack area and 1 second after he attacked. (This is too low of a time for a large mighty dragon to attack and certainly will make beginners get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when they die during the tutorial)-Too advanced character creation (There are just too many buttons and it gets annoying after a while in the character creater, I will probalbly never make a new character in this game due to that)As long as these things aren't fixed i won't change my mind of the game.This game is from my view is currently useless and bad but it isn't a lost cause.Fixing the things i've taken up would probably make the game more fun.This is just a review from someone who is trying to research games and feel free to test the game yourself.Thank you for reading.

												The game seemed very promising from the start, with alot of customization. The gameplay is also very captivating, the only big problem is cutscenes out of sync, complete sync of voice-acting, screen freezings all over the place, sound effects non-existent or just rarely activating and the same song playing all over again...It is worth a try, but until it's all fixed, it's a no for me.

												Note to self: Stop downloading this game. No matter how awesome it might look, you won't be able to play it.Note to everyone else: If you get past the terrible IE forced register screen - that locks up so you can't boot the game through steam - and the login screen - that A) asks for an email, while it actually needs a user ID, B) does not give any details on errors and C) Keeps errorring no matter what you do or try - let me know if this game is actually good or not! I mean It looks cool, but you know. Doesn't really help that the game does not seem to be properly intergrated with steam.			"

												Holy ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥do I have a tale to tell about this game. So I saw this on the new releases for F2P MMO's and I was bored so I thought why the ♥♥♥♥ not. So the game downloaded fairly quickly which is always a plus. The game did it's obligatory MMO patches and I loaded the game up. I was not prepared for what I found. First of I'm greeted by the henchest man I've ever seen in my life. Like. Holy ♥♥♥♥ are those kind of abs humainly possible, I honestly feel sorry for the poor guy. So I switched over to a female character and of course to fit the theme of the male design she was in fact wearing nothing. Well she may as well have been. This was a pretty bad ♥♥♥♥ing sign. I pressed on. What worse could happen? I was brought to a fairly in depth character creation screen. BUT. It was not a ""Let's make your character look how you want"" screen. There were not one but FIVE sliders for the ♥♥♥♥ing BOOB. IS THAT NESSESARY. SURE ONE IS FINE. BUT FIVE. By this point I was kind of losing my♥♥♥♥♥♥But me being the idiot I am. I pressed on. Only to find the beginning of Rift where I have to kill a bunch of zombies before I moved on. I killed them and a cutscene was triggered. Honestly. I was not prepared for what I saw.It was him. The world breaker himself. DEATH. ♥♥♥♥ING. WING. IN A GAME THE DEFINATLY WAS NOT WORLD OF WARCRAFT. HERE HE IS. DEATH WING. COMING TO KILL ME. THE NAKED BOOB MONSTER. (I honestly tried my damn hardest to make her look how I wanted but nope wouldn't happen) So I killed Death Wings minions (Some weird plauge lizards) and I trigger another cutscene. Yet this time. Oooooh this time is worse. Sindra ♥♥♥♥ing gosa. Another wow dragon comes out the ♥♥♥♥ing ground just like in the WOTLK Trailer. And she send Death wing to come beat me up.Obviously I smack him down and♥♥♥♥♥♥on his corpse. Then some♥♥♥♥♥♥thinks it's a great idea to ride Sindragosa into the pit and have a ♥♥♥♥ing party at the bottom. THEN ANOTHER CUTSCENE.IF YOU THOUGHT SINDRAGOSA AND DEATHWING WHERE ENOUGH.THE ♥♥♥♥INGLICH KINGARTHAS ♥♥♥♥ING MENETHIL RIGHT THERE. HE EVEN SAYS ""NONE WILL ESCAPE MY ICEY GRASP"" WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ IS THIS GAME. WHY IS THIS GAME REAL. WHO'S IDEA WAS THIS. If you like boobs and stolen content this surely is the game for you. Otherwise. Leave this place and never return.			"

												I made my character and spent a lot of time customizing it. I was really excited to play this game, but as soon as I entered the story, I noticed that the cutscene lagged dramatically. When I went to control my chracter it wouldn't respond right away and then would jump forward in a choppy manner through several actions. The lagging was so bad that I could not even control my character to get through the first scene or kill a single zombie at the start. I am very disapointed. I have  good internet connection so I don't know why it lagged so terribly.			"

												Von den Machern von Runes of Magic war nichts anderes zu erwarten. Dieses Spiel überzeugt durch seine einzigartige Grafik, sein geniales Kampfsystem und der Tatsache, dass man sich die unterschiedlichsten Drachen zähmen und auf ihnen reiten oder sie im Kampf einsetzen kann. Außerdem sind die Quests abwechslungsreich und es gibt einige Instanzen, die man entweder alleine oder in der Gruppe bewältigen kann. Für all die Sammler unter euch gibt es eine Erfolgesystem und eine Liste aller fangbaren Drachen. Ich wünsche eine gute Drachenjagd!			"

												Like 99% of MMOs, free-to-play or no, this game's character creation features big strong mans and tiny little ladies complete with ...what, 3 or 4 boob adjustment sliders? Also, attempting to fix your Fantasy Woman Body into something resembling an actual human will result in your model being all kinds of messed up. Not to mention the armor is, of course, designed to not actually be protective or...really even comfortably worn by any woman.Aside from that, the UI looks like it was thrown together in about 30 minutes and is, in general, pretty terrible to look at. Sound bugs out and goes up and down randomly at any given moment. The weapon models don't seem to be anchored to the characters at all? Or not well, at least. Just running makes a weapon on your back flip out, and multiple times the model left my character's hand while fighting/running. I'm sure the dragon aspect is rad, but your gameplay only matters if what surrounds it is worth anything, and everything in this game looks like it was designed by a 15-year-old dude with a base knowledge of programming and an unhealthy amount of waifu figurines on his shelf.

												One of my favourites! I love the idea of beeing a friend to dragons not only killing them! ;) Something quite new and creative! ;)The graphic is great as for the free MMO games! But although there is new dragons on higher levels, they usually still remain similar to the lower level ones, which doesn't make a huge difference with both visuals and abilities (altough I believe everyone will find their perfect dragon ;) ). On the other side to similarity of the dragons, the main characters are well made and can be widely customized. ;)The game is mostly free, but as always there are aditional parts which you can buy for a real money. ;) In overall great game, full of fun stuff to do. ;)			"

												Awesome game, with a good PC, no lag and stuff like that if you know your limitations, the game has a lot of bugs, but you get used and avoid them in time, hell you can even exploit them to some extent.Dragons are like Charizards...pokemon, mount, friend, fighting partner, healer, tank, DPS , WTV you want your dragon to be, just put right skills and right stats on it when hatched.Marketplace dragons are ussually with♥♥♥♥♥♥stats, don't bother with them unless you just want Vanity skins , the best dragons are only obtainable in-game by farming/hatching/catching them.The end-game starts pretty early, you can farm for you lev 102 gear starting with lev 94, which is good because last levels are boring and mostly dungeoning.You have flying mount since level 2, no quest is too hard to solo.Over 300 dragon types, because of recolors, actually just about 30-40 models with a lot of skins.The bugs and the grind are the only cons I could find.>>>>>>>>>>>EDIT<<<<<<<<<<<< : There are SO MANY GREEDY as.sh.oles capturing all the wild dragons and having timers and lifelessly camping them all with the sole purpose of seeing their name on the screen...that you better get used to Hatching dragons and forget about the capturing ---  and they enjoy every moment of telling you to ""fu.ck off"" when you tell them that they already caught that dragon like 20 times and maybe allow other people to get it. > Main reason I quit I quit after 1000+ hours  because It was just  Farmville dragon version. there is no PvE content besides just killing the first boss of each raid until you get enough currency to get full legendary - or hiring someone to kill the first boss while you just enter and collect the currency.PvP = higher gear wins when people 1 shot you because they have been farming for more time than you and all good players go into the same guild who owns the Sky islands, there are no battles just slaughters.EDIT : giving it another Try			"

												 The world has a lot of attention to details.  All NPCs can be spoken to and say something in return, even if they are environmental filler characters. The small dragon I have started with is very responsive to PC keyboard controls for flight.  Overall I give this game a thumbs up so far. Things that need a little work are some help references as to keyboard shortcuts as well as a help file with topic search.  I somehow found myself transported to a higher level area with no obvious way back and no help search to figure out where I should go to get back leaving my character stuck at the moment with quests unfinished in the initial game area.  I also would like to see coloring options for clothing to be more diverse at the start.  Many of the colors appear washed out. For example, white is sort of grayish on the armors instead of brilliant white, and black is more of a dark gray.			"

												Really enjoying this game. I am a US player and the framerate is usually in the mid 40's during EU primetime for me, ping is decent too, mid to low 100's. I guess the framerate, ping, and other issues from some of the negative reviews might be due to their system and/or ISP. It's free, so no harm in downloading it and checking it out to see if you're able to play it. It only has 4 classes, but I think the dragons make up for that. Combat isn't great, but it's not the worst I've seen either. Your character is limited to a handful of moves, but each dragon could add different attacks, depending on the one you have out with you at the time. The dragons can also learn each other skills over time.  It is heavy on the use of real money needed (Euro prices on purchases through the site/ in game store after the $14.99USD Steam Starter pack, so you have to do a little math.). But if you like it, it's worth a few bucks to support it, at least for me.I would say that this game is not for the entitlement types that want/expect everything for free from the start. So if that's the type you are, I wouldn't bother.			"

												Brilliant game - I have never much liked MMORPGs but I chose this one because my little daughter recently got into ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and I wanted a game with lots of flyable dragons in it. So now it's ""daddy can we fly dragon!"", ""let's fight spiders!""... I'll enjoy that while it lasts!The game itself reminded me of Guild Wars. The map design and monsters are good, the sound and music less so. It is still active, I haven't interacted much with other players as yet but there are plenty of people milling about. Cost-wise I would say you do need to spend £20 or so on inventory slots, but the rest of the paid-for content is genuinely optional, and pretty cheap.It's been stable on my system, no bugs as yet. The combat mechanics and many other systems in the game are like Monster Hunter: not deep, but deeper than they initially appear. The aggro is a bit daft, you can happly amble all the way into monster castles and they only attack if you walk right up to them. Monsters' attacks interrupt your actions, so the effects of being outnumbered are exaggerated but otoh that can add a bit of challenge.The portrayal of women is consistently awful, and the men are almost as bad. They should patch that, and get the text edited: it would cost nothing and then everything would be in line with the respectable art design.			"

Other than that its a great game that you can just pick up and play.For a F2P it has some stunning graphics. fairly decent sound and  a really good combat/action system. It breaks away from the other MMORPGs that have you stand around spamming the same buttons untill its time to move out of the way of an attack. Here you feel more like you are doing the fighting and the dodging.			"
