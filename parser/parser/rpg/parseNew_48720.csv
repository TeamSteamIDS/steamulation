												My god, This game. I cant belive that i missed it when it was released, this game is just pure greatness. I think this is the best ""mount and blade"" game in the series. Its kinda similar to the last game , ""Mount and blade : warband"", but new additions are improved graphics and guns. Gunplay really makes this game unique as the combat in this game is best i have seen in a while. You fire your inaccurate musket or bow from range, and on close combat you try to kill your enemies with a sword, and block enemys attacks, if you master the timing, you can easily take down large group of enemies. It adds bit of reality and cool skill ceiling to the game.In singleplayer, you start as a little poor villager, you can Travel around the map, Take quests , trade ,rob caravans, besiege castles , recruit men and much more. When you start to Get some money and experience , you will start to Get better gear and armor, and you start expanding your army. You can ally with factions and conquer the other factions. Its awesome when at start you rob small bandit groups with your Little army of mens recruited from villages, and after some time, you have army of 100 of mens, and you Attack an enemy faction castle along with your Friendly Armies. Singleplayer is like big sandbox, you can just be trader and make loads of profits, you can be bandit and rob caravans, you can create your own faction and conquer lands, or ally with other factions and eliminate others. You can get hours and hours and hours of fun.    This game also has really entertaining multiplayer, first you create the way your multiplayer character looks like, then you hop in the battle. Usually there are about 50 players in same match, other team is defending castle and other is attacking it. You can buy equiment like better armor with gold (you get more gold when you get kills). There are also classic deathmatch , battle and other game modes. I just love the multiplayer, it feels amazing when musketeers fire their muskets and throw their grenades and trough the smoke charges cavalry trying to stab poor foot soldiers and as the armies meet begins hectic sword play.     Also, this game has really active mod community which helps this game survive on the long runI Cant recommend this game enough , it really is worth the price			"

												What can I say about this game?UPDATE!!!!: While the gameplay itself is absolutely phenominal, there is a MAJOR drawback that I discovered once I was finally given a castle to oversee. Beyond the challenge of getting your best friend, the King, to give you a little slice to call your own, when the budget screen shows up for each town/castle/village you own, instead of putting every tariff and expense on a single sheet with a breakdown of each category as was done in basic Warband, here they point out to you EACH AND EVERY thing you have had built, and every person you have had hired for EACH AND EVERY town, castle, and village. As I mentioned in my first review, there are a lot of options for each location you own. Now imagine every week in game, you are bombarded by a 30 page dissertation of every individual expansion you have ordered. It makes the game *almost* unplayable. This is the only major drawback of the game that I have found. If you can cope with this first paragraph, read on and see why I would still reccommend keeping a dictionary handy to check your sperling and that you should purchase Mount and Blade with Fire and Sword!It's fan-freaking-tastic!!I loved the original, but lets face it, there comes a point when there is no more challenge or suprise to obliterating your opponents on the field of battle. That game was drying up for me, it was finished.Then this little gem appeared, and the love was reborn!The game is the same concept; pick a faction, crush the opposition.What makes this game so great? They give you freaking muskets, pistols, and grenades!The reload spead is faster than reality, but who wants to stand around reloading all the time?But the powder weapons, even at their worst stats are devastating. The grenades are a lot of fun, but leave a bit to be desired. You can choose from three different sizes: Small medium and large. (Sounds like a freaking fast food menu, right?) The problem with each of them is they do not replenish after each battle as bullets and arrows do. But hey, they're already OP, so theres gotta be a drawback somewhere, right? Now here's where I have an issue with the game: Some unknown set of circumstances casues them to explode but do no damage. (Believe me, Im not missing. When you are taking the walls and you are the first one up, get to the top of the ladder and look down at the horde waiting for you [units set at 150]. You cant miss a target like that if you tried. So after the first two grenades, the rest seem to stop working.) But with any of the three types of grenades, you can expect 3-4 kills with one throw. Oh! There is nothing more satisfying than watching a surge of blood-thirsty warriors coming at you with every ounce of confidence that you are going to be splattered across the walls. Then with a single throw, 7 of them just drop dead. And the rest? Well, there seems to be a large impact on morale with these explosions. Sometimes you dont even have to hit anyone. They hear these beasts go off nearby, and that's all for them! FT! Im done!!Another drawback to this game: They took out a lot of the weapons you could get in the original. My favorite was the heavy axe (Or something it was a one-hamded axe, dealing 40c) and they also took out the lucern (Fudge spealling, the pole-hammer) both gone. Replaced now by generic fencing swords and eastern equivalents. The game is still entirely playable, but you just yearn for your tried and true steel buddies of old. Other features of note: You can upgrade and armor recruits at mercenary camps. Each camp has their own nationality and their upgrades only affect that nationality. (Rascist, I know) In cities and Castles/fortresses: You can visit Weapon, Armor, and Horse masters to order ""custom"" associated gear. There is also a WONDERFUL new adition of the Merchant Guild!! Leave a couple thousand Thaler (money) at the ""bank"" and let it accrue interest. Theres even more to mention, but if you even managed to get this far in my review, I salute you! If you liked Warband, just stop reading and get Fire and Sword already! You wont regret it!			"

												Mount and Blade is the secret handshake between PC gamers in the know. It's the last revelation of a secret society. Everything that makes PC gaming great is here. Unique gameplay that would never sell on a console, History nerd heaven, MODS out the Kaiser, and fun mulitplayer.With Fire and Sword is also an amazing entry in the series. The new weapon types shake up gameplay in wonderful ways. The setting is unique for players too. If you are not playing any of the Mount and Blade series, you aren't living properly.I would say that With Fire and Sword may not be the perfect introduction to the series for a new player. Warband, then Napoleonic Wars will acclimate you to this game.			"

												When Mount & Blade came out, it was an ambitious project that did not reach its full potential. The first standalone expansion  (Warband) added some key improvements to the formula, but ultimately it felt like a re-release of the first game with just short of enough new content to justify paying full price for it if you already owned Mount & Blade. With Fire & Sword is the breath of... semi-fresh air that the series needed. The essentials of the gameplay remain almost identical (except for the great addition of powerful firearms and some other additions, which force the player to come up with new tactics). However, it is the setting of this game that really sets it apart from the two previous M&B titles.Based on Henryk Sienkiewicz's historical novel ""Ogniem i mieczem"", the game pushes us back to a period in real world history instead of fiction. We are taken to mid-17th century Eastern Europe, where the once great Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is facing war with multiple of its neighbouring nations. This is where the facts end, as the player can choose to ally himself/herself with any of the real factions included in the game (the 'Polish Commonwealth', the 'Kingdom of Sweden', the 'Cossack Hetmanate', the 'Muscovite Tsardom' or the 'Crimean Khanate') and alter the course of history. Alternatively, like in Warband, you may choose to form your own kingdom or simply remain neutral throughout the duration of the game.Ultimately, the gameplay of With Fire & Sword is refined to such an extent that it feels like the most well-designed of the first three M&B titles. However, it is still very similar to the previous games and suffers from the same main flaws at the core: lack of significant unique content in terms of story. The cold and calculated nature of the tasks and actions the player is permitted to do in the game may get tedious after a while of playing. If you didn't enjoy M&B, then perhaps you should skip this one unless you really like history. On the other hand, if you enjoyed Mount & Blade then I see no reason why you shouldn't like this game (its unique and unusual setting, which explores a period in history rarely ever mentioned in video games, makes this experience more interesting).

												Singleplayer Grade 7/10 (mainly due to bugs)Multiplayer Grade 8/10 (If you buy this game for multiplayer, remember to check if there are still active players online playing this game)IMPORTANT:1) TRY FREE DEMO BEFORE PURCHASING!2) Mount & Blade Warband is much better and it has mods that bring firearms to the game.Short review: Like mount & blade Warband, but in different setting. If you hate idea of firearms in this kind of game you shouldn't buy this game. The grade is lower than in Warband, due to some problems in gameplay and large amount of gamebraking bugs.Full review:The singleplayer of this game gives you the possibility to lead mercenary warband in the setting of 17th century eastern europe. Like in mount and Blade warband, the experience is generally exciting and unique. Unlike Mount & blade Warband, which is like huge sandbox, this game tries to create what many consider the the Holy Grail of gaming , which is combining story and sandbox gameplay. Unfortunately the developers failed in this in many ways.First problem is that many players didn't care at all about the story and wanted to play sandbox game, but this was difficult due to the fact that unlike in Warband, you can't create your own kingdom. You can't get married either and there are no tournaments. Because of these and some other reasosn he RPG and sandbox elements are lacking compared to Warband.Second problem is that if you follow the story (I played the Black Mace campaign which on my opinion unfortunately wasn't interesting) you will face problems. The first one of those are huge amount of bugs, that force you to load your saved game many times during the campaing. Many of these bugs are related to the fact that the world of the game changes usually independently comapred to the story. Even when these changes don't cause actual bugs, they can seriously hamper the players attempst to progress in the story. I was for example given task to capture certain city from hostile country Poland, but by the time I had army to capture it, neutral country Crimean Kahanate had already taken it. In order to capture the town, my country would have to start war also against them. This would have been almost certain defeat due to getting into war in two fronts.Third problem is the setting. Some people might be scared about the strange setting, but that is not what is the main problem. The problem that the setting causes is that it affects the gameplay negatively. In mount & Blade Warband, the player can both be commander of his/her troops and also be the superhero in shining armour that kills dozens of enemies on his/her own. This is even somewhat historical because armour made medieval knights very difficult to kill. In Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword, half of those filthy peasants :-) that you used to kill without trouble are now armed with firearms, that kill you with one or two shots on hardest difficulty. Even on lower difficulty levels it is difficult to be superhero anymore. The one shot kill firearms also make melee weapons relatively weak, which is a shame, because one of the best things in Mount & Blade series is the melee combat.Despite the severe problems in singleplayer I gave this game grade of 7, because the basic mechanics of Mount & Blade series are still there and they are great.Multiplayer part is good, mainly due to the uniqueness of Mount & blade combat. The reason to not to give 9/10 for multiplayer is that there are no modifications for multiplayer unlike in Warband, and because the gameplay is slightly worse due to what firearms cause to the gameplay.

												Mount&Blade: With Fire and Sword takes place in the middle of the 17th century, its about evolving your character into either a bandit, lord or even a king. The game has 5 main factions: The Cossack Hetmanate, Polish Commonwealth, Crimean Khanate, the Kingdom of Sweden, and the Muscovite TsardomMount&Blade: With Fire and Sword is just like every other Mount&Blade game, addicting, fun, amazing, any good word that comes up in your head. There ARE bugs, but not much. It doesn't cost much, worth every single cent.My rating: 9.5/10			"

												Tis a good but nuanced game. I could only recommend it to people who really like Mount & Blade and are interested in Polish history. Game has promised patches that never came, the ""Black Mace"" story quest (Ukraine/Zhaparozhie) is still broken IIRC haven't done it recently. The game is also incredibly imbalanced and the firearms are the worst of it. The sad part is that it's not the inclusion of the firearms, but rather their mechanics. You can reload a a full-length rifle while galloping on horseback, I'm not even exaggerating sadly. Like I said good but nuanced game. Only buy if you really like M&B and Polish history.			"

												Aye, over thousand hours have been sunk in Mount & Blade With Fire and Sword.And why I've sunk so many hours in this game, you may ask,The answer is: because I really love the time period of this game and I find it most interesting part of history.But let me tell you what the game is:The game is basically reskin of Warband with muskets with the singleplayer which is a sniper simulator in a nutshell. Nothin' to add that.Multiplayer is: Full of pike-spammers (is that even a real term?) Badmins who ban you without hesitation Musket snipers (other strange term)Horse archers who can snipe you from miles away Stupidly fast infantry (like Crimea and Cossacks) who can almost outrun a horse.I have very negative thoughts of this game and only good thing is the time period of game.If you want a masochist experience then this is the game for you!Edit: review updated with more explanatory content and (hopefully) better grammar.Edit 2: got banned from a siege server because I was better than the admin in combat.

												You know, i dont know how many reviews says get Warband instead. I wanted to begin with With Fire and Sword, and do Warband later.But if you are looking for modding directly. Then go Warband directly.Just make sure first to play With Fire and Sword if you like the time period, atmosphere and nations, if you like those, this can be the best of MB serie for you,with true to life Euro-asian nations and etnicities.    Whole game is very ethno...Interesting and funny wars. Also challenging achievements.. All broken.This game is little buggy. But most bugs can be overcome with enough persistance and patience. Persistance and patience, are key to its gameplay too, as 90% of the game, you will travel as a courier, riding around with foods.If you have patience for all that, you will never give up on this game, you will enjoy it even more. It is a personal preference.11/10			"

Posted: January 6, 2016
												This game is fantastic. I've put hundreds of hours into it, and I'll likely put hundreds of house more into it. Takes place in the real world in mid-17th century Eastern Europe. There's 5 factions; Muscovite Tsardom (Russia), Sweden, Poland, Crimean Khanate (Crimea, which is a location in the game), and the Cossacks. You'll meet people from these areas as well as Spaniards, Frenchmen, Germans, and even Scotsmen. There are muskets, and because of the time period, they come in a variety of flavours. Home made, matchlock, wheel lock, and Miquelet (flintlock) are the main ones, in order of quality. Accuracy is in short supply of course, but I do believe there are some rifled muskets in the game, however they are VERY expensive, and not something you can give normal soldiers. Only your own character, and heroes.You amass your own Army, there are many different endings, and there are many different ways to fight. Personally I like to position my cavalry to the side, while my infantry takes 10 paces in front of my marksmen to defend them from enemy cavalry, while my own cavalry does the same. If the enemy bowmen/musketmen get too close for my liking, I'll send in my infantry to charge them, make them switch from ranged attack to melee, so that my own musketman can help quell them while they're busy with my infantry and cavalry. Works very well for me so far, as you can tell it's all basically revolving around my musketmen, but the infantry and cavalry certainly have their place. Without one or the other, I would feel vulnerable. You can cavalry if you like, or perhaps just stick with infantry and musketmen, or even exchange the musketmen for bowmen but you best have some DAMN strong bowmen with some DAMN strong bows because as troops come with heavier armour, those arrows quickly start doing less and less damage, however muskets will always do a lot of damage... when the shots hit. Thick shields and thick armour combined can really lessen a musket's effectiveness however.There's lots of quests, lots of cities and towns, lots of different methods to take in order to secure victory, the replay value is VERY MUCH present, and as many battles as I take part in, it never seems to get old. The tutorial is entertaining enough, complete with voice acting, but it's not something that drags out annoyingly long. It puts you in the action quite quickly, and then you're free to go, Eastern Europe is yours to explore! Though there are some muskets that are so accurate you'd think them rifled, there's always bullet drop, so you'll have to learn to compensate for that. It just adds to the gameplay however, which though simple, is difficult to master, and I'd have it no other way. Like Call of Pripyat with Misery mod (and The Armed Zone if you REALLY want to be overloaded with firearm selection), and like Red Orchestra II/Rising Storm, I expect to ultimately end up with 1000+ hours in this game as the years go by. Sure it doesn't look particularly pretty, but there's a unique appeal to it that I've yet to find in any other game or mod. An experience in and of itself.The process of leveling up, improving my various aspects, getting better gear, customizing ther Mercenaries available for hire at Mercenary Camps, training them up from Recruit, to Experienced, to Veteran, to Elite... it's so much fun that I've lost count of how many time I've restarted the game. A clean slate starting at day 1, my current playthrough is over 450 days in-game, over a year's worth, my Army is at a max of about 87-88 troops, however when I put the coin down for Mercenaries with ALL the best equipment I can give them, then train them together with a few of my heroes to work them up to Veterans and Elites, my less than 90 soldiers feels more like 150-200 or more, usually depending on how many muskets the enemy is bringing to the battlefield. If none, it feels like I've got 300 troops, might even be gutsy enough to take on 350 if all they have is bowmen, but that might be reaching a bit too far. All the same, there's such a wide range of armour, melee weapons, bows, muskets, horses, troops, and so on... the variety is amazing. Ultimately though, we all know that muskets would come to rule the battlefields in the 18th and early-mid 19th centuries, so although most of the muskets in the game are primitive matchlocks, it can only be expected that they'd ultimately be superior. That said however... armoured, well trained, and well equipped bowmen vs unarmoured, untrained, and ill-equipped musketmen? I'd put my money on the bowmen any day of the week. You don't pick up a musket and you're suddenly invincible. If you see a hussar barreling at you on horseback with lance couched, as of yet untouched on the battlefield, a single musket ball will likely do little more than♥♥♥♥♥♥him off, you'll want a second one to finish the job, but if he gets you with that lance, musket or no, you're equally dead both ways. Some say that cavalry with muskets is all you need, but cavalry can only use carbines of pistols, and not only that, firing on horseback isn't as accurate as firing on the ground, so not only does fool soldiers with muskets have more accurate firearms that cause more damage, they also have the advantage of firing on the ground. However once they have to be forced to use melee, the shooting stops, and if the enemy is still shooting or firing arrows, then you're at a heavy disadvantage, which is where the infantry comes into play. Troops trained in melee combat, often given better melee weaponry, have them positioned to protect your musketmen, just as pikemen had done before the advent of the bayonet. If the fighting becomes stagnant though, with the musketmen a mere 50m away, sending in volley after volley, order the infantry to charge, get up in their faces so they can't keep their muskets spitting, but keep your men firing lead balls into them. Yes, just like chess, there are many ways to attain victory. Find your own way, your own troops, your own tactics, and take 17th century Eastern Europe for your own! HUZZAH!			"

												BUTThe reason I don't recommend this game is because it's predecessor (M&B: Warband) is an absolute gem with essentially the exact same graphics and gameplay but for me it just feels.. better. If you haven't tried it then you should go pickup Warband and if you have played Warband then I'm here to warn you that F&S is just a little bit off.I can't quite put my finger on it; perhaps it's the strategical considerations that come into play with the introduction of firearms, or perhaps it simply wasn't balanced quite as well, but either way F&S on the whole is just not as enjoyable to me as Warband. Both are exceptionally unique and fantastic games but I would either buy Warband if you're new to Mount and Blade or stick with Warband if you're a fan of the series.			"

												I spent 5 years trying to come up with a funny review for this game. I failed. Now, I'm gonna stick with the good ol' boring, wannabe helpful review.I don't have an idea why I didn't reviewed this game for so long but seeing those fresh recruitments (thx to bannerlord I guess), I decided to be helpful to those who consider buying this game as a committed player of the series, started playing Mount and Blade in November 2009 and spent many days&nights playing it since then.Comparison to the previous games; Even tho scenarios to take the throne of some nations (like Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Russia) were added as a unique feature to it's predecessors, Single player was a little... dull. Despite using firearms, siege artillery still wasn't added to the game. There are some features like; ordering a weapon for yourself, changing equipment of the mercenaries from their camps for a price (yeah, they have camps now) etc. but also It didn't have marriage or creating your own kingdom/empire so they took some things out, put some in.Multiplayer on the other hand was quite entertaining, especially clan battles. So just go for it If you want to pvp. Even tho, the era of clans is over, you won't have trouble finding a server if it's not late night or morning. Multiplayer is still not dead! The game isn't demanding and most likely to run smoothly on ancient rigs. (Hello 128 MB Video Card)  Graphics are ok, not great but ok. (Graphics wasn't the MB's strong suit anyways). As for the price, It's cheaper than what it deserves right now.* I give it a 7/10, feels incomplete in so many levels but also doesn't fail to keep you entertained. At the current price, It's worth it.			"

												This is a very nice and a heck of an addictive game! It is very much like Warband, but with a few major differences: firearms - drastically changes the combat; grenades - probably the most fun part of the game; realistic world map and city names - makes it a lot easier for the player to connect to the in-game world. But the most important thing for me is that I can hire an army of my ancestors - the Kalmyks.

												YEs! this game has everything that made Warband great plus early era guns and cannons! i put off playing it for a while, because i was worried the guns would be too overpowered and sometimes they can be. you can be mid to late game and be a super high level with tons of health and armor and get murdered by a couple stray bullets, but it's not something that's going to happen a lot. especially if you play smart. i think this game requires much more strategy than Warband. in warband, by the time i've level 40 or so, i can wade into a battle and kill 20-50 people on my own and it's much harder to do that in this one because of how much damage guns can do. you also tend to have more casualties during battle and numbers tend to matter more. it's like they took all the good parts about warband and added to it. more quests, a new world, new factions, more and different weapons (including primitive grenades). beyond all that, the various factions have their own storylines which i did not need, but kind of love. playing as the polish will have some different quests from the swedish which are different from the russians which is different from the crimeans. the addition of the story elements add some believability to the various relations between the factions because you learn why they like the factions they like and hate the factions they hate.if you played warband and like it, you'll most likely enjoy this game too. if you haven't played warband, i recommend getting the mount and blade full collection and playing warband first, then coming to this, because there are some major differences in gameplay. i assure you the addition of guns and bombs adds much more depth and strategy to this game than warband had to it. that's not to say warband was bad or too easy, just that guns make it easier to kill than swords. which we all already knew anyway.

												TL;DR It's a fun game but Mount and blade warband is better.Let me explain. I bought this game on a sale because guns sound a lot more fun and warband was more expensive. So I bought this and the original mount and blade. The problem with this game is that the single player is hard. Like really hard. It's hard earning money, there is no real tutorial to learn you how to start your own empire or join an existing empire etc.My first time playing my men were starving, I had ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons and I was fighting bandits in hope that I could pay for my soldiers and food. Eventually my luck ran out and I lost everything. This has been a theme for my experience with the singleplayer. It's fun if you know how to play and earn money without going to tournaments and cheating the system like in warband. So why do I have so many hours on it? Well the multiplayer is awesome. Shooting people with muskets and♥♥♥♥♥♥is a ton of fun. It's a bit like the napoleonic dlc for warband, which is a ton of fun, but more derpy. I guess this is where I conclude my review. This game is fun if you know how to play, the multiplayer is the best part and I've played a lot of it however the singleplayer is somewhat lacking and where the previous games were fun this one is too difficult and time consuming. I've put 20 hours or so into the singleplayer but I just don't get into it.			"

UPDATE: As much as I would like to get into this game more its pretty boring compared to Warband. Plus I hate the looks of the clothing and weapons.While Mount and Blade: With Fire & Sword isn't as fun as Warband, it's still pretty awesome. I've read both positive and negative reviews for this game and I can see how it can go either way. I personally enjoy this game, it gives you an entirely new perspective on the world forcing the player to adapt to a new environment very quickly. I find making enemies much easier in With Fire & Sword than it was in Warband, so you need to watch what you do or you could find yourself alone against an army.Mount and Blade: With Fire & Sword is very similar to Warband only in a different era (The 17th Century to be exact). Here's my breakdown of WFaS:PROS+ Includes 21 Steam Achievements (Some more challenging to get than others)+ Requirements are low allowing this game to be played on almost every computer+ All Castles & Fortresses have Taverns (Unlike in Warband it was just the towns)+ Ability to chat with the Mayor/Elders directly from the town menu (Unlike in Warband you had to find them yourself)+ Ability to make a wagon fort (Allows for a better defense perimeter in Battles, but does not necessarily give you an avantage)CONS- No Steam Trading Cards- Larger quantity of Bandits/Looters/Enemies than in WarbandWHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? WITH FIRE AND SWORD! (BUY THIS GAME)My Rating: 9/10 (Recommended) "

												Fantastic and fun game. Not as good as Warband but once you get out of the beginning phase it's a very enjoyable game.... at least until major quest givers disapear from the ♥♥♥♥ing mapI wasted 20 hours on a character. I was nearing the end of the Muscovite questline, at the point where you rebel with the claimant to the Tsar's throne and declare yourself the grandson of Dimitry.So in that quest you have to get support of a certain warlord. Nikita Odeovseky or something. Naturally, the first thing I do is go find the nearest Muscovite warlord to ask where Mr. Nikita is. ""I don't know where Warlord Nikita Ovaryscars is"". Hmm maybe this is something for the quest and i'm supposed to go to the only fortress he lives in. Nope that doesn't seem like it. Maybe I have to wait. So I set up camp for a week. Nothing. Talk to another lord and ask where this jackass is. ""I don't know where he is.""Okay something's ♥♥♥♥y.Save and quit. Enable cheats. Control + T in order to view everything on the map. Can't find this guy's party. He isn't in any Muscovite castle chilling like a ♥♥♥♥♥. Maybe he's prisoner somewhere and I need to break him out! :OI spend 15 minutes scanning this damned map looking at every prisoner garrison of every castle, town, and noble for this warlord. Nope. He's gone.Okay ♥♥♥♥ this save is broken. Maybe I'll restart, export the character, inflate his skills and give him cash, then breeze through back to where I was. K cool.2 hours into going back through the beginning dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥hardass phase of blah blah♥♥♥♥♥kissing nobles and take this letter across the map to this guy who is definitely at this town but by the time you get there he's somewhere else. Great now to initiate the quest I had started. No time wasting now.Gotta find the Tsar.Go ask nearest warlord where Tsar Mikhaelovich is.""I do not know where Tsar Mikhaelovich is""where's a gun			"

If You are new to this game follow the Black mace story line as Cossac acquire the Unique weapon build a team of NPC (dont forget to add them in a special group as personal guards) since the Polish rebels are eliminated feel free to make some extra saves and either finish the game as cossac or as any other party. :clover: Have a good time.

Pros:+Firearms+Grenades+Additional siege options (sneak through town, blow up wall, poison water supply)+Campaigns+More town/empire management+Real map locations+Can trade in castles (was not able to in Warband)+Bank/debt system (however simple it might be)+Can place orders on the best equipment from various venders (new feature)Neutral:~New siege system. Multiple ladders instead of one. Good if you are an attacker, bad if you are defender. ~Gameplay. Overpowered bullet damage forces you to keep your distance and player smarter. Cons:-HORRIBLE SIEGE AI. ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS. Half the time your troops or the enemy is just standing there, doing absolutely NOTHING or they keep switching their weapons back and forth, whilst doing nothing. -Bugs. CTD bugs after tabbing out, finishing a battle, or just traversing the map sometimes. 'Line error' messages and more bugs sometimes after battles and quest completions. And then you can also shoot someone and the bullet will go behind and not do any damage. Extremely annoying.-Campaign intructions are vague and hard to figure out. You will end up using google to complete missions. I guarantee it. -Tax revenue from towns is no longer automatic. You have to visit your town to collect.Overall, it is a step down from Warband. Sure, you can say ""but guns, so cool, much wow. pew pew gg"" but these new additions do NOT make up for the sloppy AI and the bugs. The ""RAAHH CHARGE!!!! I'LL KILL 50 OF YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S!!"" feeling at the beginning of every battle is not the same as it is in Warband, there's more of a risk to go in balls deep forcing you to stay back in every battle.TL;DR - Do not buy this game if you are looking to get into the Mount & Blade series, buy Warband instead.. Vanilla (unmodded) Warband offers a similar experience but with less of the hassle. Modded Warbands offers a superior experience, and it has a wide array of mods in comparison.			"

												Its actually challenging! Instead of just spamming rhodoks or nords you actually have to think here. Musketeers are vital to a healthy strong army, but are terrible in combat, infantry is high damage but not very hardy and calvary is EXTREMELY EXSPENSIVE but hold a raw power unseen by any force on earth besides the German Blitzkrieg, but be warned, these arent the Swadian tanks weve come to love, charging a musketeer wall head on is a mistake and you WILL lose men! constantly refresh your reserves. As always make sure to keep your factions kept within your army to one or two as desertion is common. Be warned, you are no longer the god wielding death and mayhem with your heavy armor and two handed weapons as seen in warband, shaking off all but the most powerful blows, in this game you are very, very vulnerable early game and even late game you are still able of being beaten. Armor and weapons are exspensive and money can be hard to come by, COMPLETE FAVORS TO GET MEN. PERIOD. GET DAT TOWN RELATION STAT AS HIGH AS A KITE BECAUSE WITOUT IT YOUR ARMY WILL DWINDLE! AND IF YOU RUN INTO DESERTERS EARLY GAME PAY THEM OFF! THESE ARE NOT THE IDIOTIC NORD AXEMEN THAT YOU CAN RIDE AROUND AND SABRE ONE BY ONE, THESE ARE MEN WITH MUSKETS AND CALVARY OF THEIR OWN THAT CAN AND WILL 1 HIT KILL YOU, YOUR FOLLOWERS, AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR MEN. MY FIRST PLAYTHROUGH I HAD 20 SCYTHE WIELDERS AND RAN INTO 6 WINGED HUSSARS. NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS CAPTURED AND MY ARMY DECIMATED. GREAT GAME			"

												Here's the thing - if you're looking for the best mount & blade to buy and can only afford one of them, this is, sadly, not the choice to make. I love this game but Warband is the superior one, although this one has guns for the campaign, the gameplay is better and warband and there's just not anything new here. I enjoy both of the games, but this game does lack in comparison. Now is it a bad game? Hell no. I love using a two-handed claymore one minute and switching to a pistol for the next wave of enemies, and having a group of 100 men with nearly all of them using muskets is so satisfying when you can watch them shoot down the entire enemy group. If you can afford both mount and blades grab both of them, and while you'll throw more hours into the other, you'll get a great amount of game time and fun from this one as well to make your purchase worth it. Just wait for a sell first.			"

												Pretty similar to Warband, and still good, and the graphics are maybe slightly improved. However, I can't seem to get in to it as much as I do Warband..I would say just play Warband, its better than this one, with♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of mods that can mostly emulate what this game has. I honestly wouldnt buy this game, if you have the money for Warband. If you have the 20$ (or only like 3ish dollars on sale) Buy Warband, It's an excellent game. But this one is still ok, its basically the same concept as Warband except it is set in Eastern Europe and there are guns...It has OP guns in the beginning and the map isnt huge. The armor is weak and the weapons are too...I'm just reccomending this to not hurt the series. It is much more difficult than Warband and honestly not as fun. Just get Warband.			"

												""Mount and Blade With Fire And Sword is so bad"" That right there is a lie.

Yes I have a little hours on it but I used to play warband and this 3 years ago on desura.9/10Pros --Good singleplayer-More choices than skyrim (incomming hate)-Fun-Endless-Multiplayer-Can run on the crappiest of computersCons --Graphics suck-Guns are OP-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*Rating from me - 9/10*			"

												Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword is on of the greatest strategy games (in my humble opinion) of all time. Not only can you command your army, but you can do so while playing as your own character. The multiplayer part of this game is not very famous, by that i mean not many people play it, yet it still gives you a sense of trying to get better and and improve at it to better yourself to someday beat someone who slayed you before. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games and doesnt mind to learn from mistakes.			"

												Tl&dr: my recommendations for M&B variants are as follows:1. Viking Conquest Reforged2. Floris mod3. Warband4. Any mod you can find, but you can expect some crashes and bugs in some5. With fire and sword6. Blood and Gold: Carribean! (only for a 5 minutes laugh)I assume this M&B version wanted to put the player in a position closer to an army general than the original Warband, but fails to do even that through its own fault. This is why (comparing to Warband):- no more character attributes design at start of the game. You start with the same point in all attributes and can distribute only a few. You will be a poor fighter, poor trader with a slightly above average IQ; no other choice.- since the discovery of fire (a.k.a. muskets) any fight can end abruptly if some mediocre rifleman gets lucky and lands a head shot from across the map, no matter how many hit points you have or what head gear you use; but to be honest, this can be avoided 99.99% of the times if you get a horse and run around in circles like a crazy chicken. In short, if you run around buck naked you survive, if you stand still in the best armor in the game, you die.- although the game almost forces you into a command position, the battle map size doesn't really give you this feeling. Half the times, after you give a few commands and your men start to move into position, the enemy cavalry is already close and charging, turning what should be a clean line-infantry battle into a total mess of men and horses.- adding to the above point is the battle size limiter to 150, which makes you feel like you are the leader of an oversized gang, rather than some wannabe Napoleon. There are tools to increase this size to 1000, but, considering the small maps, having 1000 men fighting is more of a lottery than some tactical or strategic combat.- Warband had a questionable AI at best in siege battles, but this one made the step forward. The best result I had against this terrible AI was at a siege 60 attackers vs. 180 defenders. Attackers won with 1 wounded and 1 dead.- speaking of AI, do not expect any challenges on the global map either. No matter what you do, you can't be outsmarted, the only way to lose anything is through brute force, when you are seriously outnumbered.- story-line quests are bugged; almost all of them. The only one that works without constantly saving because of the fear of the bugs is the Polish one. However, it has some interesting ways to make the game challenging. One moment you have half of the map, the next half of your cities belong to the enemy without any battles fought or any warnings. Why? Because you talked to some guy and asked him what's wrong. Thank you.- no more tournaments, lots of quests from Warband removed- troop upgrade trees are lacking imagination to say the least- money from fiefs are not sent to you automatically forcing you to make a tour every now and then to collect your taxesOverall, a M&B with less interesting combat, but in which you can trade and become a tax collector.

												okay my review:Maps 5.5/10.0Well you might ask me: why so low score? just because they didnt make castles historically accurate, and just a few unique buildings, while the eastern europe was filled of them. Example: my country's capital Vilna (Lithuanian spelling: Vilnius) had a river getting into two pieces, a very steep hill with a great tower on top and walls surrounding. the tower on hill is even today staying there. you could google it too. Trakai, that village nearby, was no worse, it had huge great fort in a island which was in a huge lake, altho what i've seen was a random village with a few houses ingame. The map could've been more accurate.Combat + Units 8.0/10.0The game, has great combat, altho sometimes AI gets easily stuck or it forgets to fight and other funny buggy things. sometimes they even bug out so hard, but still its good.But the units, you could've make a bigger variety of them, because i am pretty sure there was not a lack of unit kinds there. I like the ones that you made, but some are little inaccurate.Storylines + Quests 7.5/10.0The Quests from cities are a little boring: if you do much of them, they repeat quickly...Storylines are good, but sometimes buggy.Factions 9.5/10Well they're great, but it would've been more amazing if we wouldve had prussia, ottomans, austrians too!Overall calculated rating of these things from me is 7.625/10.000			"

												This is a mod of the original version of Mount & Blade. The primary focus of this mod is the singleplayer campaign revolving around the formation of the Moscovite Tsardom of Russia, the Swedish Deluge into Poland, and the Crimean Khanate Incursion into Kiev; this is the modern day area of Eastern Sweden, Poland, Ukraine, and Western Russia. The big gameplay change is the inclusion of firearms; however since this is based on the original Mount & Blade, the Player will automatically lose the battle if his character is knocked out. With the inclusion of volley fire firearms, the player character can be knocked out with a single bullet, causing the gameplay to suffer greatly. The second large addition to this mod is 3 unique questlines revolving around the kingdoms of Poland, Cossack Ukraine, and Moscovite Russia. However, the questlines are near impossible to complete without a guide, are buggy, and poorly translated.With the singleplayer losing most of its charm with combat being against the player's favor, and the quests being difficult, requiring guides, buggy, AND uninteresting, I cannot recommend this game.The multiplayer is an interesting take, but the Napoleonic Wars mod for Warband handles firearms much better. I recommend M&B: Warband over this game. Free Warband mods are vastly better than this one.			"

												Buy Warband instead. The difficulty between this game and Warband has been increased greatly, which isn't a bad thing. Once you got a hang of Warband the AI got fairly easy. Unfortunately success in this game is not only greatly more difficult, especially at the lower levels, but often your success in matters are not only random, but often the odds of missions you are given are literally impossible.If the only issue was difficulty it'd not be a problem. But mission scaling is horrendously broken. If you take a mission, especially at the lower levels, you have typically less than a fifty percent chance of finishing it. I would say the game is just too difficult, but I've nearly mastered Warband and I can't play this one for more than a few minutes without either losing and getting captured, or save scumming.			"

												This game is probaly the best sword fighting game I have ever played :D It's amazingly addictive and keeps you entertained for hours...But the thing is, it was originally a DLC so it's not that big a game. But that doesen't mean it's only has 1 level. It has 2 modes: castle seige and battle mode. (+ Campaign mode).In both battle mode and castle siege you only have one life, which immediatly rises the tension.The campaign mode is good and fun, but i prefer the other game modes. The online exprience has some different maps and it is modable (Is that a word)?but the other players.. My god they are annoying.So say you want some good old swordfighting action, yeah? You want them to fully block, and attacklike a proper duel, yes? But the thing is, the other players think that doing that is bullsh*t and spin around in circles while mashing left click is a good way to win a fight. Just saying.Overall Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword is a great game but however has some issuses. (I forgot to mention that the graphics aren't that good, but that doesn't ruin the experience at all).The game has a simple to learn but hard to master combat system. It's very simallar to Chivalry Medival Warfare.In other words, BUY THE GAME!			"

												Props to my good friend RedAlpha for giving me this games as a Christmas gift. Thanks alot, buddy. Fire & Sword, as a standalone expansion to Warband, is almost mechanically identical to it's relative game and has everything from it that makes it good, but there are tweaks and alterations that set it apart from the game enough to justify it as it's own separate title. Not only changing the weapons that the skills constitute and the armor and apparel to go with the new, much more advanced and recent setting than Warband, but to go with that, they added guns and grenades (Hence 'Fire and Sword'.) which is my favorite selling point in this game, because of this, they changed the ranged infantry from Archers to Marksmen, whom you can command to form rows thanks to the new additions to the order-giving system this game has. However, Fire & Sword also shares the two infamous gripes I have with Warband: Frustration with regards to difficulty, and as mentioned in the Warband review, letting a snail win a race to you while you're -riding a horse.- Oh well, just like Warband, this gets a 9/10, an impressive.

												I'm up in the air with yes and no. It is not as good as Warband, but it's fun. It's got optional story, which is nice, and guns and horses and swords, which are all nice, (oh, and GRENADES!) but it has its fair share of problems. You can't set up your custom kingdom, you can only usurp existing ones. Bad. You can die (yes, that matters a lot!), which is not supposed to happen in M&B, and some of the storylines are just plain silly. Looking at The Deluge and Black Mace! False Dmitri is probably the best one. Speaking of which, this game is considerably more linear than the others, which is why it is out of the loop. Mount&Blade is supposed to be sandbox open-world blah blah. Also, you can't go home and become a family man here. You don't have that option anymore. So, go back to Warband for the moment, and wait until Bannerlord to -see if it is any good-. EDIT: Bannerlord will be the best game of all time. Be a family man.Anyway, returning to this, guns! Why not? The other best part is that if you hire a mercenary army, you can customise their uniforms. 11/10, would make morion-toting Crusader army again.			"

												-Started campaign-Became a trader and made some money-Hired mercanaries and began adventuring in the north-Did a couple quests for the muscovite tsardom-Found an old man in a village who gave me a golden cross and pistol-Decided to not pay attention to what the man said and went to do more quests for the tsardom-Delievered a horse to the tsar-About to be vassalized for bringing a horse to him when he sees the cross-Got thrown in jail-Escaped jail and fled to poland-Found a claiment to the tsardom who decided to help me overthrow the tsardom-Used the cross and claimed i was the real heir to the tsardom to turn the entire army against the tsar-Overthrew the tsar and betrayed the claiment who helped me-Became the new tsar and led the muscovite tsardom to glory.10/10 would overthrow the muscovite tsardom again.Seriously though this game is pretty good, not as good IMO as warband but its up there, wouldnt suggest getting this if you want to just join a kingdom and take over the world as the vassalize system feels slightly broken (Tried to get vassalized once by sweden got the king to 80 opinion of me and had fought so many battles against his enemies yet he wouldnt vassalize me at all) however sieges are pretty fun and there are more options than in warband for sieges such as blowing a hole in a wall. Outside of sieges combat is really fun and requires you to use a strategy instead of just charging all the time like most would in warband, however it does have alot of glitchs from what i can see and IMO is not as well done as warband is however one thing this game has over warband is story quests, three of them infact one for the muscovites, one for the polish, and one for the cossacks, they are pretty fun and enjoyable decent length to. 7/10 great game if you like 1600's combat and want to play a mount and blade game that has a ""main story"" element and don't mind the fact the game feels a little unfinished in some areas			"

												The game's story was so good that it inspired me to read the novel that this game was based on. It also got me interested in 17th century Eastern Europe history, just like how Napoleonic Wars DLC got me interested in 19th century Western Europe history.There are three main storylines (Polish, Cossack and Muscovite) depending on the faction you join. So you could play the game 3 times to get through all the endings.I recommend playing with a mod to enhance the experience.			"

												A good game. Though it isn't as good as Mount and Blade: Warband, it is still awesome in its own way.Pros: Guns - guns are OP. Sure, they take a long time to reload, but they have power and can wipe out whole armies.Actual trading - assessing local prices actually means something and you can make lots of money by doing it. Also, you get to form your own caravans, which is awsome and makes you very rich if you do it right.Banks and Guilds -you get to deposit money in banks and gain interest on that. You can also take loans as well. There are special guilds which can sell you special armor and weapons. Though expensive, they are very cool and can provide you with some cool stuff.Useful Castles - sounds weird, I know, but now every fortress or castle has a tavern and a marketplace. Unlike the Warband castles, which were basically just strongholds, the WF&S castles allow you to sell stuff, access the tavern, and talk to a mayor for quests. Interesting story-based quests  - there are special series of story-based quests for the Poles, the Russians, and the Cossacks. These stories are well-done and are quite interesting, giving you some history lessons while at the same time letting you campaign and battle Mount and Blade style.Grenades  - sure, they're almost always inefficient and usually not worth the steep price, but they are freaking GRENADES. IN MOUNT AND BLADE!!!!Cons - Bugs and Glitches - the developers moved on before the game was fully fixed, which is a huge shame. Though the game is mostly smooth and most problems have been dealt with, you may experience some graphical glitches here and there. At the worst, you will have a bug that wiill ruin your game. For example, a faction leader will be defeated in battle and never reappear, or the story-based quests will break and you'll be forever stuck on one part. Hopefully, you won't have these, but you've been warned.Lack of variety - in Warband, all the factions were truly unique, with obvious strengths and weaknesses. In WF&S, all the factions seem the same. Aside from appearances and some strengths (Poles= cavalry. Swedes = infantry), the factions don't have enough variety to make they feel truly unique in battle. At the end of the day, they are all essentially the same.No Story for Crimeans and Swedes - while the Russians, Poles, and Cossacks have story-based quests, the Crimeans and Swedes have none, which is a shameMap is Bland - in Warband, you have a desert, a steppe, a tundra, a mountain range, and a plains region. These added variety to the game and made the different areas unique. In WF&S, the entire map is flat, with just rivers and a few patches of forest. Woop-ee. Overall, don't let the cons prevent you from buying the game. It is a very fun and exciting experience which all Mount and Blade fans should have.			"

												Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword, with regards to how much I like it, and how much I don't, is quite a hard game to review. Overall it feals a lot like Mount and Blade, which is hardly suprising, but then it feels more advanced with the guns, almost like Napoleonic Wars DLC for Warband. Graphically i don't think Fire and Sword is really an inmprovement. Personally i don't think it looks very good, but let's be honest, that is never what Mount and Blade was about. If it was, they failed every time. The playstyle of the game is very much the same as all other games, with the same idea behind blocking and attacking n melee, and shooting. This is set in the early era of the invention of guns, i don't know for certain but maybe early 1700's? Either way, the uniforms for the soldiers look very old, and the guns are NOT very accurate. They also feel very 'light' and a bit too easy to aim, in comparison to that of Napoleonic Wars.The campaign is 'good'. That is about all i can say for it. It is much like the other games of it's type. Overpriced equipment, limits on army size and plenty of fetch and carry missions, and still no luck with marrying into a wealthy family. I think once you have played any Mount and Blade campaign, you have played them all. I can't think of much more to review in this game, maybe because there is nothing else. Overall, i don't like the time era very much which has turned me away from the game. I prefer the Napoleonic Wars by far. Other than that, death and melee still looks stupidly unrealistic, gunshots sound like...anything but gunshots, and the music is quite bad. Despite all this, i cannot say i don't like the game. Mount and Blade are good at making addictive games that are quite bad in comparison to other games, yet still very good. I know all that made sense, but i feel better for getting that out. 8/10. Graphics and the era ruined it for me more than anything, but i do like it.			"

												Amazing game, it captures the steppe/eastern style of warfare perfectly in the 17th century. I love this game and have enjoy it immensely a thousands times more than Warband. The line battles in Napoleonic Wars don't even match up to this game. TaleWorlds Entertainment is ripping themselves off by offering this standalone for 10$. I do not lie when I say if I could do it all over again, I would have purchased this at full price, not on sale and never picked up Warband. Its obvious more people like Warband because it's medieval theme, but for people like me, Fire and Sword is a little trip to gamer's heaven. While the loyal fanbase is moving on to Bannerlord, I'll still be on my little island, riding my war horse, bow in hand, leading Khan styled hoards, charging straight for an army of Polish Winged Hussars, while arquebus and wheelock muskets can be heard in the distance.

												Very Good....Rating: 8/10- Gameplay: 8- Multiplayer: 8- Campaign: 10- Learning Curve/Depth: 10- Community: 8Great addition to Warband, this DLC allows you to really see the gamplay come out in spades! New factions and weapons are definitly fun!Fight battles in first person using your horse and sword when you feel lucky and conquer the world as well in the strategy view. This game never seems to stop giving new twists and turns with its great sandbox environment. This game is a lot like sisters, one is always prettier and this one is not that sister (that is NW) but this one has a ton of personality!- FPS Battles- Overhead open world conquering- Strong Character Development- Strong Team Characters Developed*Note graphics are dated because the game was released a long while ago but there are modifications available that bring it up to date!**Quick update 12/27 about the story line, it is a bit flat to start with but then again it is a sandbox game so you are making the story up as you go!

The historical novel ""Ogniem i Mieczem"" or translated in English ""With fire and sword"" tells the story of the conflicts between Poland and Ukraine back then the Polish commonwealth and the Cossacks who are going up on a rebellion against the Polish.

												Good about warband: Your pc doesn`t have to be from nasa to use it on the best settings.You can spend much time on it before it gets boring, then you have the mods.Cheap.Bad about warband: OldLack of realism sometimesBugs ( not gamebreaking, but there are some)Everything is small /holdings armies) compared to reality.Mount and blade warband compared to fire and sword:Mount and blade: Much more worked onMore active serversMore and frequent updatesFire and sword:HUSSARS!!! CheaperIf you prefer to play in a fairytale world , there you go.But I think that it is much funnier playing in a historical world, with real troops and factions. The idea of fire and sword is really cool, but they haven`t worked on it enough, and the developers have left it to it`s own fate. If fire and sword had been worked on for as much as warband was, it would be epic. It lack the features warband has, and the graphic.Fire and sword has guns, this is a +. But can be frustrating gettin randomly one shot, and killed. If you are: Polish, Lithuanian, Russian, Crimean, mongol, ukrainian, swedish. Or you syphatize with any of them, You will love fire and sword (for a time) "

												AS A GUY NEW TO MOUNT & BLADE: I think this game was really well made, as a strategy game it was fun playing it , although it was alot challenging when I had no armies at all. This Game will take you to a different level of strategic gaming. An RPG styled you can level up, your troops can level up, and your empire can be ""leveld up"" by building upgrades and hiring people. You can be an emperor/King Or you can help a KING to take over other nation. Well whatever you choose it depends on you. GOOD LUCK :) This game was alot of fun, and I'm looking foward to play this game again. (P.S this game is really really hard, so you will need patience. Or, you can use the easy way. Use cheats xD. Happy ruling )			"

												First of all I would recommend this game for anyone who likes sandbox games ( for the single player mode ). One reason this game is so unique is because it has a different style of musket fighting than in the other mount and blade mods. The game gives you a sense of individuality in multiplayer, in which there is no sandbox you just battle with other people. In the other mount and blade mods and other games like those, you fight in groups so you are more of a body of men than a single soldier. In the multiplayer almost everyone moves at their own free will, like an irregular. So being a musketeer means more of you by yourself than you in a battalion of infantry. But it also allows other things, imagine a knight with a gun. This game is very fun but the multiplayer takes a while to master especially since there are a lot of hackers on some of the servers so PRACTICE!!! But other than that this game is very wide spread so it covers a lot of fields so this game is definitely one of my favorites.			"

												WF&S is basicly a mod for M&B: Warband, sacrificing some of Warband features for actual historical background.If you played Warband, you know what to expect. If you haven't - M&B is a sandbox game. You are being thrown into a pretty big map, full of villages and cities belonging to one of five factions. And then... well, you tell me. You want to become a bandit, rob caravans and burn villages? Why not? Want to be a vigilante, taking down bandits and doing small jobs for the lords? Why wait? How about joining the faction, gaining fiefs, and taking over hostile factions? Go on. Or maybe... create your own faction, and become a king? Your call. Or you can always be a merchant. Still a good idea if you enjoy it. This applies both for warband and With fire and Sword.Factions in WF&S are Polish Commonweatlh (with their extraordinary cavalery), Kingdoms of Sweden and Russia, Cossacs and Tatars. Each faction has it's strong and weak sides, as well as it's unique units. Speaking of units, i have to say that I'm  disappointed. not by the numbers - there are plenty of them, but upgrades.... most of the units can only be upgraded to veteran/elite status. Even village recruits can be upgraded maximally to Mercenary status. Which means - obtaining unique faction units is really hard.A word about equipment. Crossbows were removed, instead, you get muskets and pistols. Pretty good and deadly weapons, if you know how to use them. Of course, they need bullets. Luckily, they refill after each battle. Weird enough, granades (yep, there are explosives. Quite powerfull, yet, quite pricy) don't refill. So if you buy pack of 3, use one - next battle you'll have 2. Quite annoying, isn't it? To sum up, if you enjoyed Warband, but got a bit bored with Swandians and other Nords, and want to try something new, but not THAT new, try WF&S.P.S: Just realised that it's just like Napoleonic wars, if it were abit more to the east, and contained single-player			"

You can make custom battles, campaign, multiplayer and have much fun killing men with different types of weapons (sabers, bows, muskets, something like the fist grenade ever, spears, broadswords, swords...). In campaign you can hire men and conquer the map killing your enemies (almost eveyone) earn money and honor and become the mightiest faction in the game! I highly recommend this game!			"

												Ever sense I had the pleasure of getting M&B warband ive been a huge huge huge fan of the series. Clocking in nearly 100 hours in almost no time it was easy to get lost into this medival world. Generally text bases rpg's would steer me away but not the m&b series. The combat is just sooo perfect easy to learn and soooo difficult to master. Multiplayer is tense and rewarding as you see yourself climb the leaderboards the more you play. The story mode is amazing allowing you to make a character and a story completely your own. It is difficult for new players but if you press on you will not be dissapointed. You can literally be and do anything you want. Wanna be a trader of goods make profit by selling various goods from food to silk. Maybe join a faction and pledge your allegiance to it. Do you wanna say ♥♥♥♥ that and start your own empire from the ground up to take over the entire continent. YOU CAN! its an amazing game and the new guns add another layer of difficulty and tension this is a must own so if you dont own a M&B game GET ONE DAMNIT. 10/10 who needs a life anyway when you can start your medival empire.

												Very good game but only if you're into this type of games. It's cheap♥♥♥♥♥hell both on sale and off sale, right now it's like $1,24 which is a focking joke, even soda pop costs more than this gem. And I'd tell you that it is defintely worth even $20. But enough about it's value. Game has a lot of content as for such game, entertainment is almost endless, for example I've never finished any of main quests but still enjoyed it tremendously. I spend few hundred hours (off Steam) with this and never got bored. I would recommend it especially for people that aren't familiar with XVth, XVIth and XVIIth century Poland, Ukraine, Russia and Crimea - it's a great way to learn more about our culture and history. It might somehow clarify, for not acknowledged, why Crimean Crisis occured, what's going on in the Ukraine and why are these countries so important in present day world.Graphics - even though I've taken under consideration the fact that is outdated, it still sucked for its times: 4/10 (doesn't matter much if you enjoy the game itself)Music - stays in the climate of those times and those places: 9/10Content - enough for such game: 7/10Gameplay - many times I've had batter things to do (like study to not be a ♥♥♥♥ing failure) but I rather played F&S: 9/10 [disclaimer: difficult to stop playing once you get into it] Dude just focking play it, it's 1.24 for focks sake			"

												Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword is an excelent medeval RPG with a hint of strategy. You can create your character and name him/her like in any other RPG but you can also create your own story and your story will affect the stats of your character. During your adventure you can hire mercenaries in bars capture prisoners and create an army. Your army can also be upgraded so then you can get the best troops possibile on the battlefield. You can also siege castels if you are good with maniging your army. I personally give this game a 9.5/10the graphics are a bit outdated but the rest of the game functions perfectly			"

												A good Mount and Blade game, this one is set in the mid 1600s and there are a lot of firearms and different weapons than warband. In this game you will be finding party casualties a lot higher than in Waband, because a lot of firearms are a one hit kill.Slightly suffering from repetitive gameplay and not very many people playing it, but is still a solid game.8/10			"

												Warband with Muskets.Set during a tumultous time in European history. Centered in modern day Poland and surrounds, Fire & Sword does an excellent job in recreating many of the armours and troops of the time.The faction quest lines are a nice addition that set it apart from Warbands purely sandbox mode.It is pretty much just more Mount & Blade, but that is always a good thing.

												ONCE AGAIN INTO THE BREACH GENERAL!!! CAN YOU NOT SEE THE ENEMY FALTERING??? THIS IS OUR FIGHT TO WIN!!!DO YOU NOT HEAR ME GENERAL??? I SAID CHARGE!!!We have fought and bled for this chance and you would sit it out? What of your brothers and sisters who lie dying and screaming for aid or even a swift death, crying for their mothers as they lose control of their bodies. Is this how you would honour them, with cowardice?You make me sick. What is that you ask? Why don't I charge with you? How dare you? Is it not I who has the more courageous task. Do not let the wine, food and this tent fool you. It is to dull my rage for I fear without it I would be first into the breach, and that would be the end of us all, for if I were to meet my end in such a glorious charge many, many innocents would suffer for it. I am but one man but I must carry this huge burden alone. Now order your men to CHARGE!!!

												Despite what people may say.. I personally think it's really good. Some of the Pros is that they have firearms. Outfits look really nice, HUGE map, and have a few story modes you can partake in (I believe it's Sweden, Russia, Commonwealth, and Crimea). Plus you can actually feel like you're in a line and if you know the commands.. Can win a battle in a single volley. Just as Carolus Rex, I was outnumbed in this battle against Russians. -4 Battle advantage. Didn't look promising for me. But I had a strong musket infantry line. And as Cavalry charged, most went down. And then the infantry came. Took out a large portion of them in two volleys. Now there is cons.. You can't create your own kingdom. Apparently the economics are bad(I haven't noticed, looks the same to me), can't recruit from villages(as far as I can tell), the huge map makes you look like an ant. So if you zoom out, you're gonna lose yourself. Or where you're trying to find. Though overall, I love the game. Very fun and unlike the Custom Battles for Napoleonic Wars of M&B, the AI can actually shoot their guns. The rating I give is Recommend and a 7/10. I think they could've done more to Fire and Sword. But it's still a good game. Don't buy into the negative ""The economy is ♥♥♥♥♥♥"" or ""Glitches everywhere"". Because I haven't found a single glitch yet. Or at least one I haven't noticed.EDIT - After playing for WAY more, I'll edit the review some more. The Story modes are The Polish Commonwealth, Russia, and The Cossaks. And you can technically ""own"" a kingdom. You just can't name it, or be for one paticular side. The fief you capture will be called the land you took it from with ""Rebels"" at the end. (For example, if you conquered Warsaw, it would be ""The Polish Commonwealth(Rebels)"". Though, unfortunately, you can't do anything with it besides own having it for yourself. Regardless, it's still very fun.			"

												Beware, this game is shockingly addictive! What starts as a simple, open world RPG with no clear goals or aims turns into a personalized intricate story. My character started as a simple merchant of the Cossacks and soon became a powerful political figure with an impressive army, though with the main goal of ensuring the nation's survival through peace. This game is more historical than the others, though only loosely,  and more visually detailed. The combat system is also better than the others as are much of the other aspects of the game: trading, questing, commanding, etc. The setting of this game is also more advanced, 1700's ish as there are wheellock and matchlock firearms. This game and the other Mount and Blade games are very noteworthy and worth buying on a good sale.			"

												It's a Mount and Blade game. Need I saw more? This entire series is a masterpiece. Great story, amazing gameplay, easy to learn - hard to master. Almost everything in this game is perfect. I prefer the 1600s setting over Napoleonic Wars. But like other great games - it's only good because the positives overlay the negatives. By god, there's a lot of them.- Crashes: The game crashes often. It's not really a graphics issue, it happens when interacting with an NPC. Even still, without crashing, clicking dialouge options often drops FPS waay low.- Hit Detection: Guns are the main selling point of this game. And they suck. More often than not, bullets go straight through enemies. Trying to hit anything below the abdomen is a surefire miss.- Siege: Sieges 'glitch"" out a lot. Once you've pushed pass the wall, you head down to engage the enemy... and there's an invisible wall! The AI just sits back behind this wall - none of your soldiers can hit them, they don't charge, and you can only use what's left of bullets/arrows to take them out. Then retreat, loose morale and have your soldiers suck even more.- AI: They can be stupid sometimes. AI is hard to program - I don't blame 'em.- Music: The music is buggy as hell and likes to-o r-r-r-re-n-n-ot-t-tesic-c-ch is an-n-n-nin-ng as h-e-e-e-ell. (to repeat notes which is annoying as hell)Don't let these cons fool you - this game is amazing. However, some players may get annoyed by these glitches, so be cautious			"

												Honestly, this is my favorite game and in WFAS it just gets better. Not Only are you getting a hands on experience about a certain period in time, but you also get to make your own character, build you own army however you please, and become a lord of your own nation. If that doesn't suit you, you can become in kind to a bandit and raid ""innocent"" villages and reap to rewards. Or you may wish to be a merchant, learn the arts of trade, what sells for good where and how to make money quick. Feeling lonely playing by yourself? You can play online with friends and pplay through different scenarios. Ever wanted to besiege a castle, or fight alongside up to 200 men? you ccan do all that here in a quick battle, too. The point is, this game is great in most fields and live up to more than its expectations. Mount & Blade in general is a great series and WFAS keeps the trend goiing. 10/10. Besides graphics, I believe this is one of the best games and you will not be dissapointed by getting it. GG no re. Hope to see you online soon!			"

You can play online with friends and pplay through different scenarios. Ever wanted to besiege a castle, or fight alongside up to 200 men? you ccan do all that here in a quick battle, too. The point is, this game is great in most fields and live up to more than its expectations. Mount & Blade in general is a great series and WFAS keeps the trend goiing. 10/10. Besides graphics, I believe this is one of the best games and you will not be dissapointed by getting it. GG no re. Hope to see you online soon!			"

												Pros: Poland.        Sweden.        Mount and Blade.        Interesting campaign/storyline and weapon/armour selection.Cons: Very weird interface-backround colour when compared to it's predecessors', and this annoys me greatly.         Guns are a bit too OP.          No options to select your backround, like M&B and M&B:Warband had.         Dull gameplay when not in battle.Overall I must give it 8/10. While it's a pretty bad game compared to those before it, it is alright as a standalone.I did not rate it as standalone though, if I did it would achieve an 11/10. The fact that Poland was in the game made it very amazing.PolandPolandPolandPolandYou know you love Poland...			"

												Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword is a game many fans don't view in a positive light, and while I cant say exactly why, I can make a few guesses. The biggest to me is probably the introduction of firearms into Mount and Blade, its pretty powerful. early on, and I myself never had any problems just riding into huge battles alone on horseback just to shot dead most enemies before finishing off any stragglers. That being said I feel like it is also missing some of the broader features of Warband, thus losing some of the variation in gameplay. I have not spent as much time with the game, on or off Steam as I have with the other two Mount and Blade games so I don't have as much experience with Mount and Blade with Fire and Sword. That being said, I myself Still really like the game and recommend Mount and Blade fans try it.			"

Russian Tsar Vasily IV Shuysky gave tribute to Polish King Zygmunt III Waza.(1611) A lot of historical thread in one game. MAKE POLAND GREAT AGAIN!~Enjoy 8/10.  "

												The game is so good, I literaly bought it again on Steam, only so I can give it a positive review. With Fire and Sword is a standalone thrid party created Expansion to the Mount & Blade. It put's the game into the real 17th century Europe, and does provide player with an optional story mode, and tons and tons of new features and usage eases. After you get used to playing with Fire and Sword, the Warband itself will just feel empty, and limited. The game however requires a bit of mindset changing if you are a Warband fan already, since 17th century armies were marginally different from the villager raised armies of Calradia. The multiplayer game also provides players with slightly altered combat system (Difference can be felt only by the very dedicated players), that is the matter of taste. I persoanlly like the way combat works in Wfas more than WB, but I do understand that some people my like the feel of WB more than Wfas. Generally the game is worth your money, especially now that it is on sale. I have spent more than  1000 hours in the game over the last 4 years I have it. (Some of the features that were added to this game : - Optional Story lines- More siege possibilites- Better siege AI navigation- Training soldiers in castles and towns- A LOT of new buildings to build in your towns- Buildings now also require hiring people to operate them- Being able to choose equipment for some of your troops- Ability to talk with Guild master / Village chief without finding them in city- Building provisoric defenses to help you on field batte (wagon fort)and many, many other minor changes like loaning money, sending NPC's to academies, tavern brawls, sending merchant caravans etc.)The game however does not feature : - Marriages- Tournaments- Training camps (They serve different purpose now)			"

												I kinda liked this before I found a mod for Warband that's like this 'game', except 10 times better, with new animations, far better weapon noises, more accurate clothing, balanced-out calvary (kinda), seperate pistol/musket ammo types (Realism) a bigger map, more factions, naval-related stuff, and more that I still haven't found yet. Oh, there's also 12-pounder cannons.Villages don't have trained soldiers in the mod, despite the fact that 'Fire & Sword' does. Seriously, you're fighting a VILLAGE! Villages tend to not contain 50+ soldiers. With Muskets.The mod's called L'Aigle, and despite being in Alpha, Warband didn't crash at all for the entire day, compared to Google Chrome's whopping 5 times from simply right-clicking. :^)Don't waste your cash on this, just buy Warband if you haven't already and check out the full-conversion mods.

												Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword It is a good game and i recommend this for all. My computer is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥and i can run this amazing game really smoothly and my computer isnt even a gaming computer anyways.heres the good about this game: the fighting in this game is really good and it is really fun to play with friends to have a good laugh with and team up agains other players you can customize your character Male/Female and make them look how ever you would like. There are a couple of game modes you can play like survival, Teamdeath match, Deathmatch and so on. Theres even a campaign so if you dont feel like playing with other players you can go on there or in private match to play by your self.The bad: The shooting in this game is kind of hard you have to aim in a certain area to shoot someone in the head, leg, chest etc. if you are on a horse and your weapon is a  spear or sword you have to aim in a certain way as well to kill them easy. If you are on foot and about to fight someone and they have a sword and you have a spear it is hard to attack back because the sword is quicker than the spear AND YES there is weight heavy armor with a broad sword or a heavy pike you will run slow and if your getting attacked and trying to run put away your weapon and run.BUT all in all ithis is a great game i highly recommend it hope this helped :)			"

												I have to say, I have only played the same old games all the time. Never wanted to venture away from my comfort zone. But this game kinda just grabbed my attention. Yes the grapics are old but the game play is fantastic. Only problem is, if you have no ranged or cav and you are vs cav, prepare to be kited and destroyed i did 1v20 at level 1. They enemy had no ranged weapons so I just rode my horse around in a circle poping off pistol rounds until people would route. I would go after then slice them and repeat. Though when you get into big battles you better know how to issuse to correct commands If not it will cost you the game I say 9/10.			"

												A very different game from the previous Mount & Blade games.  Some changes not so good.  But the biggest good, or interesting change at least, is the addition of firearms.  It really changes how combat works, especially early on it can be quite difficult.  It definitely provides a new experience and I think it is worth trying.  Really changes the combat.  I think in terms of whether that change is good or not, will differ greatly from person to person.  If I had to choose my top Mount & Blade game it would be Warband.  This one has removed the arenas and tournaments from the game, which I think they should have kept.  However this is still a fun game, and the other changes make it worth trying out.			"

												I'm still adamant this game will be awesome, so don't pass judgement just yet. They do a lot of bugfixing in this game, they just have a bit of a slow development cycle. They still need to fix achievements, as they don't appear.The game strikes me more as a 'P2P Mod' than a typical expansion. It also appears to compound the problems of the last game, namly starting out, since 7 bandits with guns are much more likely to take out the lone wanderer than 7 bandits in previous games. However, all the open-endedness is still there, now in some kind of maybe Russian land but now with added featuers like banks and most importantly: guns. For all you people who read the last review and needed guns, but were too stupid to figure out how to install a mod: get this. If you like Mount&Blade and can deal with the above problems: get this. If you havn't really tried the series and want to play: go get Warband. Bugs, guns, fun.			"

												Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword is just not as good as Warband but will still have you playing for hours when you get into it.WFaS made by a polish company (as far as i can remember) set in the 15th to 17th century adds guns to madness that is 'MaB' but personally i still prefer the Swords and combat rather than ranged weapons.The map personally is not great but it is only a map, everything else is just the same as it was in Warband. Just a storyline to go with the action, new factions based on true history and plenty of men to boot.This Warband focuses less on allowing you to create your own faction and more or less forces you to become a Vassal. Again nothing wrong with that, it's just very unrewarding claiming your own kingdom so i tend to avoid it.Overall, everything is the same you just may not like it as much but it is still woth the money easily and the online also remains with guns helping increase the diversity of troops.I grant this a solid 8.8/10			"

												I recommend this as it is very fun to play and you can do a lot of stuff on it. Mount & Blade games are good because they are different to other games. Although some people might find it boring, I think you can spend a long time on it because there is singleplayer and multiplayer. Obviously people will mostly go on multiplayer, multiplayer is more challenging than singleplayer.Fire & Sword is also quite realistic because in some games you can shoot people in the head and they don't die, but with this game they will die if shot with a gun or bow in the head. I would rate 9.5/10 because of the sheer lack of graphics, but that dosen't really interfere with gameplay.			"

												Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword is a great expansion to the classic Warband game. Not only does it add guns, but a whole new map and story too. New mechanics and crisp gameplay make this another well done experience. Must buy for Warband fans.			"

Because there are no Khergits so no more getting mad and banging your head against a wall then having to go to the hospital because you had a head injury and when you go back home you look at the crater and your like ""Oh i remeber that time thats the time when i banged my head against the wall because of stupid Khergits.""

												 with fire and sword is a great game with awesome game play but theres still a lot of room for improvement so far as i played the game i've seen there's not a lot of choice to weaponry or armour but i found some armour i like just fine, but back to weaponry so far i've only seen 2 different kinds of bullets and when bullets are damage they say its bent when it should say its crack, but to other more important things gunmen are not as effective as they should be as i seen so far it seems they don't shot very straight or the guns need more damage. but there are lots of good things added too like i think the mercenary camps are perfect just the way they are but over all i hope to see improvement in updates i have to give mount and blade with fire and sword a 8/10			"

												Wieder ein sehr gutes Spiel von Mount & Blade, an Warband kommt es allerdings nicht heran. Die Einzelspielerparts sind teilweise zu schwer geworden und die hohe Durchschlagskraft der Feuerwaffen macht es nicht unbedingt leichter. Zudem ist es am Anfang etwas unklar wie und wo überall Soldaten rekrutiert werden können. Am groben Spielprinzip hat sich erfreulicherweise jedoch nicht viel geändert, so das man sich schnell in das Spiel reinfindet wenn man einen der anderen Teile schon gespielt hat. Was jedoch in Fire & Sword besser geworden ist, ist die Übersetzung. Zwar ist diese immer nocht nicht perfekt aber schon wesentlich umfangreicher und treffender als in Warband.			"

												I recommend this as it is very fun to play and you can do a lot of stuff on it. Mount & Blade games are good because they are different to other games. Although some people might find it boring, I think you can spend a long time on it because there is singleplayer and multiplayer. Obviously people will mostly go on multiplayer, multiplayer is more challenging than singleplayer.Fire & Sword is also quite realistic because in some games you can shoot people in the head and they don't die, but with this game they will die if shot with a gun or bow in the head. I would rate 9.5/10 because of the sheer lack of graphics, but that dosen't really interfere with gameplay.			"

												Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword It is a good game and i recommend this for all. My computer is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥and i can run this amazing game really smoothly and my computer isnt even a gaming computer anyways.heres the good about this game: the fighting in this game is really good and it is really fun to play with friends to have a good laugh with and team up agains other players you can customize your character Male/Female and make them look how ever you would like. There are a couple of game modes you can play like survival, Teamdeath match, Deathmatch and so on. Theres even a campaign so if you dont feel like playing with other players you can go on there or in private match to play by your self.The bad: The shooting in this game is kind of hard you have to aim in a certain area to shoot someone in the head, leg, chest etc. if you are on a horse and your weapon is a  spear or sword you have to aim in a certain way as well to kill them easy. If you are on foot and about to fight someone and they have a sword and you have a spear it is hard to attack back because the sword is quicker than the spear AND YES there is weight heavy armor with a broad sword or a heavy pike you will run slow and if your getting attacked and trying to run put away your weapon and run.BUT all in all ithis is a great game i highly recommend it hope this helped :)			"

												Want a somewhat realistic story on medieval times? Well... this game won't exactly provide that. Ultimately, it is fun to play but they took out the concept that if you're a woman, you have a harder time. This takes out a part of the series and it is a let down since people enjoyed this concept. I feel like people got mad and they let these people have their way and took it out. Mostly, the game is fun. I enjoy using the guns in the game and they seem overpowered but the reloading is a downfall to it. Like the crossbow. Better than the bow, but you sacrafice some reload time. If you enjoyed the concept of women having a harsher time in Warband and it's something that you saw as something to benefit to your replay value and having mods in the Steam Workshop, well, I don't recommend the game. If you are a huge fan of Mount & Blade either way, then I do see this as a game for you.			"

												While not being as good as the main series, WFaS does feature something akin to a story quest experience for three of the major factions, which was a novelty upon release and as of yet, still is. If you like musket warfare and didn't particularly like napoleonic warfare due to too much ranged combat, this might definitely for you, bringing a good mix and a extremely large variety of units.

												154 hours clocked on this game and now i am finally ready to tell my verdict - Stay away. Game is awesome but the end game is not working well even by M&B standards. No patches coming so it's basicaly just a broken heap. There is no way to reach any kind of satisfactory end game state with this game. Sandbox or not.  Get Warband or even the first one if you must. Or wait for the sequel.			"

												If you're like me, you asked a friend if there's any good games with musketeers in it, and came here. Then I watched the video, and became somewhat uninterested in the game because I have no interest in the Northern Middle East and the Northeastern-most part of Europe. But the game was on sale for cheap, so I went ""What the heck"" and jumped in anyway. I instantly fell in love with the game and all the features I saw off the bat. Even though I kept getting murdered by bandits and ended up restarting my playthrough about 7 times in my first hour, then figured out there was such thing as difficulty settings, I still loved it because the fighting mechanics of the Mount & Blade engine are SO much better with guns. If you ask me, Warband has NOTHING on this game. It's odd to me how the majority of Mount & Blade players will tell you Warband is the best, but it feels so plain after playing this game. You can choose one of 5 factions -- Muscovite Tsardom (Russian), Cossack Hetmanate (Ukrainian), Crimean Khanate (Ottoman), Polish Commonwealth (Polish, obviously) or my personal favorite, the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish, also obviously). You can also start your own faction and get obliterated in two days. The game has a variety of items ranging from basket-hilted swords to rapiers to complex-hilted broadswords to double-barrelled Dutch pistols. There's also tons of armors, weird hats, and my favorite, Comb Morions. Specialty items that are of top quality and are always exotic or technologically advanced can be ordered from masters of the craft in a town center. These items are often imported from the Dutch or the Turks who don't exist as factions in the game, but it just takes 2 in-game weeks to get your order. Overall I had a lot of fun playing this game, and I think it has tons of replayibility. My suggestions:- Get a hussar lance- Get a breastplate and a morion, which you can get from Karllsson and Victor de Buscudor relatively early in the game, and hiring them is still cheaper than buying the items without them (just ask to see their equipment when you hire them)- Just use whatever firearm you can get in an easy bandit battle or somethin'. Save your money.- Buy troops. Aim for 60-80 in the start and work your way up to a 200-strong army. In the beginning, get some cheap mercenaries who you can upgrade over time, and later order specialized faction-based forces from a town's commander in the town center (note: you need to wait 3-5 days for the men to be trained and ready before you can pick them up)- Do quests and serve a faction leader as a lord so you can start collecting taxes as well as getting weekly payment for military campaigning. You're gonna have to do a ton of quests for a ton of DIFFERENT people from that faction first, though.- Save up for the double-barrelled Dutch pistol, maybe a half-decent sword, and you're set for life. From there you can pillage and defeat your foes as you please, and there'll still be PLENTY to do...That's all the stuff I wish I would've known when I started. But feel free to discover that on your own.			"

So does Warband with modifications and lets be honest Warband is a lot more fun and most mods and a lot more stuff such as weapons, armor, and factions. So I would say pick warband... This game is great fun but just cannot compare to warband...  So in all Warband is better in my opinion but this game does add some nice features and I still have to recommend it.			"

Firearms have been introduced to the battlefield, opening up exciting new play styles and options. Players can also utilize explosives for taking out groups of foes or to breach castle walls. In addition to the enhanced singleplayer mode, With Fire and Sword also provides a host of original multiplayer content including the new Captain Mode which allows players to control their own forces in online matches.

												Main questline is somewhat lazy and kind of disappears. Game has less content than some free community made mods yet costs 10 dollars for some reason. The Eagle and the Radiant Cross or it's submod have probably the same amount or more of content and is completely free. There's also a wide variety of mods that go above and beyond like Gekokujo, Floris, Pendor, Brytenwalda, Anno Domini, and much more yet this expansion doesn't really seem to bring anything to the table like the other two expansions. Very uninteresting map, lacks detail and makes the eastern european theme very drab. All in all not really worth buying imo. Napoleonic Wars and Viking Conquest are far superior expansions while this just feels like a community mod. If it was made by a fan I'd give it a 8/10, but since its made by taleworlds and charges money, more like a 5/10 in my opinion.			"

												Notably better than vanilla Warband, but this game suffers from one great big insurmountable flaw: It is made entirely redundant by Warband Workshop mods. If you own warband, download a total conversion mod from the Steam Workshop (Perisino is my personal favourite). BOOM! Instant Mount and Blade game, and its free. If this had Steam Workshop support, it would no doubt have an excelent modding community of its own, but without it, there is really no reason to buy this game. Let this be a lesson TaleWorlds! The new game had better have workshop support if you want it to replace warband.			"

												all u do in this game is get charged by bandits every three steps i take! What is this im trying to finish my quest! you stopped me like three minutes ago! And guess what else since im at the beginning, my army is small and is murdered with little effort on there part and leaves me defenseless getting spooned by 8 bandits at once. On the bright side as you progress through the story and little by little you become more supierior then these problems dont have much meaning. Also it is a good idea to remember the map as soon as possible it will help you with your quests. This game now features guns now which is a nice upgrade from the previous games in the series. This game gets a 7/10.			"

												If you dont know mount and blade already, it is a realistic medieval simulation role playing sandbox game. At least I just called it that. For those who want to go god of war style, look elsewhere, because you will die in the 3rd second of combat:D It has a steep learning curve and realism can be irritating at times (like getting killed by a blow, or two) if you value realism over mindless hack and slash, I recommend this game. Although the main storyline is quite weak in the game that you barely recognised its existence, there are tons of things to do for those who like to explore. Graphics are not the best, but coming from a small studio, this game is a valuable underdog. "

												Where could I start?  There is nothing wrong with this game.  Living up to the standards I've come to expect from Paradox Interactive, this game is perfection, fine-tuned.Some say that introducing firearms ruined the game, but that isn't true.  It made it different, and people hate change.  Playing through the campaign of this game blasts you with the ideal that indeed, graphics don't need to be perfect to have a completly immersive game. Huge battles that are decently historically accurate (as far as weapons / armors go), and an excellent team-building system make this one of the epics.  A game I ALWAYS come back to.  Living the life of the gun-runner in the medieval era, or any other sort of life for that matter, makes this game great for me.  But you could approach victory however you please.So what are you waiting for?  Buy it. 10/10.			"

												As a fresh face to the Mount & Blade series, and also a fairly seasoned veteran at the Elders Scrolls series, I had *some* difficulty learning this game. Whether is be from the fairly complex battle system, to the robust and dynamic economic system, all the way to just not having my hand held. The reason for me being, initially, overwhelmed, was that there isn't really any direction given to you (so, for all of you players who hate linearity, take a look at this). Essentially, you're thrown into a huge world after you complete the short tutorial, and with only two towns to note, you have no main quest line (at first), no grandiose story (also, at first), nothing. ""Why?"" you may ask. The answer is one that, albeit cliché, is simply because it's up to you.  With literally no bars to take note of, you can: make a living learning all of the best trading items and locations, be sure to spend a ton of money on mercs though; plunder every poor village you see, using the money and supplies to further expand your small band of unruly thieves; play the noble boot-licker, and live a virtuous and honest life as you win further glory for your lord. As the parenthetical phrases have said, the lack of a story is only in the beginning, when you're not a particularly notable character. Though, you could completely ignore that story, and still fully enjoy every aspect of the game.Aside from the story, the combat system is something to take note of. There are speed multipliers that aide or detract from damage done on horseback, range and reach modifiers that take note of how much damage point X on a longsword does compared to point Y or Z, guns that can literally change the tide of any fight (I've been one shot so much while prancing around on my pony...), and fun archery, crossbows, and throwing weapons, all affected by range of the shot, location of impact, and all that nitty gritty stuff. As a side note, it's a fun little challenge (and I use that term loosely) to find a band of 10+ looters, or similarly weak enemies, and fight them by yourself, I've taken grenades into those fights, and run circles around the enemy to herd them, in a sense, and then just toss a grenade ;)The characters are rather lackluster unless you're dealing with specific, named characters, who all have their own sets of morals and values. For an example, a more noble character may leave your party if you're constantly bullying small villages, whereas the more violent-loving characters may shun you from running from a fight - yes, even if it's your 20 man squad of peasants, versus a noble's 100 man squad of elite soldiers. Named characters also have their own skill sets, so finding the proper balance of brain and brawn, or just pure brawn, is all a matter of personal taste and is affected by your long-term goals for a character. The political aspect of each faction and character is something that I find incredibly amusing as well, blindly taking quests from the nobles of Sweden may land you as the enemy against whomever they're currently at war with, thus losing a key trading outpost (I say this from experience, be careful). This game hasn't won any awards for its graphics, they can be buggy, low res, low poly-count, and all of the above at one time. And, speaking of bugs, there can be a lot. Tearing in a lot of terrain, a complete lack of rendering in the overworld, and just flat out moronic AI, the pros outweigh the cons, immensely. Multiplayer is something that I didn't bother with much, but I have dabbled. From what I've played, the classes seem fairly balanced, and the 'kill to coin' system if very reminiscent of CS.In the case of Warband vs With Fire and Sword, I'd have to take WFaS. Overall, the game feels slightly more immersive with the landmass being real geographical locations, cheaper costs for mercenaries (which actually did take away a lot of frustration from a lot of my merchant characters), and guns. Guns are incredibly amusing to play with since the game takes place in the period of time when gunpowder just began to be utilized for firearms and explosives. There's also some quality of life improvements with the guildmaster from warband being replaced by the mayor, who's accessible from a town menu, there are also more towns you can actually visit, rather than large amounts of fortresses that only house nobles. Sadly, though, I have yet to see tournaments in any of the towns, and that was a major point of fun for a lot of my playthroughs. All in all, a fantastic game, with a lot more than you could hope for. Don't judge a game by its graphics: 9/10			"

												Personal rating: 4/10replayability: N/ABudget: Don't bother. Get warband instead. Lenght: InfinateNote: Below is my review from warband. Imagine that it's basically like Warband, but not as good. Which isn't saying much to begin with! This title simply takes away the few features that made warband addictive and entertaining. While definately entertaining, this game feels like it was never fully developed and was released in it's beta, or even alpha state. It presents a weird mix of game types, from RPG like conversations via dialogue options to Heroes of Might and Magic style overland map travelling to open combat in third person, like in Oblivion. While this may sound great, and is infact entertaning (for a while), the game is lacking in so many departments that it's almost embarrasing. It could have been so much, but unfortunately, this is what we get. The worst about this game, is, that it's unwinnable. There is no purpose in the game, so it's just a sandbox freeroam game with randomly generated missions and encounters. That get's old quickly.While not a true paradox game, I can see why paradox published it. There are some similar elements. This game is extremely addicting and can feel overwhelming at times, which is what hooks the player. The potential of going from lowly peasant to ruler of an empire and the danger of losing it all even at that point. There is so much unused potential in this game. A new title is coming out soon, a ""sequel"" of sorts, I recommend waiting for that.			"

												Hi and Welcome to another one of those Reviews- Let's Start! Get your pocporn cus we gonna be here for a while ^.^````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````-Basic Introduction-This game is set in the years of ol' 1600's. Weapons of that era were captured partially. Armour is set good,Nice set of melee weapons and also ranged- muskets and bows, pistols and grenades.````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````-Multiplayer-*Drawbacks*There are no clans/regiments or not that any time I come on it I see them. I bought this game to play in a clan and I really was disappointed when there wasn't any multiplayer :(There is that *lag* fire ( Firing when you do not release your mouse button to fire your ranged +++*Good things*Alot of players tend to play Captain Co-op.

												Buggy. unpolished, glitchy.Game doesnt flow like warband does, inexplicably they have removed all the useful features of warband? cannot ask logical questions of NPC. in warband you can say ""where is king♥♥♥♥♥♥"" and the NPC will tell you where he is near and where he is going.in this stupid version you cant talk to women anymore about that, and the men only tell you ""He is on his way"" A useless piece of information.The colors are all wrong, gamma is terrible and generally I am let down.

I mean its still a Mount and Blade game so I still enjoy it but just theres always that damper on it. BUT this game has features I wish were in other Mount and Blade games base, like the Caravan Feature that is probably the most beautiful way to earn money in this game, also the factions are a really good touch.            All in all its a 6/10 its playable and still able to sink 100+ ours into it if you enjoy the gunplay and etc.			"

 How I played this game: (difficulty)	 1. 	 Setting the difficulty to easy. (WTF too easy?) 2.	 Setting the difficulty to normal. (Yep it's like I'm playing the normal mount & blade version it's  still easy) 3.	 Setting the difficulty to hard. (OMFG! THIS IS SO UNFAAAIIRRRR THIS GAME SUCKS! LOOK AT THAT STARTING GAME ALREADY LOSING F*CK! I'M GONNA UNINSTALL THIS SH*T!! F*CK!!!!!!!!) How the gameplay works: (easy, normal, hard)    1. 	 Always comes with the tutorial when you started a new game. (even tho there's a tutorial in the main menu) 2.	 Starting quest [bandit problem, tax problem, AND F*CKING SALT! (SALT IS VERY HARD TO FIND)] the elder will give you a quest which you will spend 13 days in the game!!! THAT ONE IS TO FIND 3 BAGS/SACKS OF SALT!!! 3.	 The most exciting part is, when your enemies have a gun DON'T CHARGE ALONE! Because when they start to shoot you at the same time you'll die! Uhm I mean knocked unconcious. (TRUE STORY! DON'T CHARGE ALONE!) 4.	 When the lord asks you to collect his tax and accept it you'll not face him ever again. Tips & Tricks:	 1. 	 If you want to defeat the Kingdom before you do it take some ""collecting taxes"" to the lords because after that you'll not find him/her anywhere! 2. 	 Want the game more easier? Well I got a 1 good tip for you -->  ENABLE YOUR CHEATS!	 "

												Для бОльшей аутентичности очень советую поставить WFaS Enhanced mod, игра без него смотрится далеко не так аутентично. Хотя сама по себе она целиком оправдала возложенные на серию надежды: Графика лучше, геймплей бодрее, система взаимоотношений НПС и персонажа теперь нечто большее, чем то убожество, что было в первом M&B. Я очень удивлён что игра стоит дешевле других частей, но это уже причуды разработчиков. Поскольку эта игра может считаться одной из фундаментальных творений игровой индустрии на то время, ставлю ей 9/10, да и то лишь за изредка встречающиеся баги, связанные с текстурами.			"

												I loved M&B: Warband and really liked With fire and sword when I started it, as someone that likes to create my own adventure and has a lot of Warband I didn't read guides, just started playing. I started to make my fortune by trading, got up to almost 500,000 thalers, good gear, all the needed companions and a good core army when I wanted to start joining factions for the combat experience and found out I can't, somewhere along the way I randomly started a ""main quest"" of a faction I don't even like which cannot be canceled and forbids me from joining any faction or taking up any merc work, more than 10 hours of trading and building wasted... With fire and sword has a interesting concept however due to bad optimization, bugged quests and randomly denying parts  of the game I can't recommend it, if you want the M&B create your own adventure experience just stick with Warband...

												This Mount & Blade was poorly done.  It just doesn't compare to its predecessors.To start off, I'd like to say that Fire & Sword has an incredible problem with experience points and leveling, and on top of that, if you want to level up, you've got to kill countless people with firearms- It doesn't matter what armor you wear, damage taken can be as low as 16 points in heavy armor to a full 60 with none.  You get shot in this game, your fun is over.  The big problem there is that firearms are actually quite common to everyone except you...  Want a good one?  Be prepared to spend $2000 or more.  In addition to that, when you're actually trying to ""aim"", be prepared for ridiculous misses, while the enemy seems to have no trouble hitting you from halfway across the map.Aside from the experience points problem and the stacked cards against you in the gun-crazed Eastern European atmosphere, the balance for the game feels a bit off, and nothing is as ""pretty"" here as Warband.  The map is overall darker, the bandits seem less regional as they are in Warband, and the game feels less alive than Warband.  My biggest problem with it?  It just isn't worth it when an infuriating mistake occurs.  Ride by a reloading musketman, put the reticle over him, miss about 2 paces from him, and get shot in the back as you're riding away...  When you finally *DO* kill him, you get 30 experience points.  Yay you.  23 more to go before you'll level up!Mistakes like these show how little thought and reception was given to community concerns.  It's a dumbed down model, and I've been pushed away by the ridiculous level-up problems.In addition to these slated issues, another problem is in regard to armor.  Armor is completely unbalanced, and much of the decent equipment is ridiculously overpriced.  There seems to have been no thought put into balancing the economy in that regard, which makes it nigh-impossible to outfit yourself to survive a few bullets.  So how do you deal with these gun crazy fools when your armor- and that which you manage to buy- barely protects you?  Spend about 20 minutes circling 13 Brigands until they run out of ammo, and you'll see my point.This M&B is a definite Thumbs Down.  It just wasn't well-thought-out, and I don't think development was very receptive to the community on its issues, and there are many.			"

												TL DR version:Buy if you like:70 musketeers firing their guns all at onceAvoid if you dislike:Buggy questsNo right to rule systemLack in variety of weaponsLong Version:I've played Mount and Blade Warband with Floris Mod and before.The only epic thing in Fire and Sword is the ALL FIRE NOW command you give to all your musket-holding soldiers and watching the enemies fall as your volleys pierces through every armor in the game.Other than that, the game and current mods don't allow you to be a ruler (no right to rule system like in warband), the soldiers can only be upgraded into a better version of themselves, unlike in warband where a simple militia can be upgraded into a pikeman, a crossbowman, a horse archer, a lancer or throwing axeman. The weapons choice in this game is very poor as well and lack in variety. There's only four ranged weapons - Pistol, Carbine, Musket and Bow, where Musket is the only ranged powder weapon that can't be used on horseback. The melee weapons lack the cosmetic appeal they need.Oh, and many of the quests are bugged as well to the point that you will have to consult a walkthrough in order to avoid the bugs. There is also a lack of ways to increase your renown in the game where there are only small groups of bandits and you'll be forced to fight the lords of one nation if you want to increase your renown faster than escorting caravans to towns and picking off small bands of bandits.

												i have an amazing recipe for APPLE PIE 1 3/4 cups (260g) plain flour1/2 cup (75g) self-raising flour185g unsalted butter, chilled, cut into small pieces1/3 cup (75g) caster sugar2 eggs1 tablespoon milkDemerara or caster sugar, to sprinkleFILLING 8 large Granny Smith applesJuice of 1 lemon45g unsalted butter1/2 cup (110g) caster sugar1 teaspoon ground cinnamon1/4 teaspoon ground clovesstep 1Sift flours and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl. Add butter and rub lightly into flour with your fingertips. Lift mixture high above the bowl as you rub, to incorporate air into the pastry and make it lighter. Continue until mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs, then stir through sugar. Lightly beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon chilled water, then drizzle over flour mixture. Start to bring the dough together by cutting the liquid into the dough with a blunt knife, then form into a smooth ball with your hands, adding a little more water if necessary. Divide dough into two pieces, one slightly larger than the other. Wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for 30 minutes.Step 2To make the filling, peel and core the apples, and cut each into 8 pieces. Toss immediately with lemon juice in a large bowl, to prevent apples from discolouring. Place the butter and sugar in a large frypan over medium-low heat. When butter has melted, add apples and spices, then stir to coat. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until apples have softened. Set aside to cool.Step 3Roll out the larger pastry ball on a floured workbench to a 30cm circle (about 2mm thick). Roll pastry around rolling pin, then unroll over a 22cm metal pie dish. Gently press into corners and allow excess to overhang. Place filling in base with a slotted spoon. Roll the small pastry piece to a 25cm circle. Beat remaining egg with milk, brushing some on rim of the base. Top with small pastry.Step 4Lift the pie dish and cut excess pastry from edges with a sharp knife. Crimp edges of pastry together with your fingers. Chill for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 180°C, place pie dish on a baking tray. Brush top of pie with more beaten egg, sprinkle with demerara or caster sugar. Cut four small air vents in the centre of the pie and bake for 45 minutes or until golden brown.			"

												a quick quote from a friend that loves Mount and Blade: Warband. "" Mount and Blade with Fire and Sword is ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥as ♥♥♥♥"". He's not right but he's not wrong either.  Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword tries to take a risky step of adding guns to a mostly medieval franchise, it succeeds in some ways, but it is a terrible attempt in another way. Napoleonic Wars did a much better job doing this and it costs the same.  Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword is a downgrade of Warband in the aspect that Mount and Blade's best part was it's fantastic medieval environments and amazing gameplay which is what sparked and rose Warband to fame. With Fire and Sword throws it all to the garbage and takes away the Medieval tag by adding GUNS! I say spend your money on Napoleonic Wars, because that game is money well spent with its endless gameplay and possibilities. They spent more time into a DLC then a Standalone Expansion because  Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword has next to nothing new to add to the series other then a game with guns but the sad truth is, Napoleonic Wars does it better. Recommended on Sale and if you are hungry for Mount and Blade, but with MnB:Warband mods, i doubt that will happen.			"

												The game brings you to the renessaince europe's northern territores. The war has begun between Poland and the Khanats.What i think about the game:Even if the graphics aren't the best, and the old BF:BC 2 has better graphics, it looks good enough. The battles you can have, more than 500 troops at the same time on one map. The multiplayer is hard, but if you play enough with the game you can get much better. The single player let's you conquer whole northern europe: Sweden, Poland, Russia, Ukrain...You can follow quests to get strong, but if you want you can also ride to the next camp, buy some troops and run down a village, even a castle. The multiplayer has a lot of maps, and the community makes more and more. And if you're not good in PVP you can also play Co-Op with friends. You can buy 6 men to your side, buy some equipment, and fight the enemy, and survive the waves. The game has so much to offer. I recommend this game, because it's a Mount & Blade game, because it's FUN!			"

If you like Warband a lot, definitely get this during a sale. If the whole pack is on sale, I recommend you play Warband first before trying this expansion.This is not DLC. This is an expansion. It does not add anything to the Warband game world so to speak, you launch this expansions as a separate game.			"

												This is byfar the worst Mount And Blade game, i'd say topping the original by quite a way. Yet it's still one of the best PC games that you can play. Personally, I hated using the muskets, i didn't like the real world relevance, Mount And Blade is all about Calradia, and the people inside. The weaponry felt quite unbalanced, but besides that being (in my opinion) the absolute worst thing, it expanded in every way and made it so much more interesting to play, making the out of battle experience even richer and more enjoyable. It let me experience this type of game in a way i didn't think possible. So if Fire And Sword's out of gameplay experiences were placed with Warband's setting and gameplay, then it would be the actual perfect game.			"

												This game's mechanics are terrible, stick with mount and blade if you donj't want to rage at the game screwing you over (as it does many times).Some examples of this:Sided with Poland, we were doing well until two polish cities (one was Warsaw) mysteriously became Swedish (no siege, no reports of being conquered).King constantly sieges city that is alternately taken by 3 other powers constantly, we lose all of our forces doing so.Forces really want to siege a city in the heart of the enemy's territory on the other side of the map. So they do this, and it causes 1000 problems.Have to do a part of the main quest where nobody from the country knows the location of the guy I have to visit (literally no one, talked to at least 10 people) and I have never seen him once.  So I can't progress in the main quest at all which I need to do.  Amazing.Somehow 150 troops are faster than my army with only food supplies and half cavalry units.  What the hell.Tons of other problems like these can be avoided by playing native/modded Mount and Blade Warband.  Seriously, don't buy this if you value your time at all.  If you want firearms just buy the Napoleonic Wars DLC for Mount and Blade Warband (multiplayer only).			"

												Mount And Blade: With Fire & SwordI remember i had just still only known the M&B series for such little time, yet after playing Warband. I had to keep going and surely With Fire & Sword kept me at the edge of my seat taking up hour by hour as i couldn't be contained from this outstanding expansion to this godlike franchise.A truely amazing experience i've had with this game for only three days.This expansion or stand-alone DLC for Mount And Blade: Warband (Another great piece to buy) is a definite must have for any PC gamer. Taking place in 17th Century Europe, firearms and explosives have now been introduced causing much more of a threat in casualties. As well as five nations ranging from the Polish, Swedes, Ukranian, Russian and Arabian decent are in constant war with each other. Whilst you, a wandering mercenary must find your calling to either work for these factions and conquer all of Eastern Europe. Or manage to raise an army of young recruits and mercenaries to be a lone wolf and conquer all of Europe yourself.There is also a story for the Poles, Ukranians and Russians in case you want to play in a more linear fashion.Other than that, combat still feels fantastic aside from the old 17th century firearms being able to one shot both you and the AI,  but thats just really my only downside to this game.Realistic, fun, and endlessly entertaining. I recommend Mount And Blade: With Fire & Sword to either veterans of the M&B series or maybe those who wish to start off their long and exciting journey into this series. But be advised, if you are a first timer to this series and buy this, just note the start in this game is far more complex than the start in Warband.Yet at the same time, both Warband and With Fire & Sword are honestly worth the cheap price it asks.

												I Love mount and blade warband...but was very disappointed with this ""newer"" version. There is little in regards to troop diversity, very few items to buy/loot. It is essentially Warband with 25% of the items, 25% of the troops and add in a few guns. One of the few times I have regretted buying a game sequel as it has less content and polish. This product would have been acceptable as a free mod...not something I paid for.My advice...buy mount and blade warband...download mods. Best ones I have found are:Floris modPhantasy CalradiaACOK (A clash of Kings)Perisnoand many more...			"

Apparently this is a widespread problem and google searches offered no solutions that actually worked, so for that reason I do not recommend purchasing this game.The guns are a fun addition, and they did some nice improvements in this version (being able to upgrade villages/towns with buildings and leaders), and the quests are fun from what I've been able to do of them between all the crashing. The black mace is a neat item.It still however suffers from a lot of the same issues the original failed with, including the far too intense micro-management babysitting required late-game, where when you conquer most of the map you end up just running around constantly re-taking castles that your own faction cannot defend, or chasing off enemies that just instantly respawn with 100-300 size armies full of top level troops. That part of it really ruins a lot of the fun of the end-game as far as I'm concerned. I should be able to expect my own lords to match up reasonably against enemy lords, but most of them just constant camp in their castles and do nothing of use. Even turning the battles on easy-mode and going hero castle conquering it takes forever, because it just ends up being a ""run around babysitting castles from being taken while my own lords do nothing"" game.Also disappointed in Fire and Sword troop upgrades, most units can be upgraded only once or twice, and a farmer cannot eventually become a knight or anything cool, so that is rather a big part of the game they turned quite boring.Overall I don't recommend this game, it's not worth the money. Way too much crashing and not enough of the previous versions problems fixed to make it worthwhile for the few neat innovations.			"

												While being a very anticipated game for me and many others, I was very underwhelmed by the work put into this game. While many others did enjoy this game, with right reasoning too, I personally enjoy the other two predeseres to the mount and blade franchise. Let me tell you why. I have seen plenty of mods for mount and blade warband and they have been pretty good. In fact I would go as far as to say some of them are up to par or even better than what with fire and sword has to offer, a ten dollar game mind you, as where the mods were completely free (Minus the game). This game really brought me down and thought the mount and blade series was slowing and going down, but news of a sequal to warband has got my hopes up for the franchise again. Now let me tell you why I prefer warband to this. In this game you dont recruit people from villages anymore, a perfectly fine mechanic they threw that out the window to make it where you have to get people from the merc. camp in the faction. Now this is kinda a load of bull because they cost way too much and also are not very good in combat, the unit upgrade system was funky and when the game was released you could not even upgrade your troops to begin with. The interface and combat seems clunky, the weapons are very unrealisic, and the quests I just dont like in my opinion. Overall rating for this game? 4/10 could be better.			"

												(review of a game previously purchased and played)Mount and Blade: With Fire and SwordYour probably thinking ""I Loved Mount and Blade:Warband .... but now with muskets Awesome!!""  well no, not so much.M&B:Warband was this series crown jewel... Fire and sword is this series ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stepchild.  It feels gimicky, and ruins gameplay that was/is uniquly Mount and Blade.If you want some Mount and blade style gameplay but with muskets buy the DLC for warband called ""Napoleanic Wars"" its amazing and does correctly what Fire and Sword does not.Fans of the series should avoid this title and it pains me to say that as ive supported this developer since i first heard of the Orgional Mount and Blade and bought it to support a new indie dev.  (single guy makes a game... compelling story)  But hes not indie anymore and this title prooves that.Overall id give this title a5/10 (because it doesnt do anything good, and is worse then previous titles)			"

												I have to ask if this was an actual expansion made by those who made M&B Warband..or if this is another glorified Mod like Vikings that got pushed onto steam. If the latter, then it would explain so much.This game has lots of good improvements and additions, yet it just falls so very short. With a game more focused on caravans, less chances for actual combat (In Warband, you could hunt down brigands and such in the early parts. Here, you don't really get so many to hunt down), and a strange voice focus on always saying ""With Fire & Sword!"".This doesn't feel like Warband. It just feels so off and strangely..boring. You have less fighting, and more running around to find who sells salt or the frustrating quest of what Bishop wrote what on what cannons to use as some passcode. The nations/powers don't have the same 'personality' and feel as Swadia & Company.Honestly? Don't buy this. If you want guns THAT badly, find a mod. Any mod that puts them in. But this mod is not worth 10 bucks. Get it under 2-3 dollars if you really *MUST* have it, but Warband is much more fun than this.			"

												I want to like this game, I really do. But the combat feels so... Unfair, and short. Having played Warband for many hours, this game just didn't feel the same, and mods reflect a general dislike of this game. Something about it makes it feel shorter, and clunkier. This is a game that in my eyes just didn't live up to my expectations. If you want a more balanced combat system, with each class having advantages and disadvantages, then go to Mount and Blade Warband. If you want quick, ranged battles with the battles being dominated primarily by musketmen, then this is the game. If you want a gunpowder multiplayer experience, Mount and Blade Napoleon.			"

												Guns = cool, everything else = not as good as warband.EDIT: Heres some more about why I dislike it.To me Fire and Sword just has much less character and charm to it. In Warband I often struggled to gain a large army and to maintain it I enjoyed interactions with the characters, e.t.c, but in FaS I didnt care about the quests the lords gave, the lords/kings, or really anything else. There are also odd choices such as you cant recruit from towns at a certain point, and more. I recomend buying Viking Reforged instead of Fire and Sword, and looking into reviews that competent people have written.			"

												     Caravan Simulator 2015 Is this game.This game adds and takes away a lot from the great M&B Warband.     What it gives?---------------------Caravans-New Map-Ordering Custom Gear (armor/weapons)-Firearms-Main Storylines-New Factions-Cool custom mercs-Banks-------------------     Now what it takes away--------------------Marriage-Tournaments-The usefulness of hiring village volunteers-Crossbows-The Sense of being a hero in a battle-The fun of being able to simply join a faction and get land then break off and be your own nation------------------     I personally find this game pretty fun, but i dislike what they removed mostly. I enjoyed courting my future wife and i enjoyed joining a tournament. I also miss being able to take on 10 guys by myself easy as pie. With the presence of firearms, you WILL die in 1-2 bullets, unless you leave your damage taken at 1/4 (Easiest) Getting fiefs is now a HUGE chore! Want to get your nice personal custom musket? it costs over 100k thaler.. How do you get 100k thaler? There are ways of getting cash, but it still takes quite a long time, I have done about 30 hours of JUST trying to make cash, and in that time i have the best gear OUTSIDE of custom gear. Now banks are useful, but there slow, want to raid a village? cool you get about 1-2k and that faction will hate you and hunt you down DEAD. I do enjoy this but if your a achievement hunter this game will literally take you over 100 hours to finish 1 storyline, unless you cheat but then you dont get that cheevo. The presence of being able to hire top tier soldiers is nice, but you have to wait a few in game days. There is ALOT that just makes this game slow..very very slow, if you are willing to put ALOT of hours into this go ahead. It is not as fun as Warband was, not even close, and I would recommend getting a mod called ""mount and gun"" before this game, i got it on sale for 2$ which is definitely worth it, but i would wait for a sale to get this, it is not worth full price.      Good luck and enjoy! "

												There is no reason to get this game when there are so many mods for Warband. Some have all the features of Fire and Sword, such as different grades of food and gun warfare. The game lakes quite a bit of polish, even compared to the original Moun and Blade. The gameplay is ruined for me by the fact that for whatever reason, I can't recruit troops from villages. I'm not sure if this is a glitch or a gameplay mechanic, but it ruins the flow of the game because it makes getting high tiered troops impossilbe. If your looking for a fun game in the Mount and Blade series, just stick with Warband or wait for the devs' sequel.			"

												This game constantly feels like there is things missing it it, the Mount & Blade series and every game in its series is based more towards modding and modding is what makes the game; thus saying this, the modding section of this game is pretty low in the section of mods you can get compared to Mount & Blade Warband which is the game that takes home the golden trophy when it comes to this series. Mount & Blade Warband also has a pretty decent vanilla game compared to this game, as this game constantly feels like its missing features as stated before.There is one thing I do like about this game and that's the ability of fire arms in the vanilla game (which there are mods for fire arms in Warband) and the ability to mass recruit soldiers at low costs, other than that I don't really care for the game.If you love Warband you may want to try this game but just know this game is lacking more so in the content department than Warband is and mods are what make up Warband and this game doesn't nearly have the wide variety of mods as Warband has.It's a good game, don't get me wrong but it's just lacking with content and the world feels more empty than Warband and the lack of mods and vanilla features that were in Warband makes me give this game a thumbs down.

												As a veteran of ""The Deluge"" M&B: Warband mod-, -I can safely say that this game, which shouldhave been released as DLC for Warband as it bringsNOTHING new to the table-, not only pales in comparison with [The Deluge] mod, but by doing so, the devs failed to achievewhat they had set out to.

												DO NOT BUY, terrible rip off of a mod made for the original mb, from the description it sounds like there might be a story mod, but there isnt, its just the exact same campaign as before, no more tournaments, weapons cost over 100000 gold, you cant recruit peasants, bows are♥♥♥♥♥♥ guns are slow as hell, no two handed weapons that can be used on horseback and the ai is not really improved at all.

												I can't stand this game. With as great as the first Mount and Blade was, you'd think the sequels could only be better. You'd be wrong. The sword controls are completely broken, making it all but impossible to actually swing your weapon in the manner you wish instead of flailing around like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fish out of water. The enemy coding remains just as horrible, however, meaning that once you've flailed yourself into a defeat, if you manage to miraculously get away you can expect the exact same enemy party that just beat you to immediately chase you down again, just to watch you Kermit the Frog your arms around until they beat you again. And again. And again. Unplayable. They should've stuck to updating the original instead of wasting time on this piece of crap ""upgrade"".			"

												The developers abandoned this game and left it in a bad shape. The game has a small player base and a lot of major storyline-breaking bugs, it's still playable though.LIETUVIAMS Šį žaidimą kūrė lenkų kompanija. Nors žaidime yra lietuviškų elementų, kai kur tekstuose ATR vadinama Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, bet iš pradžių šalį vadino Polish Republic, vėliau kai bandžiau ginčyti pavadinimą, pakeitė į Polish Commonwealth, tačiau ignoravo prašymus įtraukti Lietuvos vardą.

												Heyyo, another game in the Mount and Blade franchise... not as good as the first one, but maybe on par or a little worse than Warband, it's still a good game. For multiplayer? I wouldn't bother with this game as Taleworlds now has that viking game out which is Multiplayer only... I dunno, I might not bother with that one since I really enjoy the singleplayer of the Mount and Blade series.			"

												Can't recommend this when Warband exists.The art feels very off, and the core gameplay isn't as fun in my opinion.With warband, you have plenty of mods to spice it up if the base game gets stale. With this, there are very few mods.Maybe get it if you love Warband and are willing to pay for a campaign with a historical setting, rather than just go for mods.The multiplayer is basically dead, but captain co-op is a neat addition if you can actually find a game.

												God this game...I geniuenly don't know what to say! The mechanics are kinda bad, the animations are stiff, not to mention the bad graphics, that is caused by the, at least,  century old game engine. But oddly enough, it's lack of quality is the charm of it. A lack of that realism, the developers sought to create, actually comes across the board as a positive ""quality"". You don't play it for an technical masterpiece, but to have fun and have a laugh with your friends at some of the ridiculous characters you can create. So if you're looking for a realistic Witcher-esque masterpiece, this isn't the place for you. This game is for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles, nothing else.Hope this review helped you come to a conclusion!			"

Just get ""Mount and Blade: Warband"" because it is similiar with far fewer bugs.			"

I love this game, but when companies put the screws to there customers, i really have to say NO NO NO thats unacceptable. hence i will have to give this game a thumbs down, even though initially it is a thumbs up.If you buy this game, you will likely love it for a while, then grow into a silent rage when you realize its an aborted game that didn't get enough development time.

												If you are considering getting this game, DON'T. I pre-ordered it with high hopes from  the creators of Mount & Blade/Warband but unless you did heavy research, you'll learn the hard way Fire and Sword is basically a older version of Mount & Blade that was geared towards the European audience just repackaged and released upon the masses at retail price. ($30)When compared to it's ""older"" predeccesors it falls flat on it's face in every single way possible. The addition of firearms isn't nearly enough to make up for the short-comings. You could easily just get a mod for Warband to just add firearms. The character models look like they took the original Mount & Blade's models and just wiped their♥♥♥♥♥with it. The dev team has not done nearly enough to breathe life into this because in my opinion nearly EVERY faction is the ♥♥♥♥ing same. The only way I can diffrenciate them is ""mongols, other guys with horses, Swedish, everyone else"" the 'unique' units are a joke. The AI is lacking. Marriage? Gone. Companions are generic as hell, certainly no Nizar. I had to FORCE myself to play this game in order to validate my mistake of paying for this game. While they were trying to make it historical, Eastern Europe was not the greatest place to do it so I give them credit for working with what they had. There are not many mods for this game either because what's the point? the Trade missions are a DRAG, villiager missions can go to hell, in fact I can say every mission with MAYBE the main questlines are BORING and REPITITVE and POINTLESS. There is nothing redeeming about this game.RATING:3/10 (a BAD game)The only mistake the devs made was releasing this AFTER Mount & Blade/Warband. This should've been the first game in the series. The M&B games after this would've been hailed as the greatest ♥♥♥♥ing improvement ever. If they were on such a money-grubbing mission they could've at least improved the graphics, AI, EVERYTHING before releasing it. Not even can be called a reskin of Warband because its INFERIOR to Warband. Looking at this game makes me ill.			"

												Mount & Blade: Fire and Sword is the third game from the game series of Mount & Blade. A sandbox game that takes players to control a character in an open world map with multiple  major and minor factions.Those who have played the previous/other games from the same series will know exactly what I am talking. If not, take a look at my Review related to M&B: Warband for a complete knowledge of what the series and its games are about: http://steamcommunity.com/id/TakedaYabu/recommended/So, I’ll begin my review by writing about the bad aspects of the game which are many...No character background story:That lack of such feature before your adventure can even begin, gives you the feeling that you will be playing with a completely random character. Unlike of what happens to all the other previous games in the series, Fire and Sword does not have a custom character background history.Same engine and mechanics as in the previous game, Warband:There is absolutely nothing new in Fire and sword that wasn’t been already seen and experienced in M&B: Warband. From the graphics and textures, what changes are that only muskets and matchlock pistols were added as a main weapon in the field of battle.In few words, this game feels like an average community made mod/expansion, and not an actual game produced from a company who managed just before, to release the best game from its series that defined the whole concept of what a true sandbox game should be.Even more bugs and errors:Despite Warband having some issues with some insignificant bugs and errors that could be easily fixed most of the times, in Fire and Sword, not just it has the same bugs and errors but also other more bugs when you wish to do an action, but also in the quests themselves that can ruin your entire gameplay if you are unlucky enough not to create a save file before you accept that quest.Boring and repetitive:Even when both games follow the same concept of sandbox with a very similar if not the same gameplay style, the way the campaign map is designed being only made of grassland and more grassland instead of the 4 elements seen in Warband, such as the Desert, Snow, Grassland and Montains.Unbalanced game:Despite being interesting at the beginning, once you have invested some time in the game and in your campaign progress, you will realize that the game ends up by making you looting villages, sell items, hire troops and fight.The players routine in the game to achieve success and power is a never ending repetitive loop.Now to the good aspectsMusic:The music in this game is wonderful I must admit, to hear the piano and the violin while you shoot and slain people is very pleasing and mixes perfectly with the time period where the game is based on.The age of gunpowder:The addition of firearms and armies based on it in a Mount & Blade game is unique and indeed a surprise to players who enjoy shooting and slashing down opponents!ConclusionI would rate this game a 20 out of 100 or a 1,0 out of 5,0 stars. The same exact graphics and game mechanics as in Warband in a game that could easily contain success, but failed miserably... a huge disappointment.			"

												Well, it's not that bad. Probably can be fun for some. But overall, I consider it to be awful. I played only 3 hours, because of the early game. And here's the main reason: It's hard. You can put difficulty on easy and lower all options until you get ""14% difficulty"", but you're still going to be killed by villagers. The issue? You aren't fighting farmers, you're fighting the same soldiers you'd recruit. So, yes: 50+ units of the same level of the early game units. You might reply saying that you won't pillage villages soon. Well, wrong. The questline forces you to raid not one but three villages, a task that apparently may only be done with 15 mercs (and I repeat, easy difficulty with 14% difficulty in the options). Of which atleast 10 will die because there are musket militia, and your ""riflemen"" mercs have bows. Have fun.			"

												While another good game in the series, I do find the addition of guns really takes away from this game, Especially with how your AI work compared to how the enemies works. I find more often then not battles start up, And the AI mows down half your team with a wave of musket shots which seem lazer guided. I would Strongly suggest the others in the series.			"

												I bought with fire and sword probably a year or more after it came out because I had  finally purged enough salt from Mount&blade and Mount&blade warband not feeling finished. I was able to buy this on sale for like 1.99 or something.I regret the time I spent installing it. It's a partially reskinned Mount&Blade Warband with guns, but somehow it manages to lack the appeal of its predecessor. I didn't play long enough to really pick up on the nuances of why, but I didn't care to. Uninstalled it as soon as I finished my first session. Probably will reinstall Mount&Blade warband though! If you haven't played that one you might want to check it out!			"

												At first... I was like ""Oh, sweet, a Mount & Blade set during the Deluge!  This sounds really interesting!""  It sounds interesting.  Sounds.I enjoyed Mount & Blade a lot, and I was expecting it to work as sort of an expansion pack similar to most mods or the Napoleonic Wars add on.  However, it turned out to be a stand alone game.Whatever, I can dig it.  I'll just start a new single player campaign.It promptly asks you what difficulty and gender, and immediately after... skips the background and goes directly to the stats screen.  It was unusual, but I figured maybe it was after this part.  I enjoyed having a background for each character, afterall.  Added to the immersion, afterall.What a backstory for your character?  You won't get one here.Alright, that's fine, I can still hang in.  Now, where do I spawn first?  I think Sweden would be fun.Nope, can't do that either.  You begin with a tutorial.  A tutorial.  It leads to your first quest which is fight a gang of bandits and hlp three guys you don't know out of a sticky situation.  Or something, not really sure.  I stopped caring when I realize they just drop you into the action with little motive or reasoning.Well, that was a rough start...  Still, its set during the deluge.  I wonder what weapons you can get.I turn cheatmenu on to see the item list... and it was removed.WELL, that sucked!  Whats the purpose of removing a cheat option?  To balance a game that's already been cheated?Whatever, I'm sick of campaign already.  Time to check out the custom battle!I set up a siege between Sweden and Poland, I'm fighting for the Swedes as a nameless Scottish Halberdier.  Whatever, I get to hit someone with a halberd and I like it.  ^^The battle starts off like most Mount and Blade battles, so no real difference there.  The moment I die, the battle ends...  Which is strange.  Yes, I know Mount and Blade tends to end battles when you die, but with all the mods that continue the battles... you'd think they'd take a cue from the community.  I mean, Napoleonic Wars began as a mod.  And now its like $10 on steam.Whatever, I'll just host a mulitplayer match and turn a password on so the battle continues.  Siege again... and I forget the AI is stupid in Multiplayer.  Something they won't ever fix...  Not like they can just take the NPCs from the Singleplayer game and use them instead of the bots, but whatever.  I'll just take a moment to check out the armor and weapons we can get for each faction and each unit.The stuff you get are just as bad, apparently.  ""Its realistic, though!""  Realism would mean they didn't call Russian Musketeers 'Riflemen'.Whatever...  If you want some deluge action in Mount and Blade Warband, save yourself the money and find a mod on the forums.  I'm sure there is something that is just as good, if not better.  Overall, I don't think this game would be a good buy for your library.			"

												It takes all the annoying parts of Warband and expands upon them while killing off what made Warband a good time.

												Shoutout to the band Dragonforce for their enormous contribution to both the soundtrack and overall design on of this game. It really shines through just how must work was put in to keep this true to their song and novel: Through the Fire and Flames. The game's story really speaks to your heart as you persevere the harsh, unforgiving wasteland that is Poland, and you can clearly tell it has the same unbeatable quality put into it that each and every one of your songs has. ""Fighting hard fighting on for the steel through the wastelands evermoreThe scattered souls will feel the hell bodies wasted on the shoresOn the blackest plains in hell's domain we watch them as they goIn fire and pain now once again we know""- Dragonforce			"

												Can somebody say ""frustrating?""  This game is relentless to newcomers and vets alike.  If not for the guns, Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword would be just Mount and Blade, but it would also be exponentially better.  From the begginning of the game to the pinnacle of your rule, guns remain the height of your fear.  Just a single bullet can put a player down in a battle, leaving the rest of the fighting to the exceptionally stupid AI who always seem to lose if they're on your side.  Simple occurrences like that can set a player back hours, and this happens over and over again.  This is a game Macklemore would turn down, even if it was just 99 cents.			"

												First off this series is great. But when i played this game it almost ruined the everything i loved about this series. I started watching a person call Reformist (go check him out he is great he got me into warband) so i bought warband. BAM!!! I went from playing steam only when my brother was on our ps3 to trying to get on every second possible yeah its that goodmy machine can not run anything but it runs warband like a dream. Then this game went on sale and i was chearing a lot.i wanted this game soo bad so i bought it. when i first started it up... it crashed. When i finally got it to work i was really exited i played for a few minutes and then just did not like it. So if you wanna get a game save your money and get warband (it is 10 dollars more but it has like a billion mods.) So if you are going to buy a game buy warband.			"

												Its far from as good as Mount & Blade warband.What i felt most disapointing was the singleplay. Sure it has some new mechanics but i didnt find them any good or fun.Also you don't get those epic and fun fights like you do in warband. Becuse you spend most of the fights hiding behind a rock, tree or your soldiers so you wont get one shot by some random rifleman 100m away.The rifle combat is so awful. The rifles are very strong so you can often get suprised killed by anyone. Useing a rifle yourself is even worse since the bullet can fly anywere. So shooting becomes more of luck then a skill. With the high relode time just makes it worse. If you want to fight with rifles in a mount and blade game i recomend the napolic dlc for warband. Becuse the rifles are more accurate so its more skill based, It feels more epic with music and cannons, I think relode is faster or atlest it feels faster. I only got the hours on the game becuse the melee combat in multiplayer was the one fun thing.			"

												It's the black sheep of M&B. The addition of firearms to the base game essentially unbalances everything, and being shot anywhere ♥♥♥♥s you up something terrible. This and the period of history it depicts are the only real divisions between it and Warband.However, you probably only own this anyway because you bought the collection, in which case you have Napoleonic Wars which is far better, despite being multiplayer only. Out of all the numerous modules you can get for Warband, Fire & Sword will probably be played the least.			"

												I though this was going to be a good game, better than Warband. Guess what? It wasn't. It's exactly like M&B:W but with a smaller troop recruitment, Want to play as a Warlord that conquers land? Too bad. This game takes away the feel that you can conquer every single village,town,fortress,castle, and Capital. This is a good game overall(Graphics, Storyline ETC.) but the gameplay isn't that good, I though it would be like M&B:W but with cannons. It wasn't.

												With Fire & Sword is a version of the game Mount & Blade, the game that claims to be a mix of a role play game and a wargame. The most obvious changes are the replacement of crossbows with firearms, a new map and the 16th/17th century setting.  This is the time that warfare gradually changed from melee based to firearm based. (A side note: the setting actually mixes  aspects of the 16 century setting with that of the  17th century. The halbediers belong more to the former century and the musketeers/cavalry more to the latter.)There some  other changes. There seem to be more quests and the recruitment system has been overhauled. However, at the core the game is the same and as such has the same problems as the old game, such as a rudimentary battlefield mechanism, a nonexistent storyline,  a simplistic dialogue tree, superficial boring personalities and  tedious repetitive battles of which there are way too many. And these problems are  now compounded by the introduction of firearms.With muskets you can kill an adversary from the other side of the map and what is more.. he can do the same.  In fact the ai is actually better at shooting because it isn't bothered by the fact that from a distance avatars are so small that you can't make them out right. My first half hour was spend being shot to pieces. The only way to escape that fate is by  moving in an unpredictable pattern so the enemy can't take aim properly. In the meantime you either have to try and kill them with your own firearm(while moving about in a random way!) or with your  sidearm. Battles turn therefore into tedious hit and run activities in which standing still is an invite to be killed on the spot.The milita that you can recruit at the start is woefully inept to deal with anything better than looters and once you have enough of them to actually have a chance to win a fight, your army is so slow that you can't catch deserters, brigands and such because they are faster than you. So you either have to fight enemies who are superior to your inept troops.. or hope to corner a band of ruffians,which involves you in chasing them across the map hoping you won't loose sight of them when the night sets in or when they run into a wooded area.In fact the best thing to do is not to recruit any militia or infantry but to go from town to town to find and  hire mercenary cavalry or  heroes so you can overtake your enemies or have a chance to runaway from them when they are too strong.In any event the game seems to promise to become a protracted boring game, like the basic game was, but now you can use firearms and play on a map that represents eastern europe. The game is neither a good role play game nor a good wargame, because it doesn't implement either aspect well and  it amazes me  that people actually consider this game to be good.But I guess tastes differ..

												This 17th-century counterpart to the fun-filled Mount and Blade: Warband was ill-conceived and does not even nearly measure up to its predecessor. Firearm-based warfare simply does not fit into Mount and Blade's combat system, and the result is silly, disjointed battles rife with anachronistically-accurate gunshots. In the period during which this game takes place, one would be lucky to hit a barn at 100 meters with a musket. As such, massed volleys were the order of the day. Not so in this title. Want to hit an enemy from 50 meters with a pistol while riding at full speed on your horse? No problem. And don't be surprised if you get sniped from halfway aross the map under the same circumstance. And it's not just the battles that are bad: the campaign takes a giant step backwards from Warband also, lacking numerous gameplay aspects native to that superior title. Campaign gameplay in With Fire and Sword mainly boils down to running away from bandits and endlessly playing errand boy to local lords, and is both needlessly difficult and extremely tedious.Though this game is sold at a bargain-bin price, it is truly not worth any amount of your money or time. Avoid.			"

												Warband is much better. The main questline for certain factions (mainly Muscovite and Polish ) are so glitchy that you have to save every little step you take or else you risk having a gamebreaking glitch where you can't progress. Also you can't make your own faction, only rebel against a current faction.			"

There's probably a great game in here, but every time I try to dig it out, I'm just stymied by how much padded ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t it in this. If the devs sorted through the numbers and actually crafted a pace to make the game fun, it has the potential to be a classic.			"

Mount & Blade is a MiddleAge Game. Here you can play Roleplay in Singleplayer which i really enjoy because there are many ways to play for example you can be a Rebel or you can be a royal Duke and be nice to a King... Many Weapons and many Armors but thats not all! There is a also a really cool Multiplayer, fight against other Players with Sword,Bow,Guns and more. If u like Middle Age Roleplay or Fight, i can really recommend this to you. "

												I thought this game was going to be mount and blade but with guns! It's not that. It sucks♥♥♥♥♥1. The guns are a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.2. The map has to have been downsized by about 3 times.3. No more hiring from villages, you go to merc camps. Yay?4. Raiding cities is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. All of your men die almost instantly. (Even elite units)5. The ""new"" armor and weapons are poorly textured and none of them look cool. 6. Most of the gun models look like rectangles with♥♥♥♥♥♥drawn on them.7.I loved the combat in Mount and Blade warband, but here it is boring.8. The AI of your troops is utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I order my men to hold the position and they either charge or fumble around. And when they do either of those, the enemies are already here, and we're all dead.9.You will not make a big army. Big armies are a ♥♥♥♥ing dream in this game. I went to all the merc camps and cities and only had around 70 men.10.The gun's fire sound effect sucks♥♥♥♥♥ I liked the one in napoleonic wars better.11. The maps are bland and boring.12. What the ♥♥♥♥ is a wagon fort?13. Enemies can hit you from a mile away, but you can barely even see them.14. There's like 20 weapons in this entire game.15. Most of the marketplaces are empty. There's about 5-6 items in each one.16. Almost all of the bandits are on horseback, making it boring to fight them with marksmen.17. You will not have epic shooting battles. You will have the battles where all of your men die and you have to shoot the enemy.18. There is no real improvement. 19. You will not get a boner from the music. The music is not cool.20. The UI sucks my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ juices. It's all white and makes me feel like I'm going blind.21. The factions are boring and you don't really care for them. Sweden? Oh boy, I love that faction! no.22. There are about 3 types of boots in the entire game.23. None of the weapons or armor from the old game are in this game. Therefore, this game is a giant pile of monkey♥♥♥♥♥♥Pros1. Guns are cool.2. Grenades are coolJust kidding both of these suck♥♥♥♥♥♥in this game.			"

												Mount & Blade, Fiery Sword is a terrible, terrible shitpiece of a game. Unlike Skyrim, there are no epic fantasy elements in the land of Firordia, instead, the player travels across boring European landscapes- with no snow. Clearly they do not know that European landscapes are boring without snow which  is why Oblivion was a♥♥♥♥♥♥game. I do not reccommend this game. Even the combat opts too far towards actual swordplay instead of flailing your weapon like Skyrim. Not reccommended.			"

												This game, plus the other Mount & Blades, are the peak of medieval style combat, and this game is more 1600-1750, with guns, but the fighting style and the sandbox mode made this game one of the best to me. I've been playing since 4th grade, version .808 i believe, and I've watched it grow throughout it's development. I love this game.			"

												It is fun, especially the guns and increased options....But... be wary. It's very buggy and some quests are very difficult to understand the the heck your supposed to be doing, especially some of the mainstorylines.No where near as good a game as Warband, but still a decent game in its own right.

												Mount und Blade with guns.Pro-tip: make over half your army out of marksmen. hit F1 then hit F1 again to tell them to hold their position. Hit F2 and F1/F2 for them to make one or two lines. Hit F2 again then hit F6 for them to spreadout so they don't get annhilated. Hit F3 and hit F2 so they fire at your command. Hit F3 and hit F2 when the enemy is in sight to let loose the bullet storm.			"

The intro has you assiting a bunch of people in a fight, shooting the lock off a gate, grabbing some horses and riding out fighting your way to freedom. Sounds great huh? Thats about all you get whereupon it becomes a very bland feeling verson of warband in a european setting. That interesting plot driven adventure feel at the beginning? Gone in place of boring quests probably drafted out on the back of a♥♥♥♥♥packet.Get warband and download the 1257ad mod which is an awesome european world total conversion of the game with so much more content and stuff to do.

												Once you get the hang of the trade caravans to get a decent amount of cash to pay your troops with, and buy some good equipment, this game is fantastic! I particularly enjoy the siege defence element of the game, holding out a fortress with 50 elite mercenaries, against an army of 400+ is extremely rewarding! Replayability is great too, with the faction quests and combat styles. There are some great mods, I have to recommend GESIA, after 100+ hours of native I installed it, and haven't stopped playing it since! Well done developers for making a game around such an untouched part of history which contains many gaming opportunities, and making it a great one!			"

												While the campaign is next to neverending (I have not even finished it myself, and have only been able to eliminate two factions in the course of the game)  the multiplayer is pretty fun.  My favorite type of game is Captain Co-op in which you and everybody else leads a squad of six soldiers which can be upgraded as the round progresses.  There are 30 rounds in each multiplayer game (assuming your team can survive that long) in which after each 10 waves the enemy gets stronger.  Overall, a fun game in multiplayer.			"

Again, nothing about this game is perfect, and it's hardly for everyone - but I love how open it is. It's almost like ""create your own story.""			"

												Fire and Sword takes place much further along in history than the other Mount and Blade games. The inclusion of flintlock pistols and rifles may not seem like to much, but the game becomes very unbalanced with these new weapons. While trying to fight your way to capture a town, a single stray shot will hit and kill you. Thus the game thinks the battle has ended, but to continue fighting you have to use the automatic fight protocol (which sucks). I realize the developers were trying to modernize the game to include a bit different play style, but the balance is way off to allow for an enjoyable playthrough. Try either the original Mount and Blade or Mount and Blade: Warband if you want that combat oriented conquering goodness of a game. Those two are much better balanced.			"

												Ugh, I hate to♥♥♥♥♥♥on this game simply because I love the hell out of M&B: Warband. However, I don't like this game very much. I would say I hate it, but it's not a bad game per se. Let me explain:The AI is incredibly ♥♥♥♥ing lucky. You could be level 30, in the best armor possible, riding the best horse possible, across the entire battlefield, behind trees, over a hill and a town militia will kill you with 1 lucky headshot. Then you lose the battle because your troops go full retard when you die. Also, the mapppp....the Mappppp (da plane, da plane!) Who the hell made this map? The zoomed out view looks like it was done it MS Paint at the last minute. If you haven't seen it, it is basically 1 huge flat area with an ocean to the side of it. It's just insanely huge and flat. There are WAY too many towns and cities. There are just a lot of little things about the game that drive me insane. I wish I could like it. I really do. Guns + Swords + M&B creators = Good game, right? Nope.Sorry M&B. I ♥♥♥♥ing love Warband, I seriously applaud you for that game, but I just cannot play With fire and sword. I give it a 3/10.			"

Spy missions are completely broken, no minimap and you supposed to find 1 exact person in a huge town with no horse. It's like playing GTA without a minimap or a car and your supposed to find someone in the entire map. You can get killed by 4 gun shot wounds. Armor is very very useless. +1 defence instead of +6 like warband.			"

												It was a late night in Bread Village we had been sieged for over 10 days with continuously attacks, the men was starting to get tired and our morale was getting low. Then on the 11th day me and my men attacked the enemies base with great success but worse thing happend meanwhile, when we started to march home again you could hear the agonisingly screams from afar from the village where we lived. When we enterd the village you could se corpses lying on the ground for some reason it was only villagers from our village. We asked one of the survivors that was badly hurt and lying on the ground what had happend when we where gone, the only thing he said was ""HAIL THE BREAD!"" continuously while shaking. As he would said nothing more we want deeper into the village at the main hall where most of the survivor where they all stared at us and chanted ""The Bread"". A feel of dread slowly creeps over me. One of the survivors is my best commander and I ask him what the hell is going on. He then slowly starts walking towards me, and i notice that all other survivors are doing the same. I notice that they are all completely naked and they are all covered in flour and some of them have burnmarks on their skin. Their chants increase,""THE BREAD, THE BREAD!"". I saw that in their hands they are holding big white bread loafs, and slowly one step at the time they are coming closer and my commander is holding a huge sack of flour. I start yelling ""WHATS HAPPENING"" but no answers are given, i cant find and escape they have surrounded me and are continuously chanting ""THE BREAD!"". They are so close to me i can smell the delicious bread. They suddenly stopped when they where one meter from me their chanting was starting to fade away. One of them said ""What bussnies do you have with the holy bread?"" i answered ""what BREAD?!"". The moment i said that they started furiously chanting ""THE BREAD!"" one of then hit me with the bread in my face. Then the chanting faded again. One of them said ""The Bread is all that is holy and sacred do you offer your life for the Bread and is willing to sacrifise every thing for it. I think to myself what is this madness about this bread? the whole village has lost its mind. I screamd you are all INSANE! Then everything got dark...Based on an ingame experience10/10			"

												For those of you who've played M&B Warband, what you'll find is a somewhat more limited but much more story-driven game, set during a very dynamic era in Eastern Europe's history. It's somewhat more limited as there are fewer 'roleplay' options and the economy seems less well developed, It's much more story-driven because instead of the over-arching ""take over the world"" objective, you have three different stories (Cossack, Muscovite, and Polish) you can engage in and leave 'on the back burner' at any time to return to the free-roaming sandbox world, which still exists largely unchanged from Warband. AI improvements: By default, a pike and shot formation will shelter the shot under the pikes. Ideal for defeating cavalry. Musketeers can kneel and fire. Reloading can be achieved on the move, though at a walk. In terms of the engine, WFAS and Warband are essentially identical, so expect smooth performance on any remotely reasonable gaming computer even at maximum settings.			"

												This game is lots of fun.. There are Basically two Modes  the Campaign mode where you build your character and a custom battle mode where you vs another army..It is very simular to Mdickies World War Alpha even the game machanics of the battles So I will use this for comparisons for those of you who have played it..The Custom mode is like Deathmatch mode in WOrld War alpha only you can only have 2 sides in M&B not up to six in WWAThe Campaign mode is like WWA storymode too But the way you move around the Map is different.. WWA is like playing risk while M&B is kind of like the way they do it with the Might and magic games only realtime not turn basedWWA has more weapon types then M&B and the melee combat is done better in WWA But the guns are done much better in M&B and WWA does not have horses while M&B does..M&B is  a more indepth game overall then WWA because it also involves making decisions, leveling up you charator, doing side quest, Buying and tradingI would say it will keep you entertained for longer based on that If you already own M&B and still want more I do also recommend trying WWA.. its a bit more arcady and its a free download from MDickies site But still Buy this Because this does have a lot more to it.. and you wont regret buying M&B.

												I  bought this game because I loved the other mount and blade games. However, I think this expansion(or mod?) ruined it, for multiple reasons. I really liked the addition of guns to the game. Ive always wanted to play mount and blade in that sort of time period; with muskets and cavalry sabers.The real problems are:+ the graphics are to terrible. Mount and blade is obviously not the most visually pleasing(for obvious performance reasons). But this game took mount and blade graphics, and made them even worse, with no apparent trade off for somehing else. The battle maps are extremely foggy, and the world map is hard to look at. It looks more like stretched burlap than grassy fields. Not to mention, there isnt any real terrain like there was in the origional game. The entire map it completely flat.+ the use of actual real life named towns and cities kills the mount and blade ambience and lore. Why do I want to fight for Poland, or Russia or Sweden? What happened to the first kingdoms? like Swadia, or the Rhodoks, or the Vaegirs? Why couldnt we use them?+They changed the colors of all the menus from dark tan(in the origional) to a bright(almost white) beige. I know this doesnt sound like much, but it washed out all the detail in the menus, and its difficult to see what youre clicking on. Not to mention, every time I bring a menu up, i get blinded from the brightness due to its contrast from normal gameplay.I love the idea of this game, but in my opinion, it was poorly executed, and seems to have just been hastely thrown together.

												Overall it's ALMOST as fun as M&B: Warband. Unlike Warband, story of the game -this time- is authentic  and not a fantasy product. Continous wars between Swedish Kingdom, Russian Tsardom, Cossack Khanate and muskets! The saddest part for me is that game is bugged. Not tiny bugs! Big, story screwer bugs. I have lived the biggest of them in the storyline of Tsardom throught the end of my rebellions against the Tsardom and had to start all over. So what I mean is, save A LOT and use more than one (1) files to save! Otherwise it's just a moment to get screwed by a bug and frusturate. Such a turn off for a game like this. It's also very funny, when game screw you a lot with it's bugs, when you use a cheat it disables the achievements. What can I do if you bugged my gameplay and I had to use a cheat to come where I was at the first place! (teleport cheat on map). Storywise 9, gameplay 5/10.			"

												A development of Warband which is almost hidden from view. The obvious changes of adding firearms and new factions hides a much deeper alteration to the mechanics of the game as a whole including the ability to create a trade infrastructure for you to generate money, work for mayors and the guilds, support claimants, or take over a faction with scripted story driven quests. The soldier experience system has also been overhauled. At first glance this is simply more of the same but a deeper investigation shows a more mature and well realised whole than Warband.			"

												It's M&B, there's some new features but in some ways it cut back some features too. You can't be female, there's no marriage sidequests to speak of. But there's a bit more to town management, which I like, and it generally feels a bit more refined. Technically it's more a standalone expansion pack than a new game. What I'm looking forward to, really, is M&B2.			"

												Mount and Blade has always had a method that works quite well.  Honestly, I woried that it would be broken with gunpowder, but they still managed to pull it off quite nicely.  You can copy/paste my review of Warband for this, but it has a different feel due to the new age.  Its best to treat this and Warband as completely different games.			"

												I gave this game 100 because i really enjoed it just to let every one know i have played all other mount and blade games and this one has good and bad things now 1st its not empire total war this game goes like this u fire one shot and then go in to hand to hand combat like in warband i did♥♥♥♥♥♥me off alitle bit wen i saw the reviews so low no other game can bring you the experience that mount and blade does this game is warbad but it has guns witch are accurate and take forever to reload so like i said you will shoot ones then you go and fight one bad thing i need to mention is in warband wen u become a lord of your own nation you can pick a name for it here you can not it just says ure a rebel country and other is that you can not have vassals (companions fighting with you) in warband you could offer a fief to your companion and then they will raise an army and fight with you and you can not do that here a big let down but thats the bigger change in this game besides the guns, so are there any good things? yes 1st now in every village you can talk to the elder you dont have to go into the city and look for him no more, and i think thats all for the changes. This game is cheep defiantly worth it and by the way the graphics are slightly better enjoy XD			"

(Against other players you get like 3 guys)Great game, maybe not for $10 but if you love M&B  youll like this game....

This game has a lot of exploration and free raoming characteristics in it.

												This game is lots of fun.. There are Basically two Modes  the Campaign mode where you build your character and a custom battle mode where you vs another army..It is very simular to Mdickies World War Alpha even the game machanics of the battles So I will use this for comparisons for those of you who have played it..The Custom mode is like Deathmatch mode in WOrld War alpha only you can only have 2 sides in M&B not up to six in WWAThe Campaign mode is like WWA storymode too But the way you move around the Map is different.. WWA is like playing risk while M&B is kind of like the way they do it with the Might and magic games only realtime not turn basedWWA has more weapon types then M&B and the melee combat is done better in WWA But the guns are done much better in M&B and WWA does not have horses while M&B does..M&B is  a more indepth game overall then WWA because it also involves making decisions, leveling up you charator, doing side quest, Buying and tradingI would say it will keep you entertained for longer based on that If you already own M&B and still want more I do also recommend trying WWA.. its a bit more arcady and its a free download from MDickies site But still Buy this Because this does have a lot more to it.. and you wont regret buying M&B.

												While guns try to act as the selling point for the game the mechanics are too sluggish to be effective. Considering this is paradox's first attempt at three dimensional guns I wouldn't hold it against them. The usage of real European nations was definitely a nice touch. As a whole I'll give this the exact opposite of my review for the book the title was based off. While the worst piece in the trilogy it still manages to entertain.			"

												I played through the original Mount and Blade before I got to With Fire and Sword. Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword is a definite upgrade in the Mount and Blade series. The ability to use firearms makes it a lot more interesting. However the missions are similar to the regular Mount and Blade, which was so fun to play and quite large. So if you already have played through the regular Mount and Blade and loved it you will like the additions in With Fire and Sword. It takes time getting used to the world, and it is a large world. You will need to fend for your soldiers and build your army slowly in order to have a chance to really dominate. This game requires a lot of patience but it is fun to storm the castles with your army. Once you have a few castles under your control it becomes a lot more easier to manage the game. the trading system is a nice thing as well if you have the patience for it. Learning which resources are needed in different places can take some time. Overall great game.			"

												This game is like a more tactical version of Chivalry. The levels and teams are very historically accurate, from the way they look and sound, right down to how the weapons handle. This is not a very fast-paced FPS shooter, it's more of an antique combat simulator. Mount and Blade really belongs in its own special category of tactical FPS. When a server gets going with a good team on both sides, it can be a lot of fun. I also enjoy skirmish mode. I have never found much time for the campaigns. Buy it on sale, and it's some of the most unique fun you can have for the money.			"

												This game, plus the other Mount & Blades, are the peak of medieval style combat, and this game is more 1600-1750, with guns, but the fighting style and the sandbox mode made this game one of the best to me. I've been playing since 4th grade, version .808 i believe, and I've watched it grow throughout it's development. I love this game.			"

												Well, i'm leaning more on -1 but ehh, every time i try to battle, the game crashes, the reason why i'm not really for -1 but kinda goin for it is because idk if this is a common issue, if it is common, -1, if it's a fault on my end, +1 because I love the overall category of the game, I love the gameplay so far hahaha from what i can tell from the first mission, i like that kind of   fighting			"

												Could have been great, but sadly isn't.Pro's:Weapons feel lovely. Both melee and ranged.Uniforms are pretty. Not sure if they are historically accurate but they look good enough to a layman such as myself.Quest system for leaders and villages is very much improved over vanilla. Not great but still, its an improvement.Cons:The AI is what breaks it. The game could be fun if you ignore the other bugs but sadly this is the real issue. The issue is In city fights/seiges the AI will just stand there not attacking and changing weapons back and fouth. You can literally walk into a bunch of 50+ of them and punch them all to death slowly without any sort of resistance. Its  totally game breaking.The map is very boring (kind of reminds me of seven kingdoms if anyone remembers that from the 90s) as its basically all plain with no features and the tile set is a very noticable single small repeating square of colour and the occasional mountain line or river.Theres alot of minor details that I could go on with such as certain factions items are a bit imbalanced such as janissary armour being paper thin etc but those are minor. Theres nothing 'really new' over M&B other than a usually bugged out and uncompletable quest line. Consider this a mod for M&B with a price tag. Sadly you are better off with one of the M&B free mods which are very close to this. Theres quite a few available and they are all superior.Verdict: 4/10. Could have been great, but its lazily finished with lots of game breaking bugs. "

												While this game is fun, it doesn't live up to the legenday Mount & Blade Warband; and heres whyThe multiplayer is pretty fun, and it includes some exclusive gamemodes that native Warband doesn't include. However, since WFaS doesn't have any major multiplayer mods, it gets boring after a while. Plus, there are only a couple of active servers left on WFaS.The singleplayer for this game is sadly not nearly as good as that of Warband and even the original Mount & Blade. It has so many problems that make it almost impossible to enjoy. If you use cheats you might get some fun out of the singleplayer, but its so broken that playing it legit is more like a chore.I know I've been giving this game a negative summary, but to be honest, its not that bad (if it was I probably wouldn't have played 50 hours of it). Its just dissapointing how its not as good as Warband, but its still worth picking up if you can find it on sale.			"

												This version of the game sucks. Gameplay and story are about the same as the other games except that when you are taken prisoner, you lose nearly everything, including inventory items and equipped things such as muskets, pistol, etc leaving you with absolutely nothing. Most enemy troops are faster than you so they can run you down and kill you over and over I was captured 8 times in a row losing everything over and over. You can't recuirt troops like the other games in fact it seems as if you can't get any troops unless you buy mercenaries at outrageous prices. Oh and the armor sucks, so most of the time it's one shot kills. Do not buy unless you intend on being frustrated and bored of losing battle after battle even on easy mode.			"

												This game seems to be a lot less fun in the early game than Mount & Blade: Warband because it's harder to get started. For instance, you can't simply recruit men from villages and level them up anymore. Also, firearms aren't really that fun to play with, given their inaccuracy and very long reload times. They're interesting, but not fun, at least as far as I could see.I wanted to play more to see if it got better later on, but the performance of this game is terrible. I can run Mount & Blade: Warband with maximum settings and hundreds of men on the field at 200 FPS, but this game on low settings and 20 men on the field gets only 20-50 FPS. (It seems to be more related to terrain than battle size.) It might be okay if the frame rate was at least constant, but it stutters quite a bit, causing the gameplay to speed up and slow down frequently, which messes up the timing in combat. There are numerous forum posts from other people with the same problem, but no good solutions, so I found this game to be essentially unplayable.			"

												After Mount and Blade : Warband game it was very understandable that people are expecting more at the new one. Unfortunately almost all your expectation will blow up but of course it depends on what is it. When you look at graphics it is just like the last games of Call of Duty (ı m not talking about good quality of course) there is no specific change.  Most fateful loss in this game is at the Warband you could do someting like marrige and got relationship with the others but in this one they are not exist anymore. From another aspect we can say that upgraded guns and tools make you feel better but you can easly find those textures and items from modes too so there is not much thing to say positive.			"

You could be playing this game for a year and have all your men and top tier armor shredded by anyone with a rifle. I have no idea why so many people recommend this game. I have watched people do playthroughs of this game for a year and just have everything they worked for so easily stripped away. If you want to lead and armor and build a character over time I would recommend WARBAND. If you want to up the difficulty ridiculous and feel like you have to be on edge every battle, feel free to buy this game.			"

												The most satisfying thing in this game is when an enemy is running at you and you aim your pistol at his face and blast him away right before he reaches you.  And also running over people with a big horsey :)On a more serious note, I highly recommend this game if you are the least bit interested in sword combat and a hint of strategy and controlling your own conquering army.  The neat thing about this game is that while you can look at a map and move your army around the continent, and choose castles and villages to raid or conquer, as soon as you begin a battle, you have the option to join it.  Which means you have your own character that you level up and equip gear to who serves as your army's leader.  So there is both a strategic side as well as a medieval FPS side.  In my opinion it also has a very good replay value.  All in all it's a very well made game and I have enjoyed all 400+ hours of gameplay :)			"

												Let's talk about the pros first. Ok, I really appreicate that lots of new features including firearms, commerce and banking systems and especially quest lines are introduced in this game, which can be considered an improvement compared to the orignial series. In addition, the historial background and gun warfare  have made this game enjoyable for those who just want game experience. However, the game is still technically broken due to the buggy questline, the worst nightmare of the game if your questline is terminated accidently when you've already spent dozens of hours building the characters. Also the AIs sometimes just stuck in environments, such as the deserters running back and forth in wagon's fort map and could not escape, and the siege army stay on the ladders until you shot them.Anyway, I still love this game for its new features that the orginal series did not have, but I really hope this game could be fixed.

												If you want something like mount and blade warband. DONT GET this game. Its hard to start your own empire, due to the difficulty of recruiting decent troops. The weapons take quite some time to shoot (bows and arrows are better in my opinion). And pretty much isnt as fun as Warband. If you are debating on getting Warband of With Fire and Sword, I'll get Warband in a heartbeat. :P			"

												Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword takes place in 17th century Eastern Europe. There are five factions to choose from, the Polish Commonwealth, Muscovite Tsardom, Cossack Hetmanate, Kingdom of Sweden, and Crimean Khanate. Each faction has unique troops each with its pros and cons. There is a leveling system in this game so you can upgrade your character throughout the game. You can play in first person or third person. Throughout the game, you will recruit soldiers to join your troop. They can be upgraded once they have a certain amount of experience. You can also hire mercenaries too. In combat, you can command your troops to form a certain formation. The game is very similar to Mount & Blade: Warband. There is some addition in Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword, there are new weapons such as muskets, pistols, and grenades. There are some UI improvements as well.Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword is quite similar to its predecessor, Warband. The buildings and troop uniform look accurate. The towns and villages look nice. I really like the UI improvements, it's really neat. There are many mods for this game as well.However, there are some bugs and glitches in the campaign. The animation when someone died because of getting shot looks weird. There isn't much ragdoll from the grenades as well. Some aspects of the game, such as the loading screen, aren't optimized for widescreen resolution. There is no Steam Cloud support for this game too.To conclude, despite some of its flaws, Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword is still a very fun and addicting game. I really enjoy the hours I played it.			"

												Gun powder weapons spice up the action but the muskets are WAY too over powered. This game takes place around the 16th century when guns weren't very reliable and insanely inaccurate, but in With Fire & Sword, you can snipe someone from about 200 feet away and get a freaking headshot on them about 80% of the time. This goes for singleplayer and multiplayer. Mounted units can still destroy any unit, which is fine. It's fun running over people while on horseback. You can recruit armies quickly with several types of mercenaries, it is easier to manage towns, earn money, and there are more options to manage your armies now in battle. It's pretty cool getting a few dozen musket units all lined up in a row and fire at the same time. Grenades do exactly what you would think. Blasting a hole into the side wall of a castle and charging in is certainly alot faster and easier then using ladders during sieges. There's plenty of mods you can find to set your fix, just like the other Mount & Blade games. There are some other improvements here and there over Warband, but I think Warband is still the must have game out of this series and stand alone expansions. With Fire & Sword is still worth getting in my eyes; you'll just have to get used to the additions of guns and other new modes and features. "

												Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword is an interesting.. Sequel/Standalone whatever it is to Mount and Blade and Mount and Blade: Warband.While it proudly boasts the classic Mount and Blade style game play, allowing you free roam to do whatever you please in the world, be it conquer it, hunt bandits, or even just run caravans, there are a few things that make it exceptionally notable from the original game and it's sequel.The first, and most likely the most noticably, is the guns. Unlike the original and Warband, which were set in a medieval-esque setting, fit with Crossbows, Bows and Throwing weapons as the only ranged weapons, With Fire and sword is placed in the 17th century Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth, and, as such, the game features guns. Most people see this in the game, and are offput by it (Much like many were to Age of Empires III) figuring it to be game-ruining or cheap. Taleworlds are smarter than that though, and the method to which they added guns is quite interesting. Mount and blade is renowned for it's complex systems for calculating damage accuracy and speed, and the way they introduced guns fits perfectly into this. You see, the guns, like any weapon real life or (good) fantasy, have both pros and cons.Starting off with the pros, guns are incredibly powerful. A good shot to a person can very easily kill them instantly, and someone without a shield (something the game encourages by making them a bit pricey) can't block the shot. That on it's own would be ridiculously powerful, but it is weighed against the incredibly long reload times, limited shots and incredible inaccuracy. The weapons are treated by the game to be a sort of glass cannon: Incredibly powerful, but on it's own? Useless. Anyone with a mind wouldn't ride on their horse with a gun and without a sword. This makes for some incredibly interesting strategy and thought to be combined with the weapon, as is usual with the series.The second difference is in troop management. The player can only recruit so many troops from villages at the beginning, this means that they cannot stack up troops as they would in the other two games. Instead soldiers in the earlier game are comprised almost if not entirely of mercenaries. If this were how it were in Warband, the game would be absolutely unplayable. In With fire and sword, however, there are some major changes. Firstly, the mercenaries you build your armies out of can be hired as much as you like from a mercenary camp, and more interestingly, at a mercenary camp you can actually choose what gear your troops have (Much like with companions, although a bit less customizable)This allows you to tailor your army however you like it, albeit at a cost.  This feature is incredibly fun and interesting, although I believe it should have been optional to have the village recruitments for the most part turned off in the beginning, to allow more freedom.A downside to With Fire and Sword though is the lack of mods. This is of course not the fault of the developers, and much more the fanbase. The game didn't hit as much success as Warband did with the community, despite how well the game compares to it, and so the mod base, compared to Warband, is empty. This is a catastrophic shame, although even without mods the game on its own still has much merit.The game also isn't quite as memorable as the other games were. While the other games had their own original nations, With Fire and Sword draws more from actual history, and so contains real nations exclusively. This means that, while they are different culturally and strategically, they aren't as exuberant and different as the ones in the original games. The original two had everything from the desert dwelling Sarranids to the steppe venturing Khergits and snow wandering Vaegirs. While you could see the cultures they were drawn from, it was still interesting to see them all interacting with one another, and they were distinctly different. Not as many people know the difference between Russian troops and Polish ones as people do Viking and Arabian ones. These features aren't inherently bad, though. They can appeal greatly to a history buff with a passion for the 17th century. It is simply that these features aren't as appealing to a wide audience. Don't let me dissaude you though, With Fire and Sword is a wonderful game, even if you aren't as into history as some other people are. It holds up extremely well to it's counterparts and in some ways surpasses it. And, if you enjoyed either of the first two games, I highly reccomend you give this one a try, even if you don't like the game in the end, you won't regret any time spent in it.			"

												I've got mixed feelings about this one, and generally I don't vote no. In this case though, the game feels incredibly unpolished. I'll take on missions that appear to be identical (confronting village raiders at midnight) and sometimes arrive with my men and armed, sometimes arrive by myself and unarmed. That's just one example, but it exemplifies my general impression. The game is a black box. Surely something made the difference, but there was no obvious notice in advance. Trial and error is really the way to proceed and that irritates the hell out of me.The battles feel gritty and historically grounded. If you have the patience for this sort of attention to detail at the expense of a smooth ride, the game is probably for you. I, on the other hand, have become incredibly impatient.UPDATED: Ingri is a badass. Apparently the only useful woman in the time period, who makes up for her fellow females (who give no quests, and can provide no information or services) by outshining every other NPC. Once I had her in the party and started getting into trading the game became much more managable. I still think the game could use a lot more polish, but if you're willing to get over the learning curve it's incredibly fun, especially at the price point.			"

												M&B: With Fire & Sword is my favourite game out of the Mount & Series. It's more or less an RPG set during the Deluge in Eastern Europe in the 1600s. Join an army, or rebel against the powers including Poland, Sweden & Russia. My favourite part of the game is slowly developing your character in a way that is similar to that of The Elder Scrolls games (skills, inventory, quests, etc,.) and travelling across the map to hire soldiers and unique mecernaries for your army.I had one problem with the game and that was completing the main quest which proved impossible as I didn't follow the instructions properly, didn't complete the required tasks in a specific amount of time or committed actions earlier which halted the development of the story. I could not complete the game from this point and had to start again, it's wise to save your game before undertaking big quests.Despite the story problem, I love this game and I had alot of fun playing it!8.5/10			"

												This game is the ultimate add on to Warband other than Napoleonic Wars, it is probably the most intricate and highly competitive game that there is out there on Steam. Everything about the mechanics makes you want to try harder so that you can master anyone. This game does have guns, but not the sought you would find on COD. Imagine bieng a Musketeer where you have to make use of your entire inventory in order to rack up some kills. Once you buy this game, you will have invested into a very difficult but highly satisfying learning curve that can only be improved through hours of dedication. This really is not like a typical FPS where whoever clicks first wins.			"

												I enjoyed Warband greatly and had high hopes for With Fire & Sword.  The most frustrating part of this game is the constant overrunning by the AI.  It seems like one day I defeat their great army and the next they are back in full force.  I can't get ahead and have found this to be a huge detriment to the game.  I do like the enhancements made from Warband to this version though.  Mostly that involves the interface in towns, fortresses and the like.  Other than that, I found Warband a much more enjoyable game and more reasonable AI.			"

												Warband is the better game, but if you enjoy the setting, the historic appeal of F&S should be enough to keep you into it, despite some blandness/drabness, much of the same and the lack of a fully fleshed out map. Being based on a 19th century Polish novel, minor historical inaccuracies can be forgiven. That said, it has a great soundtrack and i enjoyed the change of pace and locale for what it's worth.			"

The five nations are... Muscovite Tsardom ( Russia), Polish Commonwealth ( Poland), Kingdom of Sweden ( Swedish-held territory), Cossack Hetaman ( Cossacks), and Crimean Khanate ( The Tatars).

												Guns are so op in this game it's amazing this could have come out with the game. I love the Mount and Blade series and really loved Warband. And I think they had a lot of ideas right in fire and sword (mainly having village elder and what not as a clickable option so I don't have to run around towns trying to find the elders) but the guns in this game ruin it. First mission with the bandits I get head shot before I even reach the enemies. Nothing more annoying then being on some NPC's no-scope, across the map, head shot montage video. I have high hopes for this series because it looks like it's going in the right way, but I can't recommend this game because the combat is so broken, and for a game which revolves around combat it's to big an issue to not be adjusted.

												While this game may not have the charm of M&B:Warband, it definitely scratches that itch to command an army of musket wielding troops and watch them pepper an army of idiot peasants trying to run screaming away from you.The game itself is much like the rest of the series, start out with almost nothing but the weapons and a horse you are assigned by difficulty, then complete 'quests', join a faction and try to rule the world.  A cast of semi interesting characters join you on your ride through fake history as you lay waste to the country-side.The customizable troops you can get is a nice touch, and if you get enough cash (eventually you will via plunder or trade) you can effectively travel with an army of epic geared troops, slaughtering everything in your (or your lords) name.Story?  Bah who needs one in this style of game?  Your story is the story, basically making it so you yourself get to design your own story by destroying army after army.  Or die trying.  And stuff.Open world games are easy to get lost in, and while the graphics are dated (but being able to display 200+ troops in a FPS styled RTS is impressive in it's own right) there are worse things in life.I strongly recommend this game for people who wish that M&B had muskets instead of crossbows, as while the story isn't a big leap, the combat definitely feels fresh.  Skyrim this may not be, but in Skyrim you can't honestly lead 200+ troops around attacking people/villages at random or capture yourself a few castles without some serious modding.Also look into the mods/DLC for this game if you like multiplayer, the community is pretty cool.

												I loved the original M&B, but I hated what they did to the combat system in Warband. This one fixes a lot of those issues. Overall, it's the same game. There are some minor tweaks, a few new additions (the obvious guns/grenades), and a better combat system. However, the game feels a little stale if you played the others. It's certainly worth buying...if it's on sale.			"

												The campaign mode is brilliant. If you are looking at the screen shots and thinking maybe the graphics are not that great don't be put off. They are pretty good, the animations are good. The combat is superb, I have never played anything with such great horse mounted combat. The controls are very responsive and well thought out. All in all a fantastic game with a long life span and high replay value. The introduction of muskets and flint locks is also very cool.  Great franchise.			"

												A decent game, it is sort of a step down from warbands, though it has some nice additions.  You can no longer start your own kingdom in this game, but you have firearms and grenades, as well as stores in castles instead of major cities and various other additions that make up for the few things that were removed.  The game also supports 3D vision with no bugs (at least none I have encountered)			"

												Mount & Blade the game is a wonderful creature. I've played many hours in this franchise, throughout several games, and I am nothing short of amazed. The basis for the game is so simple, I often wonder why more developers haven't tried something like this, but then I get knocked off a siege ladder for the second consecutive time by my screaming comrades, and feel like playing Call of Duty 36.This installment is a magnificent addition to the franchise - perhaps less-so on the RTS side of it, but definitely moreso on the combat/castle siege part of it. And that's one of the most beautiful parts to the game: There are many sides to it!Though slightly more limited than some of its predecessors (mods included), WF&S is an explosive entry into an explosive era in our world history: The era of the discovery and hugely widespread use of powder weapons.Being a generally combat-based game, this is the feature which I believe shines the most -- another facet of combat.Firearms bring an entirely new level of gameplay. Crossbows had a similar feel, but the sensation of riding down fleeing cossacks and driving a pistol ball into the small of their backs is hard to replicate without the resounding BOOM of a gun. You can really feel the concussion of many of these weapons. The graphics of them are at some points breathtaking. You trot several yards toward a distant wood-hewn fort, your many ranks of men beside you, having temporarily discarded your horses, and the fog is so thick, you can still barely make out the outline of the structure, though you know you must be close now. Suddenly, cries of germanic slang echo across the misty gully in front of a suddenly evident wooden wall, and more obviously, the gunshots follow, their concussions cutting through the haze like thunderclaps.Watching the blasts of powder-powered weaponry atop the walls of a wooden fort was all I needed to justify my purchase of this game.Then I got pushed off a siege ladder again.

												This version of the game sucks. Gameplay and story are about the same as the other games except that when you are taken prisoner, you lose nearly everything, including inventory items and equipped things such as muskets, pistol, etc leaving you with absolutely nothing. Most enemy troops are faster than you so they can run you down and kill you over and over I was captured 8 times in a row losing everything over and over. You can't recuirt troops like the other games in fact it seems as if you can't get any troops unless you buy mercenaries at outrageous prices. Oh and the armor sucks, so most of the time it's one shot kills. Do not buy unless you intend on being frustrated and bored of losing battle after battle even on easy mode.			"

												This game rewards all of the traits that have given real life warlords success: valuing quality over quantity when building an army, making powerful allies, being patient, being ruthless, picking your battles, knowing when to retreat and when you can afford to take risks.I believe if you play this game at any difficulty, you're going to be challenged and rewarded. While Warband was in many ways better and contained more depth, the combat system was a bit too easy. With the addition of firearms in this game, any careless misstep can result in losing a battle, losing an army, losing hours of investment.This game is rough around all edges, is buggy as hell, and can get tedious. It's also one of the purest strategy games around, with an often gleeful third person combat system to boot.			"

												This iteration of M&B adds guns (pistols, muskets) as well as a new map with new factions (not fantasy - Cossacks, Crimeans, Muscovites. Poles, and Swedes). As a result, much of the game's presentation is historical in nature. You'll see references to people like Jan Sobieski and Cardinal Richelieu. Nonetheless, WFAS still enables the same level of flexibility as other M&B games. Want to be a bandit? Sure. King? Done. Trader? At your leisure.If I had to voice any complaints it would be that there are no tournaments (RIP ez cash farming) and no marriage system. Highly recommend.			"

												Ponies & Guns: With Guns & More Guns is the tale of a brave and stupid random mercenary dude and his quest to create a gunline so that his troops easily win every single battle. Together with a ""not vampire"" and a Frenchman with a deep hatred for the 3 musketeers, he sets out to help whichever random Eastern Block faction he sees fit. I recommend the Cossacks. They fight for freedom, which I can only assume means they love America.			"

HOWEVER!I strongly suggest buying any other mount and blade game simiply because this is the worst in the series, Warband is thousands of times better and has mods that can pretty much make this game obselete and not just that, BUT the mods that can make this game over in Warband have more things in it. So even though this game is not too bad on its own, Warband or even standard ol MAB is better, but Warband is the best choice you have.			"

(save for the octosexual trans-mollusk bit, but you can pretend)M&B: WF&S is a great game. if you liked M&B: WB. I can almost garantee you will like this game. now let's just jump in*pros*-Guns (muskets and wheel-lock rifles at least)-Grenades (booming intensifies)-Sweden (YES!)-Bar fights (stickemup *hic*)-making money is not some sort of feat like in WB (but everything is more expensive)-better recruting system*cons*-No tournaments (sadness intensifies)-Guns are OP until higher levels (1hit kill till you have 15 armour)-no sea raiders I don't think (drinks from skull while crying)-Swedish Curassiers (WHY ARE YOU SO HARD TO KILL!)-Tutorial level gives you no freedom (at lest the tutorial is voiced)-still looks like a potato on max settings (at least I can play at 150-200 fps on my rig)So, in all. there could have been a few more features I would have liked to see in F&S, but I still like it. I still strongly reccomend getting Mount and Blade: Warband first.Hope it helps			"

												It was a late night in Bread Village we had been sieged for over 10 days with continuously attacks, the men was starting to get tired and our morale was getting low. Then on the 11th day me and my men attacked the enemies base with great success but worse thing happend meanwhile, when we started to march home again you could hear the agonisingly screams from afar from the village where we lived. When we enterd the village you could se corpses lying on the ground for some reason it was only villagers from our village. We asked one of the survivors that was badly hurt and lying on the ground what had happend when we where gone, the only thing he said was ""HAIL THE BREAD!"" continuously while shaking. As he would said nothing more we want deeper into the village at the main hall where most of the survivor where they all stared at us and chanted ""The Bread"". A feel of dread slowly creeps over me. One of the survivors is my best commander and I ask him what the hell is going on. He then slowly starts walking towards me, and i notice that all other survivors are doing the same. I notice that they are all completely naked and they are all covered in flour and some of them have burnmarks on their skin. Their chants increase,""THE BREAD, THE BREAD!"". I saw that in their hands they are holding big white bread loafs, and slowly one step at the time they are coming closer and my commander is holding a huge sack of flour. I start yelling ""WHATS HAPPENING"" but no answers are given, i cant find and escape they have surrounded me and are continuously chanting ""THE BREAD!"". They are so close to me i can smell the delicious bread. They suddenly stopped when they where one meter from me their chanting was starting to fade away. One of them said ""What bussnies do you have with the holy bread?"" i answered ""what BREAD?!"". The moment i said that they started furiously chanting ""THE BREAD!"" one of then hit me with the bread in my face. Then the chanting faded again. One of them said ""The Bread is all that is holy and sacred do you offer your life for the Bread and is willing to sacrifise every thing for it. I think to myself what is this madness about this bread? the whole village has lost its mind. I screamd you are all INSANE! Then everything got dark...Based on an ingame experience10/10			"

												The only competition for Mount & Blade is another Mount & Blade.With Fire & Sword has been announced as ""More M&B, now also with a story"". It is basically a mod provided by the developers themselves, with a new (historical) map of Eastern Europe, new balancing and some tweaks. This is not M&B 2 or Warband 2, it is just a stand-alone Warband mod. The story takes place in a few ""epic"" quest chains, which offer a little more than the bare-bones open world medieval warfare simulator which the main game has always been. It is still 95% make-your-own-game open world, just spiced up a little.Be warned, difficulty is insanely high. You will try and fail many times before you even learn how to hold your own, let alone become powerful enough to win any significant battle unaided. I was originally surprised how bad the balancing and code quality were, but the post-launch patches have corrected many flaws and made it playable. Still frustratingly hard, but rewarding if you persist long enough.			"

												If you're considering buying this game, I would recommend purchasing Mount and Blade: Warband first. Fire and Sword pales in comparison. It has a drab and boring overland map, repetitive scenes, only semi-original factions, and the most annoying tutorial in the history of everything. Fire and Sword does bring a few new concepts to the Mount and Blade table however. It offers massed firearm combat along with swords, pikes, bows, etc. It also offers a few ""campaign quests"" which are simply longer than normal quests with fancy names. There are plenty of mods for Mount and Blade: Warband that offers just as much as this game does. Which isn't much.6.5/10			"

												Some might call this the black sheep of the series because of the plain and repetitive pattern on the mapscreen and in the towns/villages but this is what this game has that the other didn't have. GUNS n' GRENADES. You are pinned down behind a weak pine tree. You've taken out every cavalry the enemy lord had to send by his riflemen got your number. And what is it that caused your death behind that tree? THEIR GUNS. Another example, you are up against a big stack o' baddies and are armed to their teeth with swords and sturdy armor. What did you use to reduce their platoon to a meat rain? That's rite. GRENADES. But some might also nitpick on the swinging controls and such but personally I don't see that as a problem. To me, Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword have got everything the other ones had and more to it. 8 outta 10 :)			"

												OH MAH LAWRDAlright so you just randomly feel like you need a game where you can turn the tide of any battle with simple commands? Or perhaps you just need to see and hear swords clashing? Or maybe you like muskets? I like muskets.For a great single and multiplayer game Mount and Blade has a lot to offer. Anything from gear, mods, weapons, countries, ect. But wait...The campaign has a FULLY nagivational map! Searching through a vast land to find mercanaries, getting dragged away from your home by bandits, losing your stuff, burning bridges for money, taxing citizens then keep their money to yourself. Let's not forget....SEIGEING CASTLES!♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥yeah. Climbing several ladders to reach a only certain death, hiding behind your only sense of hope wishing for the rain of arrows to end, charging head first with 200 or more units screaming for dear life. Open field fights are pure chaos with swords every which way. I swing one sword to kill a soldier from behind and suddenly another blocks it. But then the line infantry are firing at my guys. Oh my. The good-Amazing combat and block system-Tons of weapons-Muskets-Spears-Expansive campaign with endless possiblities-Doesn't suck-You can hire whoever you want, pillage who you want, marry who you want, and be held captive all in the same moment.-Easy yet frusterating sword play-Arrows hurt The bad-Naploneic wars is only for Mount and Blade Wardband plus you have to pay for it. Another downfall is people. Everybody online just want to charge you. Join a clan for line fighting. It is worth it.-Warband is better by a long shot but Fire and Sword offers gun play to any battle-Sometimes swords or spears don't register and you end up in the wrong-A.I. for huge battles online (By yourself in your own server) charge straight to the wall and just start pushing themselves until they die.-A.I. are not very smart-The command system is ok but units do react fast enough to form two lines or hold position-The game is very slow to begin and building an army can take forever. 9 times out of 10 ex military will just kill your small party and take all your♥♥♥♥♥♥ -The starting quests suck-Finding the weapon you want is hard but buying it is even harder. Espically if it is going to break or be lost easily.-By the time you get to a seige battle neither side wants you involved.-It is hard to find certain people for quests. I can't find the king of red land while the king of green land is in purple land-Frusterating movement system (Map wise) Bandits or♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bags run into you as often as possilbe-Money is hard to come buy -You have to provide food for your partyBuy it.

Map is bland and boring, devoid of any work or effort, the factions are really hard to distinguish from each other, obtaining new soldiers is a joke and while there are new weapons, such as muskets and pistols, you could have easily downloaded a free mod for the same experience. 4/10 Wish I never bought it, I had more fun with the free TF2 items that can with this game if you preordered.

												Fun until you get defeated by cheating enemys. Honestly the game slowly decays as the quests are less and less intresting and just plain boring. Campaigns are rare. Most quests you get are just to send a blank message from one lord to another. You will also notice times when the AI pretty much cheats the game and a group of enemys fire the muskets at you and regardless of how fast or which direction you go, They will instantly hit you. Above all, There are almost no combat missions, That once important ""Ransom a girl from bandits"" Quest is all there is to fight in mostly as you will notice that there is almost no bandits. Losing all your gear is pretty much always a bad thing. Mostly when you lose all your rare and favorite items. But instead of fixing that, They make it so that you lose all your good gear regardless of how hard it is to get. This game clearly only gets a 5/10. An average game. Not because of it's graphics or it's general setting. It is because of the bugs, Lack of content and other stuff. I really, Really want to give it a higher rate but I can not.			"

												Get Mount and Blade: WarbandHonestly, I like using guns, but with this game, I ended up using bows since I couldn't even hit point blank (I've even tried using cheats to mod the skill to the highest to see if it did anything). Guns have a lot more range than bows, but I can snipe a lot of people with bows since they are a lot more accurate. Of course, on easy, the AI is so bad that sometimes, they will stand in a line while I stand to the side just sniping and killing at the same spot. If I do it with a gun, I miss 4/5 times. The  storyline is heavily bugged. Currently, according to the game, I became Tsar and Raven became Tsar afterwards. The former Tsar is still present as a Tsar, though. I've interacted with the former Tsar and he was given a castle by Raven (which I took from our enemies to begin with). I betrayed Raven so that I could become Tsar, but I can't do anything that a Tsar can do. (I've even followed the walkthrough exactly for this quest.) I've finally resorted to downloading a save game editor, but there is no support for With Fire and Sword while there is support for Warband. You might as well just go for Warband due to mods and lack of support for this game.			"

												Really fun AND it is pretty cheap(While off sale, it is $10USD, on sale it is $2.50 or so)Compared to Warband, it's go it's ups and downs.Upside to this over Warband:Guns and grenades, Thalers actually matter, you can't tank an army of 500 with only 20 troops.Downside of it not being Warband:You can't run your own nation(Well, name it & get other nobles to join you.)Ultimately, I'd suggest you get Warband, as WFaS is actually just a mod for Warband. You can get Warband along with WFaS just by getting Warband.			"

												I've always been in the ""Graphics don't make a game"" camp and I can safely say this is true in this case. You won't play any of the Mount & Blade titles for the graphics. I think what grabs my attention most about the game is the longevity, playability and sandbox feel to the game. There is freedom in the game to a certain extent. It's like Freelancer but with horses and hatchets. I am really enjoying with Fire & Sword as you have the Musketeer and Swashbuckling era of history. Shooting a Slav Brigand from his horse with your flintlock musket as he charges your lines of musketeers is very satisfying!			"

												you know that old warband game they had a few years back? well they just turned a T.U.R.D. into a classix! i mean this game has everything, and really streamlines the old warband formula!like you know how there were all those BORING character customization options? well they just got rid of them all! you can't even play as a girl (phew, we all know we dont want girl gamers in this one!) and guns make this game hardcore as hell. gone are the days of needing to spend time training troops when you can just give a few barely upgraded peasants a gun and BLAMMO! you'll be taking down enemy armored calvary in no time! but that works both ways, so you better watch out for the pinpoint accurate flintlock muskets out there (they one shot you in full plate armor just like real life!) yeah uhh this games great i give it a 7/10. needs more hot chicks tbh (10/10 gameplay 10/10 graphics 10/10 hardcores but only a 5/10 in hot babes (they're just not that hot in this one)			"

												Ye olde battles move forward with Mouht and Blade: With Fire & Sword. Loosely based on a historic fantasy novel, experience the conflicts between waring nations from the eyes of a mercenary captian for hire. The addition of firearms and other changes will give those familiar with the previous Mount & Blade games something new to experience, if not something to be alittle frustrated about. Dont expect to charge head long in a grand calvary charge. Muskets turn your thick full plate into a screen door. And there's no founding your own kingdom, it's either swear yourself to a king, or live your life as a hunted rebel			"

												Some might call this the black sheep of the series because of the plain and repetitive pattern on the mapscreen and in the towns/villages but this is what this game has that the other didn't have. GUNS n' GRENADES. You are pinned down behind a weak pine tree. You've taken out every cavalry the enemy lord had to send by his riflemen got your number. And what is it that caused your death behind that tree? THEIR GUNS. Another example, you are up against a big stack o' baddies and are armed to their teeth with swords and sturdy armor. What did you use to reduce their platoon to a meat rain? That's rite. GRENADES. But some might also nitpick on the swinging controls and such but personally I don't see that as a problem. To me, Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword have got everything the other ones had and more to it. 8 outta 10 :)			"

												Mount & Blade: WFaS is an awesome game that combines the amazing gameplay from Warband with a twist of gunpowder, this minor addition alters the whole game darastically. This game is hard at first, it requires correct judgment of reach and speed whilst also challenging you to think about what direction to attack from. You can attack and parry from 4 sides, slash/parry from left, slash/parry from right, slash/parry overhead attacks as well as stab. The controls are very simple, a simple click and flick of the mouse in a particular direction will give you your attack/parry. The gameplay in this game is a mix of RPG, Strategy and Action, you will be controlling a main character, leveling them up and giving them weapons and armour. When you are in combat you will also be commanding an army (if you have decided to recruit troops) the commands are very simple, such as; hold, move up, charge and hold fire (with fire and  sword feature only).In short this game has given me hours of fun.

												Fire and Sword adds only what is seen in the pictures. It takes away every feature that made Warband accessible and enjoyable.  Tournaments, Productive Enterprises, Plunder and razing of villages, new faction creation from captured castles, recruiting from villages (replaced with a Mercenary Camp at every faction), and the ability to have a marriage. I played this enough to realize this is a downgrade not an upgrade. The map in singlepalyer is dull, mountainless, and has the same skirmish map for nearly every encounter. Guns in their current state are realistic in the fact that they destroy your health bar. This can be a very heavy imbalance when you cannot gain money to buy armor, buy recruits, and equipment. My friends and I could not have fathomed how disappointed we would be when we actually played the game. If you want a warband that has muskets and a historical setting, try Old Frontier 1755. I am only voicing my honest opinion.			"

												I don't know why people feel this one's the weakest of the series, but that's a bunch of hoo-ha.  If you like Mount & Blade and you're willing to adopt new tactics and accept a new playstyle, you're in for a treat in the gunpowder era!			"

												I don't understand why lots of people hate on this Mount and Blade. Sure, its not as awesome as Warband, but it will still give you a similar feeling of what Warband did. The feature I miss the most is being able to name your kingdom. Instead, whenever you take a castle, it just makes it ""blah blah (Rebels)"" My dad managed to take every castle for himself, BY HIMSELF. He was his only vassal.			"

												Mount and Blade has always had a method that works quite well.  Honestly, I woried that it would be broken with gunpowder, but they still managed to pull it off quite nicely.  You can copy/paste my review of Warband for this, but it has a different feel due to the new age.  Its best to treat this and Warband as completely different games.			"

												Originally a mod for Mount and Blade, With Fire and Sword was picked up by the developers and made into an independent game with some of their own little additions and polishing. This game comes with a lot of really awesome improvements to the original and Warband. But some of these improvements aren't all that awesome in reality. Most of it will come down to your tastes and the changes are too many to list. None of these specifically are game changers though and I would NOT recommend you buying this game before you play Warband a lot. The main problem with this approach though is, if you've played Warband and spent a lot of time playing the many mods for Warband. You'll realize that the improvements this game includes aren't necessarily better than what you get with Warband. And the amount of Mods for WFAS (The amount of which, which are all just minor improvements and can be counted on your hand.) are not nearly half as awesome, or not even 1/100th as plentiful as the mods for Warband. Basically, if the time period turns you on and you really, really, really liked Warband this is the game for you. If you have never played Warband. DON'T BUY THIS!			"

												This game should just be called ""Mount and♥♥♥♥♥♥ With fire and sword"" It hates you. It hates everything you've ever done and everything you'll ever do and it wants you to know it so bad its♥♥♥♥♥♥has grown teeth just so it can gnash them together at the very thought of you enjoying yourself.If you're familiar with the other mount and♥♥♥♥♥♥games then this game is no different. Its still damn near impenetrable. Its still got a hokey diplomatic/relationship system that feels half realised. The combat still swings wildly between being repedative and annoying to frustrating and annoying. Except now there's guns. Because hey, where's all the fun in a battle if you're not hit and killed the moment you get within line of sight. It plays like a Sisyphus simulator. Except the boulder is your army. You push your army around the map and just when you get things going, you get decimated. repeat. Good if you hate free time.			"

												This game is very very good.  Compared to Warband, it is much easier to die, get captured, etc.  I think this is a good thing.  So many times gamers and critics knock sequels for being a re-skin of the original game.  With Fire & Sword requires a much different tactical approach to both battles and the overworld map.  So if you enjoyed the mechanics of Warband and would like to expand your tactical horizons, With Fire & Sword is for you.			"

												This game is a standalone xpac for one of my all time favorite franchises, Mount & Blade, but with historical factions and guns.  The fighting takes place in the 1650s during the Cossack uprising in Poland.  The game was a bit of a disappointment at release, due to some missing features (especially if you're coming from M&B: Warband) and a lot of bugs.  Its still buggy but its playable, especially with mods.  The SP is more story/quest driven than Warband, but make no mistake that its a sandbox game.  My favorite addition that it brings to the table is MP Captain mode, which allows you to control a squad of bots against other players or fight alongside them in cooperative mode.  This mode is actually really great; its fun to use your SP squad skills in MP, but there aren't a lot of people playing it anymore.  Overall Its a flawed game, but still a good one.			"

Like the entire Mount and Blade series, With Fire and Sword blends 1st-person fighting with Real-Time-Strategy and battlefield tactics harmoniously. With entertaining gameplay and well-written stories, M&B:WFS is easily one of my favorite games. Roleplaying is enjoyable and fulfilling, and you'll never run out of ways to fight. Truly a wonderful experience for all!			"

												Let me be clear: This game had many issues at launch, and some are still being ironed out... But it's a completely awesome game to compliment my favorite game from 2010, Warband. I love the map, the settings, and the campaign. The MP has some issues with Battle, but I never bought this for MP - the COOP is where it's at if you're looking to play with friends. Again, nothing about this game is perfect, and it's hardly for everyone - but I love how open it is. It's almost like ""create your own story.""			"

												While the campaign is next to neverending (I have not even finished it myself, and have only been able to eliminate two factions in the course of the game)  the multiplayer is pretty fun.  My favorite type of game is Captain Co-op in which you and everybody else leads a squad of six soldiers which can be upgraded as the round progresses.  There are 30 rounds in each multiplayer game (assuming your team can survive that long) in which after each 10 waves the enemy gets stronger.  Overall, a fun game in multiplayer.			"

												Mount & Blade: WFaS is an awesome game that combines the amazing gameplay from Warband with a twist of gunpowder, this minor addition alters the whole game darastically. This game is hard at first, it requires correct judgment of reach and speed whilst also challenging you to think about what direction to attack from. You can attack and parry from 4 sides, slash/parry from left, slash/parry from right, slash/parry overhead attacks as well as stab. The controls are very simple, a simple click and flick of the mouse in a particular direction will give you your attack/parry. The gameplay in this game is a mix of RPG, Strategy and Action, you will be controlling a main character, leveling them up and giving them weapons and armour. When you are in combat you will also be commanding an army (if you have decided to recruit troops) the commands are very simple, such as; hold, move up, charge and hold fire (with fire and  sword feature only).In short this game has given me hours of fun.

												If heaven does exist, then this is exactly what it would be like.Jokes aside this game is crazy fun! (Depending on what kind of person you are and how you like your games roasted that is) I myself bought this game about a year ago to add it to my collection of growing games. I have even placed it in my ""Favorite"" section near Skyrim, Natural Selection 2 and a few other select titles that I enjoy. I hold this game very highly for every aspect it gives to the player. The graphics are far from being good but once you fall in love with the game you can't help but enjoy the not-next-gen graphics. Combat is very basic but can prove to be a nuisance at times. Charging directly towards guns that are pointed in the opposite direction that you are traveling does prove to make matters worse. But hey! It's still fun!I haven't yet begun to find myself tangled in any of the main quests as I'm too busy trying to level my player and increase the size of my party to overtake castles in the name of the Crimean Khanate! Victory for my nation will follow within the next couple hundred hours I invest into this game.In this game you do find yourself running around a lot given the fact the map of the whole game is a whole country. My advice to when you start playing, pres Ctrl + Space. It allows you to travel and wait much faster. Also makes the game less of a headache once you have to travel from Akkerman directly to Moscow (both at opposite sides of the country).During sometime after you get addicted the game does get repetitve in both positive and negative aspects. The quests that nobles give are always the same 10 or so quests the game has. The combat is also repetive in feeling that it is awesoem! You truly have full scale battles against other armies. Victroy feels satifying and Defeat feel like, well defeat. Plus it doesn't help when some of your comrades bring it up to you that you suck.Overall, I can easily say that I recommend this game. The graphics aren't pretty and the combat isn't spectacular. But time and effort you spend into your Player will be more than rewarding. You eventually become attached. You try to talk to your troops and nobles but they never listen. I've never experienced any other of the Warbands but I can gurantee I'd be in love with the others as much as I am with Fire and Sword.			"

												Picture this, you and your men sit on their horses, watching the battle below.  Infantry men battle in the mud, gunners fire into the chaos, cavalry swoop around to attack the flanks.  You see a weakened spot in the enemy lines.  You call to your men, and in a blaze of glory, you charge unto the breach, cutting down the foemen like a scythe through grain.  A loud crack is heard!  Your men beside you start falling from their saddles, ammassed foes with pikes rush towards you.  An ambush!  The enemy had lured you and your men into a trap!  Quickly you turn your horse and run madly from the slaughter, a few of your surviving men follow, while the rest are cut down.   But this was all a ploy!  Allied captains then order a frontal assault, gunshots tear down the enemy lines, cavalry again charge down the center and infantry support them with pikes and swords.  A glorious victory, and the foes flee before your rightous fury!  Epic scale, intense individual combat, and grand strategy, all!~			"

												Ye olde battles move forward with Mouht and Blade: With Fire & Sword. Loosely based on a historic fantasy novel, experience the conflicts between waring nations from the eyes of a mercenary captian for hire. The addition of firearms and other changes will give those familiar with the previous Mount & Blade games something new to experience, if not something to be alittle frustrated about. Dont expect to charge head long in a grand calvary charge. Muskets turn your thick full plate into a screen door. And there's no founding your own kingdom, it's either swear yourself to a king, or live your life as a hunted rebel			"

												If you've played Mount & Blade or its followup, Warband, you've pretty much played this already. The guns are an interesting and challenging addition, but aside from a few minor tweaks and a new map and era based on a book, the game is the same. Warband still feels like a more worthwhile game but the entire Mount & Blade franchise is solid gold in my book. Few games do so much with so little.			"

												Fantastic addition for a great game.  Full of 16th Century style, including some great moments with mounted gunpowder combat.  For anyone who wants to know how a Dragoon fights, or has even a passing interest in the military of Scotland, Sweden, Germany, Eastern Europe or Russia - give it a try.With advanced formation for gunnery, fire on command for lethal volleys, flanking fire, and fast commands for row formations, you couldn't want for more tactical options.  Curassiers, and some great Pikemen complete the mix.			"

The units don't level up as much as they do in Warband, they just turn (veteran) and the mercenaries are lame. I guess I prefer the units in Warband but I also like how there's none of those stupid♥♥♥♥♥Khanate units that all they do is run away the entire fight, and if people want to run away, you blast them with your nine son.

												Mount and Blade is an addictive game where you go about trading and fighting on foot or horseback. Your character upgrades itself as you gain experience. Buy, collect or sell weapons, armour, firearms (Pistols, Muskets, Grenades), different kind of horses, sell prisoners as slaves, recruit troops, etc. The mechanics of fighting is the best part of the game. There are even seiges you can take part in to storm a castle. Fire and Sword is based more heavily on trading than the original version and here are many more castles, and a bigger map. You can even send caravans to trade and in this version, this provides substantial money. Castles and towns can also be developed quite a bit after you own them. You can even order hand-crafted weapons at a steep price and which are slightly better than what you find on the market. Great game!			"

After that this is one of the funnest games I've ever played.At times you'll just want to break your computer because of a headshot KO  or some massive army killing you (took me awhile to learn patience and not immediately start looting villages), but the game just drags you back in because you want to beat it.Really the only criticism I have of this game is how they watered down the quests given by mayors and lords. 90% of the time it's ""hey, deliver this for me"", 9% is ""stop war"", 1% is go kill these baddy bandits (which there aren't even base assaults like warbands which I did enjoy).

												Get Mount and Blade: WarbandHonestly, I like using guns, but with this game, I ended up using bows since I couldn't even hit point blank (I've even tried using cheats to mod the skill to the highest to see if it did anything). Guns have a lot more range than bows, but I can snipe a lot of people with bows since they are a lot more accurate. Of course, on easy, the AI is so bad that sometimes, they will stand in a line while I stand to the side just sniping and killing at the same spot. If I do it with a gun, I miss 4/5 times. The  storyline is heavily bugged. Currently, according to the game, I became Tsar and Raven became Tsar afterwards. The former Tsar is still present as a Tsar, though. I've interacted with the former Tsar and he was given a castle by Raven (which I took from our enemies to begin with). I betrayed Raven so that I could become Tsar, but I can't do anything that a Tsar can do. (I've even followed the walkthrough exactly for this quest.) I've finally resorted to downloading a save game editor, but there is no support for With Fire and Sword while there is support for Warband. You might as well just go for Warband due to mods and lack of support for this game.			"

												It's great and unique, until you get into the quests set up to make you fail. Even if your army is 60 strong, the important quests don't care and will only give you a handful of your men (4-6), or even none at all again 20 or so men!That's the most frustrating part, that your powerful army is of no use while performing some of the most important quests.Secondly, the introduction of muskets destroys any illusion of balance.They're highly innacurate, yes, but it takes just one bullet to take anyone out of the fight. Including you.Ultimately, the fights come down to chance. Do these bullets whizzing past you keep missing, or will one of them hit their mark? The odds are against you, my friend.If games like this suit your fancy, please direct your attention to Mount and Blade: Warband. You will find basically the same game, minus the muskets. Arrows might strike you, but you can at least spot them mid-flight and know when you've been hit.			"

With guns now able to two shot you, you might as well give up being anything but a strong warrior.  Yeah, I guess it's a new improved ""difficulty"" by limited your options, but it kills the beauty of sandbox.  Say you need to track down a murderer.  You and your 20 guys go to the town.  Your skinny butt says ""I got this guys"" and 20 minutes later they drag out your bleeding corpse.  Moral of the story, if you like hack and slash games where you play a tank killing everyone, this is your game.  If you want to be a commander from the start, l2p noob or just skip this one.			"

												This is my least favorite M&B. There are virutally no bandits, due to so many nation patrols, finding bandits for quests can be a hassle, finding people in general is a hassle.The map is huge, which is good and bad. I love that every castle has a market and stuff, shows that the world is growing and on the rise. Fort sieges are tough. I like that, but if the enemy has only people with guns, you can expect to lose a lot before ever reaching the walls. Guns are powerful in this and surprisingly accurate. The mercenary customization is neat, no complaints there. Making your own faction, which we've all done in Warband, don't lie, is a lot harder, seeing as there are often more men in forts now, and then people will come after you, or, on the good side, try to recruit you. Its a fun game, no real complaints other than you can't really free lance, and the quests didn't really catch my attention. Its a good game, but not my game. 8/10 despite my feelings. It deserves it.			"

Watching the Polish hussars bravely charge into your gunline and the musket duel between the lines of musketeers never gets old. You die really fast to random shots though. I was spawned into a village carrying a pistol that needed two shots to kill the enemy, of which there were half a dozen at least. They only needed one shot to kill me. I spawned in the open. That needed some amount of saving and loading to deal with. Fun but with some odd quirks that will annoy you.			"

												If heaven does exist, then this is exactly what it would be like.Jokes aside this game is crazy fun! (Depending on what kind of person you are and how you like your games roasted that is) I myself bought this game about a year ago to add it to my collection of growing games. I have even placed it in my ""Favorite"" section near Skyrim, Natural Selection 2 and a few other select titles that I enjoy. I hold this game very highly for every aspect it gives to the player. The graphics are far from being good but once you fall in love with the game you can't help but enjoy the not-next-gen graphics. Combat is very basic but can prove to be a nuisance at times. Charging directly towards guns that are pointed in the opposite direction that you are traveling does prove to make matters worse. But hey! It's still fun!I haven't yet begun to find myself tangled in any of the main quests as I'm too busy trying to level my player and increase the size of my party to overtake castles in the name of the Crimean Khanate! Victory for my nation will follow within the next couple hundred hours I invest into this game.In this game you do find yourself running around a lot given the fact the map of the whole game is a whole country. My advice to when you start playing, pres Ctrl + Space. It allows you to travel and wait much faster. Also makes the game less of a headache once you have to travel from Akkerman directly to Moscow (both at opposite sides of the country).During sometime after you get addicted the game does get repetitve in both positive and negative aspects. The quests that nobles give are always the same 10 or so quests the game has. The combat is also repetive in feeling that it is awesoem! You truly have full scale battles against other armies. Victroy feels satifying and Defeat feel like, well defeat. Plus it doesn't help when some of your comrades bring it up to you that you suck.Overall, I can easily say that I recommend this game. The graphics aren't pretty and the combat isn't spectacular. But time and effort you spend into your Player will be more than rewarding. You eventually become attached. You try to talk to your troops and nobles but they never listen. I've never experienced any other of the Warbands but I can gurantee I'd be in love with the others as much as I am with Fire and Sword.			"

												Ugh, I hate to♥♥♥♥♥♥on this game simply because I love the hell out of M&B: Warband. However, I don't like this game very much. I would say I hate it, but it's not a bad game per se. Let me explain:The AI is incredibly ♥♥♥♥ing lucky. You could be level 30, in the best armor possible, riding the best horse possible, across the entire battlefield, behind trees, over a hill and a town militia will kill you with 1 lucky headshot. Then you lose the battle because your troops go full retard when you die. Also, the mapppp....the Mappppp (da plane, da plane!) Who the hell made this map? The zoomed out view looks like it was done it MS Paint at the last minute. If you haven't seen it, it is basically 1 huge flat area with an ocean to the side of it. It's just insanely huge and flat. There are WAY too many towns and cities. There are just a lot of little things about the game that drive me insane. I wish I could like it. I really do. Guns + Swords + M&B creators = Good game, right? Nope.Sorry M&B. I ♥♥♥♥ing love Warband, I seriously applaud you for that game, but I just cannot play With fire and sword. I give it a 3/10.			"

												For those of you who've played M&B Warband, what you'll find is a somewhat more limited but much more story-driven game, set during a very dynamic era in Eastern Europe's history. It's somewhat more limited as there are fewer 'roleplay' options and the economy seems less well developed, It's much more story-driven because instead of the over-arching ""take over the world"" objective, you have three different stories (Cossack, Muscovite, and Polish) you can engage in and leave 'on the back burner' at any time to return to the free-roaming sandbox world, which still exists largely unchanged from Warband. AI improvements: By default, a pike and shot formation will shelter the shot under the pikes. Ideal for defeating cavalry. Musketeers can kneel and fire. Reloading can be achieved on the move, though at a walk. In terms of the engine, WFAS and Warband are essentially identical, so expect smooth performance on any remotely reasonable gaming computer even at maximum settings.			"

												Not as fun as it's predecessors. You cannot recruit villagers from towns around the map. Spy missions are completely broken, no minimap and you supposed to find 1 exact person in a huge town with no horse. It's like playing GTA without a minimap or a car and your supposed to find someone in the entire map. You can get killed by 4 gun shot wounds. Armor is very very useless. +1 defence instead of +6 like warband.			"

Though ""With Fire and Sword"" doesn't add a large amount of new things(namely guns), it does give you a new scenario to deal with and can extend your play time in the M&B universe. Once I've had my fun with guns, I will still be returning to Warband(I prefer arrow filled battles overall).			"

												I am a big fan of the Mount & Blade games but when I read the discription of this one I didn't think I would like it. It sounded like they left the traditional sandbox and went with a quest base game. I also didn't think I would like addition of guns but I was wrong. This game is still the awsome game I have grown to love. It seems a little harder and the guns change the stratagy a lot but it is still the best game ever. These are true sandbox games. Hard to get started but loads of fun. If you don't have it you should.			"

												I was an avid player of warband, having logged many hours even before I bought the steam version.  (I would guess something like 1000 hours in warband)  regardless, I got the collector pack even though I owned warband already just to try this... mod.  The game removes alot of content that I liked about warband.  marriage and courtship have been removed.  You play for what seems like a very long time and then cant join a faction.  (buggy and broke)  No matter how high level you get a lvl 1 peon can one shot you with a musket if you are not contantly weaving on your horse to the point of sore hand joints.  Generating money in this game feels like work compared to warband.  You can't recruit units from villages anymore and train them up.  You can go to merc camps and buy soliders but they have a limited amount.  Even when your mercs level up through training and battle you have to pay to upgrade them, and it's no small amount.  Bottom line is take out most of what is fun about warband and then you get this.  It feels like work, not a game.  Anything battle over say... 1/3 your forces is almost impossible.  I once too out 120 troops with a 78 highly trained merc fighting force, to get garbage drops.  Best is like some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ +3 cloth boots.  Are you kidding me?  What about that lord I just face♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  I don't play on easy but even if you do you can still be one shotted, start of game or accomplished vet doesn't matter.  Frustrating game.  Quests are weak sauce too.  Deliver this message to (insert lord from other faction here who we are at war with) ... well WTF would I deliver stuff to someone i'm trying to kill?  How come you don't know the password for your own treasure?? (slight spoiler)  Don't buy this game.  Stick with warband and it's awsome mod community.			"

So I, a man who has spent over 100 hours on warband, expecting villagers with clubs and pitchforks was met by an army of fully armored, fully armed soldiers who slaughtered my men. I lasted longer by circling them on my horse and shooting them one by one. I then ran out of ammo  and they started using there bodys to slow down my horse. I was then arrested by the Tsar. after that i bought some mercs and stole a castle, And thus how I became The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.			"

												Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword takes place in 17th century Eastern Europe. There are five factions to choose from, the Polish Commonwealth, Muscovite Tsardom, Cossack Hetmanate, Kingdom of Sweden, and Crimean Khanate. Each faction has unique troops each with its pros and cons. There is a leveling system in this game so you can upgrade your character throughout the game. You can play in first person or third person. Throughout the game, you will recruit soldiers to join your troop. They can be upgraded once they have a certain amount of experience. You can also hire mercenaries too. In combat, you can command your troops to form a certain formation. The game is very similar to Mount & Blade: Warband. There is some addition in Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword, there are new weapons such as muskets, pistols, and grenades. There are some UI improvements as well.Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword is quite similar to its predecessor, Warband. The buildings and troop uniform look accurate. The towns and villages look nice. I really like the UI improvements, it's really neat. There are many mods for this game as well.However, there are some bugs and glitches in the campaign. The animation when someone died because of getting shot looks weird. There isn't much ragdoll from the grenades as well. Some aspects of the game, such as the loading screen, aren't optimized for widescreen resolution. There is no Steam Cloud support for this game too.To conclude, despite some of its flaws, Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword is still a very fun and addicting game. I really enjoy the hours I played it.			"

												This game is lots of fun.. There are Basically two Modes  the Campaign mode where you build your character and a custom battle mode where you vs another army..It is very simular to Mdickies World War Alpha even the game machanics of the battles So I will use this for comparisons for those of you who have played it..The Custom mode is like Deathmatch mode in WOrld War alpha only you can only have 2 sides in M&B not up to six in WWAThe Campaign mode is like WWA storymode too But the way you move around the Map is different.. WWA is like playing risk while M&B is kind of like the way they do it with the Might and magic games only realtime not turn basedWWA has more weapon types then M&B and the melee combat is done better in WWA But the guns are done much better in M&B and WWA does not have horses while M&B does..M&B is  a more indepth game overall then WWA because it also involves making decisions, leveling up you charator, doing side quest, Buying and tradingI would say it will keep you entertained for longer based on that If you already own M&B and still want more I do also recommend trying WWA.. its a bit more arcady and its a free download from MDickies site But still Buy this Because this does have a lot more to it.. and you wont regret buying M&B.

												I like the idea of a pike and shot campaign but this game was executed kind of poorly.Firstly, the battles aren't very fun after the novelty of gunpowder weapons wears off. The enemies often start way too close to you for you to give orders and try to win the battle tactically. This is especially bad for the era this game is set in. The effectiveness of muskets seems too random. Sometimes they will annihilate groups of soldiers, and sometimes they will do absolutely nothing. It's really frustrating when the enemy moves slowly enough to let me get 3 volleys off and my line of musketeers just hits no one. The worst thing is fighting the Crimean Khanate when they start really close and rush you with loads of cavalry before you can do anything at all.The problem with the sandbox map is that there are no large bandit groups. You want to practice and train your men on lowly bandit armies? You want someone to fight while your nation is not at war? Well forget that because bandits and rebels only come in groups of about 15. You can only have large battles against professional armies, which makes it  hard to train new recruits when they all die to large numbers of high tier soldiers. Not to mention attacking factions comes with consequences.There are some new features that I liked. For example, you can now go to a mercenary camp and recruit large numbers of soldiers like a standing army, and even buy them equipment. I had fun spending time and money equiping my army but then half of them died in their first battle. But other than a few things, the game is mostly unchanged from Warband. The main difference is the setting.You might like this game if you are going to try really hard and be patient, but for me it just isn't as fun as Warband. If you are new to Mount and Blade, I suggest getting Warband instead of this. M&B is just more suited to the medieval setting and Warband feels more complete.			"

												This iteration of M&B adds guns (pistols, muskets) as well as a new map with new factions (not fantasy - Cossacks, Crimeans, Muscovites. Poles, and Swedes). As a result, much of the game's presentation is historical in nature. You'll see references to people like Jan Sobieski and Cardinal Richelieu. Nonetheless, WFAS still enables the same level of flexibility as other M&B games. Want to be a bandit? Sure. King? Done. Trader? At your leisure.If I had to voice any complaints it would be that there are no tournaments (RIP ez cash farming) and no marriage system. Highly recommend.			"

												The most satisfying thing in this game is when an enemy is running at you and you aim your pistol at his face and blast him away right before he reaches you.  And also running over people with a big horsey :)On a more serious note, I highly recommend this game if you are the least bit interested in sword combat and a hint of strategy and controlling your own conquering army.  The neat thing about this game is that while you can look at a map and move your army around the continent, and choose castles and villages to raid or conquer, as soon as you begin a battle, you have the option to join it.  Which means you have your own character that you level up and equip gear to who serves as your army's leader.  So there is both a strategic side as well as a medieval FPS side.  In my opinion it also has a very good replay value.  All in all it's a very well made game and I have enjoyed all 400+ hours of gameplay :)			"

												Prepare yourself to get shot randomly with fire and sword! (HAH!) Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword, is a gem that manages to get interesting the more time you decide to invest in it.The main difference in MB: Warband and MB: With Fire & sword are the few but more interesting quests and the fact that you cannot survive without a gun. You can try but having a spare gun and some bullets makes your life much easier when fighting certain enemies. Now the one thing that makes me angry with a vicious fury, is the gun's mechanics in this game. Now I'm all for historical accuracy and muskets being inaccurate and unpredictable, but when a peasant from a mile away with a broken and cracked old pistol can headshot me... That's when I lose my sh!t. But it is a minor issue when you manage to play carefully and don't rush into battle without knowing you can win. But of course the unpredictable guns have many times been the reasons I hate this game at times. When one of your strongest soldiers get shot down in a quick charge against 3 bandits, that is not a nice time. The game has many ways for a lone soldier to survive in an eternally conflicted European time in history. Whether it be as merchant or mercenary, loyal subject or lone vigilante. MB: With Fire & Sword has it all. 7/10 - Quicksave (seriously) before ANY  battle.			"

												Gathering an amry is slower than warband. I like it because it is more realistic. I haven't encounter any bugs in native although I haven't completed a full game. I mean this isn't a sandbox and the game does in fact finish. In my current campaign I am following the Polish struggle against the Swedes. The game is based off a famous Polish novels similar to count of monte cristo but it is historical and published during Polish under Prussian, Russian and Austrian annexations.Anyway the lore is solid. There is 3 stories to follow, Cossack and Russian.The combat I found way more interesting then melee in warband. It's Pike and Shot.  "

												I've got mixed feelings about this one, and generally I don't vote no. In this case though, the game feels incredibly unpolished. I'll take on missions that appear to be identical (confronting village raiders at midnight) and sometimes arrive with my men and armed, sometimes arrive by myself and unarmed. That's just one example, but it exemplifies my general impression. The game is a black box. Surely something made the difference, but there was no obvious notice in advance. Trial and error is really the way to proceed and that irritates the hell out of me.The battles feel gritty and historically grounded. If you have the patience for this sort of attention to detail at the expense of a smooth ride, the game is probably for you. I, on the other hand, have become incredibly impatient.UPDATED: Ingri is a badass. Apparently the only useful woman in the time period, who makes up for her fellow females (who give no quests, and can provide no information or services) by outshining every other NPC. Once I had her in the party and started getting into trading the game became much more managable. I still think the game could use a lot more polish, but if you're willing to get over the learning curve it's incredibly fun, especially at the price point.			"

												Gun powder weapons spice up the action but the muskets are WAY too over powered. This game takes place around the 16th century when guns weren't very reliable and insanely inaccurate, but in With Fire & Sword, you can snipe someone from about 200 feet away and get a freaking headshot on them about 80% of the time. This goes for singleplayer and multiplayer. Mounted units can still destroy any unit, which is fine. It's fun running over people while on horseback. You can recruit armies quickly with several types of mercenaries, it is easier to manage towns, earn money, and there are more options to manage your armies now in battle. It's pretty cool getting a few dozen musket units all lined up in a row and fire at the same time. Grenades do exactly what you would think. Blasting a hole into the side wall of a castle and charging in is certainly alot faster and easier then using ladders during sieges. There's plenty of mods you can find to set your fix, just like the other Mount & Blade games. There are some other improvements here and there over Warband, but I think Warband is still the must have game out of this series and stand alone expansions. With Fire & Sword is still worth getting in my eyes; you'll just have to get used to the additions of guns and other new modes and features. "

												Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword is an interesting.. Sequel/Standalone whatever it is to Mount and Blade and Mount and Blade: Warband.While it proudly boasts the classic Mount and Blade style game play, allowing you free roam to do whatever you please in the world, be it conquer it, hunt bandits, or even just run caravans, there are a few things that make it exceptionally notable from the original game and it's sequel.The first, and most likely the most noticably, is the guns. Unlike the original and Warband, which were set in a medieval-esque setting, fit with Crossbows, Bows and Throwing weapons as the only ranged weapons, With Fire and sword is placed in the 17th century Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth, and, as such, the game features guns. Most people see this in the game, and are offput by it (Much like many were to Age of Empires III) figuring it to be game-ruining or cheap. Taleworlds are smarter than that though, and the method to which they added guns is quite interesting. Mount and blade is renowned for it's complex systems for calculating damage accuracy and speed, and the way they introduced guns fits perfectly into this. You see, the guns, like any weapon real life or (good) fantasy, have both pros and cons.Starting off with the pros, guns are incredibly powerful. A good shot to a person can very easily kill them instantly, and someone without a shield (something the game encourages by making them a bit pricey) can't block the shot. That on it's own would be ridiculously powerful, but it is weighed against the incredibly long reload times, limited shots and incredible inaccuracy. The weapons are treated by the game to be a sort of glass cannon: Incredibly powerful, but on it's own? Useless. Anyone with a mind wouldn't ride on their horse with a gun and without a sword. This makes for some incredibly interesting strategy and thought to be combined with the weapon, as is usual with the series.The second difference is in troop management. The player can only recruit so many troops from villages at the beginning, this means that they cannot stack up troops as they would in the other two games. Instead soldiers in the earlier game are comprised almost if not entirely of mercenaries. If this were how it were in Warband, the game would be absolutely unplayable. In With fire and sword, however, there are some major changes. Firstly, the mercenaries you build your armies out of can be hired as much as you like from a mercenary camp, and more interestingly, at a mercenary camp you can actually choose what gear your troops have (Much like with companions, although a bit less customizable)This allows you to tailor your army however you like it, albeit at a cost.  This feature is incredibly fun and interesting, although I believe it should have been optional to have the village recruitments for the most part turned off in the beginning, to allow more freedom.A downside to With Fire and Sword though is the lack of mods. This is of course not the fault of the developers, and much more the fanbase. The game didn't hit as much success as Warband did with the community, despite how well the game compares to it, and so the mod base, compared to Warband, is empty. This is a catastrophic shame, although even without mods the game on its own still has much merit.The game also isn't quite as memorable as the other games were. While the other games had their own original nations, With Fire and Sword draws more from actual history, and so contains real nations exclusively. This means that, while they are different culturally and strategically, they aren't as exuberant and different as the ones in the original games. The original two had everything from the desert dwelling Sarranids to the steppe venturing Khergits and snow wandering Vaegirs. While you could see the cultures they were drawn from, it was still interesting to see them all interacting with one another, and they were distinctly different. Not as many people know the difference between Russian troops and Polish ones as people do Viking and Arabian ones. These features aren't inherently bad, though. They can appeal greatly to a history buff with a passion for the 17th century. It is simply that these features aren't as appealing to a wide audience. Don't let me dissaude you though, With Fire and Sword is a wonderful game, even if you aren't as into history as some other people are. It holds up extremely well to it's counterparts and in some ways surpasses it. And, if you enjoyed either of the first two games, I highly reccomend you give this one a try, even if you don't like the game in the end, you won't regret any time spent in it.			"

												If you're looking for a Mount & Blade mod with superb multiplayer, this game isn't for you. It has a couple servers here and there but warband offers so much more, the only reason I'd by this is for the campaign. You cannot create your own faction in this one, but you can go through the story lines of all the factions in the game. Is this Campaign mod really worth that much? up to you. Also it has a squad defence mod where it has u control squads of men with other human players to survive a swarm of bots. Really fun.			"

												This game is fantastic, with a lot of cool things, how you can destroy the story you created by 1 click. It is amazing. The mechanic of the battle is awesome. I love the gigantic♥♥♥♥♥battles of 400 (enemy army) vs 100 (your army) and at the end, you win because you have better equipment. This is what RPG means. Creating your own everything: your own character, your own equipment, your own army, etc. This is definitely one of the best RPGs out there, that isn't very well known. And, I have to say that this is better than Warband. Yes, i said it. Don't buy Warband, buy this. This is 100 times better than Warband. And yes, i played Warband. I don't say that Warband is not a good game. It is a good game, but, With Fire & Sword is a lot better.This game deserves a 9/10. You should buy it right now.			"

												I prefer Warband to this version, but there's some improvements on the singleplayer this title has that make it fun, too.If it wasn't for the setting I didn't really like, I'd have probably loved this title more.Would have preferred a Napoleonic Wars/American Civil War singleplayer to the Russian setting.Still a fun title, though Warband's mods can out-do what With Fire and Sword can offer.

												M&B despite the outdated tech, its one of the best games. (See more under M&B)This Addon play in my favorite scenario, but I cant recommend it to anybody. Cutting options from original and Warband make no sense. M&B is not a storygame like Dragon Age or Witcher. Its the intuitive fighting system and the additional options. Better you read the books of Sienkiewicz. Hope somebody will redo this Addon or make a mode of this scenario for Bannerlord. I recommend it, because its still M&B.Still better, than War of the Roses!5/10			"

												If you like gun powder and history, especially Eastern European History of the 16th century I would suggest be bought with Warband during a deal or when you can afford it.Fight as the devious Cossacks, the bandits of the Crimean Khanate, the Noble Poles or the growing Russians in an era of ever shifting alliances and bloody conflict. You have nothing but your horse, a handful of silver and a silly hat. Now slash, stab, lance or shoot your way to Victory!			"

												It-s an interesting game and would be a lot better if it werent for the quest mechanics. I played this right after finishing Mount and Blade Warband and the way the use of firearms makes you change your strategy gets you thinking. I stopped playing because of the quest mechanics. It gets a little bit tiresome delivering letters to and for lords. The sidequests which were available in WB, like honing your skills and upgrading your men by taking on bandits, is virtually impossible here because they move too fast on the campaign map. With a little bit of tweaking it could be a lot better. Thumbs sideways. That being said, if you like MB, its worth trying out.			"

												Alright, this is...well nothing compared to Warband. But however it is still good, it has limited options though. The scenery is nice, and such, political aspects aswell, but alot of the options in warband are eliminated. Marriage is, so are founding your own factions, etc. The game itself is good, but napoleonic wars is extremely better. The formations and such are great, battles are good, but combat with guns is the only good thing to this game really. I like the special quests, but I struggle to find them past ""satisifactory"" level. Mount and blade is supposed to be BETTER than this. It's still good, and I recommend it, but it lacks any depth compared to Warband. Just get Napoleonic wars for multiplayer, but this right here is a worse version of NW for singleplayer. But it's still a 7.2/10. Get it by all means, it's good.GET A BETTER INTERNET CONNECTION RUBBERBANDING NOOB			"

AI is more stupid than in first version of mount and blade, that stupid baricade is what???...everywhere you can be looted, even in cities, you can sleep for night only at castles, you do half dmg to man with pistol, after that another one will shoot you down from horse with one shot, hard as hell on medium, villigers (peasants) are more useless then anytime before, also they will atack enemy one by one more like in mortal combat than mount and blade!!!!! Its most buggy version of mount and blade i ever played.....dont buy this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥..warband works way better..this is only stupid way to get money for the same game with remade armor, and rifles, which  are using the same aim as bow!!! wtf??? why i cant shoot like a normal man in a normal world.....thats not the biggest problem, thats only one of weirdness, more awfull is baricade with entrance, also that thing even 4 deserters riding on thier horses through woods, can build fort from 10 wooden cars in seconds...so they are looting and atacking ppl with full caravan around...also it means two cars for 1 horse...and they are still able to catch you:-D i will try this game more, because the stupidness should be lowered with number of soldiers raising.....but....my first feeling from Warband was..awesome...this made me cry...buy datadisks for warband, like i will do...this dont even look so good and i dont know why, it is not looking like on pictures, and i can raise graphics , i am not stupid....so...worst surprise in this series:-(			"

												Gathering an amry is slower than warband. I like it because it is more realistic. I haven't encounter any bugs in native although I haven't completed a full game. I mean this isn't a sandbox and the game does in fact finish. In my current campaign I am following the Polish struggle against the Swedes. The game is based off a famous Polish novels similar to count of monte cristo but it is historical and published during Polish under Prussian, Russian and Austrian annexations.Anyway the lore is solid. There is 3 stories to follow, Cossack and Russian.The combat I found way more interesting then melee in warband. It's Pike and Shot.  "

												This game seems to be a lot less fun in the early game than Mount & Blade: Warband because it's harder to get started. For instance, you can't simply recruit men from villages and level them up anymore. Also, firearms aren't really that fun to play with, given their inaccuracy and very long reload times. They're interesting, but not fun, at least as far as I could see.I wanted to play more to see if it got better later on, but the performance of this game is terrible. I can run Mount & Blade: Warband with maximum settings and hundreds of men on the field at 200 FPS, but this game on low settings and 20 men on the field gets only 20-50 FPS. (It seems to be more related to terrain than battle size.) It might be okay if the frame rate was at least constant, but it stutters quite a bit, causing the gameplay to speed up and slow down frequently, which messes up the timing in combat. There are numerous forum posts from other people with the same problem, but no good solutions, so I found this game to be essentially unplayable.			"

												This game rewards all of the traits that have given real life warlords success: valuing quality over quantity when building an army, making powerful allies, being patient, being ruthless, picking your battles, knowing when to retreat and when you can afford to take risks.I believe if you play this game at any difficulty, you're going to be challenged and rewarded. While Warband was in many ways better and contained more depth, the combat system was a bit too easy. With the addition of firearms in this game, any careless misstep can result in losing a battle, losing an army, losing hours of investment.This game is rough around all edges, is buggy as hell, and can get tedious. It's also one of the purest strategy games around, with an often gleeful third person combat system to boot.			"

												I loved the ""Fire and Sword"" Trilogy and was excited to play this game.  Unfortunately, compared to Mount and Blade:Warband, it is maddening and terrible for two major reasons:1) Horribly unbalanced.  Having to take on an army of 800 with an army of 70 or 100 is impossible.Takes forever to build up enough steam to make a difference and the friendly AI is brain-dead compared to theenemy AI and the onslaught of large Armies.2) Wagon forts.  Thank God they shot this idea in the head for Warband.  Hate it.  Wish there was a was to disablethe feature for Fire and Sword.  Leads to same frustrating, slow, AI-broken battles, over and over and over. Some of the land battles and castle defenses are great.  The addition of firearms makes things quite challengingas the stray bullet can kill you or your horse at any moment of a battle.			"

												I've got mixed feelings about this one, and generally I don't vote no. In this case though, the game feels incredibly unpolished. I'll take on missions that appear to be identical (confronting village raiders at midnight) and sometimes arrive with my men and armed, sometimes arrive by myself and unarmed. That's just one example, but it exemplifies my general impression. The game is a black box. Surely something made the difference, but there was no obvious notice in advance. Trial and error is really the way to proceed and that irritates the hell out of me.The battles feel gritty and historically grounded. If you have the patience for this sort of attention to detail at the expense of a smooth ride, the game is probably for you. I, on the other hand, have become incredibly impatient.UPDATED: Ingri is a badass. Apparently the only useful woman in the time period, who makes up for her fellow females (who give no quests, and can provide no information or services) by outshining every other NPC. Once I had her in the party and started getting into trading the game became much more managable. I still think the game could use a lot more polish, but if you're willing to get over the learning curve it's incredibly fun, especially at the price point.			"

												Mount and Blade: With Fire and Sword is an interesting.. Sequel/Standalone whatever it is to Mount and Blade and Mount and Blade: Warband.While it proudly boasts the classic Mount and Blade style game play, allowing you free roam to do whatever you please in the world, be it conquer it, hunt bandits, or even just run caravans, there are a few things that make it exceptionally notable from the original game and it's sequel.The first, and most likely the most noticably, is the guns. Unlike the original and Warband, which were set in a medieval-esque setting, fit with Crossbows, Bows and Throwing weapons as the only ranged weapons, With Fire and sword is placed in the 17th century Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth, and, as such, the game features guns. Most people see this in the game, and are offput by it (Much like many were to Age of Empires III) figuring it to be game-ruining or cheap. Taleworlds are smarter than that though, and the method to which they added guns is quite interesting. Mount and blade is renowned for it's complex systems for calculating damage accuracy and speed, and the way they introduced guns fits perfectly into this. You see, the guns, like any weapon real life or (good) fantasy, have both pros and cons.Starting off with the pros, guns are incredibly powerful. A good shot to a person can very easily kill them instantly, and someone without a shield (something the game encourages by making them a bit pricey) can't block the shot. That on it's own would be ridiculously powerful, but it is weighed against the incredibly long reload times, limited shots and incredible inaccuracy. The weapons are treated by the game to be a sort of glass cannon: Incredibly powerful, but on it's own? Useless. Anyone with a mind wouldn't ride on their horse with a gun and without a sword. This makes for some incredibly interesting strategy and thought to be combined with the weapon, as is usual with the series.The second difference is in troop management. The player can only recruit so many troops from villages at the beginning, this means that they cannot stack up troops as they would in the other two games. Instead soldiers in the earlier game are comprised almost if not entirely of mercenaries. If this were how it were in Warband, the game would be absolutely unplayable. In With fire and sword, however, there are some major changes. Firstly, the mercenaries you build your armies out of can be hired as much as you like from a mercenary camp, and more interestingly, at a mercenary camp you can actually choose what gear your troops have (Much like with companions, although a bit less customizable)This allows you to tailor your army however you like it, albeit at a cost.  This feature is incredibly fun and interesting, although I believe it should have been optional to have the village recruitments for the most part turned off in the beginning, to allow more freedom.A downside to With Fire and Sword though is the lack of mods. This is of course not the fault of the developers, and much more the fanbase. The game didn't hit as much success as Warband did with the community, despite how well the game compares to it, and so the mod base, compared to Warband, is empty. This is a catastrophic shame, although even without mods the game on its own still has much merit.The game also isn't quite as memorable as the other games were. While the other games had their own original nations, With Fire and Sword draws more from actual history, and so contains real nations exclusively. This means that, while they are different culturally and strategically, they aren't as exuberant and different as the ones in the original games. The original two had everything from the desert dwelling Sarranids to the steppe venturing Khergits and snow wandering Vaegirs. While you could see the cultures they were drawn from, it was still interesting to see them all interacting with one another, and they were distinctly different. Not as many people know the difference between Russian troops and Polish ones as people do Viking and Arabian ones. These features aren't inherently bad, though. They can appeal greatly to a history buff with a passion for the 17th century. It is simply that these features aren't as appealing to a wide audience. Don't let me dissaude you though, With Fire and Sword is a wonderful game, even if you aren't as into history as some other people are. It holds up extremely well to it's counterparts and in some ways surpasses it. And, if you enjoyed either of the first two games, I highly reccomend you give this one a try, even if you don't like the game in the end, you won't regret any time spent in it.			"

												Gun powder weapons spice up the action but the muskets are WAY too over powered. This game takes place around the 16th century when guns weren't very reliable and insanely inaccurate, but in With Fire & Sword, you can snipe someone from about 200 feet away and get a freaking headshot on them about 80% of the time. This goes for singleplayer and multiplayer. Mounted units can still destroy any unit, which is fine. It's fun running over people while on horseback. You can recruit armies quickly with several types of mercenaries, it is easier to manage towns, earn money, and there are more options to manage your armies now in battle. It's pretty cool getting a few dozen musket units all lined up in a row and fire at the same time. Grenades do exactly what you would think. Blasting a hole into the side wall of a castle and charging in is certainly alot faster and easier then using ladders during sieges. There's plenty of mods you can find to set your fix, just like the other Mount & Blade games. There are some other improvements here and there over Warband, but I think Warband is still the must have game out of this series and stand alone expansions. With Fire & Sword is still worth getting in my eyes; you'll just have to get used to the additions of guns and other new modes and features. "

												Great expansion to mount and blade! The guns add a lot of fun to the gameplay, and you can actually reload while moving (unlike the napoleonic wars DLC)!!!!!! I haven't played singleplayer yet but multiplayer is very fun, especially commander battle! Co-op commander battle is amazingly fun, although many servers limit your party size to 6 and it gets extremely hard around wave 7 or 8, even with more than 10 people. The only problem that I have noticed is that in the not co-op commander battle gametype, only team 1 can actually make make a squad of men, which takes away the fun as it quickly turns into a slaughter for team 2 every round.

												This game is fantastic, with a lot of cool things, how you can destroy the story you created by 1 click. It is amazing. The mechanic of the battle is awesome. I love the gigantic♥♥♥♥♥battles of 400 (enemy army) vs 100 (your army) and at the end, you win because you have better equipment. This is what RPG means. Creating your own everything: your own character, your own equipment, your own army, etc. This is definitely one of the best RPGs out there, that isn't very well known. And, I have to say that this is better than Warband. Yes, i said it. Don't buy Warband, buy this. This is 100 times better than Warband. And yes, i played Warband. I don't say that Warband is not a good game. It is a good game, but, With Fire & Sword is a lot better.This game deserves a 9/10. You should buy it right now.			"

												You can have fun in it's it's just lacking in the fun department unlike Warband.I feel like this game was lesss thought out and less cleaned up before it was put on steam. There are a few things that I really find annoying and it does keep me away from playing the game. Towns and fortresses look identical so you are forced to check your notes to see if what you're approaching is a town or not. Since guns are now a big part of this game many bandits now have them and use them well but since it's considered ""realistic"" you take one bullet to die. This is annoying just for the sake of how you start out. It's not exactly hard to get money but it's not exactly easy either. You are heavily over estimated for goods and when you go to sell them they may be worth less than a 1/3 of what the esimated price was. Aside from all this is seems this game is just trying to do too much at once. I feel a workshop would really improve the game and make it more enjoyable for me at least.For right now I'm giving it a 3/10 just for feeling kinda sloppy			"

												Funny game and community...Gameplay is like counter strike, but with stones and daggers...swords...rifles (medieval stuff). Each round is basically the same and there aren't too many NA servers. European players seem to enjoy this game though. Aye. You can joust in this game.Cons are graphical and physics glitches. Hitbox detection issues. Poor musket rifle accuracy. And lastly, the melee animations are atrocious. FPS drops are rare unless you got a PC from the stone age.			"

												I was told of this game by a friend while overseas. I mocked it mercilessly just because of the name.  Mount and Blade... Say it with authority and gusto, you'll get it.However, after spending a mere ten bucks on this game, I was surprised to see how crazy deep this game goes, yet only as deep as you want it to.  There is a whole political world that surrounds every action.  There is a tactical battle system that does less of that.If your okay with losing. A lot. Because F this game! then your in.  The learning curve is steep, and the time it takes to be able to actually feel like your doing ANYTHING is immense.  However, if your the hardest of the core, you will find one of the greatest games ten bucks can buy.  Wether you pledge fealty or try and strike it big on your own it takes planning, it takes thought, it takes forsight. Want to ambush your enemies in the field (which is dictated by where on the map you engage?)  Want to sack castles and/or forts to hold more land? By all means do so.  Want to distract with cavalry while your riflemen and infantry get into a perfect position to be lead to? Go for it. Dont wanna mess with all that tactical crap? Hop on your mount, weild that blade, and go to town.  I reiterate, I hope your ready to lose.  A lot.This game really is for the hardcore.  Nothing is fast and very little is easy. "

												Meh.Could've been a lot better.Still probably worth playing and fun.Not the same as Warband.Has different stuff....I felt Warband, because it had more to the game, was better.Though this isn't a totally bad game.I don't like the longest lances in the game point-blank killing me though I think that's lazy design.  Make them switch weapons to a sword or something... really.There are fun aspects to this though not in Warband.  Although if you want a better RPG experience play Warband.I think there were some things that definitely could've been done differnet...  majority of NPC heroe's you can have in your party are not interesting or dynamic and there's errors in their text which is BAD.  There's some flaws.  Not game ruining glitch, just some lame flaws here and there that are somewhat minor.It's still decent though and it's different. "

												As good as any other Mount&Blade game, i mean really good.In my opinion rifles being added to game isn't that bad. Yes, they are a bit overpowered because you can reload them while moving, however if you look up the k/d lists in servers, you can see that players with the best scores are always playing melee. I play this game since it is published and it was same back then. I think that this game has great multiplayer and still not filled with auto-blockers like Warband MP.About the singleplayer, I think it is really good but really difficult. I only played Cossack Hetmanate and Polish Commonwealth campaigns(there is also Russian campaign which is also awesome). Even though they are very difficult as you should be always prepared and often encounter unfair battles, they are lots of fun and well planned by the developers.My overall score is 9.5/10 also considering its price. For this price, it is one of the best games you can have and a game that you will never ever regret buying.			"

												Prepare yourself to get shot randomly with fire and sword! (HAH!) Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword, is a gem that manages to get interesting the more time you decide to invest in it.The main difference in MB: Warband and MB: With Fire & sword are the few but more interesting quests and the fact that you cannot survive without a gun. You can try but having a spare gun and some bullets makes your life much easier when fighting certain enemies. Now the one thing that makes me angry with a vicious fury, is the gun's mechanics in this game. Now I'm all for historical accuracy and muskets being inaccurate and unpredictable, but when a peasant from a mile away with a broken and cracked old pistol can headshot me... That's when I lose my sh!t. But it is a minor issue when you manage to play carefully and don't rush into battle without knowing you can win. But of course the unpredictable guns have many times been the reasons I hate this game at times. When one of your strongest soldiers get shot down in a quick charge against 3 bandits, that is not a nice time. The game has many ways for a lone soldier to survive in an eternally conflicted European time in history. Whether it be as merchant or mercenary, loyal subject or lone vigilante. MB: With Fire & Sword has it all. 7/10 - Quicksave (seriously) before ANY  battle.			"

												This game... man, what a frustrating load of♥♥♥♥♥♥ After losing my 50,000th dollar (out of a alte-game average of 6,000 in the bank) due to the kind demanding we go on a war parth while i'm on the other side of two empires who want me to die, and after losing my only land for the second time because that same king gave me border towns and towns literally in enemy territory, I am not playing anymore. If every succesful fight begs a manual save, every paycheck demands mathematics, every failure requires you to go back with your future-knowledge and not lose your 5,000$ gun this time (praying that you can make it to the town before losing too much money to get a weapon through bandit raids and more praying that the town has a weapon you can use). I put about 15H into one save, and I've got a fancy suit of armor (of which half had to be replaced over time as honorable opponents stole my♥♥♥♥♥♥for varying amounts of lack of reason) and a few levels to show for what was 8 in-game months of nonstop pain and suffering and loss after loss because I don't like using cavalry, or played the gun mod for the guns, or the enemies random hobos had better aim than my elite riflemen.The fights were good, though. Will play custom battle mode in future.			"

												Thoguh many compare M&B WF&S to Warband,it doesn't make justice with this game.The key feature upon which the comparison is made is guns,and those drastically change the combat.In M&B and Warband it's more simple and easier, you can be a one man army,thinning the enemy's army while your troops engage the now more weaker bulk on the enemy's army.But in WF&S, combat is now more realistic and harder. You have to plan ahead and use the terrain and your troop versatility to your advantage.You need to think, is it better to have a highly armored units to serve as a target for the enemy's marksmen,to deplete their ammunition, making them easier to handle by your cavalry,or is it better to pound them with marksmen. While your horde of infantrymen closes on the enemyand overrunnig them by sheer numbers and using as an advantage the slow reload speed of the muskets.I truly enjoyed the more historical take of this expansion on eastern europe, (though I'm a bit bias because of my origins).The towns are truly beautiful and much better than the previous games.And it can be always improved by mods (I recommend WF&S Enhanced), which further enhance  the game.Worth the money "

But do you really think you'd survive if you took a musket shot through the chest in a time when surgery wasn't very advanced?			"

												Eventually once I put more time into this game, I might have a better outlook on it. While the use of firearms adds a good twist to the game, it just doesn't have the same appeal to me as M&B: Warband. It took me some time to master the art of getting head shots with bows and crossbows in Warband. In WF&S, I'm getting headshots like crazy with a pistol right away and it just doesn't seem as fun. Maybe it's just me. I highly recommend getting the Napoleonic Wars mod for Warband and playing multiplayer on there if you're need to fill your slow-as-molasses-reloading gun fix.			"

The firearms and relatively low armour actually make this a lot more challenging and I wasn't able to create a god-like murdering machine who could single-handedly capture castles and towns as I could in the previous games.

												I  bought this game because I loved the other mount and blade games. However, I think this expansion(or mod?) ruined it, for multiple reasons. I really liked the addition of guns to the game. Ive always wanted to play mount and blade in that sort of time period; with muskets and cavalry sabers.The real problems are:+ the graphics are to terrible. Mount and blade is obviously not the most visually pleasing(for obvious performance reasons). But this game took mount and blade graphics, and made them even worse, with no apparent trade off for somehing else. The battle maps are extremely foggy, and the world map is hard to look at. It looks more like stretched burlap than grassy fields. Not to mention, there isnt any real terrain like there was in the origional game. The entire map it completely flat.+ the use of actual real life named towns and cities kills the mount and blade ambience and lore. Why do I want to fight for Poland, or Russia or Sweden? What happened to the first kingdoms? like Swadia, or the Rhodoks, or the Vaegirs? Why couldnt we use them?+They changed the colors of all the menus from dark tan(in the origional) to a bright(almost white) beige. I know this doesnt sound like much, but it washed out all the detail in the menus, and its difficult to see what youre clicking on. Not to mention, every time I bring a menu up, i get blinded from the brightness due to its contrast from normal gameplay.I love the idea of this game, but in my opinion, it was poorly executed, and seems to have just been hastely thrown together.

												Would recommend that you pick up Warband instead of this. The guns detract from the gameplay and Warband is a better game overall.			"

												Better scenario than Warband. It's very funny and enjoyable to play single or multiplayer. Game scenario is about Ukrainian Cossack State in the middle of Crimea,Polish Commonwealth and Muscovite Tsardom. If you watch ""Ogniem i Mieczem"" movie,game scenario will be more fascinating for you. Using firearms are pretty funny and not hard. You should buy it.			"

												Remember those hours upon hours playing Risk and then you would make secret alliances and your friend would go to get another mountain dew and you would remove half his army from the board?This games kind of like that. But you have a horse. And you don't roll dice. And theres no mountain dew. But it's still fun as hell for some strange reason, maybe the simplicity.Always a good way to kill time when I am indicisive about what game I want to boot up.			"

												Definitely a step down from Warband, only worth checking out on sale. Muskets are a neat novelty, and the larger picture is cool (volleys and whatnot) however being a musketman is boring as hell, bows are becoming obsolete and melee combat is a good way to get shot in the face. That winged hussar in the picture would only get a couple runs in before that happened.			"

												10/10Got beaten by polish troublemaker in tavern, then captured by bandits. After a while I was working for polish king, travelling across the eastern europe with his letters. What is sad is that fever killed almost all of my man. Still, very good game.			"

												Fun until you get defeated by cheating enemys. Honestly the game slowly decays as the quests are less and less intresting and just plain boring. Campaigns are rare. Most quests you get are just to send a blank message from one lord to another. You will also notice times when the AI pretty much cheats the game and a group of enemys fire the muskets at you and regardless of how fast or which direction you go, They will instantly hit you. Above all, There are almost no combat missions, That once important ""Ransom a girl from bandits"" Quest is all there is to fight in mostly as you will notice that there is almost no bandits. Losing all your gear is pretty much always a bad thing. Mostly when you lose all your rare and favorite items. But instead of fixing that, They make it so that you lose all your good gear regardless of how hard it is to get. This game clearly only gets a 5/10. An average game. Not because of it's graphics or it's general setting. It is because of the bugs, Lack of content and other stuff. I really, Really want to give it a higher rate but I can not.			"

												Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword Not as good as its predecessors but still enjoyable to a bit. + The map is big+ Firearms+ Trade system (Sending your own caravan)+ Castle's got their own tavern and a market+ Main quests - little mods - Expensive firearms and that kinda thing - Functions that was in Warband is not in here - Not alot of activity on the campaign map except for the factions.  You buy the game for the multiplayer? I would recommend you not to buy it. There are only a few people that are playing multiplayer. But you buy the game to play alone then go ahead			"

												Why i hate the game?1. 84% performance, 100 vs 100 man battles will cause you to lag on a good graphics card. Even in the 960 series of Nvidia :(2. Soon after playing for a few hours, 40 vs 40 man battles will now lag3. This bug has been going on sincdd the creation of the game4. Unable to go full screen because of the missing cursor5. Super Bad Rifle aiming and reload speed is way too long6. Exp grinding takes too long.But, What i love about the game?Comparing to Mount & blade1. New tactics to attack/ take over castles. (Poison water, Bombings of wall ...)2. Easier time to recruit troops at mercernary camps.3. Able to earn Thales much more easily with merchant guildP.S Not sure about graphics of the game when im playing 84% performance.6/1o. "

												With Fire & Sword falls well below the bar set by the original Mount & Blade. The only real positive aspect of this version of the game is the addition of gunpowder weapons. After putting in a good amount of time in both versions of the game I must side with the standard version being far superior.			"

												If heaven does exist, then this is exactly what it would be like.Jokes aside this game is crazy fun! (Depending on what kind of person you are and how you like your games roasted that is) I myself bought this game about a year ago to add it to my collection of growing games. I have even placed it in my ""Favorite"" section near Skyrim, Natural Selection 2 and a few other select titles that I enjoy. I hold this game very highly for every aspect it gives to the player. The graphics are far from being good but once you fall in love with the game you can't help but enjoy the not-next-gen graphics. Combat is very basic but can prove to be a nuisance at times. Charging directly towards guns that are pointed in the opposite direction that you are traveling does prove to make matters worse. But hey! It's still fun!I haven't yet begun to find myself tangled in any of the main quests as I'm too busy trying to level my player and increase the size of my party to overtake castles in the name of the Crimean Khanate! Victory for my nation will follow within the next couple hundred hours I invest into this game.In this game you do find yourself running around a lot given the fact the map of the whole game is a whole country. My advice to when you start playing, pres Ctrl + Space. It allows you to travel and wait much faster. Also makes the game less of a headache once you have to travel from Akkerman directly to Moscow (both at opposite sides of the country).During sometime after you get addicted the game does get repetitve in both positive and negative aspects. The quests that nobles give are always the same 10 or so quests the game has. The combat is also repetive in feeling that it is awesoem! You truly have full scale battles against other armies. Victroy feels satifying and Defeat feel like, well defeat. Plus it doesn't help when some of your comrades bring it up to you that you suck.Overall, I can easily say that I recommend this game. The graphics aren't pretty and the combat isn't spectacular. But time and effort you spend into your Player will be more than rewarding. You eventually become attached. You try to talk to your troops and nobles but they never listen. I've never experienced any other of the Warbands but I can gurantee I'd be in love with the others as much as I am with Fire and Sword.			"
