												I liked the Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing quite a bit, so I was excited for II.  The original game had its problems, but had enough atmosphere and quirky humor and story for me to enjoy it.  Where VH excelled, VH2 does not.Pros: 1) Game's atmosphere is beautiful.  I particularly like the outside areas.  Unfortunately, very little of your gameplay experience takes place outside.Cons: 1) They attempted to fix the lackluster skill tree from the original game.  The original lacked choices and most of the skills were useless.  They did a complete 180 and the skill tree still sucks.  Now, it is oversaturated with no coherent structure.  Certain skills unlock other skills but have no function in relation to those skills.  For example, Want to build around ice damage?  Pick one skill on the right, arbitrarily attached to some fire and lightning.  Then, try to pick a skill on the left, arbitrarily attached to other random skills.  Makes no sense.2) Balance.  Game balance is awful.  I played the original game on the hardest difficulty [I play most ARPGs on the hardest difficulty].  VH2 seems to have mobs that are weak [on any difficulty] and mobs that do an incredible amount of dmg on any difficulty other than ""casual"".  Even if I built my character around heavy defensive passives/tricks ranged/casting things [which tend to do more dmg in general] hit BRUTALLY hard.  There's also the occasional 1 shot from a challenging to see ability when swamped in a pack of mobs.Edit: I've now played through the game with a second character.  My first was a thaumaturge that really struggled with balance.  My second was the original hunter character, but built around spell-casting.  I played my second time on hard/heroic difficulties - stacked the mana shield defensive ability and some other defensives, and could face-roll pretty much anything so long as I had mana.  Again, certain skills are way more powerful than others, effectively making the oversaturated skill tree still feel problematic.Edit Two: Played more on the thaumaturge on heroic.  Balance is really what is holding the game back.  Built my character around abilities that could do damage while moving and crit chance/crit dmg [crit chance around 32-35%, crit dmg maxed @ 450%], and high HP, made heroic pretty easy.  The problem, though, is sometimes you just get 1 shot from off-screen, even with high damage reduction.  Difficulty basically scales like this: Mobs have higher health making it take longer to kill them.  High dmg abilities do insane dmg and can result in 1 shots.  The longer a mob lives, the greater chance of a 1 shot.  Not sure how they can really fix this, but it makes build diversity fairly limited.  At a certain point you just have to be able to do damage while moving and you have to spec heavily into defense.3) Storyline/Quests.  This is really my main qualm with the game.  The storyline of this game is really disappointing.  Maybe the storyline isn't disappointing [as it makes sense in the context of VH1], but the way it is executed is disappointing.  The questing sucks.  Very little variation, mostly based around tower defense.  The vast majority of your missions are ""secure X, Y, Z points by battling through streams of enemies.  This was my least favorite type of mission in VH and it seems to be what the entirety of VH2 is built around.  If I wanted to play Tower Defense, I'd play Tower Defense.  The final boss fight, spoiler alert, is not even a fight.  You literally kill streams of enemies until his force field's HP hits 1.  He then blows up and the game ends on a pathetic attempt at a cliff hanger.  I understand the attempt at a military strategy/real-time invasion, but it simply fails to be enjoyable.4) End Game:  It's about what you expect.  You get ""random"" dungeons [just reskinned areas of the main story] and tasks to complete within them.  Some of them also have interesting things that makes them substantially more difficult [Your companion won't help, can't regen life/mana, etc].  I did a few of them on heroic difficulty.  They were a challenge.  The quirky interactions don't take place between Katarina/Helsing so it's basically just the mindless challenge of slaughtering enemies with certain affixes that make the already poorly balanced gameplay more difficult.  I'm glad they added this feature.  Unfortunately, it does not do much for me because I've already done a lot of this in Path of Exile AND Path of Exile's system is better.  All in all, I think it will be fun for people who haven't already beaten the model to death in other games, but wasn't real fun for me.5) Multiplayer:  Much like during the launch of the first game [in which it wasn't even functional], multiplayer is quite buggy.  In fact, I've only successfully joined 1 game [I've tried to join many], and the host disconnected shortly thereafter, rendering my efforts obsolete.  I've also tried hosting multiple times.  I will get a message that ""x is trying to join your game"", but they are never successful in doing so.  Not sure if it is a bug, a lack of stable connection, or what, but multiplayer seems quite hit or miss.Verdict:If you did not play the first game, don't buy this.  The first is a much more complete experience.  If you loved the first and are desperate to see where the story goes, buy this.  If you loved the first for what it was, and aren't too attached to the story, don't buy this.The game simply lacks what made the first game worth playing - the quirky nature, originality, and great atmosphere - while not really fixing any of the detracting factors of the first game [lack of real diversity via skill tree].

												Time Bought: Pre Ordered Money Spent: $37.50Worth The Price?: YesPosition In Game At Time Of Review: Have all my classes max leveled, have game & DLCs on 2 steam accts, got most of the sets epics and all godlikes, farmingAfter adding the first Van Helsing to one of the most favorite games I've ever played, VH2 only polished and added to the enjoyment where the first one left off.  I was still playing the first one up to the release of this game and continued playing it during this one.  But VH2 not only left off where the last story ended, but improved on tons of things to make this game even more enjoyable than the first.  So with this in mind, I wrote a review for people new to the series as well as one for people who have played the first game and are considering getting this one.Newcomers to the Van Helsing trilogy-Even if you haven't played the first one, it would still be enjoyable to start with VH2.  The reason for this is much like any other game, such as Borderlands 2.  Playing the first one AFTER the second one will give you more depth in the story as well as make you appreciate all the changes that were done in the second game.  Even though I would recommend playing the first one first, I don't see any spoilers at all in VH2 to the storyline of VH1.  There are even items/gear that is reverse compatible ;) which you will probably think is pretty keen of the developers.  Yes, it plays like Diablo 3, but that is by all means not a bad thing.  But that comparison is very similar to saying Battlefield plays like CoD or MoH.  And what about the ""Gears of War"" and ""God of War"" comparisons in other games.  Yah, it's kinda like that :/  All in all, if you get VH2, you will be getting a great funny and very enjoyable RPG which you can co op up to 4 players as well as PvP.  When you play it, you'll know it's going to be a great game from the photobomb on the title screen[www.twitch.tv] hahaha.Ones who've played the first Van Helsing-It may look like the same game but many things have been polished to fit customer satisfaction.  For instance there are still 6 pages of storage, but now most of the gear takes 2 blocks instead of 3, and the storage space has been significantly expanded.  So now there is over double the storage space of the first game.  Along with the max level reaching 60 instead of 30, there are doubled the skills to mess around with!  So you have the option of lvl10ing the skills and tricks you have ported over OR taking them off and starting a whole new tree of new abilities.  Or you can even mix it.  Oh yeah, as I stated, you can export over your powered up character from the first game :)  The Chimera is not as powerful as it looks but is still a great addition as well as a little storyline within the sp story.  Also the 'sets' and 'epics' have 'ink infested' versions which are level 60s.  So even though you may have a complete set with the level ranges at 33 38 and 45, you can still farm for the all level 60 versions of that same set :))))  OMG, and wait until you get your first 'godlike' item!!!  Besides that they just expanded on everything that made the first game so fun to play like: glory, perks, weapons & gear, laughs, easter eggs, tower defense, etc.  The story, I would like to compare to The Matrix Reloaded.  Not the best story, but essential in the trilogy and to any fan of the first game.  It was also fun to play through with more boss fights and loot drops.  So basically, I would definitely recommend this game if you've played through the first one even just once.The DLCs-I've written separate reviews on each DLC.Rating: 9/10			"

												Update: I have investigated the claim that the bugs have been fixed - it is possible that some are, but a quick check showed that the game is still unplayable as multiplayer co-op.This game seemed promising, but has a number of bugs that make it unplayable.  The only reason that there are positive reviews here is that the people writing them did not attempt multiplayer.  These are some of the bugs were unable to fix over several hours of attempts:*Stats from gear are not being applied to damage*Mobs stand frozen after death and do not despawn*Enemies are invisible to one player*Projectile effects are invisible*Cannot attack or target enemies*Enemies ignore player*Enemies path or are knocked into unreachable locations*Game crashes during load screens*Load screens persist for several minutes*Quest objectives do not complete even when conditions are metI just wish somebody was answerable.

												My husband and I played through VH1 together, and bought 2 to play together also. Unfortunately it's unplayable and we had to give up after trying for a couple of hours. He created the game and I would join his, and my side of things was buggy right from the first scene with Prisoner Seven.  Also, neither of us could import our characters, so we had to start over. Hurray!Some of the bugs were odd but not a big deal:  I would equip an item and I could hear his character say ""I can't equip that."" and his Katarina would respond to me equipping gear on mine or giving her items to hold.I was constantly running into problems seeing enemies (at all), having them appear to still be alive and standing even when they were supposed to be dead, no ability animations, abilities not working at all, cut-scene conversations being repeated on my side which forced both of us to wait for me to be able to click through it all again before I could move, etc.   So I would leave the game and come back, and things would work for a few minutes before breaking again. After doing that several times I started to crash instead of just bugging.... we gave up after the fourth time I crashed in 20 minutes.Before he and I started this together, I played it alone for nearly 2 hours with no problems at all. It just seems to be multiplayer that's awful. So so disappointing.			"

												I have played the closed beta which consisted of a multi-stage invasion of your fortified resistance forces by the bad guys.  It played exactly like the first game, which for me was a very good thing.  I played the first game on heroic to offer some challege, as anything less and it seemed I would just steamroll the enemies.  I imported my Hunter character (I finished the first game with the Hunter and the Thaumaturge, but I could never get the hang of the  Arcane Mechanic) and the game started up on the heroic difficulty.  It was much more difficult this time around.  I don't know if I was under-geared, as I could never complete the post storyline challenge quests from the first game, or if they just upped the difficulty in general.  The loot drops were appropriate and generous.  Overall, I am really looking forward to this release.  I am really excited that all your equipment, gold, and character skills carry over.  You will learn to loathe the throngs of flying robots that shoot electricity.  Absolute and complete loathing.			"

 The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II Review  The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II Complete is a game you don't want to miss. The game starts out a bit slow but after you get a couple of hours in, its non-stop action and excitement. A must-have for any action role-playing fans. There are numerous skills and perks to customize your character, a multitude of magic items and artifacts, rare monster trophies, many extensive sidequests,  runecrafting,  and more that is sure to keep you entertained for many hours. Controllers are fully supported and there are several multiplayer options as well. While Van Helsing II is mostly hack and slash combined with RPG elements, it also has a well developed tower defense game weaved into the story along with numerous sidequests that add to the fun.This game has many great features that would easily fool you into believing it was developed with a massive gaming budget. The storyline is great, the soundtrack is perfect for the mood, the voice acting is superb, the graphics are rich with detail, and the gothic art is simply astonishing. It does so many things right and that is rare, even from many of the bigger studios. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II plays out much like its predecessor and picks the story up right at the end of the original (although it can be enjoyed without having played the first one). In fact, there is an option that allows you to import your favorite characters from the first game. However, it has several key improvements, most notably, the game offers several character classes from the beginning and even more skills/perks to suit different play styles instead of adding them as DLC like in the original game. The tower defense portion of the game has been improved and enriches the story.  The User Interface has been re-designed and is much better. The graphics have been improved as well and really give you that gothic feel. And don't forget about the DLC's included in the Complete Package. The Pigasus DLC introduces a new lair NPC pet that you can send out into the Ink to search for rare magic artifacts and weapons. The Ink Hunt DLC is an extension of the game that adds 4 new maps along with quests and nmissions to extend the overall game and can only be played after the base game is finished. The Good:=======+  Nice graphics/artwork+  Quality soundtrack+  Well-written storyline and good voice acting+  Numerous character cusomization options+  Several Multiplayer options+  High replay value+  Steam Trading Cards & Achievements+  Full controller support+  Quality DLC+  Well designed user interface+  Smooth graphics+  Active developer support with updates+  Many customization options for game, sound, video, hotkeysThe Bad:======-  Long Intro video-  Initial learning curve is high (it gets easier)-  Slow  loading at startup-  A few bugs still remain (not game breaking)-  Changing between controller/mouse requires re-launchFinal Thoughts:===========This game is nothing like it was when it was first released on Steam. Originally, there were many who had issues with bugs and crashes but the developers have actively worked to fix them and still remain involved in the community. Since then, this game has vastly improved and new features are still being added. The game is very entertaining and offers a lot of quality content for the price. I strongly recommend this game to all action role-playing fans. It has quickly become one of the best available and I look forward to a Van Helsing III.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												The game is a continuation of the first game, so if you didnt play the first one, you should play it.It's one of the better RPGs, action and adventure games, one of my favorites.If you are much into RPG games you should get it.This game is about Van helsing, you have your ghost katarina with you, and she will help you doing the quests.I must admit, that the game is pretty short, but its also very cheap! so if you liked the first one, get this!4/5			"

												The second episode of the adventures of Van Helsing resumes without a breather the narrative continuity of the previous chapter enriching the structure with a good dose of new integrations: first of all, the introduction of a class system that, while not making the pillars like pale, puts a proper piece to one of the most important shortcomings of the previous episode. The roundup of news continues with an unprecedented Runecrafting system, simple to master but unexpected depth, and a new management mode of our allies within the resistance. Add to this the return of particular Tower Defense mode and get back in your hands one of the best quality/price ratios currently available for any fan of action-RPG. Shame about the multiplayer component issues: currently, if you are interested in buying the game with friends, our advice is to wait and see the developments in the coming weeks, given that for the moment the online is very unstable.

												The Great:- Compelling isometric ARPG combat- Varied and satisfying skills and progression system- Satisfying execution of almost every aspect of the game- Tower defense (optional) mini-game that is good enough to be sold as a standalone game (almost worth the price for it alone)The Good:- Well written and delivered dialogue and narrative- Strategy elements added to already great ARPG mechanics- Very similar to previous game (which was also great)- Good loot dropping ryhthmThe Bad:- Very similar to previous game (previous game was great, so this is only slightly bad)- Some of the added elements weren't fully realized (e.g. sending followers on quests had little to no impact on game)Conclusion:If you like isometric loot ARPGs (like Torchlight), this is a must buy.  Even if you don't, this game is absolutely worthy of a purchase at some pricepoint.			"

												This game is a perfect quick fix if you have a Diablo/Path Of Exile craving, but don't want to spend another hundred hours to satisfy it. Game's story lasts for about 15 hours at normal pace, but there are possibilities to continue playing if one wishes to: the story can be replayed at higher difficulty and there are scenarios that are certain non-randomized levels with varying challenges for end-game.My advice is to play the first game first (because it is pretty good too), then import the character into the second game (just a button click away) and continue the story with 30 new levels of skills. Van Helsing II is otherwise a very nice game, good-looking steam-punk theme, good voice acting and an entertaining story, plus a lot of parody and great humour with references to various pop culture. Game play offers three classes and there are several builds to explore. Tons of items, including legendary and set items. Game runs smoothy, with an occassional crash (had about 3-4 crashes during 20 hours), but game saves frequently so one seldom looses progress. No other issues encountered here. Combat is fun and satisfying, and it is very entertaining to explore the world. This is actually the first game of this style where I bothered to pay attention to the story and other lore-related details. Great fun stressless casual hack-n-slash game!			"

												First off, if you’re interested in this game but haven’t played the first one yet I HIGHLY recommend holding off on this until you complete it. This is for multiple reasons, the first being that this is a continuation of the highly enjoyable first game, so you’re more likely to have an understanding and appreciation of the storyline. You are also given the option to carry over your character from the first game, including all skills and items, a feature which I was very pleased to see. Just as the first, this game is a solid ARPG which puts Diablo 3 to shame. The art style and steampunk atmosphere is very well done and pleasant to explore. Gameplay graphics are great, although the cutscenes seem to stand out as being of lesser quality. Like the first game you are joined by your ghostly companion, Katarina. You have the option to allow her to aid you in battle, or to put her in ghost form where she neither deals nor receives damage, instead providing you with a damage reduction bonus. There are a wide variety of skills to choose from for both you and Katarina. It’s easy to spread yourself a little thin when it comes to the somewhat large skill tree, but if you play it smart you can easily tailor it to suit your preferred playstyle. There are tower-defense minigames, which I happen to enjoy but if you’re not a fan you can easily skip them with no penalty. You are also given control over captains, who you can send to take care of issues which are apparently beneath you. This is a new feature, adding a bit more strategy to the game as you must decide which of the captains in your command is best suited for the task at hand. You'll be surprised at just how many great references are hidden throughout the game. I will refrain from mentioning any so as not to spoil them for anyone. If you are like me and try to fully explore each map you will be greatly rewarded with references, loot, and fun.My biggest issue with this game is the ending, which I found to be a bit underwhelming and extremely predictable. This is by no means a big enough deal to ruin the game, but it is worth mentioning.			"

												I bought VHII for 10 dollars with an online coupon.  Even though I'm sure I didn't get the BEST deal out there I'd say it's money well spent.I never played the first game.  So, I started on this one with a new toon and leveled him up to 30 by the time I beat the game on Hard Mode.  Then,  went to veteran mode afterwards on fearless and had a blast. The loot was much better on the higher settings and for those who like crafting -- you can spend a good amount of time sifting through loot to enchant and enhance your gear to get the most defense/offense out of them.  If you don't like crafting then I'd stay away from that part.Replay value is fairly good.  The story itself isn't spectacular, but if you're going for achievements it's always nice to get a few new options when you do the second run through.  If you don't want replay value.  It took me roughly 28 hours to beat it first time through on hard mode.  So, again worth the ten bucks I spent.  Voice acting for main toons is good, and side characters is a bit shady from time to time, but overall good with music that is also good.  Nothing was annoying to my ears.Tower defense is tricky.  Harder the mode you put it on the less likely you are to succeed.  Or, maybe I just suck at tower defense, but on fearless mode it was crazy as the joker with 300 minions willing to do his bidding.Music - 7/10Challenge - 9.5/10Loot - 9/10Skill system - 7/10Story - 7/10Price - 10/10Overall - 8.5/10			"

												The first Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing wasn't a bad game, however it did have crippling technical issues that held it back. Those issues have since been fixed, and developer Neocore Games has learned a lot in the process, it seems. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II does what a sequel is known for and improves on the core idea of Van Helsing while adding enough content to justify a sequel.The story of Van Helsing II picks up right after the end of the first game. In case players completely forgot the plot or never played it, the opening cinematic does a superb job of catching everyone up. Essentially -- the city of Borgovia needs defending, and Van Helsing just so happens to be pretty great at exactly that. Simple enough.In addition, a mysterious character simply named ""Prisoner Seven"" is involved, helping out Van Helsing throughout his adventure. However, Seven's intentions are the definition of vague, leaving the player and Van Helsing to always question his motives. The plot isn't too far off the beaten path and gets pretty predictable, but it's decently written and very well voiced in order to keep the player's attention throughout. The first game's humor comes back in full force, however this time its done with much more tact. Players now have the ability to make Van Helsing one of three classes available, instead of being forced into a single role like in the original game. In addition to the classic Hunter, players can opt to make Van Helsing a Thaumaturge or an Arcane Mechanic. Each class plays very differently from the next, and there are loads of customization options within each class themselves, almost ensuring that two players will not play alike. Players may also import their characters from the first game if they wish.Katarina, the ""ghost with a snappy wit"" returns in the sequel and can also be customized a ton. She feels much more fully fleshed out than in the first game and she even filled the classic ""tank"" role pretty well during my playthrough. Her AI can be extremely customized, which allows her to not feel like dead weight the entire time. Plus, she can hold on to excess items, go back to town and sell them, and even go buy potions.The tower defense mini-game makes its return, which is a mode that I wasn't too fond of in the original due to lack of direction. I am happy to say, however, that Van Helsing II gives this mode the care and dedication it deserves, making it leagues better. The towers are more interesting, the maps feel better designed, and the package as a whole comes together nicely.Van Helsing  is also in charge of resistance commanders now, and can send one of his commanders out to do his bidding for him. Managing these commanders is a mini-game in itself, as each one has certain tactics they are better at and sending the wrong one can mean a mission failure. The visual design of enemies in Van Helsing II is great, offering up some truly bizarre foes to take down throughout the campaign. Their behaviors are varied enough so that every enemy doesn't simply run straight towards the player, though many do. The visual style is alright, though things are overly shiny and can be a bit muddy as well.The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II is a much better showing than the original. It's what a sequel should be; it improves on nearly everything while adding brand new ideas to the pile. Best of all, the core gameplay mechanics are still a blast to use and really spice up a genre that if often left untouched. It certainly has its shortcomings, but fans of games like the Diablo series, Torchlight, Titan Quest, or Path of Exile will love it. "

												The game while it is fun has alot of  bugs they were known bugs as of May of 2014 I've checked the companys website and as of that date its been a known bug and they ""Hope to fix it soon"" if this is any indication of how there games are going after Van helsing One I'd steer clear of This game and Van Helsing 3. IE Runecrafting crashes you. Sad to see an indie company totally stop supporting a product 1 year after its release.			"

												One of the best RPG games ever. Pretty nostalgic since it reminds me Diablo. Great story, boss fights, variety of heroes and talent/skill builds, amazing environment, graphics, items and sets, healing and mana potions, awesome in every single way. And all the Easter Eggs you can find will make you smile. This is one of those must have games. Easy to beat once, but can you do it again with different hero and on hardest difficulty? Play and master it!			"

												Van Helsing has his work cut out for him. For all the monsters he's slain, the looming spectres of Diablo, Torchlight, and Path of Exile cast an imposing shadow over the rugged hero. To set itself apart, this modern dungeon crawler has to find a way to truly sink its claws into the player beyond the usual loot'n'grind. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II, the second part of a planned trilogy by Neocore Games, succeeds remarkably in carving out its own identity, but at the potentially steep price of polish and balance. The visuals and soundwork of Van Helsing II are competent, with a few bright spots. The graphics are technically solid, with varied color palettes that provide atmosphere as Van Helsing explores underground caverns, snowy forests, and laboratories full of disgusting experiments. The voice acting is serviceable and the musical score is suitably sweeping and epic, with a few catchy songs, but nothing new for the genre.A common criticism of dungeon crawlers is that they start off slowly, and Van Helsing II does everything in its power to defy that stereotype. Players of the first Van Helsing will be pleased to find that they can import their character into the sequel, with all of their skills and equipment intact. Newcomers are able to create a character of one of the three classes -- the iconic Hunter, the mage-like Thaumaturge, and the tech-oriented Arcane Mechanic -- that begins at level 30, giving them a set of gear and plenty of skillpoints to spend. Those who find the game's in-depth, granular skill system a little too daunting can start at level 1 without any major handicaps, giving them more time to learn the deep mechanics of the game.These mechanics are much of what set Van Helsing II apart, but also where this ambitious title first stumbles. The game is unapologetically complex; each class has four primary stats and access to dozens of abilities, all of which can be upgraded up to ten times. There are plenty of ways to construct a character, but unfortunately, not all of them are viable. Many skills pale in comparison to others within the same tree, and it's easy to find yourself with a build that simply doesn't work. Luckily, a respecialization option is both cheap and accessible, making it easy enough to experiment until a satisfactory skillset is found. There is a lot of content in Van Helsing II, and most of it is implemented well. The usual prerequisites for the genre are in place: a lengthy storyline with plenty of side quests, co-operative multiplayer modes for both the campaign and individual scenarios, and a 'Battle Royal' PvP offering for those wishing to test their mettle against other players. What sets Van Helsing II apart, however, is its dedication to making its single-player experience memorable to the player. Throughout the fifteen to twenty hour campaign, Van Helsing spends plenty of time fighting his way through hordes of enemies, but he also fortifies and defends his Secret Lair (yes, that's what it's called in the game). The Lair -- the heart of the Resistance movement of which Van Helsing is a critical agent-- is unlocked early in the game, and houses merchants, alchemists, and enchanters capable of modifying and upgrading Van Helsing's equipment. It also grants access to a couple of additional minigames that add much-needed variety to the usual action-adventure fare, including tower defense-style sequences in which Van Helsing must prevent the antagonist's forces from discovering the Resistance's hideout, and a menu-driven command center where the player can build a small army and send them on missions that grant equipment and monetary rewards. Though fairly basic in design, both of these distractions are plenty of fun, and I often found myself teleporting back to base to play with them between campaign missions.The combat itself doesn't introduce any shocking twists, but it stands proudly with the best in the genre. With eight of his abilities available on the skill bar at any given time, Van Helsing is never lacking for tools with which to fight, and a generous cooldown on potions and plenty of ways to restore health and mana keep things moving at a tight pace. Enemy variety is impressive, with three or four new kinds of foes introduced in each zone, and multiple difficulty levels allow players to suit the challenge to their preferences. The biggest problem that I found was that pure melee characters never really come into their own. Every class has ranged options (and, in fact, the Hunter is the only one that can melee at all), but for all the depth of the skill trees, there's no real way to avoid the punishment that comes from being surrounded by the game's dangerous enemies. It's certainly possible to succeed with a melee-oriented build, it just never reaches the destructive potential of the other choices.It's a good thing, too, because the plot of the campaign doesn't stand too well on its own. The storyline is basic, but decent enough: after slaying the evil Professor Fulmigati in the first game, Van Helsing finds that the exiled General Harker has returned to take his place. Setting out on a mission to overthrow the new government, the monster hunter is joined once again by the ghost Katarina, who has to be one of the most obnoxious characters I've ever encountered in a videogame. A constant presence at Van Helsing's side, she's an endless font of overwrought sarcasm and grating negativity; in the first two hours of the game alone, she voices her distrust of a new character seven times. I counted. As if to make things worse, she and Van Helsing trade uninspired quips with depressing regularity; the tone of the story, which can get fairly dark at times, is completely offset by the constant, heavy-handed references to games, books, and movies the pair make. Occasionally, a gem of a line can inspire a smile, but for the most part, it's a distracting and desperate attempt at humor. Further putting a dent in things are the technical issues. The game isn't particularly buggy, at least not in the conventional sense, but it found some creative ways to hamper my enjoyment. Load times are far too long for a game of this size, and even inexplicably happen just from alt-tabbing. The camera is solid enough during gameplay, but in cutscenes, it has a habit of taking nauseating jaunts for seemingly no reason. Oftentimes, a scene with two characters simply standing on either side of a table discussing tactics is lent a surreal air as the perspective randomly changes.Despite these problems, it's hard not to recommend Van Helsing II. Most of the issues it has feel like the inevitable consequences of making an ambitious game on a small budget, and I have to applaud Neocore Games for packing so much content into their latest endeavor.

												Pre-ordered 3-copies of this game for myself and two nephews.  Single player works fine up to a point, and multiplayer suffers from a variety of issues that makes it unplayable (unless you like restarting the game everytime it crashes).  Playing multiplayer along side with nephews in Story Mode yielded broken quests that carried over to the Single Player mode - we were unable to continue playing because one of the quests was glitched, ""Power of Perum - Part 3 - Kill the Adpets"" (can't kill something that's not there!!) even switching back to Single Player mode brought us back to the same glitched quest.  We tried restarting the game several times and selecting the Respawn Monsters under Options > Gameplay, but same thing.  Multiplayer crashes whenever you try to teleport to your friend's location or if they're still in a loading screen.We played the first one without any major issues affecting gameplay, but the sequel seemed to be a rush-job - looks nice, but it's broken.  Ideally, we wanted to try the PvP areas once we hit 60 but if the quests are broken they can't level up unless they grind all day (but where's the fun in that).  Additionally, the pre-order armor set was somewhat of a joke since you'll level up pretty quickly past 30 to make it obsolete.I played a new character up to 60 without issue in Single Player.  My opinion, the Multiplayer Mode is broken and will break any quests even going back to Single Player Mode.   There are a vast number of in-game perks that have been added, but not very intuitive.  Some items, like ""The Ring of Guidance"" - will instruct you to perform certain tasks, but the instructions are unclear and it fails to do anything.  Crafting is either broken or they made the instructions a secret - I've yet to figure out how to craft something, but ended up just selling all my crafting items for gold (much more productive).   Enchanting is much easier, but costly.  Trying to get a particular enchant from random can cost you millions of gold in a few minutes... would've been nice to see if the enchant was available prior to blowing millions on something that'll never come.  And lastly, the Chimera... annoying to hear him chase/hack on the NPC cat in the Lair.  Even after sending him off on a hunt he can still be heard chasing/hacking on the NPC cat in the Lair... ended up turning off Battle Sounds completely to get rid of the annoyance.Overall, the story is great, Single Player Mode works, but Multiplayer Mode is broken and will break your Single Player Mode game.  Sadly, we'll be passing on this for several months and may return to it once it's ""finished"".  Until then, I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a Multiplayer Game as I initially hoped to play with my nephews.  If you're looking to just play solo, then it'll be worth it.			"

												a decent sequel to a great action RPG game, Van Helsing 2 seems to think the bigger the better, however this might not be true when you're suppose to be playing a lone hunter. they essentially turned Van Helsing from a monster hunter who was just passing through Borgovia to it's one man army saviour and resistance leader. as a result unlike the first game, this game features less hunting for strange creatures in dark forests and more large battles in rain drenched streets. which i see as a bad thing. Gameplay wise, if you like action RPGs you will like the combat in this game, it throws as many monsters at you all at once as possible. the controls are responsive but the sound effects don't have enough impact behind them. the game also has a tower defense mini game(about 5 side-missions). which seems a bit out of place. graphically the game looks good and has some nice weather effects. however they toned down the Gothic themes and went full on steampunk in this one so you won't see any cool creatures like the scarecrow from the first game. the voice acting is good from the main characters (Van Helsing & Katarina) and so so from the other characters, but not awful. overall if you played and liked the first game you should pick this one up			"

												This is a fun action RPG. Worth getting if you like gothic/mad science steampunk settings & humor in your games.More skills, a new rune-crafting system, improved Tower Defense maps, army management, co-op & PvP Multiplayer, and the optional ability to avoid Tower Defense missions make Van Helsing 2 a definite improvement over Van Helsing 1 for me.Skill trees from Van Helsing 1 have been improved, with more skill choices & a bigger range of secondary abilities. Skill points, Ability points, and Reputation buffs can be respeced on the main character and the sidekick at your home base, so you are never locked into unworkable playstyles for too long.			"

												It's good, really good. As long as you play solo. Co-op and MP has some serious problems.Dialogues are great, I laughed a lot.Easter eggs, lots of them. I loved every single one of them, a really good aspect of the game.Gameplay is really good except skill system is flawed and I have almost never used rage system since it's kinda unnecessary.Also I truly dislike the essence system, I never actually used the essence system.Class differentiation and character progress is okay, third game has a lot better classes though. You can tell that the game was made for hunter class, but playing others won't have any bad effects.Also I miss seeing actualy gameplay screenshots on Steam Store, thanks for not making us search for actual ingame images.8/10.P.S. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing Final Cut is coming this fall, owners of all 3 games will get it for free. It'll be one long game with classes of 3rd game and improved features from all 3 games.			"

												Been waiting a while to find a game that provided everything I wanted and more. No joke, just the other day I was like man I want a game that is very challenging, has build diversity and lots of options, tons of loot and an ARPG preferably that I can move around with the keyboard (something I'd not found before). And last night, Tada, Bam, Van Helsing shows up on my radar via a Kripparian comment on how hard this game was, looked into it, found it provides keyboard movement or mouse movement, tons of skill tree's across 3 classes, tricks, aura's, Huge pet skill tree, mini games. Man I really don't know how this is only $15.00. Christ I have more stuff on my skill bar than most MMO's. Something like 16-20 things I can micro manage at once if I wanted (Only use 12 at the moment, but seriously wow, although you could get away with 3-4 just fine)Needless to say, I'm having a blast, more than I could of expected and some (tower defense included, cool creative story telling cut scenes, really good graphics and excellent effects, side hero quests you can send minions on, haha).If you want a real fun challenge, do Veteran Heroic, will keep you on your toes for sure (Fearless is to slow for my blood since enemies have gobs of hitpoints).Only negative I can think of so far is it seems a few people are having crash issues (considering 10-15K people are playing, and only 50 or so people on forums complaining, its not that high, but you take a chance).  Also one of the voice actors is kinda meh, but everything else is golden....			"

 “Join the resistance, they said. It will be fun, they said. No one ever mentioned something about a doomsday device!” The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing 2 contains all the best elements of the first game, and introduces novelties in form of bigger and more varied skill trees for all three classes and additional mini games, that contribute to the games atmosphere.In comparison with its predecessor the general level of difficulty has been increased, resulting in a more challenging world of Borgovia, that is filled with original monsters, magic and weird technology. At the same time the skills of your ghostly companion have also been rebalanced, allowing her to support you in your preferred playstyle in a more effective way. But the greatest strength of Van Helsing lies in its love for detail. Allusions to certain films, comics and the original book by Bram Stoker are proof of that. Furthermore, the protagonist and his delightful ghostly companion will keep you entertained with their wry sense of humor and many snappy dialogues. Nevertheless, there are a few shortcomings. One of them is the stiff combat system, as already encountered in the first instalment, which would have needed more attention to establish a more fluent hack & slash feeling. Another point is the storyline. While building on the events of the predecessor, the presentation of the story feels rather loveless, making it relatively easy to predict certain story related events. Trivia: Please do not open the cell of the familiar looking psychopath with cannibalistic tendencies, who prefers Chianti to certain cuisine. Your fellow resistance fighters will be very grateful for it. Achievements: Estimated time for 100% completion: +50 hoursSingleplayer achievements: 59Multiplayer achievements: 4			"

												When I first bought VH2, I had many of the same problems other people have mentioned with various glitches in the game, crashing to desktop repeatedly, etc.  I left for a few months and came back, and it is now much more stable than earlier in the year.  However, I still haven't enjoyed it.  The wild spikes in difficulty were pretty frustrating.  I would find myself going into a new area and having to constantly run while I heal up, after only being hit a few times.  Aside from the weird jumps in difficulty, the gameplay on the whole just didn't really grab my attention.  I wish I could be more constructive, but it's not anything I can put my finger on.  I've thoroughly enjoyed the Diablo games, Torchlight, Dungeon Siege, but VH2 just felt very dry and wasn't for me.			"

												Monster Hunter - Playtime to completion on normal - 11 hours / level 29Van Helsing 2 is ultimately an improvement over the first game, but not without it's own flaws.PROS: -A good aesthetic that lends itself to the story and place.-Fun skills. -3 classes. You MUST specialize in a few specific skills to be effective. I used the same 3-4 skills through the whole game.-Better (more consistent) difficulty curve than the first game. Not without it's spikes though.- More forgiving than the first game.-Aside from a small complaint or two (See below) I never ran into any bugs or glitches.-A lot of skills. This merits multiple playthroughs.Cons:-I started with keyboard and mouse. The problem with this is with this setup, you have to click on specific enemies to shoot them. If you don’t click on an enemy, your character just walks to that place instead. So i ended up walking into fight when I intended to fight from a distance. With a 360 controller, you press the skill and it finds the closest enemy, This seemed to be a better method in my experience.-Occasionally I would get stuck on geometry on the ground that seemed like i should be able to walk through.-Pressing up on the controller (D-PAD) teleports you to the base. The issue is i accidentally did this quite often and i became annoying.-Could have been longer (was hoping for >15 hours)Overall a good action RPG and easily an improvement over the first game. I will eventually go through it again with a different skill set.			"

												We bought this game mainly for the multiplayer and we were highly disappointed. We can't play a half of an hour without any bug. And of course we can't finish the game because we are stuck in a last bugged quest. Graphics and art style is very beautiful but bugged game ruined my experience.UPDATE AFTER 5 DAYS:It even get worse when i try to sign up to the official game forum. After registration and validation I am still not able to write or comment posts. Why? Because administrator must approve my account before i will get full access. What the ****?!? Full access to what? Access to creating and commenting threads? I found a thread with same bugged quest that happened to me, but there is still no response after almost week. But I am not surprised because they still didn't approve my registration.All what I found everywhere on internet is only one option. When you got stucked because of bugged quest then YOU CAN SEND YOUR SAVE TO COMPANY AND THEY SEND YOU YOUR SAVE BACK. Whaaaat?! :D That is fokin awesome bug fixing for everyone.Sorry but totally NO for this bugged game and company. As I read many people are unsatisfied from first game and it seems it will continue through the whole series and company do nothing about it.PS: Am i blind or they remove entire Van Helsing II section from they forum? I don't see it now, just don't.			"

												Rating: 7/10Visuals and gameplay remains the same as in Van Helsing I, but there some differences. The first is the interface, which I like more Van Helsing II (such as inventory, shopping features, rage indicator etc.). Humor, references and hidden content are pretty much the same (great), but what I luck is the variety of environments. The areas with nature are drastically reduced and everything is more in steam-punk style. There are also some changes in ""tower defense minigame"" and extras like rune-crafting and army building. Overall it's still pretty fun and if you like the first game, I will recommend to get this one as well.			"

												I love ARPGs. Diablo I, Diablo 2, Path of Exile.These are the heavy-hitting ARPGs I stack everything up to.Diablo I had atmosphere and a pacing you cannot find in any other game. The slow deliberation as you traveled through the dungeon has not been duplicate to this day.Diablo II had a flexible skill tree that entices players to construct a build for each and every skill. I'm not sure why, but those skills had real character.Path of Exile. My newest love has been especially revolutionary in their currency and item modding systems. The challenge of POE drew my attention. Graphically, the game is terribly bland.The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing IIAtmostphere: This game has a great atmosphere. Turning dark and gloomy areas into interesting scene pieces without the boredom like in POE or the ADHD tones of Torchlight II. There's a story that guides you along without being overbearing.Sound: The voice acting is nice. The banter between Helsing and Katarina is frequent and entertaining. There is some bad voice acting for other NPCs. The spell and combat sounds could use work.Systems: While the game is not revolutionary in its currency system, it has a good amount of gold sinks. Shopping, to respecing, enchanting, item modding, gambling: these are just some of the ways to spend your gold.Gameplay: The gameplay is pretty standard fair for ARPGs. However there is a slight targeting issue and some environmental boundaries that you might get hung up on. The maps are not procedurally generated, but they are handcrafted nicely.Customization: There is quite a bit of customization across the character classes. They advertise over 200 spells. They all seem quite varied and to add another layer of depth, they all can be modded further by the use of the rage system. By activating one or more of the rage buttons, it modifies the ability to perform differently. Similar to the rune system from Diablo III, albeit not as grand, almost all abilities have 3 mods. They usually come in the form of an extra projectile, more damage, % life gain on kill, first second of channeling stuns all targets, etc.Difficulty: I heard this game on max difficult was impossible. 4 hours into my second Hunter (lvl 9), I am encountering mobs that are similar to merciless difficulty mobs in Path of Exile. It is not until around this level have I fought my first REAL rare mob. These ice witches that I am fighting, all have a slow aura........ which stacks. In a two stack of these witches, my melee hunter was moving at around 20% movement speed.The problem with having extremely difficult monsters in these type of games, is that it forces players to kite. I still find the courage to fight in melee range. But when I'm playing hardcore against 4 Path of Exile charging Brutus', I still end up running at the end of the day.There's something for every theorycrafter. Whether you're trying to create game breaking builds or make a subpar gimmick skill work, the game is extremely fun.			"

												YES.I mean, it's a great game. Finished it singleplayer with a completely new character (i.e. I didn't start in veteran mode) in like 16 hours I believe, but I did not find all the secrets. Started veteran and I'm still having fun with slightly harder enemies and - of course - better SHINIES. Hopefully I won't miss things this time.The story was fine, although a few things were predictable, but I didn't mind. OST is great, Katarina is awesome again - although I'd wish for a few new lines instead of those we already know from VH1 (mainly talking about her reactions to ""send to town""). Also perhaps different voice packs for different class (you have three to choose from). But still, I can't complain much about the visuals nor sound (some monsters sound stupid when they get hit repeatedly, but whatever). VH2 also has several new features compared to VH1, mainly Chimera (I'm not gonna spoil it, but it's a fun thing) and generals (or whatever they were called, those guys you send out to do missions). And the tower defense minigame is back (this time we have 6 different levels).The only thing I fear about is multiplayer, since I've heard that there are still MP bugs, similar to those VH1 had. However, as I haven't played MP yet, I'm only mentioning things I've read on the forums - nothing I've experienced myself. I did have some trouble with VH1 multiplayer, though...Did I mention the OST and Katarina are great? No? Well, OST and Katarina are great.tl;dr: Buy it if you like aRPGs.EDIT: So, I now had a chance to play multiplayer. In fact, went through the whole first playthrough with a friend and on the veteran one now. Yes, this game still has some glitches, but not even half as bad as VH1. No more incredible, random lags during any dialogue. I (as a non-host) did crash a few times, maybe thrice during that one playthrough. There are other glitches such as ""invulnerability bubbles"" staying on champions despite them being vulnerable (you can see their HP go down, though, so that's a clear indication they're not immortal ;-)), had some (mostly allied) characters keep running into a wall, etc. But the gameplay is smooth and frankly - I'd say that considering my friend's laggy connection (he lags on TeamSpeak!) this game somehow manages to workaround those lags well. Well, that's if you get used to the fact that each of your hit is slightly delayed, but that's not a problem after you play for a bit. I don't even pay attention to that anymore.So, yes, this is still ""thumbs up"" and still ""definitely recommended"".			"

The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing 2 is incredibly enjoyable, while appearing fairly generic in terms of gameplay, it really shines with its level up system and variety in abilities and stats. The graphical fidelity is very high and it looks absolutely stunning at times, with some particularly impressive explosion and particle effects. However, it does suffer from various loading issues which may annoy some, but is easily solved with an SSD. If you are a fan of action RPG’s then you certainly can’t go wrong with Van Helsing, as you will find plenty of familiarities as well as some interesting new takes on the genre, such as the gothic-noir Steampunk setting and world design.Summary:+ Fantastic level up and skill tree customisation.+ Solid gameplay with lots of abilities to utilise.+ High graphical fidelity and brilliant aesthetic.- Loading times are painfully long.- Voice acting can be a little hit-and-miss at times.

												The return of Van Helsing was heralded with much excitement and anticipation to the return of hunting beasties and baddies throughout the Romanian-inspired expanse of Borgovia, but it was met with disappointment and hands thrown up in confused defeat.Like the first installment, The Incredibly Long Title of Van Helsing II (herein referred to as Helsing II) places the player in control of the gruff speaking monster hunter Van Helsing, son of the more famous Helsing that you're thinking of. Haunting his side is the impolite and begrudgingly helpful ghost Katarina, who takes on a variety of roles depending on your pre-made script for her. Taking place immediately after the events of the first game, Van Helsing finds no rest as he is instantly thrust into a new conflict that has arisen from the wreckage he left upon solving the last one. There's something lost in the adventure by continuing the story so soon after the first game, and keeping you locked into the land of Borgovia. The first installment generated a lot of adventure and captured imagination of the player as they continuously unlocked more secrets about the odd monster hub of Borgovia. The player would move across the country side, rescuing small villages and delving into secret ruins and all-around truly capturing the feel of being a Van Helsing. This game, however, locks you back into Borgovia, with very little left to explore. Van Helsing is now well versed in the country's conflicts and legends, leaving only a few snippets of secrets to discover on his path. Also gone are the days of basic monster hunting, and instead he is charged with leading a resistance against a mechanical and undead army, none of which really feels like something that fits in with Van Helsing (they were featured in the first game, but not to this degree).The variety of monsters you face feels limited, though it could only be deceptively so. It's hard to tell as any monster design is usually lost in the pulled back camera, environments blending in with the colors of the monsters, and the sheer mass of baddies that will swarm you. I feel bad for whomever designed the creatures, putting time and effort into creating each and every unique monster, only to have 90% of their design lost in the crowds. There are unique enemies, much like in Diablo, but unlike Diablo they are few and far between, with no real randomness to their set up. For the most part you'll just dredge through wave after wave of swarming enemies, only able to pick out your allies in the crowd by the color of their health bar.Musically the game falls flat. The title score perfectly matches the backdrop of the time period (fictional though it may be), but you'll be hearing that and not much else for the entire game. Your attacks have adequete sounds to follow their barrage, but the enemies will pretty much just roar and snarl, if anything. Voice acting is average to below average in some cases. The actors read their lines, do the inflections as best they can, but there's no passion or thought behind the efforts.Just like the first game, the gameplay is heavily inspired by Diablo, where you move by clicking on an area or just holding down the mouse button and aiming your hunter, and attacking is also controlled by the mouse buttons and the 1-6 keys, so you wont really be mixing movement and attacks at the same time, though it's highly recommended you learn to not stay in one place for too long unless you're really good at slowing enemies down. To help you in your quest you have skills, auras, and tricks. Skills are acquired through the skill tree, the points for which are gained with every level. At first they're cheap, needing only one point to upgrade, but soon they raise the price to two points per upgrade and then three. This is done so you don't get more powerful abilities as quickly as the lower level ones, but as a result progression through your tree feels very slow, especially as you debate whether or not you should upgrade an existing skill, either through a passive effect or one of three bonus effects that you can toggle in the field. To its credit, this game does well with an individual skill, tossing aside the notion that it's all just upgrade the skill in a lateral fashion, and instead allowing you to further customize how you want your skill to operate, but much like the costs of skills this also serves to slow down progression through the tree. You can argue if this is good or bad, objectively, but to the player it feels dull. Auras are passive upgrades and tricks are mana-less abilities usually reserved for when situations get tough. Both auras and tricks are upgraded with skill points as well, though, further slowing down tree progression and either resulting in you having a few of each, or a lot of skills and virtually none of the other two.Coming over from the DLC of the first game, Helsing II allows you to choose between three classes instead of one: hunter, engineer, and mage (the exact names I don't remember or care to look up). Hunters can use guns or swords and swap between either on the fly (though you'll most likely only stick with one as they don't share a skill tree but they have to share points - further progression slowing). Engineers attack more slowly and deliberately as well as summon turrets and mechanized spiders to help out. Mages do what mages do best: magic. All three can dabble in different elements (fire, ice, poison, and lightning), so they all feel very similiar in their effects even though their executions can be different. The game would had been better served with just the original class, much how the vanilla version of the first game came. This allowed for a very varied class, offering lots of avenues to explore for your hunter. Now, all three feel slightly more limited compared to the original design of the previous game.Gear comes much like in diablo, in different rarities with a lot of different stats to consider. You can enchant gear, there are set bonuses, the usual fare you come to expect from an action RPG. The large variety of stats that can be on a piece of gear allows for gear progression to be less linear than most games, which can be overwhelming but it does make for a richer experience.Tower defense is back, but you can completely skip over it if you want; while fun, it's understandable if you do skip it after the first or second try, as it can get tedious. Along with tower defense you have unique npcs you can send out on missions along with soliders you pay to train and equip, and a beastie that can also go out on missions and collect loot and gold for you. It's a concept that has been done before, but honestly it's not one I'm a fan of. You are given these quests that sound interesting, and then are told that you are not allowed to go - you have to send an npc on the mission and you don't see how they progress, just if they succeeded or not. It's incredibly hollow and I saw no point in its inclusion at all.Overall, the game plays much like the first game, but what content was there has been watered down by the inclusion of new, often shallow, content and all of it is spread too thin on a surprsingly short game. There is three chapters to the game, each relatively short and the story of the game just...ends. You can see it coming rather easily, but you're still interested in what will come of the predictable development, but they don't give you the satisfaction. The cliff hanger of this caliber is almost insulting, flaunting the idea of a sequel or future DLC so blatantly you get the feeling that they just didn't feel like giving you a real story when they could chop it up and serve it to you over a longer period of time, hoping you are willing to pay up each time you get another chunk.If you're looking for a fun action RPG, you'd be better suited with the first Van Helsing, or better yet Torchlight I/II.

												Critical bugs which prevent you to complete certain parts of the game are still present and this is unacceptable and it feels like half finished product more than a year after its release (even you released a sequel in the mean time which is also bugged).I experienced very low FPS on some rainy levels, especially during the extraction rig boss fight on my geforce gtx 980 dropping to 15-20 in some cases.Multiplayer is still unplayable also.Please finish & test your games before you release them.

												The game is unplayable, even in single player you can only go so far before a bug will completely stop your game progression. Do not waste your money for a game you will not be able to play past any decent point. I got to level 14, which by this games standard (as far as I can tell) is not very high, then I was halted entirely by a bug that made a quest interaction unable to occur. I am not the only to experiance the bug at the instance I did. I you want a complete game like Diablo just buy Diablo because at least you can complete it. I not only do not recomend this game but if the is the product this devloper is producing I refuse to purchase any further games from them. The game has been out for over a year now and is still unplayable.			"

												This game crash and lag every few minutes. I wouldn’t suggest on those who want to buy this game is to wait until they, NeoCore Games, fix it.While playing  this game in co-op story mode, the game would constantly crash or lag, forcing me to shut down the game and steam in order to relog back in. Then in a few more minutes it would the freeze up until it crash.  Another major bug I have encountered is the skill bug that would allow you to duplicate your ghost infinitely and use the healing spell without consuming any mana. Please fix this game. I pay, reorder,  for a working game and not to be beta tester.			"

												You like Diablo3? Then it's very unlikely you won't like this one. It got soul.You even know and liked part 1? Then you'll definitely love part 2!What a nice successor. They took everything that worked from the first part and made it even better/larger/funnier/bigger/enjoyable/etc. On a technical basis not very much has changed but to hell with that. In times where multi-million-dollar-projects are boring and completely shallow, pearls like this stand apart.Let me sum it up:+ Totally acceptable story for an ARPG. It's no ""Planescape: Torment"" but it does its job very well+ Loot, loot, loot. Socket it, enchant it, remodel it, change its appearance, compare it...+ Inventory management is nice. Lots of keys to access both character's inventory fast, and a lot of space too+ Interesting character progression, nice and many skills. Your companion is more configurable than the main character in other ARPGs+ The companion. Not as funny as ""Claptrap"" but it adds to the atmosphere+ Send your troops/captains to extra side missions. Nice idea. Some variety to the usual fighting+ The base/lair. Everything you need (incl. respec-NPC) and some gimmicks for variety+ Tower-defense minigames. Love it! If you're not that much into TD you could skip it though+ fitting/nice soundtrack, decent SFX* Except Katarina and the Protagonist the voice-overs are feeling unmotivated. But it's acceptable for that budget* Just 3 classes. And each with two major specializing differences. Could have been some more but...* Mobs do not vary much in each region, but just in time before it starts to get boring you're in the next area with other fitting mobs- not found anything negative yet. Suprising!One last word: Don't let the ""cheap"" price fool you. This fellow is very well on par with Diablo 3. At least single-player-wise (as I have not yet tested MP).			"

												Honestly, it was too short and the ending of the story came about too soon and too suddenly. Other than that it was very similar to the first game and I enjoyed playing it. All the Easter Eggs made me smile. I haven't done multiplayer, but in single player I only encountered one bug that was easily ignored by a console command. The variety of skills and weapons makes it a lot of fun and there's always room to replay the game as a different class to see if you can beat it again - like you could with the first game. The addition of a war table made for a fun distraction in-between quests.			"

												Time Bought: Pre Ordered Money Spent: $37.50Worth The Price?: YesPosition In Game At Time Of Review: Have all my classes max leveled, have game & DLCs on 2 steam accts, got most of the sets epics and all godlikes, farmingAfter adding the first Van Helsing to one of the most favorite games I've ever played, VH2 only polished and added to the enjoyment where the first one left off. I was still playing the first one up to the release of this game and continued playing it during this one. But VH2 not only left off where the last story ended, but improved on tons of things to make this game even more enjoyable than the first. So with this in mind, I wrote a review for people new to the series as well as one for people who have played the first game and are considering getting this one.Newcomers to the Van Helsing trilogy-Even if you haven't played the first one, it would still be enjoyable to start with VH2. The reason for this is much like any other game, such as Borderlands 2. Playing the first one AFTER the second one will give you more depth in the story as well as make you appreciate all the changes that were done in the second game. Even though I would recommend playing the first one first, I don't see any spoilers at all in VH2 to the storyline of VH1. There are even items/gear that is reverse compatible ;) which you will probably think is pretty keen of the developers. Yes, it plays like Diablo 3, but that is by all means not a bad thing. But that comparison is very similar to saying Battlefield plays like CoD or MoH. And what about the ""Gears of War"" and ""God of War"" comparisons in other games. Yah, it's kinda like that :/ All in all, if you get VH2, you will be getting a great funny and very enjoyable RPG which you can co op up to 4 players as well as PvP. When you play it, you'll know it's going to be a great game from the photobomb on the title screen hahaha.Ones who've played the first Van Helsing-It may look like the same game but many things have been polished to fit customer satisfaction. For instance there are still 6 pages of storage, but now most of the gear takes 2 blocks instead of 3, and the storage space has been significantly expanded. So now there is over double the storage space of the first game. Along with the max level reaching 60 instead of 30, there are doubled the skills to mess around with! So you have the option of lvl10ing the skills and tricks you have ported over OR taking them off and starting a whole new tree of new abilities. Or you can even mix it. Oh yeah, as I stated, you can export over your powered up character from the first game :) The Chimera is not as powerful as it looks but is still a great addition as well as a little storyline within the sp story. Also the 'sets' and 'epics' have 'ink infested' versions which are level 60s. So even though you may have a complete set with the level ranges at 33 38 and 45, you can still farm for the all level 60 versions of that same set :)))) OMG, and wait until you get your first 'godlike' item!!! Besides that they just expanded on everything that made the first game so fun to play like: glory, perks, weapons & gear, laughs, easter eggs, tower defense, etc. The story, I would like to compare to The Matrix Reloaded. Not the best story, but essential in the trilogy and to any fan of the first game. It was also fun to play through with more boss fights and loot drops. So basically, I would definitely recommend this game if you've played through the first one even just once.The DLCs-I've written separate reviews on each DLC.Rating: 9/10			"

												Highly recommended, if you're into hack'n'slash RPGs. If you like the Diablo series, and you need a change of scenery, pick up this game, and pick up the first episode too. It does not revolutionize the genre. The production might not be up to AAA standards. The voice acting is a bit so-so at places, the UI is not the cleanest. But the gameplay itself is solid, the class and talent system is complex enough to validate multiple playthroughs, and offers randomized scenarios after finishing the story, which is about 8-10 hours long.

												Personal rating 8/10 A little fun game, a lot like diablo but it's way more friendly. I strongly recommend getting this if you enjoy diablo type of games. It has improved from the very first game on every aspect of the game. This game has a great value for the money.Pros:Cracking jokes, references from other games or movies (such as batman sign in the sky or half life sign on the wall,star wars, alien and so on...you have to look out for those well worth it.)Good story took me 20 hours to beat the game, i wasn't rushing tho. Simple controls, variaty of items to satisfy your builds.Visually looks very appealing for such a small game, it looks even better than diablo 3 in my opinion. Cons: had a few crashes, that's the main reason why i didn't give this game a higher rating than 8/10.Improvements? set items could get a small boost to the drop rate, fairly difficult to obtain a full set.

												Horrible glitches, constant freezes, wow is this game terribly flawed. They should never have mentioned multiplayer when it clearly cannot go more than a few hours before all you encounter are multiple bugs. If you die and try to respawn the game instantly freezes and does not unfreeze. There are occassions when your special abilities are limitless, but the game will crash. Sometimes you will move and the enemies will go in circles but you cant hit anything or pick up anything. This game has been out for about a week or so and yet their tiny updates fix nothing in regards to multiplayer gameplay. If you are looking to play this solo, as i have tested out the solo gameplay, then it is an ok game 6.5\10...multiplayer i give it a 2.5\10, horrible glitches. Me and my two friends due to lack of multiplayer games chose to take a chance on the second game, boy do we wish there was a refund clause being implemented on these companies and their lack of testing a product before accepting money in exchange. They hit you up for your money and just ignore you like the interacting has ended once money has exchanged hands.			"

Yes, we have brand new skills and perks and all this stuff here, but it isn't much to make this one challenging.Also VH II is buggy (not so badly as first part, but anyway) and loads as long as Vista on first Pentium.You should look for first game: it's cheaper now and isn't worse after year of fixes.

By the other hand, you can really customize your gear with enchantments, runes. The skills and perks are ""cool"" and the coop system beside is bugged, if you manage to enter, is funny.

												The second installment of Van Helsing's series has nothing more to offer than the first one.It still has all the requirement to fit every stereotype of the hack'n'slash: poor graphics, chaotic, slightly boring, flat protagonist, no real dialogue, repetitive to death. Clearly it is not genre I like that much. So, why am I playing it, and recommending it on top of that? Two main reasons, which are what really set Van Helsing apart from all the other games of its genre: the amazing atmosphere of its world, a charismatic mix of steampunk and gothic fantasy you cannot find anywhere else; and secondly, the quirky humour, filled with references to other famous brands. Honestly, in which other game can you loot a dead Grey Wizard, wielding a sword and a staff, lying in front of a broken bridge, in an underground cave?			"

												The original game offered enjoyable writing and voice acting, plenty of loot and a decent campaign. II delivers more of the same, with a number of additional game features including an expanded tower defence mode, a new companion of sorts and the ability to dispatch recruits on missions. Even the numerous pop culture references generally bring a smile.Unfortunately, it is clearly lacking polish - from typos and even completely wrong lines in the subtitles, to constantly getting stuck in the scenery when using the Dash move to the game locking up whenever a certain button is pressed on a controller. It's particularly troubling that a sequel to this was rushed out, with plenty of its own problems, when this game could have used a bit more work. Still, though those are aggravations, the game is still a enjoyable experience apart from that.			"

												★★★☆☆The game was alright, just barely gets a positive review from me. And here is as to why.Positive:The game has the same combat, gameplay, graphics and feel as the previous title.It expands upon the skill trees and makes it feel like you progress a bit better.Negative:I played the game through on hard, and it wasn't difficult just very annoying because I constantly had to use health potions and it took forever to kill anything, even with the best equipment. The final battle didn't satisfy me, it was a lot easier than everything before it, and it left me with a ""... is that it?"" ending.If you liked the first you will like the second, just don't play it on hard, and don't import your character, the game is far too cruel with imported characters (I couldn't get through any fight without dying at least twice -_-) 3/5.

												Fantastic!~ I love this game. In gameplay, the producer is quite thoughtful for players, not just hotkeys, exciting gameplay and there is also a lot of convenience like teleporting back to home any time you want and many teleporters in the map is really saving players' time. Of course, also with incredible gameplay, this is worth to play.However, there are... too many bugs about the system that the game is easy to crash, you may take a look the details at here:""http://www.crashwiki.com/incredible-adventures-van-helsing-ii-10-ways-fix-crashes-import-options-poor-fps-colors-co-op/ ""(Close the advertisement first to see the page.)

												The game is advertised as featuring multiplayer.It does not. Freezing, crashing, and afterimages of allies are the norm. Level-up intervals are incredibly short, requiring you stop and adjust abilities and attributes for the player and ghost pet far too frequently, and the additional reputation system merely adds to these breaks from play. The game is also incredibly RAM-intensive without particularly impressive graphics.			"

												The game has alot of broken content. The trophy desk for levels 31+ has no explanation and nothing in that menu responds, you cant actually use the crafting system, and from what i've heard (unable to test since nobody plays this anymore)the multiplayer was/is broken. The endgame content is nonexistent because after beating the game, the only thing I could do was go back and fight respawned enemies, and if the content was supposed to be multiplayer, that ain't happening. If there was anything else to do, the game didn't bother to hint at it. Next, the combat is unbalanced. Enemies have such a wide variety of strength that one enemy will feel like you're at the beginning of the game, and the next enemy kills you in a single hit, even on NORMAL difficulty. This results in a bunch of frustrating moments where even with a properly leveled character, you end up getting killed before you can even react (keep in mind that this was normal difficulty setting. The higher difficulties must be god awful). I spent most of my gold reviving myself from deaths that I couldnt even react to. Its also one of those systems that scales with how much gold you have, and allows you to revive for no cost if you're broke or in a boss fight so death is of no consequence, since the shop has items worse than item drops. Aside from the glaring issues during the later enemies, the beginning to mid point has okay combat. The skill tree is garbage - in order to get later skils you have to buy unrelated skills you'll never use, wasting points. Anything but the most basic skills require many more levels than the actual level requirement for the skill, unless you invest most points into getting a single skill. It doesn't help that these stepping stone skills cost more than one point at a time. Theres also Auras and tricks in tabs beside the skills, but they work off the same points system, further reducing the points you have for skills. There's also one skill called ""Boiling blood"" that does a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of damage to the enemy at the cost of *some* health. They obviously never bothered to test the skill, because it uses *all* of your health (this skill is a good way to commit suicide), and usually instakills the enemy too. The crazy part is, I didn't even know it was the skill killing me at first because the rest of the enemies kill me so fast anyway. This means that the PVP combat was probably broken beyond repair, but thank god it didn't work in the first place and the rest of the skills are probably unbalanced as well. The games various menus are clunky. There are many extra menus and submenus that don't need separate pages, the menus have no consistent formatting and often alot of things lack clear explanation so you end up needing to google info on what this or that does. The map is servicable, but it is confusing. The mission system in the base is worthless. The only reward you get is gold which you'll spend reviving yourself, and trash items that you'll probably sell for more gold. Most missions can't be done by you, you have to select a general to have a random chance of success or failure. It's pretty boring TBH, read a description, send a general with the skills to match that description, wait 30 minutes for the lottery to finish, get gold you don't need, or an injured general you'll need another 30 minutes to use, repeat. The generals can level up, but they only get a perk which provides a miniscule boost. Since the generals can't upgrade any skills to a usable point besides their preset skills, theres no point in leveling up your generals, or to even use them at all.The missions you can do involve defending a base, where you spend points on traps to kill the enemies. Like the boiling blood skill, they didn't test them at all, so the gatling gun turret is the best, and usually kills everything on its own.  Most of the kills are done through traps, which makes it more of a tower defence than an ARPG. Getting to the story, it has 3 good main characters and a pet chimera, but everybody else in the game is forgettable(That word doesn't even begin to describe it). They are introduced for one quest, then become a useless npc in the base that I guarantee you'll never use. The voice acting and witty banter between Helsing and Katarina is good, but that's the only thing in the game thats good. As for the ending, it didn't resolve, it's just setup bait for the next game, so if you want the story, you'll have to buy their next game. The game itself works(as far as technical issues, the game sucks), and looks good but this is not worth playing honestly. 2/5.  Just buy diablo 3.			"

												It could have been fun, but right now, it is not. You can't import your character from VH I because of an already over a year old bug that still is not fixed. If you start a new character at level 1, the item drops that are useful have a requirement of level 30+, so you can't use them when they drop for your level 5 character. That is also a known bug and still isn't fixed, although a patch has been announced repeatedly (as was for the ""file too old"" bug that prevents importing a character) So, while the first installment was fun, I can not recommend VH II for the lack of support and bug fixes.

												If you liked the 1st part, then you will surely like this one too... I wonder why many felt negative about this game. In my opinion the key factor is the ""time-gap"" between games. I mean, if you start playing the 2nd part right after finishing the 1st part, you are sure to feel bored or a 'drag' of the whole story. A 3-4 month gap after playing the 1st one should keep you interested in part 2.When I first purchased Part 1, Part 2 & 3 were already out, but I did not buy all together. Purchased one after one with gap between gameplay.			"

The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing IIAs the second sequel in a trilogy, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II does keep its pros from the previous game. Unfortunately, it also retains its con. Recommended as the cons are not really a game breaking.ProMemorable companion*. Still loves her.Quest system*. They have since added some additional quest involving Captains and Fluffy. Not really game affecting quest but it does makes an excuse for a little breather and a nice source of extra income and items/essences.Tower defence mini game*. The traps are now improved with more choices. Still wish to be able to play this mini game on demand. The skill systems are well made* but not perfect. It is now improved compared to the previous skill but still, my best skill is Scattering shot from the 1st game, and that is the skill that makes it easy to get past through most enemies.ConArtificial difficulty*. Come at me bro.Some skills are still useless*. Nevertheless, they made few improvement regarding this. Single target skills generally have much higher damage and almost all skill will have a bit of a multi-target effect to it such as Ricochet. Some bug and glitches can still be seen*. CTD when trying to place a rune on the create item slot. CTD when trying to refund Acid Puddle skill.The rune system doesn’t feels like tailored for midgame. Based on the number of required item and price for rune crafting, it doesn’t feels like it meant for mid game item upgrade. You can craft things, but it feels like it’s more of an end game system or rather completing items after finishing all the quest. * Refer to The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing review  "

												Since some folks may look into puchasing these games individually as opposed to in the ""Final Cut"" edition which includes all 3 games, I'm going to also post a review of the individual games, taken from my Final Cut review with very slight modifications. I'm going to call this one Van Helsing II (while the first and third games will be I and III, of course).This a good game. However, the maps don't stand out/wow me like Van Helsing I did. I played through most of the game in its original release, and through its entirety in this version. You get a pet chimera, which sits in your base and you can send it to search for gear by clicking a map for it to go to. You never see the chimera except at our base, and he takes 10 minutes per trip to return, but you can reduce the time to 4 minutes if you find enough special items to equip on him. I only found 2, and he took 6 minutes to come back. He levels up, but it took a long time for me to get him to level 5. Leveling him up just means you have better odds of getting items when you send him out, and I never got anything jaw-dropping. It's a fun little minigame of sorts, but nothing incredible. That's the biggest change between Van Helsing I and Van Helsing II. Other than that, the story was decent but nothing amazing, the movie/TV/game references got a little carried away, but it didn't push me too far, and I actually thought the final boss fight was really well done for this sort of game. It was better than the -final- boss fight of any Diablo game, in my opinion, as you are going up against two bosses leading two armies, both of which are all trying to kill you! You show up in the middle and can take the armies' qualities into account to help decide which side you should ""aid"" in winning before taking that side out last. I wish more action RPGs with this camera perspective put anywhere near this much effort into making boss fights fun. The villain was kinda meh, and there's a character who you will look at and say ""This ally character is obviously evil"" the moment you meet the character. Still, it's a pretty decent game; not great as the first. I do recommend it, but it's more of a ""yeah, it's pretty good"" situation where it makes the recommended list, but not by a lot, whereas I will praise the first game for years to come.			"

												You can get this game for pretty cheap. Complete pack for like 5 euros. I've played a lot of hack n slash games like path of exile, diablo 2 and 3, titan quest, torchlight 1 and 2 and pretty much every hack n slash and action rpg you can think of. I guess I must say this game is at the bottom of my top list, but as a hardcore fan of the genre I wouldn't say no to this game.If you are lacking a hack n slash at the moment, get it for cheap and enjoy. I played it for about 40 hours and by that time I had done everything there is to be done and even a little bit more.That said, it has a lot of bugs that never got fixed and will be a small hinderance when playing through the game.

It still doesnt beat Diablo 3 in my mind but definitely comes a close second. Go and buy this game as you cannot go wrong. A lot of reviews talk about bugs but i havent seen any to date.

												This game is really awesome and a lot of fun. Its more of ""The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing Episode 2"", rather than a second seperate game. The story line picks up right were the first game ends and you should ideally import your character from the first game. There is a whole second tier of abilities added onto the first set thats in the first game, and if you don't import a level 30 character, you won't be able to get those abilities (unless you play with one of  the level-30s they already have available. There are a few more things they've added in from the first game, such as squad commanders located in the lair that you can send out on missions, kind of like the missions you send you assassins out on in AC: Brotherhood. They also improved the lair-defense mini-game so its  a lot more fun....and if you don't want to play the defense game, you can send your resistance squads to do it for you. One final thing that makes this game so awesome is all the funny little pop culture references...one of the early missions is ""Saving Private Bryan"", who is totally useless except for the fact that the commanders like the cakes he makes...and when you go into a cave, Katerina says ""We can't stop here, this is bat country"". Also, there's Don Quixote's lance, some plans from Da Vinci that give you a permanent stat boost, and you find Gandalf's body with a sword and staff on it...Van Helsing and Katerina make fun of him for trying to be a wizard and a fighter. Also you come across a Stargate. I like this game more than Torchlight or Diablo, and if you like dungeon crawlers, you'll probably like this one. But just play the first one before this one so you can import your save.			"

												I loved the first game, which I played all the way through. The first was really a Diablo/Torchlight clone in a different setting with a tower defence mini game thrown in. This one feels like it should be similar but they have strayed away from the formula a bit too far and the game is somehow worse for it. Also the difficult jump is just frustrating if you import a character like I did. All your good kit from VH1 is pointless garbage, ditch it right away. Even as you kit up you wlll find some foes that are simple and the next second some monster that just instakills you and nothing you can really do about it.You also keep getting called back to base so you can assign people to the task which just breaks the flow.There are far better ARPGs out there and looking at the feedback to VH3 the series fell off the tracks.

Why is general Harker a ""bad guy"" if all he wants is to clean the streets from monsters and bandits? What's up with this Resistance? Who are they resisting, exactly? Why the scientists are suddenly villains? Why half of the people here have slavic names and the other half don't? Where are all the vampires and why is one of them Van Helsing's ally? I really had no time and/or desire to figure all of this out. Seriously, even Torchlight had a better story, at least it was simple and self-explanatory.To make things worse, the game has its share of bugs, too. And the co-op mode, which is the only one i'd ever want to play in this case, is currently a laggy mess.Overall, the game's not horrible, and it probably has its moments in the later stages, but to me it's just not worth it. I'd rather pick any alternative action-RPG (i.e. Diablo 3, PoE, Grim Dawn, Torchlight 2...) than this one.P.S. The jokes like ""save private Bryan"" aren't funny.			"

												Hire some testers. I did not care run time bugs , crashes or buggy quests at VH I. But i can't import my old character to VH2 ,  ""This file is too old and cannot be loaded."". This bug is fatal for me and i am going to play this game when i can import my old char. Until that time i am done with Van Helsing. Thanks for artwork.			"

												Lags on my laptop with lowest possible settings, yet I play D3, WoW, Mass Effect series, etc just fine on medium+ settings. Tried to switch to smaller resolution in windowed mode but now the game window is just title and border with maybe a 100x20 px dimension that crashes every time I try to start the game. No way to get in and change to graphics settings, no utilities or configs I can find in the file directory tree... So I can't even try to play it anymroe. Thanks.This game is barely in beta stages, how did this get released to the public?Edit: Found registry data in 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\'. Renamed 'NeoCore Games' to 'NeoCore Games_old' and it regenerated registry data. Back to trying to get it running without massive lag.			"

												Another good game for the most part. I love the atmosphere of the game. Has several funny parts as well (some little movie tidbits mixed in here and there) and Katarina always has something to say. 3 characters to choose from and unlimited possibilties to change your gear and try to build the character you want.But, what plagued the first game plagues this one as well. It is incredibly hard, which is isn't necesasarily a bad thing, but this game is so hard until you get leveled up (almost to the max) that it explains why there is such a low completion rate of this game (I believe less than 20%). The camera angles are terrible. Causes alot of issues, especially in battle. And when you get to level 57, you open the scenarios window. If you thought the game was hard, the scenarios are even harder. When you have an achievement that you can't die during a scenario to get it, you knows it's hard (less than 1% have)Still enjoyed the game though. Nice music, story, and solid graphics with unrelenting action makes this game move along. If you want a challenge, look no further. "

												A great sequel to the Van Helsing franchise, continuing on fighting oppression in Bolgovia you must once again travel through the ink and slay hordes of monsters all while powering up a fresh new hunter or an imported character from the original. With loads more abilities, 30 extra levels, and new game mechanics like runecrafting and scrolls to add to the fun you can truly create a demonslayer, and unlike the previous game the bugs are almost non existent which is a great improvement. 9/10			"

												Quick Summary – This is a direct continuation of the first game The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing (VH1), beginning immediately after the final boss battle of that game.  The gameplay is identical, and in fact you can import your VH1 character to play through the VH2 campaign. The same three character classes appear: Hunter, Thaumaturge, and Arcane Mechanic (the second 2 were DLC characters in VH1) and the character skills are basically the same up until around level 30. In VH2 there are more “end game” things to keep you playing after you’ve beaten the main story. If you enjoyed part 1 you should like part 2.You play the title character Van Helsing, a monster hunter attempting to clear the cursed land of Borgova with your trusty (and sassy) ghost sidekick Lady Katarina. In the first game, you defeated an evil mad scientist and his clockwork monster army, but now a new hardass general has arrived to take up the evil reins. Once again, you and Katarina must work with the Borgova Resistance to destroy an army of abominations as well as face the various wild creatures of this tainted country. The Van Helsing games are steampunk third person isometric hack / slash RPGs like the Diablo or Torchlight series, so if you’ve played one of those you should have a good idea what you’re in for (swords, sorcery, loot). Gameplay-wise your pal Katarina is like a mercenary in Diablo 2 or a pet in Torchlight. She has her own equipment/stats/skill trees though, so you’ll need to spend some time making sure her build is up to par. As you’d expect, there is an extensive randomized “loot” system where you can find magical/rare/epic equipment to outfit your hero (a lot of equipment is class specific but you can twink items between characters using a shared stash). If you search online you can hear rumors of “godlike” gear, though it’s so rare that 99% of players will probably never even see one.In the first Van Helsing, the game was mostly over after you beat the last boss. The level cap was 30, and there wasn’t much to do after you finish except run “scenarios” which were hard bonus maps with upgraded loot. Bear in mind that in both Van Helsing games the main campaign maps are not randomized. Once you’ve played through the game you’ll know exactly where everything is. In VH2, there is a “veteran mode” which is a higher level playthrough of the same campaign (like True Vault Hunter in Borderlands, or Nightmare mode in Diablo) where the enemies are stronger and the loot is noticeably better. Additionally, the level cap is 60 and there are a bunch of new skills that weren’t in the first game. Oddly enough, you can adjust the game difficulty in veteran mode without penalty (higher level but easy mode!).Pros:+Nice graphics for an indie game. The story is decent (though it feels kind of short) and there are a huge number of pop culture references and pokes at other games. This is a logical continuation of the fun Van Helsing 1 game, leading directly to the third game and forming a cohesive storyline.+There is a co-op multiplayer option though I wasn’t able to find anyone to play with immediately. Campaigns are always more fun when you go through them with a partner.+If you liked the tower defense mission in the first game, there are a lot more in Van Helsing 2 though they’re basically optional quests. So if you hate Tower Defense just delegate the missions to your underlings.Cons:-My research shows a lot of complaints about the cooperative campaign “breaking” and stranding people’s characters unable to advance. I’ve experienced it once myself despite reports that the bug has been fixed. Multiplayer search is also pretty dead, you need to set up games with your friends and not rely on built in matchmaking. Alas a bunch of the Steam achievements are for multiplayer PVP -There is not all that much info online about this game. It’s hard to find comprehensive help on achievements / skill builds, probably due to the game’s indie nature. The game’s developer has basically moved on to Van Helsing 3 and won’t be doing much more for this game. You can play through the entire game and not understand a number of the “important” aspects. For example I didn’t even know what runecrafting / essences / trophies were or how they worked without researching online. They’re not even mentioned in the game’s tutorials.-One thing to note if you’re importing a character from Van Helsing 1. Your Katarina will be significantly weaker than if you play through VH2 on normal and then switch to Veteran mode. This may be a bug, but it’s really annoying if you’re trying to build an “ultimate character.”Overall I enjoyed this game, and if you liked Diablo, Torchlight, or Path of Exile you probably will too. Don’t expect it to be “better” than the first game though, it’s more like a second episode in the campaign. Going through single player takes about 12 hours to finish on normal mode, but if you don’t play through veteran mode (up to level 60), you’ll be missing out on literally half the skills/equipment.

												UPDATE 2: I've decided to change my review. While having to wait a week to complete the game, as my save file was fixed by the developers, they did indeed fix it. They've also patched one of the problems I mentioned and are working on patching the other. The point is neocoregames is actively trying to support their games and I have to commend them for the effort. The fact is, this game is so good that it is easy to hold it to the standards of a AAA game, and frankly, it should be. There is so much to love about this game (I can't speak for the other two), that if these wrinkles are ironed out, I could see a lot more people taking a chance on an unknown Hungarian talent. I finally finished the story and I was not disappointed. UPDATE: IMPORTANT - 27 hours in and I encountered a bug where a quest NPC does not appear. I cannot progress further. I cannot finish the game. This is a known issue. Google revealed multiple threads dealing with the same issue. Going to steam for a refund. 27 hours gone on a game I can't finish. Seriously. I'm not downvotimg this game. I chose thumbs down because honestly, I couldn't recommend it to anyone in good faith. There is SO much potential here, but Neocoregames as a developer have decided to exploit there games rather than finish them. These games are just not finished.Look, I love the story. I love the humor, the art, the music, the loot system, everything. It is the perfect hack and slash game, but these Hungarians are more interested in the short term. They want to make a quick buck and move onto the next thing. I don't know who owns the company, but chances are they aren't a gamer and more of an entrepreneur. Each new game or DLC means new clothes, or house, or cars for them. It's the only thing that explain the horrible ♥♥♥♥ing mess these games degrade intoFirst, there was no native controller support. Then, they tacked it on post development and its atrocious. Menus are clunky to navigate, features are just missing. You can't read any flavor text or descriptions. There are tower defense levels, but you'll later realize YOU CAN'T even reach the most important towers using a controller.There are weird visuals on the screen when using a controller. Certain menus can crash your game (search for skills crash, merchant crash, or rune crash).Point is, I want to love this game so much. There are so many funny moments and the gameplay could've been top notch, but there's no ignoring the problems. Every hour invested in this game is tempting disappointment. It's like dating someone you don't trust. You haven't caught them cheating, but you know you're risking having your heart broken. Stay for love, or leave for your own sanity. I've finally chosen sanity.Ciao Van helsing.			"

This was mostly a response to the ""most helpful"" review at the time (which did not recommend the game) that became too long to fit in the comments.  http://steamcommunity.com//profiles/76561198005772592/recommended/272470/ I felt like the review in question mostly complained about items that the ARPG genre struggles with in general, not just Van Helsing.  With Van Helsing's fresh and numerous, unique additions though, I believe this to be a requisite title for any ARPG fan.It's not that I disagree with all of your assessments, but pretty much all ARPG's have problems with items #1-3 throughout in some form or another.  I usually play a melee character, and other games usually treat melee badly (vanilla Diablo 3 comes to mind, at least compared to my experience with Barbarian vs Witch Doctor).  I was pleased to have a pleasant experience in Van Helsing 2 using a melee character.  I can't speak to mage balance because I balanced my DPS with plenty of defense/resist as a melee theme (no mana shield though).  I would sometimes get gibbed pretty quick, but I would usually see that there was dangerous stuff I didn't move out of (kinda my bad).  Plus, this game has a perk that lets you get a ""free life"" every 3 minutes where you turn into a ghost on the spot so that little mess-ups aren't such a big deal.  There's a trick that lets you vanish from all aggro as well.To touch on difficulty:  I played the game on Hard, but you can change it on the fly (which is nice) and you can get these unique trophies that modify the difficulty of the game in very specific tradeoff style ways (if you so choose).  My favorite was a trophy that gave +100 magic find, but mobs have 20% more HP.Van Helsing's storyline #3 is waaay better than almost all other ARPG in my opinion.  The quests, dialogue/voice acting, and story progression are probably only matched by Diablo 3 in quality.  Torchlight, Path of Exile, and other ARPGs barely have a useful story aside from framing mob slaughter.  It's not as good as every other game I've played, but it's top notch for ARPGs.  I see this as a highly subjective evaluation though, so I'm not as adamant about this as the other items.Endgame for #4 I can't speak to, because I usually just play through games once usually.  I haven't tried multiplayer #5, but I can see that would be a frustrating experience.In my experience with the hunter on hard for one play-through (no multiplayer), I would definitely recommend it.  I see that you had problems with the mage and maybe the gibbing gave a bad taste in your mouth playing at heroic difficulty.  When comparing it to other ARPGs, it's hard for me to see how a fan of the genre wouldn't enjoy experiencing Van Helsing and thus recommend others to ""give it a go.""   I really thought the unique elements of this game were refreshing and want to see a third one.List of other awesome stuff I love about this game is below.  I'll add more later whenever they come to mind as I'm playing the ""Ink Hunt"" DLC and replay the game using an Arcane mechanic. WASD movement option:  I don't use WASD all the time to move and attack, but it helps tremendously when kiting and in place of a ""move here"" hotkey.  By the way, they need to add a ""move here"" key, I was looking for it when I saw I could configure WASD (they currently have it defaulted as the up, down, left, and right keys.  You can also do another advanced move where you can use your mouse for things on menus (character/inventory, etc) while at the same time moving around precisely (where normally if you want to move, you HAVE to have clicked with your mouse on something).  Although I wish there was an option to make make the base keys move diagonally.  W should move the character up and to the right, the S key should make the character down and to the left, etc.  This is because most paths in top down isometric ARPGs like this usually have main paths pointing diagonally.  This default diagonal movement keeps the player from more often having to hold down more than one WASD key.The many cute easter-egg moments (this is just ONE example):  In the ""Ink Hunt"" DLC I just saw two goblins in a Titanic-esque pose fall off the front of a boat in the air, embracing each other throughout their death fall.  Sadly, I was so stunned I didn't take a screenshot   :(Very easy to compare gear quickly:  When comparing gear, by using a special option in the menu, you can see two different gear comparisons.  One comparison of base stat changes, and one comparison with all enchantments together.  This way, you don't always think, ""Wow I rarely get a decent upgrade!""  When, in fact, you've been comparing the gear using the enchantment and infused essences together in most games.Interesting Boss Fights:  The bosses usually have some kind of special addition that I haven't seen.  Like in the Ink Hunt DLC, this boss shoots a fire beam out in an arc as one move, slams down from above with another move, and draws you in with a third move.  This is just one example, but at least the bosses aren't, ""They just take longer to kill"" (although they do take longer to kill).  Luckily there is also an aura that dramatically increases your proficiency (by 25%) when taking on elite mobs.  Rewarded for paying attention to positioning: For instance, there are some mobs that have wind up attacks in front of them that can easily be avoided using direction WASD.  Other mobs will have a front facing shield (some of the mobs literally have a tower shield with a peeking window) that you must get behind to score more damage.  Other mobs will visually look heavily armored in the front, and you must move behind them and they turn slowly.  And I know what you're thinking, ""That'd be annoying to tell if the mob just has a buncha armor up front, that's a subtle tell...""  and you're right!  That's why they also add the front-damaging-reducing quality to the mobs description bar as well so that there's no confusion.  I like how the game rewards me for paying attention to positioning and taking full advantage of WASD + point-n-click synergy.			"

Not recommended for co-op play.The few hours I played alone were trouble-free, however having played through the entire campaign in co-op mode I can attest to the horrid multiplayer implementation. Expect various bugs, synch issues and crashes causing frustration and time-wasting, having to restart the game client often and in some instances restarting entire sections of maps. The above major issue blemishes an otherwise excellent title, with high quality artwork, gameplay and story, continuing directly from Van Helsing I, which I recommend playing first for both the story and the character import feature, enabling continuation of the player's narrative.NB: Buy the Ink Hunt DLC for extended gameplay, ignore Pigasus.- Skinny from the Fat B*stard (curator link) "

												Good Diablo/Torchlight clone with a bit of tower defense gameplay added.Three different classes are choosable each of them can be further customized thanks to a rich skill tree.A single player playthrough takes about 15 hours.You can start a veteran game importing your character (including all skils and stuff) from the endgame or from the previous Van Helsing game.Technically is well done.Played on a i5 4670 16gb 780 Ti  obviously it was smooth as butter with all bells and whistles turned on at 1920*1200.Just for kicks I've tried it on a E8500 4gb 5870 with the same settings and resolution....had to turn off many graphical settings to reduce lag.

Posted: May 25, 2015
												Is this game any good? Yes, yes it is, but it's definitely not ""great"". I still recommend it. Here's why: Pros:- Engaging story and characters (for an action RPG) with enough humour and charme to keep you entertained- Interesting setting (It's a mixture of the industrial revolution with magic and monster hunters), with interesting enemy design etc.- Gameplay is good enough- Diverse skill tree- Lots of items- 3 distinct classes (I think the other classes were in VH 1 as DLC). The traditional hunter, a flamethrower type guy with advanced weapons and a mage- 4 difficulty settings- Ability to import chars from VH 1 or create an ""expert char"" at lvl 30- ""Endless mode"" apparently- Low price point- Base of operationsCons:- The campaign is pretty short. I've beaten it on ""Casual"", because I'm not that interested in spending 20+ hours on this, in about 9 hours with every map fully explored. The story picks right off after Fulmigatis death from VH 1. This time you are up against General Harker, who takes over where the other villain died...well, eh. It's definitely necessary to view the VH series as a 3 episode game, because that's what it is. You're pretty lost without having played VH 1.- The story has 2 major problems:  1. The main villain, General Harker, is seen only at the very end of the game and has not even 1 line of text in the entire game. What kind of villain. Wow...boring as hell. 2. It's obvious from the very beginning that Prisoner 7 is going to betray you and become the next villain...very predictable. Also, there is generally a lot less ""lore"" in the game than in VH 1..- The setting is still cool, but there is little new to it. I think a snowy peak and a spider level are the only new settings being used. The rest is typical wilderness and city...disappointed.- The gameplay isn't bad, but it's also not entertaining for long, unlike say Diablo 3, where you have several active abilities and augmentations that can be switched around for lots of combinations. Here you basically get a limited amount of skill points to use 6 active skills (of which I only used the heal for the hunter, because honestly, weapon skills seemed more important) and also, theoretically, 8 weapon skills (4 melee and 4 ranged). I say theoretically, because you can only unlock so many skills that seem useful in 1 playthrough, because you also have to level them up 10 times to get the ultimate augmentation for it and to improve its damage. Since I barely made it to level 28 in my first playthrough, I didn't have a lot of diverse skills, because, frankly, there are just so many of them and so many seem redundant. You can't just pick up a new skill and try it out, because it might be completely useless without the augmentations or without levelling it up, which makes the system rather pointless in my opinion. Again, Diablo 3 for example does a much better job of just giving you skills to play around with, without forcing you to invest loads of skill points that you can only get back through a respec which costs a lot of money.)- The crafting system: It's frankly very boring and apparently you cannot use the rune system until level 30, because items below that level can't be disenchanted for materials you need for runecrafting...that is seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥.- There are lots of items. Unfortunately, maybe 5% of the items that dropped were actually useful to me, which makes the experience rather dull...for example, if your campaign is only 8-9 hours long and your players have to use the same weapon for 3 hours then you failed in making the loot system interesting...also dropping loot that a player can't even use, because he is level 10 and you drop a level 38 sword is supremely dickish...I still have that sword in my stash.- The game is imho not unique or interesting enough to play through again...so that is also a problem. There is no longevity.- Even on the lowest difficulty setting you can get killed very easily, repeatedly, which is also kind of frustrating, for example when you are facing 3 mighty enemies and can barely pierce their shields, but get instagibbed by their non avoidable ranged attack, that is bad game design. I don't mind a challenge, but the hordes Van Helsing throws at you are ridiculous at times.- The ""base"" gets annoying pretty quickly, because you get radioed frequently to return to base and complete some mission or whatever. Thankfully you do not have to do that...at all I think, dunno, you can also let your soldiers do the missions, but it interrupts the game flow pretty annoyingly and constantly.- Money does not seem to be an issue in this game and I have no idea what to even spend it on...save for resurrects.- The sound clipping is STILL present and is extremely annoying. Try a char who doesn't shoot with guns...*sigh*All in all Van Helsing 2 does not improve in any way upon Van Helsing 1. The only new addition I can think of is the base and that's really a minor feature. The story is less engaging, the novelty has worn off. There are still funny moments, but they are less interesting in general. It feels rushed out and as I said like episode 2 of the same game, which it apparently is, since now we have Van Helsing 3, which I will be testing now, and which probably doesn't have any changes in it either. It's a bit sad, because I think you could really expand upon the game's crazy setting, but eh...maybe 3 is better.Why do I still recommend it? Because it's a solid enough ARPG for almost no cost...it's cheaper than most games are even when heavily discounted. And for that it's good enough and entertaining for a short amount of time, especially if you want to continue your save from VH 1 (which I didn't have anymore, because not Steam and uninstalled, blah).

												* Disclaimer: Review originally written for WalaWala Games[walawalagames.com]. Steam said it was too long, so read the full review at WWG[walawalagames.com]The story picks up where Van Helsing I left off -- The little town of Borgovia needs help, and monster hunter extraodinaire Van Helsing is there to aid it. Helping the resistance do what they must to get the city back and fend off the monsters; should you not have played the first installment at all, or if it’s been long since you touched it, the introduction video does a good job of recapping the important bits and summing up what’s been going on.If there’s one thing to say for Neocore games it’s that they do pretty neat cinematic cutscenes, very nice and artistic, that give you a distinct feel of watching a movie - unfortunately, even the cutscenes can sometimes be a little bit too long when they’re put in between the action. The voice actors chosen are excellent at their roles; and the chosen depths, tones and infliction the cast uses throughout the game suit the characters very well; helping immerse you in the world. Along with the lovely visual and voices, the game has one of the best soundtracks I’ve heard in an ARPG, fitting the mood and slightly dark atmosphere of the game, atmosphere that is slightly uplifted by the many humorous lines and various pop culture references that are to be found throughout Van Helsing II, as it was in the original.The graphics improve a little on Van Helsing I, but in my opinion they still seem to lack some optimization. Despite my computer being the recommended setup for the game, and despite being in low settings, I had the exact same problem with the game I did during my playthrough of Van Helsing I ... LAG. From the get go the game is just a little bit slow, and after about an hour or more of playing the game would become really slow and laggy, sometimes even freezing up for a few seconds if I continue playing. And this was in the single player campaign. It was also noticeable during loading screens - loading the game takes just a little too long sometimes, particularly during the initial loading screen. Despite that, and jumping into the actual gaming aspect, Van Helsing II can be a delight to play. Right off the bat you’re given the option to either import a character from Van Helsing I or play with a new one which you can start from level 1 or from level 30 with a pre-designed one, which is great for trying out the different classes and builds; the difficulty of the levels also accommodates depending on which starting point you choose, so you’ll still get the full experience without finding it “too easy” just because you chose to start at level 30 instead. I chose to start anew so I could get a fresh look at the game, plus, it’d been a long while since I’d last played the originial, so a refresher course wouldn’t hurt. When starting your get you get to choose between three classes: Hunter, Thaumaturge or Arcane Mechanic. The classes are all quite different from each other, and each one has a very ample skill tree (and choice of auras) to pick and choose from, so everyone is likely to find a mix of powers and skills that suit their playing style perfectly. Personally, my favorite character is still the Hunter, though the other two can be fun to play too. My only regret in the system would be that I’d like for a bit more customization options outside the skill tree (maybe more visual variety), yet in the end it doesn’t make much of a difference. Once you make your character you’ll also have access to the options menu (why you don’t have access to this before that is beyond me), which gives you plenty of chances to remap keys and change audio and video options. Some of these require you to relaunch the game to go into effect, which is a bit annoying as it takes long to load. Katarina is once more with you during the game. I like the companionship and the role she plays in the overall story and gaming aspects. She can carry stuff, you can send her out shopping, and you can pick how she will behave during fights (ranged, melee, aid only, etc), all of which is pretty neat. They also have great chemistry between them, making you feel less lonely during the map runs. The monsters are all well designed, with a fair variety to them and interesting looks and powers. The game has various difficulty modes ranging from casual to hardcore, and you can switch them at any time, yet I noticed that it seems a bit unbalanced regardless of what difficulty mode you’ve chosen: either the enemies are far too easy or far too hard, all in the same map and mode.The story is fairly linear and simple, but it's also intriguing; the characters are interesting, and the questing follows the same vein of its predecessor. The tower defense mode also returns, improved, and you can now send captains to do some of those quests for you, which is a nice change in pace (as I’m not particularly fond of defending things, I’m more into destroying them). The downside of this is every so often they interrupt your questing with information, “demanding” you get back to take care of a situation or another (you don’t really need to drop everything to do as they ask, and I believe you can turn this off, but the interruption is annoying nonetheless).The first time you’re thrown into the fry -meaning the tutorial and the very first city-defending section- I found it all a tad confusing and frustrating. During the tutorial there were some pop ups that went by just a little too fast for me to read - it was only a couple, yet it was bothersome enough as I couldn’t really remember what all did and was. During the city section I had problems finding my way until I got used to the map indicators again, and then I had a bit of troubles finding some of the more out-of-the-way stairs and elevators, and choosing which answer would be correct for what I wanted to do; however, once you get past that area, the gameplay goes pretty smoothly, and if there was one thing I did appreciate it was that, while there were many things to learn, at least the main interface didn’t look cluttered.The game offers witty dialogue and, when questing, allows you yo choose from two or three answers. I like being able to choose when talking to characters (though most of the time is just the two typical ‘yes’ or ‘no’ disguised in a colorful fashion), however it suffered from the same all the ‘choose your answer’ games suffer from: none were clear. An answer did not quite mean what I thought it would mean which made me miss a quest (for instance, on Saving Bryan had two answers that were very similar but different in tone, and I thought the second option would also give me a chance to end the conversation and go look for him, but it didn’t and it sent me elsewhere with that mission failed). I was rather annoyed to have some missions failed or postponed (or even denied completely from trying them later) simply because the option I chose still included some form of “give me more time” or “I can’t right now” but it ended up cancelling the quest instead and the quest indicator disappeared. I had the same with a quest where I could either destroy a totem or find a relic, and when I refused destroying it initially but then changed my mind, I couldn’t go back and destroy it, so I was forced on the second quest path.After the first chapter you get to have a “pet”; a chimera you can either send to fetch stuff for you, or summon into battle. This is quite handy, and the chimera is quite adorable (in the way giant, angry beasts are adorable, I guess). It even chases around little animals while in the lair. The areas you get to visit are [...]			"

												Thank you guys for this game. It's my favourite hack'n slash game so far. Love music, love humor and huge amount of tiny tiny features that keeps you enjoing even after hours of playing. Thank you for not being boring repetative dumb hack'n slash like competitors i.e. ""snowstorm"" production about ""hellboy"". A tons of skills, upgareds, modifications, enhancements, runes, addons, pets, companions, crew, army, base, radio, Silver hair witch hunter, random events and much much more. Even simple tower defence as a side quest  created something like ""woow"" factor on my face. I just simply didn't expect that. Most important for me is Co-op and I have to say it works pretty well, apart from the resistance army management (only a player who own the session have an access to it). Thumbs up and thanks for this. Looking forward to see the 3rd part.			"

												A lot of people have the same problem - game doesn't start. It crashes at loading after movie. I spend a lot of time to find the solution and nothing helps. The only thing I found is dozens of comments about bugs. Guys, this is not beta-version and still it has a lot of bugs, not mentioned that many players can't start the game at all. Neocore lose the reputation. Some people in comments want their money back.This is not The Incredable Adventures of Van Helsing. It's The Incredible Headache of Trying Get the Solution or Van Crashing.So will you take a chance and buy this game? Cause you have 50% that it doesn't start.And still there is no russian localization. We all are waiting for fixes!UPD: Finally after hotfix I can run the game. What can I say... It seems like developers didn't optimaze the game at all... It looks like slide show on my computer (I played a lot of games with system requirements greater than this game and there was no problem). Still game has a lot of bugs.  Considering all problems I think this is beta version not final release. So I suggest steam mark this game as beta version.			"

(Defend the base by going on 6 locations where the enemies attack only where you are there, WTF ???? in Diablo-like game ??? Really ??)Also its really badly balanced and thats because this is second game and they just recycled every spell from the first game and added a little bit more, thats ♥♥♥♥ing dumb !You was playing with your character the first one and spent 10 hours building your skills and stats and then they just ♥♥♥♥ing erease it and let you do it again ! They can let you convert your original character and then let you unlock the new spells, thats will be really better than this !Also wtf is with the enemy spawns ? They are just in groups and nowhere else (Giant map, but only 25% is occupied by anything).Chests didnt drop items ! I dont know what the ♥♥♥♥ is this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t bug ...And last but not least the locations are so uncreative. I mean like really a way too much. (Blurred textures, lands with muddy dirty graphic which looks awful.I have this game on Lowest graphical setting and its still unplayable !Please believe and stay away from this game !

												By some miracle, I've avoided most of the bugs people are complaining about.  I also don't care about multiplayer elements, so that's not a detraction either.  The story seems like a pretty good idea hastily thrown together.  Many plot elements have zero explanation, they simply ""are"".  There are loads of pop-culture references which border on fourth-wall breaking, and spice things up a little.  At many points there are FMV cutscenes between you and Katarina where you must make decisions on some things, such as doing something a certain way, removing armor from an altar, searching a body, etc.  These decisions never have a bearing on larger things, but it adds some appreciated variety.  The dialogue has hit or miss voice acting, but the game is definitely interesting enough.  I made four different characters and constantly ran into the same problem over and over again.  Everything chugs along peachy-keen until you get your face put in the dirt and you're f***** right in the a**.  This is not a particular boss fight (as far as I had gotten anyway), it's always some innocuous-seeming group of mobs - too many mobs - that do it.  The problem with this formula is that this is a completely linear ARPG.  There is no grinding for gear, or experience, or stats.  Reskilling is easy enough if you haven't spent too much money, but after awhile you get this creeping suspicion that the difficulty spikes are complete bull****, meant to breathe life into what is otherwise a tactically uninteresting game.  Other people complain about the tower-defense elements, or the commander aspect where you send subordinates on missions.  While these things don't bother me, I do ask - why?  The game has only one ending, and these things have no bearing, but these are far more involved than sidequests, so why are they there?  The skill trees are massive.  There are far too many abilities, and far too few points.  The progressive-skill design is complete nonsense.  Abilities not even remotely related to one another will be required to learn other abilities you may want.  It wouldn't be so bad to waste skill points like this, but like I said - no grinding.   My biggest gripe however is the GUI.  The game has controller support which in my opinion dumbs down the interface by sheer necessity, and in my opinion cripples the game.  You essentially have 6 hotkeys, and both mouse buttons.  The function keys can swap certain abilities on the mouse buttons, but even though skills might be able to be bound, depending on what type of skill it is it MAY NOT BE USABLE ON THAT PARTICULAR BUTTON.  This means that certain skills can only be left or right mouse-bound, even though the game says otherwise.  Any particular class has literally dozens of skills, but using any more than 8 is punishing because of the occasional need to kite.  It all feels much clunkier than it should have been. So, essentially, the game would need massive retro-fitting to be a good LINEAR ARPG.  It simply breaks too many rules of good design with its self-imposed limitations to be enjoyable for very long, especially with the reality of games like Torchlight and Divinity: Original Sin.  Perseverance should be required for games like this as a matter of intelligence or discipline, not simply fighting the game's awkward systems.			"

												Overall, Van Helsing 2 is as great a game as its predecessor. Meaning that the game was shipped with the same problems as the first one: Boring storyline, shortness of quests and game lenght, not enough customization options for your equipment. Worst part is that the game got released so soon after the first that it is pretty much the same game, but with a few more quests, a new villain, more levels and skills to go with it.Keep in mind that these are not big problems at all. Gameplay itself is pretty fun, difficulty is amazing and I fell in love with the freedom you have to play on the hardest settings since the very first moment, unlike most ARPGs that will make you play through the game up to four times before having a real challenge. I've managed to finish the game on Heroic without breaking much sweat with a solid build, made by myself. That's a lot. Usually, a game won't let you experiment on builds and still allow you to progress. Either you follow the mainstream builds or you're done for. So, if you really like ARPGs and want to go even further than that, you'll have a pretty nice challenge with Veteran.♥♥♥♥♥♥s unforgiving.Having the option to use your character from the first game is also great. Played both games with the same character on Heroic and had a blast from start to finish. Some forty hours of gameplay overall. Graphics are good enough, experienced some crashes if I aggro too many enemies and atack them all at the same time with AoE, but that may be my hardware, and not the game.The reason I'll tell you not to buy and play this game is simply that it came out too soon, it looks exactly the same as the first one. It's a obvious rushed sequel to enjoy the money made from the success of the first game. By the looks of the ending of the second game, there's a third coming out. I just hope it's not the same thing all over again. If you want to play a fun, new game, play the first Van Helsing. This one is just a copy paste.Quick update (06/04/15): Yep, turns out there was a third game coming out and it is still exactly the same copy paste. My point remains: Get the first one and you'll have seen enough of all three games.Gameplay - 7/10Soundtrack - 6/10Graphics - 6/10Content - 5/10Challenge Level - 8/10Replayability - 3/10			"

												This game has some of the worst crashes that I have come across. Lengthy boss battles become incredibly frustrating for all the wrong reasons, you are constantly hoping to defeat whatever you are fighting to be able to save your progress before the game crashes. Remember, it could be a beautiful table, but if one of the legs is shorter than the other, it's still a broken product, and no one would buy it in the store or recommend it. kinda pointless to discuss the merit of this game if it's still broken at its core.

												Will be an awesome gaming experience once the devs decide that their customers shouldn't have to edit registry, swap exe files, and so on and so forth. It has been a dissapointment to see how bad the support offered by the developers really is. I am a huge fan of the first game and was so thrilled for the release of this one, only to find that I can't play after finally settling into the game and a crash occured. ...And there's no real help or answers. This is being sold to you as a presumably ""finished"" product. Beware, I've seen Betas that were more polished and in order (also, they actually worked). Hope a gigantic patch is coming soon, until then....Uninstall. Will update if there is change.			"

												I wanted to love this game. I didn't. It feels like one of those kid movie sequels where the first movie was unique and the second movie is a sad reiteration. Though the cobat in this game can be fun at times & the characters have an interesting dystopic steam punk flair, the user interface is fatally broken. Basic locamotion is a struggle at times with many of the landscape features like short bushes hampering what should be a relatively smooth process. Mere movement shouldn't engender such frustration in my books.None of the user-interface mechanics are self-evident or even remotely simple to figure out. There seems to be a flawed breakdown in the translation to ""full controller support."" One prime example would be the ""hall of remembrance"" mechanics (which for those of you who might not know is a 'castle defence' type of mini game with a challenging series of defence battles) Well, the masterminds behind this game have allocated the same key to ""start all over again at the beginning"" that you use as your main attack. So you'll  be clicking frantically fighting off wave after wave of mobs & then when you finally finish your reward (if you accidentally hit attack again even once) is to have to start all over again. This could have been easily remedied with a confirmation window asking if you did indeed want to start all over & lose all of your hardwon progress (confirmations are not a new concept in the game world... usually a standard thing to keep gamers from wanting to tear their hair out and uninstall your game). Granted you can set your own key-bindings for attack skills but let's be honest, X is standard for attack and there are only so many buttons on a controller. Not that you'd need that many with this sequel, to be honest. I was very surprised at how downgraded the skill tree was from the first game. Some things are the same (though you might not want them to be) ... almost all of the NPCs say the exact same thing as they did in one. (Like the enchantress) who says ""you seem tired"" (funny that's exactly what i'm thinking about the NPC dialogue, tired. A confirmation window would also fix the problems with the vendors. It is very easy to accidentally sell some great piece of gear with no buyback option as well. Or accidentally waste your money buying gear you never meant to purchase. And don't even get me started on the mess they've made of the inventory system which was just great in the first game. (I would have to cuss). ;)Furthermore, this sequel seems to be plagued with many of the same basic running flaws as the first game. I was so excited to get an especially great enchant, only to have the game crash & not save it. My rig is exceptionally good (custom built for gaming) so i know the crashing is not because of my set up. It's more than a bit of a heartbreak that a game with such potential (and such lootastically instant gratification via pillaging) is so .... well, broken. It makes me wish i worked in the industry so i could fix it up. It could have been legendary.			"

												Game play is excellent, but you only get half a game. The level cap I believe is 60 and in order to get there you need to play the game at least twice. So you gotta finish round one, put your settings on 'Veteran' and GRIND your way through the levels again. The DLC is pathetic, PIGASUS is not worth it. Millions to buy something. The other DLC for the Ink areas are small and pathetic. I am pretty disappointed in how this game is packaged. On the plus side I got it at 50% off, so I did get what I paid for, a half a game.			"

												I was really stoked to play this game after beating the first installment of ""The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing"", but either my computer is bricked or they really make it hard on your computer when playing this game. I tried playing this game on the lowest possible graphics - to no avail - and went on to try the first game also, whereupon I found ZERO problems. I  really  want to be able to play this game on any graphics setting higher than the lowest, because the choppy edges just don't do it for me. I also found that my computer (mid-2012 MBP) couldn't even run the game higher than 4fps when there were more than five units on the screen.Given these problems, and that it doesn't look like they update these games very often - as I saw in the first game -  I would not recomment this to my friends or anyone else for that matter. Even if it was only $4.99.So... thanks Neocore Games... but no thanks.P.S. I have zero problems with playing dungeon-crawlers like Diablo III and Torchlight II with MID-RANGE GRAPHICS.			"

												After a few hours playing this game with two of the three different classes on normal I don't feel like recommending this game to anyone.I grabbed it on a sale on humblebundle for roughly 7 $ so it doesn't hurt much.The graphics are ok. The sound and voiceacting are ok, the voices of the hero and his companion and her not so funny comments are more annoying than I enjoyed them.The main problem for me with this game is the rather confusing and not very interessting skill system, none of the spells I used in the short time I played the game feel like the do much, the animations are also rather unexciting.I don't feel like I'm playing a game released in 2014, it feels much older, other ARPGs do much much better work released before this game.Go buy torchlight II oder Diablo III if you don't already have, you will have much more fun with this two games. Or get path of exile which is also better in my opinion.EDIT:Pulled myself together to at least finish the story, which was done in 450 Minutes as I can see in the ingame statistics, which is rather short. The story itself is......maybe it's because I have not played the first part but I don't believe that the story can be much better there. The ending is just...yawn.!!!*SPOILER*!!! you just hunt that one guy for the whole game and then in the end he just ""explodes"" in a few guts an blood after the barrier brakes, no voiceacting before his final death, nothing? come on how ultra lame is this?At least gameplay got a little bit better with higher lvl and gear but still not phenomenal.

However, when I started it up the mouse cursor disappeared and I was unable to click on anything. After struggling for a few minutes, updating my GPU drivers, and rebooting the machine I tried again with the same results.Checking through the forums found that people have been complaining about this since launch last year. Turns out, the solution is to unplug any game controllers before launching the game.Why these developers think it’s okay to force gamers to alter their hardware because they’re too lazy to put an if block into their code is beyond me.Lazy programmers get no points from me, and certainly won't be getting any more of my money.0/10.

												I am a living room gamer; because I am a professional programmer I strongly dislike playing games with a keyboard and mouse -- it feels too much like work. A few weeks ago my son and I got bored with playing Reaper of Souls on Xbox One, and we were in the market for another ARPG of similar quality. We tried Crimson Alliance on the 360 and got bored with it fairly quickly. And then, WOOOSH: we discovered the first installment of The Incredible Adventures of ""Maester Van Helsing""! We were so excited that I took a day off to rebuild an older PC into a dedicated machine for my living room. Years ago I brushed off Steam as a failed experiment; but Van Helsing made me come back to it, and build my own Big Picture Steam Machine! Sure, the game's UI could use a bigger text size for those of us who like playing on sixty inch monitors from twenty feet away, but that's the only fault I found with the game (perhaps in Neocore's native Hungary big screen TVs have not been invented yet). Overall, the first Van Helsing game was a delight, and we put some fifty hours into it!Naturally, we wanted to continue the adventure and bought Van Helsing Two. Not just game number two, but two licenses as well since we were dying to try multiplayer.Now I wish I could put this nicely, but what en effing dissapointment! Van Helsing Two is a Piece of Crap.After being released roughly one year ago, it suffers from tens, if not hundreds of bugs. It is slow. Multiplayer sucks (it fails to update one player's screen correctly, randomly disconnects, etc). The added complexity of the Command Center minigame adds unnecessary confussion and bugs (you have invisible characters that will speak to you although they are away on a mission). The game crashes when you add essences to yout equipment. I could go on and on and on, and while I found the concepts, graphics and overall atmosphere of Borgovia enticing I cannot really recommend the game to anyone. The execution was obviously left to twenty year old incompetent programmers. And to be clear: when I say the game is slow, I mean that compared to playing the first game on the exact same 3.4 GHz AMD dual core machine that plays Van Helsing One without breaking a sweat.Judging by the rate at which Neocore launches new DLC and new games (Van Helsing Three is about to be released this year, and in between they made Deathtrap, a spinoff from the  Van Helsing series capitalizing on the Ink) they are more interested in taking our dollars than fixing the bugs in their existing games.Overall the game feels like a rough, unfinished BETA. Save your time and money and play something else -- even the early access version of Victor Vran is a better investment.			"

												The incredible adventures of Van Helsing is a Fun 3rd person hack and slash game. They improved much from the first game, not only in graphics but also command. The game is not perfect and has a few faults, but it stands on its own merits and supersede the first one. I enjoyed my time playing, as I look forward to future content and even, hopefully a 3rd Van Helsing in continuing the story. For a complete in depth look at what the game has to offer enjoy the video.

												Such promise. Its beautiful, the environs are awesome to explore, the dialogue makes you chuckle (even if it is a bit poorly acted), missions are varied for an ARPG. Yet, I can't genuinely recommend it beacuse ive had so many issues with buggy multiplayer :/ Fix that, and then we'll talk.			"

												Very laggy at the commander part. Took me a couple hours to finish that ""1"" part because it was so laggy due to the fact that there are tons of npcs on the map, but you can't see them until they appear during that certain ""stage."" Even after appearing doesn't mean the lag will cool down, no. The lag cools down right after you complete the ""Final stage"" of that mission because loads of NPCs will come charging in and somehow they will be eliminated by the friendly NPCs and some by your ""not so fantastic in-game lag."" This has nothing to do with your PC, no. It's all due to the gameplay and the part you're in.P.S: I've never felt such horrible lag in a very long time. Even Vindictus or SC2 in Ultra quality doesn't lag to me.			"

												Well... I got this during the Spooky-Game-Halloween-Event at a reduced price. And I'm glad that it wasn't this expensive. It's not that it's incredible bad or something like this, but... I can't put my finger on it.Let's name some points I kept in my mind.It's hard. Okay, I might not be the most veteran ARPG-Player. Maybe hard doens't fit at all. It's balancing is kind of strange. Those who played it will remember a given mountain with some krystal-golems at its top. Playing at Normal I made my way up there and performed not this bad. But.... when stepping inside some given secret laboratories, where you may get you very own second companion... it just was like I swiched to Extra-Hard difficult. On step out of your spawn-point and get mauled in a matter of split seconds? seriosly, dafuq?And switching to causel made this even more strange. Most time its kind of boring, but at all I play for the story waiting to unfold more than playing for the monster-hunt. But then, suddenly, Instant-Dead because of I don't even know. Or monsters that take so much damage I wonder if they got a Zero to much when getting their hitpoints. Just to meet something that was supposed to be a Boss (certain spiders), but that went down in a matter of seconds. Strange.Maybe I performed this bad because of the fact I never used one of these essences or even the runes. Why? Well, most time it just didn't work. Combining essences? Well... somehow, yes, but wait, why did I get something I just can use as soon as I will reach level 40?Applying Runes? Insert here, place there... the Forge-Key remain greyed out. Dafuq?*sigh* Sometimes I wonder how stuff like this slip trough a honest form of quality-control. Wait, no, I can imagine. Because the guys who tested this were able to ask. Maybe its incredible simple to do rune-smiting and stuff, if you just watch out for a nifty litty thing, that wasn't in the quick-tutorial...Anyway. I liked these two protagonists (Fluffy ^^), and for the next weeks I will recall words as ""incredible"" in a very special idom. Unfortunally I missed part One and be afraid that this may be necessary to understand what really happens there. And... seriously, anyone out there who played this who didn't know from the very first moment what absolut unforseeable plot-twist some time in the game will appear? I just waited the whole game for this to happen. And finally... Well. Get it? Or leave it? Hard to say. Some day I will give the arcane dude a try, but for now I won't play any more, because the story has been told. I really liked all that stuff you may find at these maps. especially that rebel-logo in that factory ^^ And I wasn't disappointed with the loot it hide. But... well. It's a nice story, it contains funny moments (""just pretend we didn'T saw anything"") and so on... But at least these rebellion-captains are a bit static, as  the whole hideout.Aw... just drifting away. That game has much potential, but I didn't played out all of this. Grab it, when you like ARPGs and don't mind unspecial Skill-Trees and stuff but like a good novel to play. Greetings "

												Van Helsing 2 is when it works a very fun game much along the lines of torchlight 2 and Diablo.  It doesn't take itself very seriously as far as plot but has good amounts of items and skills for character customization.  That is however, when it works properly.  I cannot leave a review for single player because I neither played it nor intended to play it when I purchased VH2.  Pros   Funny Dialogue   Diverse items   Many skill choices   Good UI and ArtCons   Multiplayer has a problem every few hours (crash or desync) when playing with only one other person for the entirety of the game.   No mod support All in all this game pushes me to the exact edge of what I am willing to put up with, I've had to redo parts of the game because of crashes and change which of us is hosting just to continue.  On the other hand it has all of the things I like about loot driven AARPGs when everything works.  In conclusion you might want to wait to buy this game until is more stable if it ever gets there, or just find another AARPG there are lots of them.			"

												Nine hours into this game and I'm quite frustrated.I finished up the main story in VH1 and decided to play VH2. 1 seemed so short to me.Thankfully 2 picks up at the moment 1 ends and I was happy to see the story continue.My eletion turned to frustration over little things that could have been done better.DX11 doesn't work in game on my PC. There are massive pixelized blobs where characters stand, right from the very first scene. Rolling back to DX10 fixed this.Every time I start the game I get pop ups from Microsoft and Steam recognizing it asthe first time I'm launching the game. Not a biggie. I just question why this happens.Mobs of monsters that pull you toward them, surround you and kill you when you can'tdo anything about it is not fun. As is elite type mobs who will one shot you the momentthey see you. This for me is a big design flaw. No matter what armor/weapons/skills you have,I have found these situation completely unavoidable...and too frequent.This is my main peeve for VH2. Balance is so erratic. To be fighting hordes succesfully onlyto be one shotted by a creature that barely enters the screen is just not right.Despite my downside problems with the game it has such promise.The addition of a Chimera pet was nice to see. You can send it on private missions andit will bring back items for you. You can even call on this pet to help you in your ownbattles, although it doesn't really seem to do anything but stay to the rear and tendsnot to help me. Perhaps further down the line it will start helping more.The defense mini games where you send commanders out into the field isn't what Iexpected in this game. They're quite fun but did take a while for me to get into.They build up some decent XP which is always nice.Katarina's wisecracks have been given a shot in the arm. She's much more vocal this time around.Her comments are always a treat to hear. The numerous pop culture references are, IMO, one ofthe highlights of the game.  The ""Private Bryan"" quest I'll be remembering for quite sometime...genius.Just like the first game it's beautiful to look at. Creatures and mechanical beasts are very welldrawn and animated. Frame rate for me suffers a bit when the screen is overloaded but It'sstill playable. I found I depend a lot on Katarina when this happens.Do I like it enough to recommend it? Yes. The story is a good one (but VH1's was a tad better).The flaws tend to frustrate me but I'm trying to overlook them. This is a fine game but, for me,1 was a much better game.With all its flaws I do enjoy playing. I'm not sure if it's to finish the game or to find outwhat Katarina is going to say next! "

												The game remains mostly unchanged at its core, but the level cap's been increased to 60 and there are enough new skills and tricks to make the extra 30 levels not feel like a chore. I had trouble transferring my character over from the first game which is unfortunate, and like the first game there are a ton of bugged achievements, but I didn't run into any other issues. If you haven't played the first, I'd say skip it and get this one. Otherwise, if you just want some more ARPG action, this will fill that need.			"

												 If you are a fan of the original Van Helsing like me this is worth buying. It's basically more of the same with solid gameplay, but a little less comedy and wit this time around. There are a number of optional tower defense side quests to break up the pace of the game a bit. I recommend playing this on a higher difficulty, I found the game to be very easy even on Heroic. At max level you have the option to either run Scenarios or Neverending Story like VH1. The scenario setup is different the the first game and rewards the player with stacking bonuses for complete a series of 6 scenarios. They also added in a few new twists like the Chimaera and improved skill trees and functionalities for Katrina. Overall a great game for the price that I definately recommend to fans of action-rpgs.			"

The end game features help prolong play and hopefully the addition of more DLC will add to the experience.Gameplay is smooth, fast paced, and fun.   The skill system promotes experimentation and is not too punishing.   The crafting system is a little flawed in the fact that you find upgrades so readily you're outgrowing your crafted items too fast.Overall a good sequel and any ARPG would not regret buying.			"

												I actually loved this game. I'd read all the bad reviews and wondered if I would, but playing it on my macbook I had very few issues. Sometimes it crashed Steam on startup, but the next time it'd would perfectly. It started to lag in the final scenes, but I turned some of the flashy stuff down and it worked perfectly. I was surprised I managed so long on my Macbook without having to.Not having played the first game, I was a little confused at being thrown into a city scene at the beginning and have to figure out what was going on, but I managed. I played through it from level 1 and there were just so many options even once I clocked the game and reached level 32 there were so many more options I had not even got near to trying. I started the game again on the higher level but got bored, same same just things are more difficult. So I ended it there. I look forward to going back and playing number 1 and then number 3.8/10			"

												First one was good alright. This one is just so very stretched! You walk, kill, walk, kill, kill and walk, kill and walk, walk and kill, over, and over, and over. Maps are pointlessly huge with nothing there just mobs waiting to get killed. I'm sure story is great, but I forget half of it by the time I get to where I need to be.			"

												My husband and I love playing co op games together.  We struggled our way through Van Helsing I and now II since we got a deal on them.  Overall could be fun  but the sheer amount of bugs made it so incredibly frustrating.  The developers know about the VERY annoying and almost constant bugs and do nothing about them, for years now!  I will never buy another game from this developer let alone III.  Shame on you all for leaving this very broken product out there while you work to release yet another game.  Fix I and II first!!!

												It would be fun unless the game have so many critical bugs that prevent you from continue to play. I like coop games and that what I had to experience in this one:- 3-4 quest bugs that prevent you from playing further and you can fix it ONLY in single player mode (goodby my partner)- quests sometimes didn't counted as completed for my partner, so next time when he would host instead of me we have to replay the quest again- game crushes during important locations loadings that led to quest being no counted as completed. The person that tried to connect to you after that will get message that he didn't ""progress till that moment in the game"" and had to host the session because of that so we could replay this quests.- ""breaking"" things worked only first time and then even the companion couldn't break themThe first game was good, but after that I will not buy 3rd part fearing the same buggy experience.

												I'm going to have to say I am rather dissapointed with Van Helsing 2, it still offers the hordes of monsters to the Xth level which is just ungodly annoying. Especially considering they nerfed many of the abilities, along with making them slower, less damage, etc. Basically I see this as even less fun then the first installment, at least that's what I see upon the ""Vetern"" option when playing this game. Let me put it like this, basic monsters can kill you in one hit, but forget about killing them in one hit, oh and all that epic gear you had from the last game? Just consider it normal gear, it just isn't worth a damn, neither are the set items. I expected to have fun with this game, but in all honesty I found it to be just a clunky chore very fast.			"

												If you like diablo style games, think of this one as the best diversion you can get. What i mean by that is that it's not quite a game you can play for 700 hours and still feel like you need to get that ""one last item to round out your build"" it's more of a game where you play through it's 2 or 3 times, 30-40 hours later you are done with it. Loot is solid, however the quantity of loot also means that you rarely find the thing you know was an ""awesome drop"" it's more a case of constantly equipping and enchanting the latest and greatest. Although there are some pretty cool items every now and then that break that rule. The world and graphics are purposely desaturated and have a steampunk kind of vibe to them. The game can crash quite easily, and there are things that prevent it from running if you don't have a certain runtime or soundcard driver or (insert reason). And that's a shame, one day you may wonder what everyone is talking about when they say it crashes a lot, the next you find out what they are talking about and get just as frustrated as them at the game simply not running. The game uses a 32bit and 64bit runtime, and the 64bit in van helsing 2 is not quite the big difference in performance than it was in the original game. Both run fine, perhaps the subsequent patches have helped that respect. The games import option was originally not working, and you had to start a high level build, that has since been fixed so i won't hold it against the game. The sequel is a better all around game, bigger, with more to do. The original has been patched to be in line with VH2, whereas it originally was a ""one playthrough game ends"" game. Which severely limited the games lasting power to about 6 hours. Now that those issues are addresses and you can play again, with new characters and item drop chances - and also you can play through the first game and then import into the second. My score of both games (since they are connected now) has improved. The first game get's a 7/10 the second game get's a 8/10, if they manage to make the lasting power and game size of the third game as big as the first two combined. That'll likely get a 9.			"

												The incredible references of Van Helsing II is an honest action-RPG that doesn't try to break the mold. It's a bit short, but still enjoyable. They tried to add so many game mechanics to it that some of them feel unfinished or without any purpose other than existing, and some of them are so obscure or confusing that I wasn't able to understand how they worked. Most of them have to do with item customizing, but the equipment you find in the field is usually plenty good enough.Word of caution: optimization is a bit wonky and some computers have encounter spots in the game where the is incredible lag, although overall it ran pretty smoothly for me and my friend. Coop feels solid, and there weren't any major game-breaking bugs in the way.In summary, it's a good game and completely worth the budget price it carries.Also, REFERENCES.			"

												As with part I, many negative reviews are related to multiplayer. I play 1p, and it works great. I prefer bringing a charter up to level 30 in part 1, then importing and playing through part II. It really only has replay value to the extent that you master character classes. If you win with a character, you can easily re-spec and try other skills. Still, easily worth the money. My favorite part is in the latter stages of the game where you're defending tunnels. Traps are fun.			"

												Good mixture of quality and price.Slavic folklore plot/creatures, steampunk atmosphere, funky humor, tons of slapstick tributes - nothing less than Bordlerlands level of fun for campaign progression.Diverse way to build a character with skills, perks and item customization. Endgame grind isn't steep, especially for certain builds, but at least that's what you can do now and by yourself, not after hundreds of hours and with prayers to RNGesus.Scenarios for now are pretty limited, not that much room for replayability as some other RPGs provide. But there could be updates, there is still Tower Defense mode, there are missions for your captains - things NeoCore can polish and introduce later.They have already done magnificent job with part two, which looks like a really sophisticated version of the original, and just after a year. I have my hopes that they will keep evolving their new franchise.It's not a brilliant game, but it's much better than D3 at the point of release, and it's not much behind TL2 in terms of gameplay. But it's much cheaper and more unique than either of them, so if you want something fancy from an ARPG - go for it.			"

Reskilling was cheap, but I can't see any difference between a lvl 10 flame thrower or lvl 10 spider.Item drops are boring as I seldomly find something that is better than I already have equipped.I could also do without the soldier mini game, read mission description, read 4 comments by your commanders, guess buest commander, click send.

												Well. After some Hours Playtime i found many things wich are just no. The Amount of enemy`s who are spwaing in a constant way arround you (so many you cant even count and focus -.-) , the amount of HP they have (you do for example 100 dmg and they have up to 12 k hp?! why? not even boss mobs just Mastergrade or rare and im playing on normal not on avarage or hardcore mode!) you NPC friend in Form of Catarina wich is completely useless since she`s most of the time gone in 2-3 hits by normal mobs (i spend all her points in vitality and still she`s gone way too fast), then you have NPC`S wich should help you but have only like 49 hp when the enemy is way above 2k for normal mobs. The amount of skill points you can use is also comapred to the Hordes of Enemys youre facing way too less and youre also in the need of Portions wich are useful if you face some mobs but if you get pushed from an horde of some veterans you smiply run away or die. Now some good things after all the crying ;) The Missions you can Put your npcs through is kinda nice, you send them on missions and get rewards for them is kinda cool. Also the Personal Chimera is nice (its like a pet wich goes treasur hunting for you!!) The story itself of course but that would be it.So if you want to buy it wait for it until its less than 5 euros.Hope i could help you with my Review :)			"

												let me start off with saying that they fixed a lot of my complaints from the first game. they story was pretty lackluster, but lets face it this is an action rpg and none that i can think of have a good story. all classes are now free, when you get legendary drops as rewards from bosses you can always use it for either you or your ally. you can respec anything about your character if you dont like it(yay perk resets). they extended the skill trees and modified thier system to allow you to use more skills. now for the things they didnt change but should have. i still use my ally as a buff totem, and the rage system encourages me to not spend any rage(benefits include 3% lifesteal, 10 mana per hit, and +17% damage). everything said and done im going to give this game an 8 out of 10 as action rpgs are not really for the story, and there are still a few things wrong with the game, but they left it open for a 3rd game so heres hoping they fix the rage system and usefulness of the companion.

												I just finished the story and If you played the first and liked it, get it because it's more awesomeness.If you played the first and liked it, know that some of the problems with the first have been fixed like enemy variety and such.Fantastic game, loved every bit of it and I'm glad they continued to work on this series after the first one. Starting a new character is actually a little more intuitive for people who want to start with a more pre-defined class since you can get a bit more specific right off the bat. You can transfer your old characters provided they're level 30 I think, which is great even though it's practically a necessity.They added in runes for your weapons and armor, at least I don't remember it being in the first game, and I havn't messed with it yet but the interface and process seems easy to do. There are no clunky systems, every part of the UI is simple and easy to use, plenty of loot to grab, high replayability, EXCELLENT voice acting yet again, combat and skills are satisfying and fun to play with, great soundtrack, etc. Also, SUPER FUN if not revolutionary tower defense mini game missions, and great little easter eggs galore. This studio knows their audience very well and loves to put in tons of winks and nods (sometimes full blown call outs, they're that blatant) to stuff we love including lord of the rings and even batman, among other things. Tons of awesomeness in this game, I promise you. Also, this game is a STEAL at 15$, you can't go wrong with this if you're looking for a great arpg. Now, my only real complaint is actually a kind of compliment: I liked this game so much that it's length left me disappointed, but I'm guessing that the production strategy neocore is going with is to sell each chunk of the series at such a low price so that they can actually stay afloat to make the whole series. I'm guessing they're not a huge studio so this is probably just what they have to do. Something else minor (at least to me), is that there's occasional screen tearing and the odd bugs here and there but nothing game breaking, so I didn't mind it much. All in all, I give it a 4.75/5, I loved the hell out of it. Can't wait for the 3rd game.			"

												Now that they patched it and I can actually start the game, I come to find there's no controller support. Now, I know it's just a minor thing, but if they could have full controller support in the first game, why can't they have it in the second? I absolutely hate playing with a keyboard, especially with the large laptop I have, and it really deters me from trying to enjoy the game. Aside from that, I'd have to say I'll recommend it for the benefit of the doubt.			"

												I haven't played the first one but from previous reviews it was pretty great. I've playedthis a few hours and all I can say is this is what Diablo 3 should've been... Diablo 3 right now is pretty much hand-held gameplay with linear builds. This game gives you specs for both you AND your merc! So far it's fun although the people who've joined my open game have been less than communicative. Looking forward to building the fastest shooting glass cannon hunter I can! :)PS. I'm down to play with anyone, just let me know!			"

												TIAOVH2 is quite good, although, when you near the end, it gets completely rediclous... because you get swarmed by spiders, dryads and more, you'll keep dying no matter what, and you got limited supplies and you shall be careful of what class you choose... As ranged you easily get a lot of aggro unless you wait for around 15 seconds before you fight, but by the time Katarina might already be dead. Personally I think there's a lot of unbalanced fights when you near the end of chapter 2 to whole chapter 3. Why I recommend it, is because it's fun, but still really annoying at end.			"

												Great FollowUp from the 1st Van Helsing the improvements to the gameplay are great and the graphical improvements and general look and fell of the UI are very welcome.  The new skill trees can look slightly overwhelming to begin with but you don't have access to everything right away as they unlock as you level up which lets you get a feel for your char and how you want to build your Hunter.

												I played straight through part one and loved it!  After playing through chapter one and part of chapter 2 I have to say I am very impressed.If you are looking for something different from Diablo 3, Torchlight 2, etc this game has it all.  So far the great features:Tons and tons of Tricks, Auoras, and skills to masterTailor your character points to your play style All three classes come with the 2nd game (No need to purchase DLC)Lady Katarina's skill tree is very impressive and offer lots of freedom on how you want your companion to fight beside youTower Defense missions are awesome ( Plays like Sanctum 2, Adds extra gameplay to mix things up a little)The loot so far is great although I haven't got to runecrafting yet but can't waitI think you max level at 60 where as 1st game max was only 30I know some might be having startup issues and it's aggrevating but developer will get issues resolved.  1st game had bugs and it improved drastically and when I played it now I never had a glitch so this shows the developer stands beyond their games and not abandon them.If you are wanting a different kind of hack'n'slash top down RPG this game is well worth the $14.99.  With all the lore and content the game has to offer this game to me is worth more than what they are asking.  I will review more features as I get deeper in the game.  Buy a copy and you want regret anything but losing sleep!  Happy hunting monster slayers!			"

												Van Helsing II combines the adventures from the first game with new battles in industrial battlefields. Katarina's still a bit annoying (in the good way) and this time you even get a pet! There's new monsters and new people to meet but the charm of the first game is still there. If you liked the first game, or like RPGs such as Torchlight II then you should throughly enjoy this.			"

												A cool, cheap action-RPG with nice graphics, great musics/voices, lots of skills, 3 classes, optional tower defense missions, great humour, lots of easter eggs, around 18-20 hours of gameplay (estimated on Hard difficulty, with skipped TD maps).If you liked the first one, then it's an instabuy for you! If not, then maybe you'll like it, give it a try, it's cheap!:)Pros:-nice graphics-low system reqs-CHEAP price-steampunkish (if you like it)-humour-lots of skills-Lady Katarina (follower) with more skills-tower defense maps (skippable if you don't like TD)-lots of secrets/easter eggs-great musics-voiceacting-Chimera (summonable ally)-resistance management (you can send 4 of your captains on missions, upgrade them...)-trophies (with positive/negative effects)-coop mode with 4 players-PVP-difficulty levels from casual to extra hardcore-nice maps (but too much industrial/city maps for me, I like the forest, mountain, open maps better)Cons:-bugs (need some patching, but nothing serious)-sometimes the loading is slow-steampunkish (if you don't like it)-(no great rendered cutscenes : but this is understandeable, 'coz this is a low budget game) "

												A solid 8/10In few words: hell of a fun. The graphic is good, the maps are spectacular, the story is interesting (but predictable... but hell, its an aRPG), skill are varied. The gameplay, buffing up your items are addictive.Pro:- A minor point, but you can import your character from the first game. But, to be honest, it a must-have part of a three episodes game.- Runecrafting, itemcrafting and alchemy. All makes a big, comfortable item buffing system.- Skill tree is much bigger... but on the con, I found myself using only 2 new skills- Chimera, resistence management is fun, giving tasks, sending your Fluffly little monster on hunts.- Easter eggs made me laugh many times, which is rare.- Graphics are good, runs smoothly on my 3 years old laptop with medium setting.- Tower Defence games- Witty, nicely written one-liners, funny dialouges- Actions all the way from the beginning to the end.- Revamped scanario mode.Cons:I am sad... because most of the ""pro"" points are sometimes cons.- I collected so many craft items, i simply didn't use them. Just hoarding, hoarding and that's all.- Small bugs: typos in skills, item names, quest subtitles jumping up and down.- Chimera skill didn't prove to be useful. I made Katarina my tank with great dps. And chimera always got injouries on it's hunts.- Tower defence: it was a great addition, but felt they put all of them in the first half of the game... and none in the last half.- No sings of PvP multiplayer.Yet, with all it's flaws I love the game. 12 hours of action, new scanario mode. The studio LOVES it's games. The try to fix the bugs, learn from their mistakes. Keep up the good work, count me in for the third game			"

I made Katarina my tank with great dps. And chimera always got injouries on it's hunts.- Tower defence: it was a great addition, but felt they put all of them in the first half of the game... and none in the last half.- No sings of PvP multiplayer.Yet, with all it's flaws I love the game. 12 hours of action, new scanario mode. The studio LOVES it's games. The try to fix the bugs, learn from their mistakes. Keep up the good work, count me in for the third game			"

												I'm really torn on this one. This is one of the times when lack of a ""middle"" option comes out. I've reached lvl 60 with one character and played through this game twice and so far I can say:PROS:- Decent loot system although it's kinda lacking on higher levels as many of the uniques and sets are the same but with scaled up stats.- A lot of customization options.- More skills available than in the previous game.- Base/troops management system.- Very nice and stylish graphics, especially weather.- It's cheap.- Funny banter and lot's of weird easter eggs.CONS:- Still the same terrible character model. I don't understand how even tho the game looks great the character model of your character is so horrid.- The length of the main story is seriously disappointing, it feels more like we've been given half of the game instead of a full product with a extremely anti-climacting final boss fight. I honestly don't know where does the 20GB of HDD space go to.- The main story's additional fault is lack of randomly generated layout once you've played the game you know where to go and what's ahead.- I encountered quite a bit of bugs on my playthrough some got already fixed, some are still there. Additionally some skills are seriously overpowered ( I know that doesn't really matter but it just makes some skills utterly useless).- The total amount of locations available in the main story is probably lower than that in the first game with some being awfully short.- Storyline is meh and the choices you're given don't really affect anything.- I didn't really enjoy the end game Nightmare Scenarios after reaching lvl 60 and rank 20 for perks there really isn't much to do other than starting a new character. There are some possibilities of PVP but didn't try it out yet.I'm hoping for future DLC with more content or maybe expansion pack. I was seriously disappointed when the game ended with that pathetic pseudo boss fight. Where's Perun? The Deathless? Prisoner 7? Those would be some interesting boss fights but nope...Fortunately building your character and slaying hordes of monsters is truly fun. There's lots of skills to choose from, I played as Arcane Mechanic and commanded a horde of mechanical allies. They added a rune forging mechanic which in my opinion completely obsoletes the old item crafting system unless I missed something. New trophy gallery system which adds some more bonuses and penalties on your game it's really unfortunate it's only available from level 31+.Even after all that I do recommend the game it's got lots of flaws but in the end its a fun hack and slash. For that price it's worth it.			"

												I guess I must be doing something wrong. Playing on normal as an arcane mechanic and I am dying left and right. Sometimes I stand in the middle of a lage mob, and nothing happens to my health. Then all of a sudden it drops to zero in one second.There is a ton of skills and it is unclear to me what benefit one over the other has. Reskilling was cheap, but I can't see any difference between a lvl 10 flame thrower or lvl 10 spider.Item drops are boring as I seldomly find something that is better than I already have equipped.I could also do without the soldier mini game, read mission description, read 4 comments by your commanders, guess buest commander, click send.

												Well. After some Hours Playtime i found many things wich are just no. The Amount of enemy`s who are spwaing in a constant way arround you (so many you cant even count and focus -.-) , the amount of HP they have (you do for example 100 dmg and they have up to 12 k hp?! why? not even boss mobs just Mastergrade or rare and im playing on normal not on avarage or hardcore mode!) you NPC friend in Form of Catarina wich is completely useless since she`s most of the time gone in 2-3 hits by normal mobs (i spend all her points in vitality and still she`s gone way too fast), then you have NPC`S wich should help you but have only like 49 hp when the enemy is way above 2k for normal mobs. The amount of skill points you can use is also comapred to the Hordes of Enemys youre facing way too less and youre also in the need of Portions wich are useful if you face some mobs but if you get pushed from an horde of some veterans you smiply run away or die. Now some good things after all the crying ;) The Missions you can Put your npcs through is kinda nice, you send them on missions and get rewards for them is kinda cool. Also the Personal Chimera is nice (its like a pet wich goes treasur hunting for you!!) The story itself of course but that would be it.So if you want to buy it wait for it until its less than 5 euros.Hope i could help you with my Review :)			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!There are random, quest-breaking glitches at multiple parts in the game. Whether it's pathfinding, objective-marking, object collisions, etc., there are too many for me in good conscience to ever recommend this game to anyone, ever. Yes I played the first one and hated it, but I half expected the devs to learn from their mistakes and create a quality product for the second game. I was 100% wrong, it's considerably worse. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!My character gets stuck running, the game crashes after loot drops, dialogue is drawn out and pointless; the slowest talkers are given walls of text to speak. It's either you're interacting with 3 feature length films, or you skip it and lose interest quickly in an already convoluted plot. Can't get drawn into anything when half the time you're waiting for everyone to shut up so you can hopefully get through the next battle glitch-free.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!It's not done, and if it IS the second of a trilogy, part 3 will forever go unplayed by me.

												Great game, if you prefer a good singleplayer story and lots of variation over endless grinding. Van Helsing offers a huge skilltree, lots of item collecting, customization and crafting fun. The gameplay is more relaxed and linear than other rpgs, you dont have 100 simultaneous quests but maybe 3-4, and you dont have 5 chars to take care of but only your main char and Katherina a helpful ghost with its own skills. The campaign itself is a bit short (maybe 30 hours) but the replay values is very high, since you only reach ~lvl30 after the first playthrough and about half of the skilltree only comes after lvl30.  I really liked that you have a lair (your ""home"") where you return after the battles to upgrade your stuff, manage your restistance group by sending out troops, a bit like in dragon age. The tower defense minigame is so amazing, you will definitely want to buy Deathtrap, the full game that they made out of it.There are a few bugs and balancing issues, but no dealbreakers.Multiplayer is unfortunately deserted, at least when I tried (1 year after release) there seems to be no one playing :(			"

This was three months ago, I have absolutely no idea how the things are now, but in my own frustration I had to say this.Game itself was fun, when it was playable. "

I played on normal to just experiment and have fun without having to research a viable ""build"" and yet that doesn't really work - you'll die a lot just trying to play through, and in many cases that will mean a respawn and a long run back down the same semi-linear tracks to where you died.Sure, you can spend gold to rez where you died, but you'll quickly run out of gold doing that.

												I rather enjoyed the first game and was looking forward to a continuation of the story with the second installment.  I got that, but what I was not expecting was that the second game (other than the story) was identical to the first.  You have the same ""classes"", with the same abilities, that you level up all over again.  If they were going to go this route they should have at least allowed a save game import function from the first one.  After less than an hour it just felt like I was starting a new charater from scratch (I was) with nothing new to look forward to except enemy units and locations.			"

												Revisiting my review now that I've completed the campaign. TLDR: buy it now.Van Helsing II stars right where the first game ended, allowing you to continue your campaign with your existing character, or start a new one either at level 1 or 30. Unlike, say, the transition between Diablo 1 and 2, there are no changes in fundamentals; VH2's tactic is to be a bigger, better version of the first game, and at that it's wildly successful.The gorgeous visuals of the first game are enhanced by excellent weather and atmospheric effects, plus some truly impressive spell effects that had me constantly wanting to mash the screenshot key.The excellent soundtrack returns, plus around the same amount of new music again, joined by surprisingly good voice acting and an array of viscerally satisfying sound effects layered on top of an ambience that combine to give the game a wonderful sense of atmosphere.(By the way, it does support multi-channel configurations, though I'm not sure if audio effects are fully positional with respect to the extra channels.)In terms of gameplay mechanics, VH2 takes the first game and extends it; all of the features from VH1 return as-is, and are expanded by enough new skills and abilities to give the game a great deal of customisability. There are three character classes, but by the time you've customised your character with the skills you want, two players with the same class could - probably will - have radically different play styles. I think they did a pretty good job of avoiding the Diablo 3 problem where some skills are effectively mandatory, and others are basically worthless, and I think overall it has a greater degree of viable character customisation, but of course there are some skills that seem weaker or stronger than others. You can fully respec every character choice if you wish, though it comes at a price. If you want to try out a wide variety of options with the same character, prepare to save up a *lot* of gold. If you choose to start with a level 30 character, there are a few pre-made options to pick from that give some variety in character builds (or you can make up your own of course). Being a game about one specific character, you obviously don't get to play anyone else, so there's not going to be any option for a female hero - the game would need to be entirely rescripted. Of course this is so obvious that I almost didn't even bring it up, but I know that kind of thing disappoints some players so I thought I'd mention it.I found the gameplay to be highly engaging throughout, even when I was getting my posterior handed to me (I'm just saying, that's a whole lot of ornithopters to fight while there are pools of poison all over the floor and homing incendiary bombs being launched at my face). I can't imagine anyone who liked the first game being disappointed here. I'd say that the main campaign is probably about half as long again, with some added variety in environments and fight mechanics (I can call down an artillery strike? Hmm, that has significant friendly-fire potential). Don't expect any *major* novelty there - we're still basically visiting wilderness, city, and areas in the ink - but it's not just rehashes of exactly the same zones, and some of the additions are... honestly pretty breathtaking. I love being able to look down at the city far below me. One of the things that sets the VH games apart from other ARPGs like D3 or Torchlight is that there are a lot of areas where you can see, for example, another level in the dungeon, and rather than being essentially just a complicated backdrop that tantalises but remains forever out of reach, here it's frequently another part of the level that you can get to.I've played a lot of ARPGs since the first Diablo, and honestly I'd be pretty comfortable in saying that this is the best since Diablo 2 was released in 2000. I'd have no hesitation recommending it even at three times the price.Original, first impressions review follows:First, if you didn't like the first one, look elsewhere. This is basically more of the same. You can import your old character, and the game starts seemingly immediately after the ending of the first one. In fact, it's so much like an extended version of the original game that I'm a little surprised it wasn't released as an expansion. The gameplay is essentially an incremental step from VH1, with some added features and extended character progression.That said, I'm not upset about this. I enjoyed VH1 a great deal, and this - so far at least - seems just like a further iteration, which is exactly what I was expecting. The gameplay updates may be fairly minor in the overall scheme, but they're good nonetheless (and I've only played a couple of hours - there could be more in store). Given that it costs less than an expansion pack for most big-budget games, anyone disappointed by the similarity in gameplay might do well to think of it as a standalone expansion, if that helps.I find the game has a great visual appeal - I love the art style and the atmosphere, and the music is great (it can all be found as oggs in the install directory, and it has all the music from VH1 plus about the same amount again).Overall I'd say this is one of the better entries in the genre for quite some time.

												The graphics are a bit messy, the story is ok, the humor scarce and sometimes repetitve but very good.The game mechanics, like wall oclusion or attack orders and distances is bad. The progresion and skills design is stupid. There is no synergy, and when there is, it is  to specialize the character ie: increased damg for fire based skills x%, and that is all the skill does. The rage system is bad, the companion is very unbalanced, even if you spek her for full tank she will die every 2nd hit with some monsters and with others she can kill them all alone. the mobs are very repetitive. There is like 3 or 4 diferent systems to improve items in the game, like socketing enchanting runes morphing and they are all dull and boring.If you like the type of game and not just the genre, I would rather recomend Diablo or Torchlight			"

												Wow Van helsing II is terrible reasons:1)If one does not have a good pc then u will never be able to play the game because at the second god damn quest your fps drops so much because there are way to many allies and enemies all in one place.2)The multiplayer gameplay is terrible it take a person half-an hour to find a game and then because the hosting is so good people leave because of lag and when the host leaves its just like FML3)Storyline/Quests. This is really my main qualm with the game. The storyline of this game is really disappointing. Maybe the storyline isn't disappointing [as it makes sense in the context of VH1], but the way it is executed is disappointing. The questing sucks. Very little variation, mostly based around tower defense. The vast majority of your missions are ""secure X, Y, Z points by battling through streams of enemies.If you did not play the first game, don't buy this. The first is a much more complete experience. The game simply lacks what made the first game worth playing "

												Game is not optimized, with severe FPS and stuttering issues.  It's a common issue reported by a lot of people, even those boasting mid-top rigs.  Skimming the message boards, the developers insist they've fixed it, however it's kindof ridiculous that the problem keeps getting reported and nothing is being done.  The common solution offered by most is to enter the install folder and start changing the files around, which doesn't work.  Sorry, but it seems like another situation where a developer pumped out an 80% completed product, took the money, and ran.			"

												I did not appreciate being unable to import my character because he was one level shy of the 30 mark minimum. The story is bland and uninteresting, involving a villain that we never see with motives that are never explained. It was nice to be able to play as the DLC characters free of charge, and the compelling stat growth from the first is maintained admirably, as are the creative enemy types. Unfortunately, the game feels like an add-on to the first in terms of quality and content. Graphics are exactly the same, and the scenery is almost entirely boring dead-tech metal, lacking the colorful forested areas from the original. The game also spends too much time on pointless, distracting minigames. One of these, a simple tower-defense, is fun, but I paid for an ARPG, not a tower-defense game. Another involves sending minions out on specific missions depending on their individual strengths and weaknesses. I hope the developers didn't spend to much time on this aspect, because it is utterly, 100% pointless.Lastly: I was unable to beat the game. This is a huge taboo for me as a critic. The difficulty spikes ten-fold during the Drill battle, as the game throws endlessly spawning OP enemies at you as you run around flipping the same switches over and over. It's tedious and unfair, and my requests for help on the forums were met with disdain of the ""get gud"" variety.At least the menu music is pretty.			"

												EDITED REVIEW - As of two weeks after purchase, the game is fully playable - and is an EXCELLENT single player APRG. I say single player because there is almost nobody playing this game online, which is too bad. It's more thought out than Diablo 3, and feels a bit higher budget than Path of Exile. If you're looking for a great ARPG experience to play solo, pick up TIAOVH 2. There are tower defense modes, a story (campaign) mode, and some amazing easter eggs thrown in for good measure. Item drops are generous and on point with your character (after my first play through I was wearing 40% ""Unique"" quality items) and the classes all do different things.That being said, the class balance could use a little work, the mage feels great at wiping away lots of trash mobs and definitely has advantages against bosses, but the engineer is amazingly powerful, especially post-veteran. 8/10, would recommend and would play again!------I cannot recommend a product that refuses to work. After following the (multiple) threads to fix the problems, the game persists in failing to load. If you want to play a game, look elsewhere. I've written Steam about it and commented on the community page for the game. I'll update this review if the problems are fixed. Such a let down.			"

												If you're unable to play a game after you pay $14.99 for it. That's not just a travesty, it's fraud and a breach of trust. When will game software companies quit rushing development and production for quick sales. It makes me wonder if they even hired a QA team at all. I don't pay money for a game just for it to crash on me every time I open it. This is not entirely Neocore's fault but the Steam client and team as well for not making sure the build was stable enough for release and sale. If you're wanting to play this game, avoid any frustration and wait about six months to a year. After they have patched it thoroughly and made it completely stable to the point it's actually playable.			"

												Like the first installment, it's good for hours of playtime, but it suffers from many of the same issues.  I had to turn almost all the graphics enhancements off to reduce the lag, as that's what killed me 9 times out of 10.  Gameplay consists mainly of spamming the same powers over and over ad nauseum and using a health or mana potion intermittently.  I ignored the tower defense section almost entirely and delegated the tasks to NPCs.  The story was not all that interesting again, and the voice acting for the assisting characters got on my nerves.  The ending to the game is underwhelming, and they expect you to play through the campaign again in order to unlock scenarios.  I say, to what end?			"

												Only got less than an hour in and wasn't impressed. Good setting and good price for sure, but I own Diable 3, so this game really feels low grade in comparison. The controls on my DS4 were super clunky and the graphics look terrible and overall everything feels very delayed. I appriciate what they were trying to do here and it has a very comprehensive skill list and multiplayer and everything. It's a really fleshed out game, just the core mechanics irked me and I decided to move on to other games in my library.			"

The only thing i liked in the game is the beast that i got, this is amazing, but overal the game lacks to may thing.. the storwas so and so , i expeceted more, but i could live with this... Houmor imported from tones of games/movies/books was fine but i think they over did it  a bit.. anyway if you find it on sale go buy it , but dont expect it to be better than 1 .. sadly :(			"

												The first impression is not too good. There is a awful bug  in the first screen of the game. If you don't open the door and just click outside of it you are automatically teleport in the middle of mobs somewhere at a lower level. From there basically you are stucked and every time when you are to close to the borders or try to open the only door available, you are teleported back. Maybe I am the only one that happens. Another problem is you can't start the game from level 1. The option is there but is disabled without any explanation. Why is there if I can't use it. I will return to  The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing until all the problems will be fixed.			"

												The game's graphics are beautiful, are similar to the first. Not so easy to equip the character at the beginning of the game, it's hard to find weapons and equipment, the first half hour of the game is quite disastrous, plenty of action for those who are just starting the game. Who has not played Van Helsing 1, stay completely lost and frustrated. In Van Helsing 1 was very uncomfortable with the scenes with extreme appeal of death, murder and lots of black magic involved, a lot of voodoo. That seconde game is not difference, Van Helsing is required to interact with the voodoo to get ahead in your career. Voodoo practices that are applied in our real world, it left me extremely disappointed with the game, because I have a spiritual life and these events are completely contrary to the teachings I follow. I have an open mind for the game and life itself, but if you are a Christian as Im, will feel uncomfortable too.			"

No more skill points though. For $15 it's a great little ARPG.			"

												Van Helsing 2 continues and expands on the gameplay of its predecessor in predictable, but satisfying ways. Beginning with the ability to import a saved character from the first game, II delivers an additional thirty levels of experience, new items, skills, quests, tower defense levels, enemies, quests, and sarcastic retorts from the ghostly Lady Katerina. It is more linear then the first game, with fewer sidequests overall but more tower defense levels, and additional side mechanics that allow you to send out NPC captains to  perform offscreen missions, rewarding you with additional gold and items, and an additional pet with customizable abilities. The equipment-modding obsessed can now alter their equipment in an additional way, via stat-increasing runes. While Van Helsing II treads ground already heavily traveled, it is nonetheless an excellent Diablolike and arguably a better singleplayer experience then many other titles in the genre, due in no small part to Van Helsing's both varied and powerful skillset. My hunter-class Van Helsing was capable of dealing extrordinary damage both to single targets and in an area, but was also very survivable thanks to a lot of lifesteal. The game is significantly easier on its normal difficulty then other titles in the genre, including the first Van Helsing, but offers two additional difficulty levels beyond that along with repeatable, randomized, high-level dungeons for the discerning munchkin. I will be proceeding directly to Van Helsing III and what I hope is a thrilling conclusion to the trilogy, and I will look forward greatly to Neocore's recently announced Warhammer 40,000 ARPG, Inquisitor - Martyr.

												With experience of multiple other ARPG games, such as Path of Exile, Torchlight and the Diablo series, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II feels weak in comparison. While the visuals aren't terrible, the sound effects are. Sound is a very important aspect in making the combat feel responsive and satisfying, and the game fails in this area. Hearing the same enemy type have only a single death scream means you'll get very tired of killing them - which should NEVER happen in an ARPG game. Imagine watching a movie with loads of fighting, and whenever someone dies, you hear the Wilhelm Scream. Over and over again. Not good.You gain levels quite quickly, but each level feels insignificant. In fact, it becomes a chore to level up. This is yet another reason why playing the game does not feel good.I haven't played the game long enough to tell how the boss fights work out, but that is because I can't bring myself to play the game any longer. I recommend you do not purchase the game unless it goes on a very heavy sale, or if there's a Humble Bundle sale with some other game you want (and this game merely comes as a sidebonus).			"

This bug has been known for quite a long time (because the came crashing is a rather obvious bug), and it aggravates me that nothing has been done to fix it yet.This game is actually not that bad, bugs aside, and I would like to progress further, but sadly I am stuck at this point and so I only got a few hours out of the game			"

												The 2nd followup on Van Helsing is a lot more polished and enjoyable than the first.The story takes on shortly after defeating the main boss in the first, and with no rest for the wicked, you're back to the monster hunting.In terms of graphical and sound improvements, I see none. They likely kept to the same core and went with ""If it ain't broke...""Van Helsing 2 offers a bit more freedom than the first, mainly due to the 2nd having all the DLC included which you can buy for the first game. This means the 2 classes, Arcane Mechanic and Thaumaturgist can be played. Blue Blood is also part of the game, so your ghostly companion Katharina is far more versatile and interesting in terms of skills for her.The little golden gem of the game, being the tower defence in the Secret Lair has been expanded a fair bit with more levels and more maps, instead of just the usual level.Aside from that, there is plenty of new secrets, a Chimera creature for treasure hunting, NPC team members in the Lair usable for quests related only to them, trophies for game changes and much more.The whole campaign feels a bit short, but definitely enjoyable. The campaign can be replayed in a Veteran version, other modes and Scenarioes for more challenges.			"

												I was positively surprised by the depth, novelty and quality of this game. I can actually say that this is the best rpg of this genre I've played until now, technically and gameplay wise better than diablo 3.Its main campaign lenght is relatively short though, but it has a generous amount of dlc to compensate.Great replayability. Awesome skill tree. Lots and lots of enemies at once. Formidable game. No actual shortcomings I can think of.			"

												If you enjoy torchlight or diablo do yourself a favor and buy this game. It should be regarded as the best arpg/tower defence game on the market I can not wait to buy Deathtrap because my favorite part of this game was the tower defense I wish it had more levels. I have played torchlight 1 and 2 both over 100 hours as well as Diablo II. This game destroys them and should be the first thing meantioned after ARPG. This is not a left and right click masher there is alot more spell/life/mana/combo management than the other games meantioned. I played a full story on the heroic setting and it was not easy to survive so I would consider this game challenging as well. If you like ARPGs and Tower Defense games Don't Hesitate BUY THIS GAME. The metacritic score is low imho. The story is good as well as the voice actors and there is some good humor mixed into the game with references to famous movies and a famous game as well. I heard this game had a rocky launch but it works solid now. When I bought the game last week a patch came out and I had crashes but a hotfix was released 48 hours later that fixed any issues I had. GREAT GAME!!!			"

												After completing the first VH with three toons, i had awesome hopes for VH2, and it didnt dissapoint at all.Its longer, it has awesome and sometimes very funny secrets, the Tower deffence mini game was much better then the first one, IE dont have to go round to try and find machine pieces, the skill trees where better more options and some costed less then the first one.The voice acting sometimes was a bit squiffy, IE very bland and they really sounded bored, just like the first one.The only two problems i have had is when doing the TD maps, if you move something in your bags, the game crashes or when putting points into your trees in TD maps it crashes, and the fact i cant Import my VH1 toon into this one... a little dissapointing.But all in all, its a darn good game. Oh one more thing, the Pigasus DLC.. Pfftt whatever dont even get it unless its in a bundle * like when i got mine* but the Ink Hunt DLC, maybe short and at the end of the Vet camp, its still fun and has a few secrets also.			"

												If your here youve probably played the first game.  If not this game is exactly like it but a little better in my opinion.  The art looks amazing using dx11, with added skills for both van helsing and katarina to make your character even more of a badass.  There is an added feature where you can send guys and a chimera on timed missions to get some extra stuff.  This game felt easier than the first one but i did die alot during my solo playthru on normal, im guessing this game would be perfect on the coop.  Even after dying alot the graphics and loot kept me coming back to slaughter more.  i played using a xbox controller, game ran smooth but i did get several weird bugs where when exiting or opening a menu itd pop up with one of my items and i could not do anything. Could have been a glitch caused by the controller im not sure but most of the time the game did always have me saved up so i did not have to lose progress. Overall i had alot of fun on this game and bet it would rock on coop.  Get it.			"

												EDIT: Nice though this game is, you'd be much better off just buying Final Cut since it's improved versions of all 3 games combined into one.Unfortunately has a lot of half-realized concepts in it: tower defense is still incredibly eh, the generals and chimera feel like they were thrown in as afterthoughts, being nothing more than loot farms, and the final boss is pretty much just killing a bunch of trash mobs for 15 minutes). That in mind, the gameplay and hand-crafted levels that made the first game fun are still there, as is the fun dialog and characters, and it's not a half-bad sequel in the end.			"

												VH2 is a Great Co-op game. I played it coop with the same buddy in VH1 too. This game balances out the combat in normal difficulty well as VH1 had a major issue of crazy difficulty even on Normal mode. The game does have silly bugs that irritate you just like VH1 did. I personally would not play this Single Player, but with a buddy or two, total Dhamaal! IMPORTANT NOTE:- Don't botther with the dlc UNLESS you are STARTING the game in veteran mode as ALL the dlc's are only really applicable from Veteran mode onwards. And the DLC's are nothing great BTW.			"

												The second part of Van Helsing's adventures has some pros and cons compared to the first one. On the pro-side is graphics and the great references to Sherlock Holmes, Mr. Hyde, the Hulk and others. Also I personally found the looting more fun. However Katarina is less charismatic and the story is less deep. This is a little disapointing: especially as the triangle between Prisoner 17, Van Helsing and Katarina has great potential for story-telling.In summary, the game is, like the first part, fun to play and a must for everyone who likes hack'n slay games.

												Part 1 offered solid hack'n slay/arpg gameplay in an interesting setting:-industrial/steampunkish meets Van Helsingfurthermore you got lots of voiced goodness going on between Helsing and his ghostly companion. They chat, comment, talk to lots of diffrent, sometimes strange, sometimes funny, sometimes nearly Pschynoautsesque NPCs and it's always entertaining. Unlinke the rather boring, blend D3 npcs and mainchars, there's a real chemestry going on here. If you don't get attached to this strange couple during Van Helsing 1, part 2 will do the job. The same goes for every aspect of the series. The catchy soundtrack and melancholic flair make this a very special ride.The whole gameworld is full of detail. you can see the effort this smal dev put into the series and it pays of. Part 1 was a complete game: lots of things to collect, loot, grind, many diffrent ways to build the couple for combat -> part 2 builds on this and feels even more refined. New gamemechanics, which build upon the solid groundwork, new build-options and new lvl-hights to achieve. I've rarely played 2 a parts of a gameseries that blend this good. They didn't change anything drastic, didn't chop up the story, they pretty much just refined what was already a very good game. If you like hack'n slay/arpg-games this is for you, if you like to explore an interesting setting and protagonists this is for you.I can fully recommend both parts of the franchise and seeing how things are now, probably part 3 also.

												I would rate myself as an average ARPG player. I imported my character from the first game and immediately went at it and just recently beat the story line. I died very few times even on the Heroic difficulty (second most difficult) because it just seemed broken for a few things but I didn't really mind. Story and other stuff is great. Would recommend if it is on sale.ONE MAJOR THING. The most important thing I saw from this game was that it could use a little more polishing. More than a handful of gramatical errors like loose instead of lose. It really took me out of the game and some of the texts didn't match up from the soundtrack. One quest, Gate of Perun was broken for me. Maybe one more week should have been spent polishing up this game, or release a patch to fix all these errors. Its just silly that this would occur to detract from an otherwise awesome game. Also, you can't go back and redo some quests which is really moronic. But none the less, great game. Had a lot of fun.			"

												Things I didn't like about this game:1) Loading time is too slow. It takes me 2 minutes from the moment I click on the desktop icon to start playing the actual game. Two minutes!2) I can play most new games at the maximum settings, but for some reason, Van Helsing II lags even on the lowest settings.3) The maps are not randomized.4) The name of the game is silly and way too long.5) Too many cutscenes and talking. This was supposed to be an ARPG where you just run around and kill kill kill and click click click, not an RPG like Baldur's Gate. Less talking, more action and more loot. Oh, speaking about loot:6) Not enough loot. I destroy every barrel, kill every monster and I only get a few drops.7) Rage mechanic doesn't tell you when it's activated. A sound effect or a graphic representation would be nice. It would be even nicer if the Rage worked like in Torchlight 2, where when you reach maximum rage, you are super powerful for 10 seconds or so, instead of these ""combos"".8) Too many mobs. Seriously, when 15 fast moving guys just surround you, there isn't much you can do, especially if you are a ranged class.9) The game graphic seems outdated, like I'm playing a game from 2005.10) UI is pretty bad. In every decent ARPG it is ESSENTIAL to have a good view of your health and mana bars (or orbs). In Van Helsing, they are barely visible.All in all, a poor attempt at an ARPG game. If you want the real thing, I suggest: Diablo 2, Torchlight 2 or Titan Quest.			"

I completed VH1 right after I receive VH2 from Humble Bundle. To my surprise, it is totally unplayable. Game crashes a lot and there are moments where you get stuck in the game with no route to continue questing. The auras in the game are also a major disappointment. It won't work in a multiplayer game because if there are 2 players in the game, the player who enters the map first will override the other player.			"

												First off, the game (on it's first try) took like 10-15 minutes to load up before the title screen. But after that was done, the game found and imported my old character and I was off. The gameplay is about the same as Van Helsing 1 and the new areas were fun to play. I enjoyed their two minigames they added - some management game with your soldiers, and also having a pet that you can feed and send to hunt. The voice acting was great as well.My main gripes would be the long loading time between areas, the horrible 10-15 minute initialization on your game's first launch, as well as the lacklustre storyline. For some reason, the game also felt very short (finished it shy of 20 hours).For this I would recommend the game, however I believe this game only deserves a 6/10.Edit: Added thoughts on completing time.

												I enjoyed VH - it wasn't without flaws but I'd hoped the worst of them (difficulty spikes, poor upgrade tree, limited workable builds) would be solved here.Sadly they're not - in fact in some ways this game is WORSE - there are more options and yet it feels like less of them are viable and the difficulty is the same rollercoaster of random nonsense.Worse still, the design of the opening of the game (after the intro) is confusing and horrible.  I was left with NO idea what was going-on and whilst replaying it kinda helped, it's not a great way to start.Add that the game seems a bit slower to load (VH wasn't quick) and a bit more prone to crash and it's hard to recommend this game really.If you liked the first - this doesn't nothing better and may in places be worseIf you DIDN'T like the first - it's really, really unlikely this will change your mind :(			"

I had to alt + f4 to force quit the application so i could simple stop playing and uninstall it.			"

												Van Helsing II is an aRPG set in the mythical land of Borgovia. If you've played Grim Dawn, Diablo or Torchlight you'll be familiar with the gameplay. The game does have a unique ability system though, as you fight you gain rage which can be spent to powerup your abilities. For example lets say you're using a lightning spell, powering it up may cause enemies to be shocked, or it may increase the number of enemies hit. A powered up spell only has one charge and can be activated with the spacebar, although this becomes tedious very fast and I'd wager 99.9% of people have this set to auto cast whenever available. The game allows you to set up powerup presets so you can very much set it and forget it and the game will automatically boost the chosen ability(s) whenever you have sufficient rage. Apart from that it's your usual aRPG fare, you have a standard talent tree with forks and paths, passive abilities and stat points which allow you to customise your character further.Throughout the game you're accompanied by your ghostly companion, Katarina. She works very much like the Torchlight pet, she can pick up items, fight for you and even be sent back to town to sell and buy which saves you the bother! She also has her own stats and talent tree, you can either build her to become stronger herself, or build her as a complete buff bot which will give you lots of powerful auras. Usefulness aside she's actually a big part of the game, and the banter between you and her is often really enjoyable, the voice acting for both Van Helsing and Katarina is top notch (the same can't be said for all the characters though!).The story will take around 10 hours to complete which is poor, and shorter than the first game. You will finish the story around level 30 but to do scenarios you'll need to be level 57 and I couldn't work out how to level up further. Perhaps this was only intended for people who imported their character from Van Helsing I but I started a new character so was much lower level by the end of the game.Technically the game is fine, most quests have voice acting which isn't always a given for this genre, especially from the smaller studios, and while not perfect it is pretty funny at times and there are plenty of references to other games and TV shows which I enjoyed. I will say the voice acting for Prisoner 7 is terrible, absolutely terrible and lowers the quality of the entire game by being so bad. Graphically the game is OK, it's a couple of years old and wouldn't have been anything to rave about back then, but it's fine. Performance is worse than Van Helsing I which stayed at 60fps without dips, whereas Van Helsing II will often dip in frame rate, and certain areas have issues and completely tank the frame rate. There is also a nasty bug with DX11 and Windows 8.1 where textures will not load, I suffered with this often and it made the game extremely frustrating at times.Overall it's better than Van Helsing I, but it also introduces its own problems so I can't score it higher than 6/10, which is what I gave the first game. And once again I can only recommend buying this game while it's 75% off.			"

												With experience of multiple other ARPG games, such as Path of Exile, Torchlight and the Diablo series, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II feels weak in comparison. While the visuals aren't terrible, the sound effects are. Sound is a very important aspect in making the combat feel responsive and satisfying, and the game fails in this area. Hearing the same enemy type have only a single death scream means you'll get very tired of killing them - which should NEVER happen in an ARPG game. Imagine watching a movie with loads of fighting, and whenever someone dies, you hear the Wilhelm Scream. Over and over again. Not good.You gain levels quite quickly, but each level feels insignificant. In fact, it becomes a chore to level up. This is yet another reason why playing the game does not feel good.I haven't played the game long enough to tell how the boss fights work out, but that is because I can't bring myself to play the game any longer. I recommend you do not purchase the game unless it goes on a very heavy sale, or if there's a Humble Bundle sale with some other game you want (and this game merely comes as a sidebonus).			"

												The 2nd followup on Van Helsing is a lot more polished and enjoyable than the first.The story takes on shortly after defeating the main boss in the first, and with no rest for the wicked, you're back to the monster hunting.In terms of graphical and sound improvements, I see none. They likely kept to the same core and went with ""If it ain't broke...""Van Helsing 2 offers a bit more freedom than the first, mainly due to the 2nd having all the DLC included which you can buy for the first game. This means the 2 classes, Arcane Mechanic and Thaumaturgist can be played. Blue Blood is also part of the game, so your ghostly companion Katharina is far more versatile and interesting in terms of skills for her.The little golden gem of the game, being the tower defence in the Secret Lair has been expanded a fair bit with more levels and more maps, instead of just the usual level.Aside from that, there is plenty of new secrets, a Chimera creature for treasure hunting, NPC team members in the Lair usable for quests related only to them, trophies for game changes and much more.The whole campaign feels a bit short, but definitely enjoyable. The campaign can be replayed in a Veteran version, other modes and Scenarioes for more challenges.			"

												Part 1 offered solid hack'n slay/arpg gameplay in an interesting setting:-industrial/steampunkish meets Van Helsingfurthermore you got lots of voiced goodness going on between Helsing and his ghostly companion. They chat, comment, talk to lots of diffrent, sometimes strange, sometimes funny, sometimes nearly Pschynoautsesque NPCs and it's always entertaining. Unlinke the rather boring, blend D3 npcs and mainchars, there's a real chemestry going on here. If you don't get attached to this strange couple during Van Helsing 1, part 2 will do the job. The same goes for every aspect of the series. The catchy soundtrack and melancholic flair make this a very special ride.The whole gameworld is full of detail. you can see the effort this smal dev put into the series and it pays of. Part 1 was a complete game: lots of things to collect, loot, grind, many diffrent ways to build the couple for combat -> part 2 builds on this and feels even more refined. New gamemechanics, which build upon the solid groundwork, new build-options and new lvl-hights to achieve. I've rarely played 2 a parts of a gameseries that blend this good. They didn't change anything drastic, didn't chop up the story, they pretty much just refined what was already a very good game. If you like hack'n slay/arpg-games this is for you, if you like to explore an interesting setting and protagonists this is for you.I can fully recommend both parts of the franchise and seeing how things are now, probably part 3 also.

												I would rate myself as an average ARPG player. I imported my character from the first game and immediately went at it and just recently beat the story line. I died very few times even on the Heroic difficulty (second most difficult) because it just seemed broken for a few things but I didn't really mind. Story and other stuff is great. Would recommend if it is on sale.ONE MAJOR THING. The most important thing I saw from this game was that it could use a little more polishing. More than a handful of gramatical errors like loose instead of lose. It really took me out of the game and some of the texts didn't match up from the soundtrack. One quest, Gate of Perun was broken for me. Maybe one more week should have been spent polishing up this game, or release a patch to fix all these errors. Its just silly that this would occur to detract from an otherwise awesome game. Also, you can't go back and redo some quests which is really moronic. But none the less, great game. Had a lot of fun.			"

												Ok, so you played The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing I, and you may not have been impressed. Skills were a bit lackluster and some were obviously far superior to others, loot drops were bland and uninteresting, and many of the missions felt like a slog. Van Helsing 2 fixes all of that. Way more skills, more variations of builds, massive loot variation (want to build a tanky mage? Sure). Your ghost companion can now do some good DPS, support, or whatever you choose. There's always something different to do. The tower defense games are better (you can skip them if you dont' like tower defense). Sending your underlings on missions is a good mini game in itself. The isometric pov is better. It feels like a different game altogether, and is more addictive and fun than the original.			"

You will fight against a machinery out of Soldiers, Giant Mutants, Robotspiders (!damn you robotic spiders!), Giant Tarantulas and more..As a lover of TopDown RPG Worlds like Titan Quest: IT, this was (like some british doodes would say) ""a good pennyworth.""I brougt the complete pack with the discount of 66%. And thanks to the frontline, that I've encountered this masterpiece!Btw. you can also send your own soldiers to battles and let them handle the sidequests or you defend the tunnels in a minigame like TOWERDEFENSE.

												Really hate how this game went from an action-adventure to a full-blown tower defense game -_-. It feels like I'm spending most of my time not roaming through the wilderness (like the first game), but going back to my base for yet another !(@#$&#@($& tower defense.Would recommend to: those who like tower defense games with a small amount of aRPG elements.

												Not as good as first one...while there are some things that were done very well, the negatives still out weigh the positives. As others have said Neocore should really be working on fixes for the bugs in this game before releasing the third (and final game). As it stands right now I cannot reccomend this game. 4/10			"

												If you enjoy torchlight or diablo do yourself a favor and buy this game. It should be regarded as the best arpg/tower defence game on the market I can not wait to buy Deathtrap because my favorite part of this game was the tower defense I wish it had more levels. I have played torchlight 1 and 2 both over 100 hours as well as Diablo II. This game destroys them and should be the first thing meantioned after ARPG. This is not a left and right click masher there is alot more spell/life/mana/combo management than the other games meantioned. I played a full story on the heroic setting and it was not easy to survive so I would consider this game challenging as well. If you like ARPGs and Tower Defense games Don't Hesitate BUY THIS GAME. The metacritic score is low imho. The story is good as well as the voice actors and there is some good humor mixed into the game with references to famous movies and a famous game as well. I heard this game had a rocky launch but it works solid now. When I bought the game last week a patch came out and I had crashes but a hotfix was released 48 hours later that fixed any issues I had. GREAT GAME!!!			"

												9/10I bought this game at a reduced price after reading some very good reviews. I was completely new to the franchise but picked up the game relatively quickly. At the time of wrting this reveiw I have completed the game with one of the three characters and I have just started a new story with a second character on veteran. The veteran option allows you to play the story mode from a level 30 character which was a really nice addition which provided a very different style of gameplay and more features, so it was as if you are getting two games for the price of one. However I was initally confused why I was only level 30 after completing the campaign on casual mode. Gamplay functions as a normal RPG should. however I do stuggle with some aspects such as very small action bars (1-6) and the left mouse being responsible for movement and the primary attack which would send me running into a hoarde of enemies instead of attacking them. Bosses are challenging and hoardes of enemies can take you down even on the easy settings.  The tower defence, chimera and resistence side quests/activities/tasks are a nice aspect of the game which allow you to earn more money and experience whilst keeping you entertained. Sometimes the game crashes which is inconveinient but it hasn't drastically affected my gameplay.The amount of choice is with regard to skills and items is mind boggling. It is as if each item is compeltely unique and offers a different range of stats which is great however it can become time consuming to make a decision as to what you want to equip. There are excellent features in the options that allow you to automatically equip the best items though. The skill tree/ tricks/ auras are fairly large for both you and your ghostly companion and as such I spent a lot of time make decisions about how to spend my skill/ability points.Overall it is pleasure to play and will probably keep me entertained for 2 or 3x the time I have already played. Thanks!(This was the first review I've ever wrote so feedback is welcome)			"

												Reason why I brought this game:  to find ARPG to replace D3Hours on D3:  2500 approximatelyGraphics:  decent, a bit low on spells / effects compare to D3Voice acting & storyline:  great job done here, I enjoyed it way more than D3 which actually disgusted me on how they killed of cain and other varies stuffGameplay overall:  smooth most of the time, skills and gears are much more flexible than D3 which REQUIRES you to have specific drops, otherwise you will need to farm for years on end..Game definitely have a lot more to offer than D3: REAPER OF SOULS, scenarios vs rift / grift are much more fun; challenging; and sophisticated.  I did not regret getting this game, and are very satisfied with it.			"

												Played around 2 hours of this game with 3 other friends. Something is incredibly wrong with the scaling of the monsters in this game, a simple wave of trash mobs will obliterate you. The combat is by no means fluid. Interestingly enough, half the quests leave you saving and quitting your game over and over until you can get past the dialogue without the game crashing. Overall, it would be a good game with minor tweaks, but there aren't any minor tweaks, so I wouldn't reccomend purchasing this.			"

												so, now they patched the worst bug and I finally can play it to the end. still some bugs remaining, still haven't try multiplayer, but eventually  - it's enjoyable.unfortunately after starting scenario maps, the game is crashing all the time. so back with ""no recommendation"" :( I have played this over 80 hours, so you could guess I like this game... but most of the time I was angry because of some bug or crash :(EARLIER OPINION:I envy the people writing positive reviews on this game. Like the first volume, it's enjoyable and I'd like to spend hours accomplishing achievements, but I can't - there are bugs I didn't find solution for :( Monsters in the tower defense mini game didn't spawn and in third chapter I'm missing a story-moving person... Only thing I found is I'm not alone with this problem and e-mail support is NOT RESPONDING. So what to do? I have played it more than is acceptable for refund, so uninstall and forget? This is like beta version, still they're selling third installment. Glad I didn't buy that too as I wanted.  If you really want diablo-like game, buy torchlight II!P.S.: I better didn't try multiplayer which is in MANY reviews bugged as well... And don't even think you can run this game on ""minimum requirement"" PC! I have an old one but still high above minimum and it runs badlyEdit: Seems like they started to patch the bugs I encountered. If these bugs will disappear, I will definitely change my rating to ""thumb up"", but still - IMO it's not OK to patch the game after year and after releasing next installment of the series!			"

												I very much enjoy this game and the original.  Both have a light-hearted and engaging gothic story.  I bought all DLC for both without second thought because of my enjoyment of them.However issues arrose after the update wherein permanent ADVERTISEMENTS for an upcoming title were added to Van Helsing 2 and my Gamepad was no longer able to select skill upgrades for any skills more than halfway down the page.  Also sometimes when using a gamepad the highlighted cursor would dissapear when upgrading or interacting with Katarina.I posted about this issue on the technical support forum for the game on steam and received a response but nothing definitive or helpful.  It has been many months since this update and I have attempted to replace my gamepad and it's drivers several times since them in order to see if it could somehow be on my end.  In all situations the problem remains identical and only for this game.Gamepad support is my primary reason for buying any game and I invested fully in this company because I believed that they would bring excellent gamepad support to this title.  Instead they started with passable gamepad support and stripped it with a patch that added permanent advertisements.I love this company and their games and have done everything in my power to find a solution that did not put this issue in their hands.  Now I have no choice but to recommend that no one buy this game if they wish to use a gamepad.			"

I believe this may be my mmo of choice even before diablo 3 ruined the matched sets in their game.  Rare items are pretty cool, even though Ive only found a few so far.  I'm gonna have to play more before I give it a real rating...as is I give it a 8/10 overall vs a 7/10 for diablo 3.			"

												The second part of Van Helsing's adventures has some pros and cons compared to the first one. On the pro-side is graphics and the great references to Sherlock Holmes, Mr. Hyde, the Hulk and others. Also I personally found the looting more fun. However Katarina is less charismatic and the story is less deep. This is a little disapointing: especially as the triangle between Prisoner 17, Van Helsing and Katarina has great potential for story-telling.In summary, the game is, like the first part, fun to play and a must for everyone who likes hack'n slay games.

I played as a caster through  all of the game and most of the game on the hardest difficulty and it took me a long time to beat it; more time than I cared to invest, but that being said for most of the game I was enjoying the difficulty. The sidequests/minigames will take up a sizable portion if you care to do them all. Pros: story and voice acting very engaging. Cons: Every once in a while if you try and shoot an enemy that is around a corner the character will force move around the corner to attack, it cannot be cancelled.7/10			"

												If you like ""rpg"" / ""hack n slash"" / or how ever you would call this genere , that exactly what you are searching for.The greatest advantage in this game is that unlike many rpgs which are based on mindless farming for useless pixels this game is much less addictive and time consuming , and yet fun and enjoiable , so if you love rpgs and love having some real life thats the game for you			"

												Van Helsing has many components to be the greatest diablo game like originality and gore. Its graphics surpass most other clones, and the gameplay is somewhat enjoyable. Somehow tho, the ""intensity"" just isn't there. I haven't been able to enjoy it as much as I thought I would. the spell effects are slow and feel very dumb to use. I think only the melee class has powerful visual effects. The Arcane Mechanic has some of the dumbest animations I've ever seen and having to travel back to town for quests just doesn't cut it anymore. You walk alot, you wait alot, and your spells don't make it worth. 5/10			"

												So here are my initial thoughts after a first completion (I’ll update when I’ve finished with a character imported from Van Helsing 1). This is a top notch action role playing game. There’s a lot of emphasis on the ‘action’ and it’s a pretty breathtaking journey from the opening scenes to the finale. In addition to standard ARPG fare, there is a pretty satisfying tower defence component (which can be completely skipped if you don’t like it, but I recommend giving it a try, I thought I’d hate it and I loved it) and a troop management minigame (a bit like they had in Assassins Creed Revelations – send soldiers on missions, they bring back loot, train them up etc).I’d strongly recommend this to people who’ve played the first Van Helsing game – and if you haven’t, get both and support an excellent franchise. There are a number of areas this game improves from Van Helsing 1. It has better graphics, greater variety of missions, very interesting boss battles (I love the finale), larger maps and more to be getting on with. My first playthrough was about 14 hours on hard mode, which is a nice length and included completing most of the side quests. There’s also two game modes, one for newcomers with a level 1 character, one for those importing a level 30 character. This means new tricks, new items and increased difficulty. All good stuff for those looking for more. I can see this occupying a lot of my time ...It’s not all roses, however... there are a lot of re-used assets, both backgrounds, scenery and enemy types, you are never short on cash, and the loot drops are a little disappointing. Most of the loot (almost all the epic items) were repeated from the first game and dropped by very few enemies (there are too many empty chests). The best items appear at scripted moments and after level 15 I pretty much didn’t change out my loot (I finished the first playthrough at level 31). In addition, Katarina is still pretty useless as anything other than a bullet shield after about level 10, she dies way too easily even with lots of upgrades.In sum it is better than Van Helsing 1 and stands on its own as a great ARPG that is more of an isometric Borderlands than Path of Exile and if that’s something you think you’d enjoy it’s well worth a couple of quid.

												Warning: Decently long review, TL;DR at bottom.Bought the game on sale during Winter Event (so 2 days ago) after playing the first, rolled veteran arcane mechanic and blasted through the story line. Loved gameplay of storyline even though it felt more like a connection to the third game, Katarina is funny as always and it was for the most part amusing. Biggest hiccup was hitting end game content (i.e. Scenarios) where I was DRAMATICALLY underequipped, and really the only decent way of getting gear was from the pigasus. So I had to slide my bloody, grumpy, body through scenarios flailing my failing limbs around until I could afford one piece of pigasus gear (~10 mil standard), after which it got much better. That said, scenarios are fun but bless their hearts they just kill me sometimes. PROS: - Funy(ny) storyline, well written and obviously well planned. No awkward tacked on sequel bait.- Included DLC classes from first game with more skills, all of which are fun.- Decently improved multiplayer from first game, still glitches during storyline and crashed game multiple times during scenario runs in endgame, but much improved from where they started in first Van Helsing. - Much better gear drops than in first game, makes farming much more exciting- Better endgame than first, though that's not really saying much since the first games endgame didn't drop muchCONS: - Endgame has some very cheap feeling shots at the player (will cover seperately, not terribly detrimental to the game at large) .- Slightly buggy multiplayer using LAN connection (can't speak for full wifi)ENDGAME: And here we come to the crux of most of my issues. Endgame is vastly improved and generally a very good experience but with that said some of the things they throw at you just feel like they were player tested on devs and didn't see much actual exposure to a realistic player base. You start out with a difficulty curve that in reality is more of a mountain (could maybe be solved by having the final boss drop a piece of pigasus gear?), and though you climb the mountain and can get a huge amount of satisfaction from doing so the mechanics of the scenario system sometimes feel engineered to take the wind out of your sails. The whole scenario system suffers from a distinct feeling of a lack of agency, you get no choice what maps, what penalties, and what objectives you'll have to complete when running one of the 6 objective scenarios and almost more painful is the lack of ability to even choose what order you run them in. You literally get thrown into one and get penalized for rerolling it if the difficulty's too high, if the penalties are too harsh or unprepared for at current gear level, or if you fail on of the objectives. You even get penalized if you reroll the scenario before FINALIZING it (something that I can't tell if was intended, or if it's just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bug). That all added together the scenarios are generally enjoyable, and actually very fun, but all of the joy you can expect to get out of them MUST be measured against your ability to not get upset when bashing your head against a wall of unforgiving and blatantly punishing mechanics. For example, there are ""clue finding"" objectives in the scenarios which ask the player to kill groups of elites around the map in a time limit. The implementation of this objective in particular ends up making it feel almost impossible to beat, and generally kills my enthusiam for continuing if paired with a horrible map and a bad penalty. Take home message to devs, hard is fun, challenging is funner, but punishing (i.e. player gets penalized with no agency and no ability to mitigate damage) is just asking for patience, not enjoyment. TL;DR -      Great game, worth a purchase (will immediatly buy next game) and recomended to be played after first. Endgame suffers from several flaws (feels like devs made it planning for everyone to have maxed out gear, nothing less) and it is deeply recomended by myself to start on casual (normal is not normal, normal is hard). All in all, worth the money though I'd say wait for a sale if you're unsure. Fans of the first will love it though, and if you are it's worth a full purchase.			"

												After enjoying the first game I picked this game up cheaply with all the DLC during a sale and its worth every penny. Having played through it only recently (Oct 2014) I didnt experience any problems or crashes at all so I'm assuming all the issues mentioned in other reviews have been patched.  The game feels very similar to the 1st and retains the witty dialogue and great maps, mobs and combat.  A quality well game that I feel deserves the full price so anything less is a no-brainer !

												This game is incredibly boring! Story is very short, the world is very small.All areas are prebuilt and never change, even scenarios use the same maps from the story mode with quest objects removed, usually populated by the same enemies. Only global conditions (buffs/debuffs) to players and enemies and area objectives change (that's not enough).Difficulty in this game means large enemy numbers with high health. There is only two types of enemies (they only look different) melee or ranged and they often spawn smaller minions non stop, that's it! As a result the game will always put you to sleep from being too easy, or if you raise the difficulty, from monotonous neverending battles.The game is filled with countless pop culture references some are funny and seamlessly incorporated, but vast majority is just too obvious and bland, to the point of being simple word to word quotes - very boring.It looks decent, and should appeal to all who like Victorian steampunk, but again that's not nearly enough.PS: If you are still interested, buy it during deeply discounted sale, and do not buy any DLC for it, they are of the worst kind (the kind that does not add or improve anything, and provides more of the same at even lower quality than the game itself).

												One of my favorite rpg adventure games; I didn't expect to like it this much. Honestly one of the biggest perks for me is the flexability of the game; you can change the difficulty at any time, and you can die without being hit with super big consequences, which takes the pressure off having to do really well. The later difficulties are challenging without being over the top, and strategy plays a big part on whether you win in fights or not; there's more to it than just having a high level or good armor. Other things I liked about the game; fast paced and interesting storyline, lots of features, a good array of weapons/equipment, interesting skill trees. I found the gameplay to be fun and interesting.strong perk: you can change your skills and stats repeatedly!!!biggest negative I found is the multiplayer has been hard to find other players for.			"

												I am only at the beginning of the game but I can say I really enjoying this. For 10 euro you receive game worth of much more. Great graphics and lot of options make this game highly replayable. Quest seems to be variable (protect, follow, kill, survive, push some buttons). Even if it is more Hack n' Slash RPG, dialogues are very funny and not very long and boring. What I really like is atmosphere of this game. Story telling, voices, locations really create amazing atmosphere of ""monster slayer"". I can only recommend, it is definitely worth of money.			"

												Seems like a decent game if you have a good computer, but do not trust the steam page's system requirments or even recomended. I have a computer that is just sporting slightly higher than the recomended power and even on the lowest settings the game can not be handled on large levels like the second one. I was really anticipating this game but now it is near impossible to play because of jumpy gameplay and visual cinematics that run slower than their audio even on a computer that is better than the minimum and recomended system requirements.

												so, now they patched the worst bug and I finally can play it to the end. still some bugs remaining, still haven't try multiplayer, but eventually  - it's enjoyable.unfortunately after starting scenario maps, the game is crashing all the time. so back with ""no recommendation"" :( I have played this over 80 hours, so you could guess I like this game... but most of the time I was angry because of some bug or crash :(EARLIER OPINION:I envy the people writing positive reviews on this game. Like the first volume, it's enjoyable and I'd like to spend hours accomplishing achievements, but I can't - there are bugs I didn't find solution for :( Monsters in the tower defense mini game didn't spawn and in third chapter I'm missing a story-moving person... Only thing I found is I'm not alone with this problem and e-mail support is NOT RESPONDING. So what to do? I have played it more than is acceptable for refund, so uninstall and forget? This is like beta version, still they're selling third installment. Glad I didn't buy that too as I wanted.  If you really want diablo-like game, buy torchlight II!P.S.: I better didn't try multiplayer which is in MANY reviews bugged as well... And don't even think you can run this game on ""minimum requirement"" PC! I have an old one but still high above minimum and it runs badlyEdit: Seems like they started to patch the bugs I encountered. If these bugs will disappear, I will definitely change my rating to ""thumb up"", but still - IMO it's not OK to patch the game after year and after releasing next installment of the series!			"

												If you liked the first Van Helsing, then you will probably like this. The story isn't very imaginative, but they never are in these action RPGs. There are a lot of funny lines though, or at least I thought so... I like Katarina the ghost companion and her sense of humor. Plenty of references to movies, TV shows, other games, etc, and I probably missed a few.There are some new game mechanics introduced here that weren't in VH1, but the main gameplay is basically the same. I imported my character from VH1 and played through on the veteran mode.			"

												At this point, I'm kind of roped into the series. I was able to play the first one for free and the second one was dirt cheap during a sale. With that said, this isn't a game for the weak. You will face HORDES of enemies on screen at all times. You are easily overpowered but, luckily, there are many ways around these battles. The main characters are charming but nothing great. One is a famous hunter of the land and the other is his ghost sidekick (sounds like a tv show honestly). The storyline is pretty cut and dry with a twist you can see coming from 10 minutes in. Regarding it as a sequel, I felt pretty disappointed. There wasn't too many differences between the gameplay styles of 1 and 2. I wasn't expected a completely different game but it would have been nice to add some new ideas. They do try to do a sort of ""tower defense"" mixed with delegation of commanders and soliders but it never felt really satisfying. I felt like I just did everything I did in 1 for this one.Overall, I do recommened if you like the dungeon crawler genre with an easy to follow but not grand story.			"

												Splendid game! Enjoyed every bit of it. It does have some technical hiccups, it crashed about 5 times in ~18h of gameplay but I've lost at most 5 min of progress. The music, the atmosphere, the visuals are all good and special. I know this is not the best hack&slash out there but it is very good. The best part are the easter eggs, I hope there are some left for the next game :). Oh and Katarina, she is great as always.			"

												Mindless (mostly) addictive fun.  A good sequel, a couple of times I thought ""oh no! not more tower defense!"" but it was done well and was easy enough to be a fun diversion.Thoroughly recommended if ARPG are your thing			"

												Van Helsing 2 is a fun ARPG that doesn't take itself too seriously.			"

												Reason why I brought this game:  to find ARPG to replace D3Hours on D3:  2500 approximatelyGraphics:  decent, a bit low on spells / effects compare to D3Voice acting & storyline:  great job done here, I enjoyed it way more than D3 which actually disgusted me on how they killed of cain and other varies stuffGameplay overall:  smooth most of the time, skills and gears are much more flexible than D3 which REQUIRES you to have specific drops, otherwise you will need to farm for years on end..Game definitely have a lot more to offer than D3: REAPER OF SOULS, scenarios vs rift / grift are much more fun; challenging; and sophisticated.  I did not regret getting this game, and are very satisfied with it.			"

												I have windows 8 64bit. There have been issues with it not starting up. I have reached to support constantly day after day. They have only suggested what is already on the support forums. It has been months since my first email and they have only responded twice. I was so excited to play the game but support offers no help and doesn't even respond anymore. I literally had to keep opening the game and get the error message to get to the 5 minutes of ""gametime"" to post this review. Game really reminds me of the Diablo 2, that being said, if you are a fan of that, get this game!EDIT: neocore games was able to help me fix 64bit support and now the game works!			"

												The game itself is great, however the negative review is for the support. I've made 3x carecters each gotten to lvl 35/37 and the game crashes on the same level once i attack an enemy. ive tried to follow all the fixes offered on the forumns and nothing is helping. so essentualy ive spend money on a great game that i can only play untill lvl 35 -.-.

												Very fun game but it feels a bit rushed, the end comes almost suddenly and leaves you with a cliffhanger and a plot twist you could see from the beginning. I really liked the Tower Defence mini-games and the overall setting of the game, but there are things that are just plain unfinished(broken item description on a few ocassions being just one of those things). I would highly recommend this game but on a sale, if you get it cheap you can have solid 12-15 hours of fun on your first run, enjoy.			"
