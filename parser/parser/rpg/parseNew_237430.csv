												Never before has a game made me so thoroughly enjoy my entirely voluntary descent into being an incredibly horrible person.I am the very picture of the RPG player that cannot help but pick the nicest choice whenever given the chance, but over the course of this game, I razed an innocent village, torched farmland, looted temples and historic sites, instigated civil war, committed murder for my own convenience, all so that I might amass as much gold as possible.I could have stopped. I could have turned away. I could have done differently. I didn't have to do it.As I ordered my men to shoot down fleeing civilians, shaking in terror, I began to appreciate the magnitude of my own awfulness. A sense of guilt settled over me. Certain choices became harder to make. I did not, in the end, descend fully into brutality. I remembered mercy. I acted as kindly as I could manage.And yet it was too late. The bodies of the fallen littered the streets. The blood of the Aztec dyed the earth of Mexico. Upon my return to Spain, I was hailed as a hero.Yet even now, I cannot help but feel that in the end I was the villain.Truly a marvellous game. I cannot recommend it enough.			"

												A very solid strategy-RPG that does more or less everything well, and some things outstandingly so. Cons: - 20 to 30-hour game, it's just long enough to feel like an adventure. But the challenge helps make up for that.- The battles are all premade, which somewhat limits replay value. But many battles have different approaches and you can choose your team.- Most of the team members don't have any character-specific dialogue, it's based on their class and/or traits.- Managing rations/food processing gets to be a chore, especially if you're giving some people double rations.Pros: - Fitting and immersive soundtrack, good battle themes.- Very good writing, extremely important in a game like this.- Meaningful roleplaying choices which affect the resource management, the battles and the endings.- Well-balanced difficulty on Normal settings.- Good artstyle and tidy presentation. Nothing mindblowing but very fitting for a semi-historical RPG.So overall, if you like what you see on the store page and it'll run on your system, get it. I bought it at like 5 times what it costs now that it's bundled and I don't regret it, because it's worth a good bit more than a buck. Looking forward to more Expeditions games, and I know I'll come back to this one sometime.			"

												I was surprised by this indie offering. It's like a combination of X-COM combat, Oregan trail challenges and exploration, with the writing and personaltiy of earlier RPGs like Fallout. This makes for a unique mix.One of the core features of this game is selecting your party not just for their abilities but for their personality. The various personalities will adjust encounters and inform your game play. You can feel the difference when two other wise identical hunters are seen from the lens of which is more annoyingly pious.The game also includes an Iron Man mode to keep you honest from save scumming. Which isn't necessary any ways because the designers actually plan for failure. They know you might lose an important or trivial battle and it isn't always lights out or game over like in many other games. For example I actually failed to finish one of the major plot points for the 1st half of the game and things just kept on rolling. Success and deafeat are in equal measures here.I have three negative points for the game. First while exploring is fun the camera is just too close and so constantly using the map and it's way points is a must for quick travel. My second complaint concerns a small aspect of the combat. Melee combat is much stronger than ranged combat and the guns you brought from Spain have weak damage and a chance to miss. The random encounters on the trail can be very harsh and given enough time you'll get a nasty surprise- also some times the consequences of a choice are not even remotely made clear and so there can be some crazy sticker shock (like instagibs).Even still this is a good game. I actually think it's worth the $19.99 at full retail and it's very impressive they put this much depth in to a game that pulled in only $77,000 on kickstarter. I finished my first play around 25 - 28 hours doing most of the content in the game. This game has replayability in many of the events and even multiple endings that acknowledge the things that you did during the game and not just at the very end.			"

												Expeditions: Conquistador is an explorative, somewhat open world, turn-based combat game.  You play as a Spanish ""capitan"" of a ship requisitioned by the governor of Santo Domingo while trying to explore the mainland of the New World.  For those of you who enjoy games like Heroes of Might and Magic, and the Princess Bounty series, this game will feel right at home to you--with a large emphasis of Oregon Trail (remember that game in the 90's?).As captain of a ship (that you don't have anymore), you start by handpicking followers for your expedition, judging by roles, personality types, and equipment that they bring with them.  There are five roles in the game--soldiers, hunters, scouts, doctors, and scholars--each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  Personality types can range anywhere from aggressive to peacefulness, to racism to openmindedness, and many more.  Will this person fit into your group of misfits?  Will Fernando get along with Teresa?  And what will Pedro bring to your crew?  Is he worth the extra ration per night?  With a well-balanced crew, your chances of survival increase tenfold.Expeditions: Conquistador leaves a lot of questions you will be asking yourself, and gives you a great sense of adventure you long for in many games.  While travelling through the mainland, you find points of interests, complete quests for people, and explore, explore, explore.  When you are out of movement points, which happens oh-so-often, and can get very tedious, you set up camp for the night and set tasks for your followers to complete throughout the night.  Perhaps some followers will guard the camp from thieves/animals, while others hunt for food, while one person preserves food, or makes medicines.  And if and when you get into combat, it's a very challenging, risk+reward style of turn-based combat.When I say very challenging, I mean it.  This game is very difficult--but in a fun way.  Every decision you make in the open world can and WILL affect your expedition.  Injuries, and even deaths, will most certainly happen.  And if you do not treat an injured follower with a doctor, the follower will eventually get worse, and possibly perish.  If you succeed with quests, you gain experience and equipment, which you can use to eventually promote recruits to veterans and leaders, and upgrading their outdated equipment.Expeditions: Conquistador is a fantastic game for its money, and will keep you playing for a very long time (the main campaign will take OVER 20-30 hours on average), and also has decent replayability.  As a captain, it is a lot of work to keep your group in good spirits as you fend off natives and other Spaniards as you search for the treasures of the New World.  Although at times the game can get a little monotonous with camping, it throws you for loops as the quest advances.I strongly recommend this game.  8.4/10			"

												I was a few hours into this game, and thouroughly enjoying it when everything started to turn brown. I had created an awesome all female squad.We had slaughtered many and completed a handful of quests. Unfortunately my doctor died early on but I had been making do without her. I was a reasonable distance from the main city when a few of my girls fell ill. I was treating them best I could, until a terrible event occured. Isabella had been kidnapped by a cult and they were going to sacrifice her in a fortnight. I headed towards her location as fast as I could but I got caught unawares and several battles later more of my girls had fallen ill. I was running out of medicine, and time. I finally got near her location, but my time had run out. I feared the worst for poor Isabella, while I was struggling to keep half my team from falling fatally ill. I only had just enough healthy comrades left to battle, the rest I was juggling medicine between. I finally made it to the shrine and it was most definiately too late. Her cold corpse was lain out on the altar and I had a hard battle ahead of me. Somehow we made it through the fight, with my favourite, Rosalia left standing. We quickly tried to trace our steps out of the mountains to get back to the city. Many of my girls had died and the rest were critically ill. unfortunately we went the wrong way and before we could even get close, the remainder of my sick left my command, as morale was low from seeing so many others die. Rosalia was all I had left. We still had a few days travel ahead of us, but before we could make it, we were ambushed by tribal warriors and they murdered her before my eyes. I was defeated.Great game, and I lost on easy XD Highly recommended			"

												A surprise hit in my book and a much belated review, I meant to write this up a while back. Expeditions:Conquistador is the kind of kind of game that sits in your backlog for months and when you finally get around to playing it you realise what you've been missing out on.There's a solid hex-tile based battle system at work here- employing line of sight, cover and flanking mechanics married with a variety of different mission objectives. In some battles the odds are truly stacked against your team, both in numbers and positioning - every encounter feels fresh and satisfying, particularly when you take down key characters during pivotal moments in the narrative. The game boasts a strong musical score throughout the adventure, helping to set and underline the mood during key moments in the game and it ties together the overall package beautifully.The events system is where Expeditions:Conquistador truly shines, employing excellent writing with plenty of flavour and flair sprinkled throughout, easily on par with, if not exceeding the beloved triple A darlings of the industry. As you'd expect there are skill checks locking out certain character builds from particular actions. A great deal of flexibility is afforded to the player in how they choose to roleplay their character and you see the consequences of your actions and attitude reflected throughout the game, with allies becoming enemies and vice versa as you strike out across the continent - you really get a good sense of agency as you progress through the game. There's a good amount of narrative branching, particularly in the second campaign, even if some of it is just for flavour it's incentive to revisit the game and see things play out different at a later date.My only gripes with the game are the camera is too close whilst navigating around the map and it only pulls back so far, panning the camera is also more restrictive that I would have liked. Neither of these issues really hampered my experience with the game. I'll be there day one when the developers release a sequel to this; they've more than proven themselves on all fronts.			"

												One hell of a game about the conquest/exploration/discovery of the new world. The game lets you roleplay the kind of Conquistador you want to be and the story/plot/characters are believable and done very well with great portraits. The strategy aspect is top notch as well. Basically anyone that likes roleplay/adventure/strategy/exploration games can't miss out on this one. It truly is greater than the sum of its part. Feels old school in the best possible way. Great gameplay and personality.			"

												First things first: Expeditions: Conquistador its NOT a game for everybody. It is a HARD game with LOADS of text and a dense historical and political context. If you dont enjoy reading walls of text and cant handle defeat stay away from this game.That said, I'll list the pros and cons and at the end give my overall opinion:Pros:- Rich, interesting and unexplored historical setting. For lovers of history (like me) this game came as a refreshing breeze.- Combat is well developed, complex but fun though it gets repetive over time. But its HARD, especially because the tutorial doesn't cover it very well. It took me about 3 or 4 hours of gameplay to effectively understand how to use the medic in battles and I can't say I mastered all the other 10 classes.- Beautifully written story and quests that makes you feel involved with the game, with your own character and your companions, thus making the huge walls of text actually a pleasure to enjoy. The writters picked up the historical atmosphere and the political complexities of Precolumbian Mexico really well (apart the female conquistadores, seriously?!). Previous historical knowledge about the Spanish Conquest of Mexico is recommended for the utmost fun though the game presents you very well with the minimum necessary for enjoyment.- Pretty interesting camping and resource micro-management. Not only the mechanics are very good but it also fits pretty well with the whole setting of the game.- Your choices DO matter! Not much for the story development in itself but for your party morale (covered in the next item)- Companions are very well written, each with an unique personality and historical background. This influences the way they will react to your decisions. Managing their different personalities and maintaining an overall high morale is essential for sucess in combat, making party management a vital part of the game. I just missed an option to directly talk to a companion, instead of waiting for random events with or about them to pop up.- Nice Soundtrack. Not really a masterpiece but fits well with the overall climate.Cons:- Graphics are simple for a 2013 game. I recon this is an indie game with limited budget but in my opinion they really could've been better, especially in the world map.- As I've said, this game is HARD. One random event or one small mistake in battle or in camp management can ♥♥♥♥ up an entire gameplay. This can be very demotivating for most players and it is especially painful when added to the bad auto-save mechanics.- Camera movement and trees. You will spend most of your time in the world map and the  top-down camera has its center always locked in your character. This hugely discourage exploring by making it very painful to see things far from your position. Wouldn't be a big deal IF collecting food, herbs etc from the map WASN""T essential to survive (There's a console code that unlocks the camera). Also trees not becoming transparent when you get near them can hide important collectables from your view. - Bumping into enemies. When walking through the world map, you will sometime bump into an enemy patrol or hunting party. Sometimes you will have the option to not engage them. If you do so, after finishing the event, they still stay in your path and touching them makes the same event pop up again forcing you to fight them or to make a detour for progressing. This is a serious issue as even the easiest looking combat can turn into a complete disaster with one or two small tactical mistakes.- Autosave: As said, this game is very hard and to add it up the autosave mechanic is very strange. I myself havent yet figured out how it works, so its safer to manually save often. Back in the days of Ultima and Breath of Fire this wouldn't be a flaw, but nowdays, in my opinion, it is.Overall: Expeditions: Conquistador is a GREAT game for an indie company. It offers a lot of entertainment for it's pricing tag and it was a great efort by the guys at Logic Artists to delivery a solid and enjoyable game. Its cons are hugely surpassed by the pros and makes it a must buy for RPG, turn based combat and/or historical settings fans. Just keep in mind that this game is HARD and has LOTS of text in it before buying. 9/10			"

												This game is awesome for its kind. It's a strategic RPG that shares gameplay similarities with Heroes of Might & Magic. Except this one is more dialogue and story oriented than building castles and armies. The graphics are pretty simple but it doesn't take away the charm of the adventure one bit! The storytelling is what makes it all interesting. It will constantly require you to make decisions, be it for small matters of social nature or serious issues and military tatics. And it does it so well it makes you feel you're reading an adventure book, even when you fail or makes decision mistakes.As you can see on the screenshots, the action part is turn based and takes place on tactical hexa-shaped checker boards. Each unit has its skills, and you better put them to good use during combats or specialize them in order to handle any situation. Strong defensive units, sharpshooters, doctors, fast skirmishers or even tinkers to set traps and covers on the battlefield. It feels very rewarding to win a battle because of a right unit composition, preparation or placement.The RPG elements are there too, from a handful of survival skills to large sets of combat abilities you can give to each of your men. And these men and women also have to be chosen carefully! Every NPC in this adventure has its own convictions, interests or goals. The religious companions won't get along very well with the native culture or those who embrace it. The fame-seeking soldiers won't like your diplomatic solutions to conflicts. Some romances might also happen! It will all depend of your choices and how you want to explore the New World. It is your expedition story that is being told, here.The only things i could wish from the developpers are more languages support (although it was already very enjoyable in english! But since the game is very text-based, it might be hard for some others to follow), and... SEQUELS! Imagine that game set in the Crusades? or the Silk road? or the Japanese islands discovery? With a good storytelling, these explorations could take place anywhere!			"

												In this game you are a Spanish Conquistador. You can choose if you want to trade and intermix with the natives, or if you want to brutally kill them, rob them and burn their villages!For that you get to choose you followers, which can be racist or open-minded, greedy or altruistic, pious or narcisistic, peacefull or agressive, etc.There are several classes of followers, like soldiers, hunters and doctors, and when you gain experience you get to promote them, giving them more abilities to help you in the game.The game is based in the exploration of the main map, with battles every time you encounter someone and don't get the chance (or don't want to) deal with them peacefully or run away.The battles are turn based, and the goals can be to kill every enemy or just to survive a certain number of turns. Most of the times you can set up barricades and traps, or use items like torches and lanterns to set the scenery on fire! The AI is not to clever, but as you are regularly outnumbered these battles turn up to be quite chalenging. You get to manage your resources, like food and medicine, and if you run out of them, you're in big trouble as you can't feed or heal your people!In the course of the game you'll have many dialogues, with your followers or with other characters, and the decisions you take in those dialogues (wheter to fight or trade, wheter to punish anyone or leave him alone) have influence on the morale of your followers. If this gets too low they will rebel!All in all a very engaging game that puts you in place of a Conquistador, trying to win glory and fame!			"

												It's a brilliant game, one of the most enjoyable I have played in a long time.As a conquistador, the story involves exploration (of the new world). The mechanic for this is similar to early Final Fantasy games, in particular FFVII. In the exploration facet, you can collect herbs, treasure and hunt boar as well as other resources with which you can create tools to help in battle. These resources can also be used in a barter system at settlements. New locations can be found in which you can meet new settlements and peoples. Meeting people is fun as the game provides a multiple choice story driven dynamic. Your choices, how you interact with the natives, determines your fate and how the story evolves. I was really happy with the choice as it involves you much more in the story and really allows you to play how you like. Diplomacy really is an element in the game in terms of which factions you want to eventually align yourself with (if you want to at all).As well as multiple choice in dealing with other tribes etc. you must also manage your own crew! You choose your troops at the outset and this is also well done. Each person is given a backstory, general stats and three determining personality attributes i.e. Courageous, Open-Minded, Greedy. The characters all have morale which is affected by your choices in the game - greedy followers would gain morale from stealing from someone for instance while others may lose morale from that.   Therefore your relations with the natives will also have an effect, be it positive or negative, on your troops. As mentioned, you harvest herbs, find treasure and hunt boar in the exploration mode but your troops will need to be carefully selected to manage your resources.  Doctors and certain other characters can create medicine from herbs while your hunters can preserve meat. You can also 'tinker' to improve elements such as rate of travel or items whcih will help in battle. Characters can be levelled as you like however. So, there is a lot of mini management involved in the game outside of exploration or battle - one must be strategic. If you make bad strategic decisions the game can be very unforgiving, even on a normal difficulty setting. Finally, battle! Having explained other elements at some length, I will be brief here - it is essentially turn based strategy. If you have played and enjoyed The Banner Saga or X-Com: Enemy Unknown, you will enjoy this. Fundamentally the mechanic is the same though it is very well done.I loved this game - 9/10. Very much hope the developers have a follow up to this in the near future. The system would allow for any theme or universe to be applied - Medieval Europe, Zombie Apocalypse(!), Classical Era (Romans) etc. though I understand the most likely follow up will involve Vikings. It seems the developers want to keep with a 'Expedition' (i.e. coloniser) theme so Zombies are probably out!			"

												I harbored no illusions about what it meant for us to explore the New World. Exploration is first and foremost a conquerer's act - over nature herself, if not the natives who inevitably resist the tides of change. I was a soldier, with senses long inured to the stench of blood, and I chose my companions accordingly. I needed grim warriors. None pious. We were not missionaries. I wanted the aggressive sorts, those fueled by bloodlust and goldlust. Nevermind I found their racism and greed distasteful. They were exactly what would be necessary in the heart of the jungle.My choices proved apt, as Mexico was as treacherous as I feared. In those wild lands, we were alone. My predecessor, a man commanding a force of hundreds, had come here and vanished. He had made mistakes. I knew I could afford none.When my servants rebelled, I slew them to a man. I would not have them slitting our throats as we slept. After defeating a native patrol, I might have spared them. These young men and women were only defending their lands from strangers in shining armor. I left none alive, none to report back to their village about our arms, numbers, and tactics.Again and again, I had to face the hard choice between surrendering my tactical advantage and attempting a diplomatic solution. Always I chose to strike swiftly and decisively. Yes I killed where peace might have availed me. But what if it had not? What if those peaceful overtures had led to ambush? I had a duty to my soldiers. They looked to me to keep them alive. That is what I did.Yet the land soon began to work its magic on me. There was a vivacity here that could not be found in Spain's stone streets. The people possessed an earthly wisdom and a refreshingly naive curiosity. Many welcomed us openly, asking about our ways and our lands. They were, it turns out, not so different from us, finding joy in a good meal and a bountiful harvest.We found common ground with the Totonac peoples, and sided with them in their rebellion against the Aztecs, true barbarians whose temples ran slick with the blood of pagan sacrifice. I allowed the Totonac Chieftain's teenage daughter, Anacaona, into my group to serve as translator. She stayed by my side throughout. I taught her to wield sword, spear, and musket. I shared our language and our ways. She was ever eager to listen to my stories, and each night as we camped in the swamps and jungles, I told her of past battles. Her eyes shone with the fires of these remembered glories, and a hope for her own.Of all of us, she was the truest and best adventurer. It was she who translated the glyphs on a golden gateway and led us into the legendary El Dorado, that shining City of Gold. It was she who manuevered through the temple of death's diabolical traps, braving a pit of snakes to uncover mounds of treasure. Without her, we would never have found the Fountain of Eternal Youth, which spring must have originated in Heaven itself.Ah, Anacaona. She became the daughter I had always wanted.It must have broke her heart when, following our triumphant battle over the Aztec Empire, I turned on her father and slew him in the same garden I had killed the Emperor. I know it broke mine when she chose him over me.I buried her with mine own hands, outside Tenochtitlan, its plundered temples and palaces alit with devilish infernos.I had been given a duty and an obligation, and I had fulfilled it to my utmost. I returned home with every companion but she still alive. Our ship held such treasure that it bobbed low in the water, our hold bursting with plundered gems. The king welcomed me home a hero, bestowing upon me lands and titles. My ambitions fulfilled.Yet as I sit on my estate, watching the sun plunge beneath my tamed fields, I discover that somewhere along the way, my ambitions had changed. The jungle had transmuted them. The glory, the riches, the titles: all hollow now. I would give them all in order to go back and make a different decision. To choose the path of peace, so that Anacaona might have lived.As a child, I thought the title Conquistador a grand one and never imagined I would hold it. As an old man, I carry it with a heavy heart. I will take it with me to the grave. Murderer. Betrayer. Conquistador.			"

												This RPG/Strategy mix is basically turn based and will see you wandering around Hispaniola and Mexico shortly before Cortez. You will explore the land and meet its people as well as would-be conquerors and colonists, gather resources, receive and complete quests and you will even be able to rebuild an old fort as your stronghold. Every turn represents a day during which you will be able to move between 25-40 movement points on the map and then you have to set up camp. During camp you will hunt for food, make medicine, heal wounded or sick team members, and look out for thieves. The combat is also turn-based and can be quite challenging. The first 1/4 (roughly) of the game will play in Hispaniola. Consider this an (extended) tutorial. After you finish this, you will be able to move to the mainland which is larger (while not incredibly large). Whether you play a really nice guy, i.e. just map the area and help out where you can, or engage heavily in the struggle between two native realms on the mainland, and play them out against each other, or simply raid and plunder is up to you.While the game has some flaws and limited replayability, it is fun and creates a nice atmosphere. This is partly because the members of your band (around 10 or 12) will react differently to each play style, they will be Spanish or Native, peace-loving or warlike etc. and they have at least one personalized event. The game illustrates that there are sometimes difficult ethical decisions to make. To look for clues from a lost conquistador with limited food and medicine and several wounded team members in a hostile area is also intriguing. One thing is for sure: King Carlos wants you to come back with a lot of money or he will be disappointed!I will add some hints that will make your start hopefully less frustrating:- get 2 doctors, because if you have only one and he is sick, you´re *****ed- I also suggest 2 hunters, while 1 scholar should be enough- researching the cart upgrade will make you move faster- you should not camp on roads but 1-2 tiles left or right from it instead- the promoted soldiers give the very useful ""stun"" bonus- you need to get the skull- if in doubt, let Ana Vidal charge :) I fully recommend this game while it is on sale, if the full price of 19,99 is justified I cannot judge. All in all: Yruenes is kind of cute! Ana Vidal, on the other hand, can fight! 9/10!			"

												This game is a turn based, setting/story driven strategy game with minor rpg elements.Whats good:- Battle and exploration mechanics work fairly well- Interesting ressource management system- Actual impact of your own decision is felt/seen/aknowledged- Battle is challenging- Several different ways to play through the game - Several different endings- Your Units actually matter (as your decision has an impact on the moral of your units, depending on their own character; racist characters do not take it well, if you are nice to the natives etc.)- Interactive part is fairly big (as having different units will end with different random events/reactions)- The character system with exp/equipment/injurys etc. is fairly good and motivatingWhats bad:- The random factor of battles is at times high, making them either too easy or too hard, if you have bad/good luck- The pace of the game is fairly slow- The mechanic breaks down at the end, as you will have more than enough ressources and very strong unites- Not all unit types are equal. Some excel in the explorative mode (as they are usfull for gathering etc.) Some excel in combat...but some do both or neither. Scholoars are only important to get 1 to tinkering 10 and for some events. While hunters can gather food and fight well.Additional:The spanish conquistator setting is very well done. It might not be for everyone, but i liked it :)Yes its historically inacurate, but i do not believe that that was the aim of the devs to begin with:)Too long - didn't read:If you like exploration, combat and a tad bit of rpg in a challanging turn based game set in the times of the spanish conquistators, feel free to buy this one :)			"

												Amazing turn-based combat game with an overworld map.  While some people will probably want to relate it to Baldur's Gate (1 or 2), and they wouldn't be wrong in doing so, I felt that it was more akin to the old Microprose diamond ""Darklands"".  This game is a love song to tactics, RNG gambling, out-of-combat roleplaying, and legit 'not completely made up' history.  The game is amazing, and the second I started playing, I was hooked.  Team based strategy like this with fortress building and empire building?  I'm sorry, did I just describe Conquistador: XCOM?  ""Mexicans spotted, Commander!""			"

												Don´t let the title fool you, this is really a very entertaining old school RPG. Playing as a young spaniard, you arrive in a tropical wilderness where you explore, battle, use diplomacy and above all survive,  far away from civilization. Combat works the same as XCOM with turn-based attacks and many choices. Even ordinary travel offers a lot of challenge as you need to help your conquistadors survive against native attacks, disease, starvation and more.If you like a real hard-core RPG with lots of detail and challenge, don´t hesitate....BUY!(P.S. Don't miss the sequel, it has VIKINGS!)			"

												I've never written a review on Steam but this game made me feel obliged to write. I may only have played E:C for 4 hours but in all of my 25+ years of gaming I have not come across such a game. Kudos to the developers! A heady blend of RPG, Turn based combat and exploration unlike any out there in the market. What really shines through, though, is the text intensive interactions between You and each party member. The conversations, although scripted, has enough choices to make the story seem seamless. I'm really looking forward to playing more of this and any similar efforts from this Dev team.Edit: I've had more playtime on this game and so far it has been challenging even on 'Normal' level. My biggest problem has been keeping my men (and women!) happy, motivated, disease free and in fighting order. The moment any of the party members get even mildly hurt or sick he or she cannot perform ANY of the Camp chores and this leaves the party shorthanded, especially if you find yourself in areas where the threats (either from the natives or thieves) are HIGH. This often leads to frustration when your carefully husbanded resources disappear overnight. I also feel that the Healing process is well implemented though probably too realistic and very taxing on Medicine supplies. More to come!			"

												Brilliant. Unusual setting. Overworld reminiscent of Heroes of Might and Magic. Tactical turn-based combat a la XCOM. RPG dialog sequences bordering on interactive fiction story-telling. Party members with their own unique backstories, personalities, and RPG-style levelling.I have found that if you suffer a few devastating defeats in battle in short succession, you will be unable to recover due to the loss of your party members, but the game won't put your out of your misery straight away and will draw out your inevitable demise. So, you may have to do a bit of save-scumming before/after every battle.If you like video games, you owe it to yourself to give this a go.			"

												A mix of a rogue-like RPG and turn based strategy. The game's mechanics are very similar to heroes of might and magic (more akin to King's Bounty - I, however never played this game), but instead of controlling castles and creature growth, you control a single hero and must explore the new world in order to obtain resources and riches, make alliances with locals and explore many sites.The story of the game is very compelling. Although most of it is text-based, without voice acting (well, this is an indie game, not a high budged AAA title), the writing is very well done. The choices you make affect the world you're exploring and also influence your companions attitudes. Depending on your choices, you can be ruthless, greedy, peaciful, just etc, all according to your playing style.All characters' stories are unique, although the character interaction occurs randomly and sparingly. Some of the quest-related companions are more colorful and tend to have more ""screentime"" than your normal characters. Most, however, tends to disappear after their related quests complete.The combat is very balanced and most units have its own advantages and disadvantages. Most of the time, however, I used almost the same party, a composition of soldiers, hunters and a healer. Soldiers acts as your tanks, absorving damage and delivering high melee damage. Hunters do little damage, but are very flexible tactically and can be used for quickly disposing the enemy healers. Sometimes I could experience some other party combinations, using scouts and native troops, but my first lineup seemed to be sufficient to win most battles. Some units are just weird to use, such as scholars. The native troops are very interesting and have very unique strategies related to them. The amazon unit, for example, are exceptional damage dealers but can absorve very little damage. The only weakness of this system is the AI. sometimes it makes very stupid decisions such as having its healer to seek one of your soldiers on the battlefield and fight him in melee or running wildly through your units provoking atacks of opportunity. Most of the time, however, it makes reasonable decisions such as seeking your weakest units to kill first, and looking for flanks and sneak atacks. I believe the AI performed much better during ambushes than in traditional battles - the first ones were very difficult while the others very easy. But considering how difficult is to program a good game AI and comparing to other available titles, this game performs well.Overall, the tactical part of the game is very well made, and if you are a tactical junkie like me, you will just love it.The party management mechanics is nice, all characters must do some task in order to obtain food and other resources. After some hours, however, this party management becomes a chore, since it requires a lot of micro management, or you will end up consuming a lot of food or having your goods stolen.In summary, expeditions conquistador is a very good indie game, delivering a high quality experience  with a short budget. The story is very nice but character development could be improved. The tactics part of the game is very enjoyable, while the party management is a bit repetitive.			"

												Surprising gem! I picked this up on sale and got sucked right in.  If you like games like XCOM or FF: tactics, you'll like this too.  My only gripes: sometimes the interfaces is picky about exactly where your cursor needs to be in able to select a hex tile in combat. Also, the design of the interface can make it easy to have the wrong follower or item selected when you do select a tile, occasionally causing you to accidentally set your squad on fire when you just wanted to move a follower.  Those are just annoyances, however.  This is a fantastic tactical subjugation sim.			"

												I am totally hooked by this gem's unique blend of tactical combat, leadership, logistics, history. You basically select your team of explorers/conquistadores choosing them by specialty (soldiers/hunters/scouts/doctors/technicians) and land with limited resources on the new world, interacting (often fighting) with the natives and all manners of events. Meanwhile you have to keep your team fed and motivated, which is easier said than done, sinc literally EVERYONE has their agendas, desires, expectation, religious views etc. Combat is handled very much a la ""Blackguards"". Their is a very nice element of improving through experiences, with a well thought out  skill tree (different for each specialty).  The logistic and strategic aspects of the game are unlike anyther I know of. I am enjoying it immensely, but I realize that if you are not at least a bit into micromanagement, this game might turn you off.			"

												Expeditions: Conquistador is a hidden treasure of a game that rewards the stalwart explorer. It deftly combines role-playing, strategy and survival mechanics into a unique gameplay experience enriched and informed immensely by its rarely explored setting. Cast in the role of a Spanish Conquistador arriving in the New World you choose from a wide selection of personalities to form your expedition and set off into Mexico to find glory. The environment is harsh and survival is a concern but the moral choices you are presented with are the most troubling dilemmas. You have the freedom and burden of choice in whether to exploit the native civilizations or forge alliances, supress pagan culture or study it, seek riches or pursue nobler ideals.Equal parts Fallout, X-Com and Oregon Trail, every strategy aspect interconnects seamlessly. The setting is fascinating, the characters and events memorable and the combat system robust. A solid twenty five plus hour experience that never stopped surprising and left me wanting MORE.			"

												Very fertile and off-the-beaten path, this Conquistador-focused setting. Don't think I'll ever see a game set partly in Hispaniola ever again. In short, I recommend it. Fights happen a little bit less often than one would think, but not by much and the fighting that's there is oodles of fun if you're prepared.The game is definitely half-and-half combat and setting though, perhaps leaning ever-so-slightly towards the setting side. The battles are XCOM-like and the overworld map is Mount and Blade-like, however it can be harder than both those games. Battles are much less reliant on RNG (save for Hunters/Trappers whom use guns/bows) and you must camp in the overworld when your troops get tired. I will say this now: do NOT just go through the main storyline quests on Hispaniola. Do the side quests. Otherwise you will lose **horribly** for a while and you will **not** be ready for the mainland when you reach it. Enemies almost always match or better you in quality AND quantity save for the odd encounter.What you SHOULD do first of all though?Buy the game.			"

												A great turn based RPG in a low fantasy setting. The combat isn't as complex as XCOM's for example, but it's equally fun and rewarding, the story is well rounded and the game has incredible artwork and a equally incredible soundtrack. The game brings out around 30 hours of gameplay, but sadly the fights and events are all scripted, so there isn't much replayability. Definitely worth buying and playing if you're a fan of turn based RPGs, or want to have some fun in general.			"

												Admittedly It's been a year at least since I played this game. But this is one of the best games I played that year! I love it. Basically what you have is Kings Bounty / HoMM style daily movement with nights for rest, where you have to divvy up jobs like hunting for food, guarding the camp, researching new tech, and so on with the people you have amassed. Then there are story-driven elements that can happen randomly or on certain events. Most of it is really good writing, and the characters have some depth and don't usually follow corny tropes, though you have a few that are like that... just like in life. The story elelments are a big part of the game, and you can gain or lose followers, resources, food, weapons, based on the choices you make. The combat is hex grid, turn based tactics style, and it's one of the best tactics games I've seen. It's pretty easy to get into and plays like you would expect, and the encounters are usually quite good - a challenge to keep eveyone from getting hurt too much, but not too frustrating, although there are a few difficult hurdles along the way. If you let your troops get hurt, they will take time to get over their wounds, and designating one of your healers to tend them during nights will improve their condition. Your characters gain exp and progress and you can name captains, lieutenants etc which increase their stats further - you can only name 1 lieutenant and so on. You can select their class and some skills.Honestly I'm rusty remembering a lot about this game bc it's been so long since I played. But I keep putting off reviewing it, so here it is.  This game is really excellently done!!  Totally recommend it for any fans of tactics games or Kings Bounty Heroes of Might & Magic type army management (not in the stacks of armies, but in exploring a map and discovering encounters and events), and some cool elements thrown in which make this game pretty unique all in all. I got about 40 hours out of it, and I could easily double that the next time I pick it up. On sale this is a great buy.			"

Playing Expeditions: Conquistador was a pleasant surprise. Not because it was free to play during the Special Promotion over the the past couple of days but because I am now in a real uncomfortable situation.Either I will buy myself a copy of Expeditions: Conquistador from the danish based Developer Logic Artists and keep conquering the rest of the eastern part of America or I will hold back my money and wait for the upcoming Expeditions: Viking next week. A decision has to be made...Many times nowadays an Indie Project on Kickstarter doesn`t even manage to get an working build up on Steam before the Team behind the project does run out of money. Not those Guys..Those guys at Logic Artists got their money and then did delivered what they had told to do and even didn`t stepped back from releasing their Game too on GOG or on the Mac.This is something that many AAA Developers are nowadays not capeable of doing without going through some Drama at the same time.Yes Tim Schafer, I am talking about your bunch of Clowns over at Double Fine Productions and Spacebase DF-9.But back on topic:Choose your decisions carefully, they might have an bigger impact then you first might guess in the Game..This is a lesson I have learned very early in the Game and from then on I knew that the Game won`t make it easy for me and that I really should think and act like an Conquistador that isn`t back home but in a country were everyone could be your enemy and therefore you should watch your back and goods as if your life would depend on those.Doesn`t matter if you are going through the jungle during the day or if you are in a Village that looked at first like the savest place on the whole continent. Make always sure that your conqueror are always well prepared and of course well outfitted and ready to draw their weapons on your command. You never know what could wait for you behind the next palm or hill..Don`t get too much distracted by the optic of the Game. It may look outdated sometimes but the keypoint is that it does what it has to do and therefore you can totally sink into the Game if you are open for the Genre the Game does represent.After around three hours I have finished a couple of missions in the Game, traveled through the eastern part of the Continent, helped a couple of the local natives, killed some of them too since they thought that I would let them play with our Skulls after they would have killed us.I would do it again. For the Spanish Inquisition, for the Queen and of course too to maybe see at the end Eldorado which I am still trying to find after all those years..Conclusion:Logic Artists did deliver with Expeditions: Conquistador a real solid first performance and I enjoyed my time with the Game so far and will definitly dig my nose deeper into the Game as soon as I get the time for it but as far as it goes I can really recommend this Game to everyone that is into those Strategy - Tactic Games and isn`t too much disturbed if the used Game Engine isn`t representing the current State of the Art if it comes to the Genre.Because as soon as you accept that the current look of the Game you will start enjoying your time with Expeditions: Conquistador and spent hours in it`s world till you have conquered everything and unsolved every riddle the Game might offer. My Rating:Thumbs Up.That´s it. Thanks for reading and have a great time ;-)			"

												Expeditions: Conquistador is a strategy RPG set in an colonisation era, where player takes over a crew of Spanish conquistadors for an adventure in 16 century Latin America. In world map player has to make most of the decision like customising troops, managing resources, trading and others affairs. In battles, it plays similar to most hex-based TBS.Pros: Battle system system is similar to King’s Bounty and Heroes, but with some significant improvements like ability to choose between long range weapons and melee anytime. Great writing and a lot meaningful choices leading to different endings. For example, will you let Aztecs to rule or raze and steal everything for your King? A lot of references to Spanish, Aztecs culture. All that are presented with a high level of detail and accuracy. Amazing soundtrack during the whole game.  Graphically it’s a good looking game. Nice animations and detailed characters. Challenging enough to make players improve their strategy both in battles and world map. It took me more than 30 hours to beat the game on normal difficulty and there were still plenty of stuff to find and do. After that, there are 4 difficulty levels.Cons:  The game gets a bit repetitive in the middle of the campaign. Especially due to the lack of the new gameplay mechanics in the second half ot the campaign. Lack of customisation. Of course, there are military rank based system granting some various skills to choose from and ability to allocate equipment. But it still feels a bit simplistic and restricted compared to the best games from this genre like Final Fantasy Tactics and others. Maybe it’s just me, but there are a bit too much reading and not enough fighting in this game. No voice acting, which is understable for a low budget game. Personally, I would really like Spanish voice overs to make atmosphere more authentic.Overall, this is a lenghty, challenging and very enjoyable adventure, in a exotic setting, which should appeal to not only SRPG veterans. Just be prepared to learn quite a lot at the beggining.9/10    "

												Many thanks to the developers from Denmark. They really created a good game with a good dialogue and combat systems in a unique setting. (I do not remember RPG about the Spanish conquest of America).   Playing Expeditions: Conquistador really feel like a pioneer of new worlds. Excellent writing descriptions of events and locations, quests (sometimes feel like the game is not a the video game - this is dungeon and dragons game). Battle system very similar to the combat system of dungeon and dragons.   Among the shortcomings can be identified too passive protagonist actually does become  de facto ""talking head"". In the battle  protagonist did not participate too.   It is also unclear why  developers decided to limit the battle by only 6 members,  while the game has 5 classes in battle using only a maximum of 2-3. One could for instance with the game walkthrough, expand battle map and add the number of soldiers in the combat.   While in the game use a historical setting, for the sake of balance developers equalized all parameters in classes,  for example  Aztec and Spanish fighters has  no distinction. Dont be surprised when you see same damage from iron  and oak swords, or the same protection from iron  and leather armor. As the de facto all the basic classes same as Spain and the natives, victory in battle will bring correct command, upgrades and the choice of classes in combat.   In the battle conquistadors do not use horses and pistols (probably forgotten them in Spain :)))   7.5/10			"

												Strongly recommended for fans of tactical combat!Other reviews have explained in detail the setting and the mechanics of the game, so I will not repeat that. This is just my subjective opinion of the game.While this is not a random or procedurally generated game, where you could get endless replay value, it is intriguing enough that I have replayed the story a couple of times, making somewhat different decisions within the relatively linear story. While the game does not force the player to solve the story in a fixed sequence of steps, but instead allows free wondering through Hispaniola and Mexico, the main plot is still fairly linear. However it's how you'll handle that plot, where the devil lies. Will you be humane or genocidal? Treacherous or fair? The game neither rewards nor punishes either style of gameplay. It is up to you to decide whether you will murder a native village or trade with it, and your ""dirty dozen"" squad of conquistadors will have different opinion on your actions, resulting in their morale going up and down. And should it go down too much, you could end up with a rebellion on your hands...But it's the tactical turn-based combat where the game really shines. Many complain it's too hard or too arbitrary, but I wholeheartedly disagree with them. It's a bit like a chess game with figures that don't always do exactly what you want them to, except it's entirely different. :) When it's your turn you can select any one of your troopers and tell them where to go and who to attack. When you've moved all, the enemy gets to do the same. Not unlike XCOM, only done better in my opinion. Cover matters, positioning matters, outfitting your troopers with weapon and armour improvements matter, perks matter, battlefield traps and barricades matter, who to attack first and why matters. And pulling off a good defence or difficult attack is really satisfying and makes you feel good about yourself. I am a typical save-scummer and will never click the ""Iron man"" campaign selection. I will replay the same battle many times in order to try out different tactical outcomes and combinations. But my aim isn't to save-scum to win the game as effectively as possible, but to extend the game as long as possible while getting the most enjoyable fights out of it. I finished the campaign once, then started it again, then just finished the first part of the game, then restarted it again, wanting to do some quests and battles from a different perspective, using different units and tactics.The one shortcoming of the game, which is the main reason why I do this is, it's too short. The Hispaniola and Mexico campaigns combined, if you don't rush them, will give you some 30-40 hours of fun. An additional Inca campaign DLC would have been nice, but the devs said there's not gonna be one. A modding tool has been released which allows people to create additional plot twists and random events within the main campaigns, but I haven't seen anything available for download and play yet.If you're into well thought out tactical games this one is for you.

OverviewExpeditions: Conquistador is an interesting concept that is sadly crippled by poor design choices.Positive (good features)Unique setting. I can't think of any other game set in this time and place (+1,5).Women are 99% equal to men which sadly makes E:C stand out (+0,5).Serious themes are implemented in a mature way (+0,5) There are no ""noble savages"" and not every Spaniard is a goatee-stroking baddy (+1,5).Offers more 'real' choices with consequences than most games (+0,7).Multiple solutions to problems (0,6).They tried to make combat different from other games (+0,5).You can be really cruel to your party members (+0,5).With Montoya as last name you get 'Iñigo' as first name (+0,1).Occasionally touching (+0,3). Neutral (average/expected features)The guitar music is nice and soothing but there doesn't seem to be much variation in music.I like that the narration is done by someone Spanish but he makes too many mistakes which makes it seem a bit comical.Adequate graphics.Some party members develop as characters, most don't.Negative (bad features)Tedious, awful, boring, pointless camping menu (-2).In the rations menu you can't sort by morale and the buttons are unresponsive (-1).You get the same events too many times (-0,5).No quicktravel (-0,5).At the end of every day you have to ensure you don't camp on the road (-0,5).Higher party survival skill doesn't translate into more food (-1).Trading is boring and poorly implemented (-0,1).Unequal starting skills (-0,3).You can easily cripple yourself during character creation/party selection (-1).Unless you have a high Tactics skill, traps are mostly useless (-0,5).Equipment is 100% generic (-0,7).Boring skills system (-1).You have to travel back to your fortress over half a dozen times to order a new construction (-0,2).ConclusionI waited a long time to play this game and i really wanted to like it. E:C has elements from some of my favourite games; Party skills like Mount & Blade, role-playing like Baldur's Gate and turn-based combat like X-Com. On top of that the setting is unique and implemented nicely, morality isn't black and white and it treats the player as an adult.Unfortunately, it seems they wanted to implement so many elements that many of them turned out badly. Normally in a RPG you find increasingly superior equipment with a variety of traits. Here equipment is just a generic ""x"" in someone's profile. There's a variety of traps to use in combat, but you can't place them very far and they take up slots that can be used for cannonballs and the like. Every character including the player has 6 skills, but especially on party members these don't seem to help much. The absolute worst part of the game is camping. First you have to make sure to not camp on the road so you won't get robbed. Then you have to distribute food in a poorly designed menu with buttons that don't always respond when clicked. There's a handful of tasks but most of them have little effect on the game. And no matter how much you improve your party members' skills, the end result is still so random that it becomes a frustration. I almost quit several times because of this nonsense. It's incredibly annoying and adds nothing to the game and you have to sit through it over a 100 times at least. Obviously they wanted to make you feel you have to survive in the jungle, but they managed to implement it in a way that completely takes you out of the experience.DetailsExperience with genre: Since the 90s.Experience with game: Completed.Rating: 3,2Recommended to: People who like having conversations in games and have the patience & willpower to deal with its severe flaws.

												Spectacular game (although I'm still a bit bitter that I screwed myself out of a better ending by playing Ironman mode) and I certainly recommend it.  It's definitely punishing, but very well written and overall a great experience.  I wish it was longer, or that there were more games like it.My biggest gripes:- The Mexico map had so much unused space.  I thought I would have done a lot more exploring than I ended up doing by the time the map was finished.- Balance of treasure found on the map vs what gets stolen from you almost every night sucks.  Managing your valuables is a big challenge.- The time limit on the last battles.  Whyyyyy.  Totally killed the ending of the game for me.But with that said, I do suggest the game, although I wouldn't do Ironman - the writing is so good, you don't really want to accidentally get locked out of certain paths.

												Crashes gnome-panel for some odd reason.Pretty standard fetch-the-item quest type game.  The combat system is sort of interesting, and different from other games I've played, but ends up being pretty deterministic.  Dialoging with the NPCs is annoying because you're given multiple responses to choose from, but they don't seem to make much difference.  They boil down to ""take quest"" or ""refuse quest"", and in some cases you only get to choose the former.Most of the gameplay is not actually in the explore-the-world, nor even the combat screen.  Believe it or not it's the camping mechanism.  You select what type of rations to use, organize healing of members, pick things to research, proportion to spend hunting, guarding, searching for items, etc.  Picking rations gets to be a bit tedious after a while, but I like the mechanics for selecting tasks for each member.

												You are El Conquistador. You are bound for the New World to gain fame and riches. How will you do it? Your call. Nobody holding your hand, telling you what to do (except tutorial sequence on Hispaniola). You have absolute free reign on how to achieve that goal:Raze native villages, kill helpless women and children, and claim the land for King Carlos? - no problem!Befriend natives, free slaves, and fight against the Spanish Crown? - no problem!Can i do both of the above? - yes you can! What i like in this game - it is not you classic ""good vs evil"" b u l l s h i t, it is more realistic, dark and ""shades of grey"" game. Just like real life.Example: Trade with the village, marry the chieftain;s daughter, accept gift and be worshipped as the sun god. Then - raze village to the ground killing all inhabitants. Il con Dieu! Stupid Heathens! :) - and the game is full of such options.P.s. I STRONGLY recommend playing in Ironman mode. Its how this game meant to be played. You will only feel the weight of your decisions if you play it like that. And don't worry about losing battles and thus game over - in most battles, while you have at least 1 of your units alive, you can always surrender/flee. Yes, you will be humiliated, lose many valuables, fail quests, some of you companions may permanently die, but you will be able to continue, and in some cases, have your revenge (or second humiliation).Overall: 9/10 go play it now, Conquistador :)			"

												Playing through this solid indie title made me wished I would have backed it when it was on Kickstarter. Expeditions: Conquistador is a pretty good strategy RPG that mixes exploration, resource management and hex-grid combat with a little bit of fiction and non-fiction. The end game was a blast to play through and I'm hoping the developer has had enough success to create new Expeditions in the future.Pros:+ Solid combat: good balance of classes, skills, traps and other items.+ Great variety of random occurances: both good and bad situations can pop up while traveling or camping that keeps the           player on their toes.+ Interesting locations: The first location is a bit more than a tutorial while the second one is pretty much the main game. Both are rewarding.+ Choice and Consequences: The game expands on this towards the end. Not all dialogue branches off to a totally different path or outcome but there is enough variance.+ Great balance of fiction/non-fiction: combat is intense because it only takes 3-4 hits to kill someone and you can't spam healing spells, however there are still curses, pagan Gods and legendary locations. Cons:- Stability issues: the first island was fine, once I got to the second location there were some crashes to desktop, some loading the map issues and some other small hiccups.- Higher Level Skills: once the characters get into the higher ranks, their skills are no longer varied. They're still semi-useful but it felt cheap. Also no higher level perks. "

												This game starts a litle bit slowly but once you get into it, it really has a good feel about it. It is simple and straight forward but there is just enough depth and customization to keep you wanting to play more. The battles lack a lot of actual tactics until higher levels. In all, this is a fine game.			"

												Its 'ok'. But just ok. Some of the game mechanics are much more anoying than fun like periodicly having to run down natives robbing you or random events occuring that you have no control over. If you do not mind redundent mechanics and being at the mercy of random events I could see others enjoying this. For me it was a total waste of time.			"

												If I had known how good this game would be I would have paid full price for it!It's brilliantly designed and beautifully written with truly different consequences based on your choices (I know because I saved and loaded a lot). The combat has strategic depth, the soundtrack and art is perfect. Availability on Linux was a massive bonus (I played this on Fedora 20). The only small issue I have is that scrolling across the map is a little difficult and the game would've been even better with a bit more detail on the adventure map; having said that, it's definitely re-playable and I really hope the developers make a sequel.

Posted: February 9
												I have played this game for over a 100 hours now, and I can confidently say it's one of my favourite games ever. Which is strange, because it isn't the best game I've ever played - there are games with far fiewer faults than this one. But it just stole my heart...You start by choosing your expedition members. Each has a combination of 3 traits, which determine what affects their morale. For instance, Agressive followers love to fight at every opportunity, while Peaceful ones prefer to avoid combat; the Openminded gain morale when you recruit natives into your adventuring party, while the Racist ones lose it; a Proud follower's mood depends on the success of a battle, while Narcissists like being promoted; and so on. Of course, nobody like going without food or having their injuries untreated. High morale gives a critical hit chance in battles, but let it drop below 2 and you've got a mutiny on your hands. Every follower has a back story. If you aren't the type who reads them, fear not - there are random ""conversation quests"" during which a follower will tell you about themselves.The quality of writing is consistently superb. It reads like the best interactive novels, and is broken up into paragraphs, so it never feels like a wall of text. Most conversations have 3 choices of reply, which can be described as ""dignified, ferocious or charming"" in tone. The majority of battles can also be resolved in a number of ways - you can avoid it altogether, use diplomacy, use the Tactics skill to put yourself in an advantageous position before the fight, or simply ride forth with guns blazing. Overall, it's an RPG in which the role-playing actually matters!The battles are the most challenging part of the game by far. They are usually 6 versus 6, but there are variations. The objectives also vary - from the standard ""Eliminate all enemies"" to ""Reach the escape zone"" or ""Stay alive for X turns"". There are 10 classes - 5 Spaniard and 5 native, each with it's own strengths and weaknesses. There are also traps, barricades, attacks of opportunity... The main reason why I've put in so many hours into this game is what I like to call ""a Non-Binary victory system"". What I mean is, you don't just win or lose. Any follower that gets incapacitated in battle has a chance to end up injured. An injured follower cannot fight and is useless in camp until fully healed. Healing takes time, medicine and doctors. So it is very important to not just win a fight, but win it without too many serious injuries, otherwise you'll run out of resources, and your party members will deteriorate and die.And that's where most of the problems with this game lie. The interface, especially the combat interface, is of patchy quality. Your troops stand in blue circles, while the enemy is in red ones, but they are not very well highlighted, so during nighttime battles you can barely see who's where. The game isn't open-world, more like a series of passages you can travel along, but the map doesn't make it clear where they are - it only shows roads and mountains. So much time, especially on Hispaniola, is spent bumping into rocks and trees. Your quest objectives can be tracked in the quest journal, but it only tracks the main storyline quests. Even then, if your objective is on the part of the map you haven't discovered yet, you wouldn't see it!Despite all this, the faults are minor compared to the good stuff. And I'm eagerly awaiting Expeditions:Viking, in which the faults I've highlighted have been mostly resolved.			"

												One of the most heavily-underrated games of its time, Expeditions: Conquistador is a well-written and deeply-engrossing masterpiece that has hours upon hours of content on top of having great replay value.The player is given the role of a hidalgo of the Spanish aristocracy, sent to the new world after a first attempt at colonization disappears. Sent first to the island of Hispaniola to quell a rebellion, the player is then given the freedom to do as he wishes, whether that means mapping out the island, helping or hurting the natives, or even in how he deals with his fellows in the employ of the Spanish crown.The level of freedom players are given is enormous; you are free to pick out your own companions, each with their own personalities, and then develop them as you wish; you are also able to play without worry of game-overs as there are very few choices that will end the game prematurely, allowing the player to continue even past tragic and traumatic experiences. It goes without saying that there are multiple endings and each of these is a direct consequence of a choice the player will have made much earlier in the campaign; will the Spanish king be pleased with your conquest of the new world or will the Aztec empire be forever grateful for your efforts in their name?The combat system is also nothing worth shaking a finger at; as an isometric strategy RPG, how one develops and balances out their characters is important and because of this, it's very easy to find a party that suits ones's playstyle: whether that means a party focused on long-range bombardment or close-rance aggression is entirely up to you.Truly, it is the freedom in combination with a fantastic storyline that makes this game worth playing. With engrossing gameplay to keep a player in thrall of this game, this is truly one of the great hidden gems within the strategy RPG genre.			"

												This is one of the best games ever made. The combat is extremely interesting and balanced. The battles range from protecting certain individuals, rushing opponents, being ambushed, to very difficult ''hold the fort'' etc ...  The game also allows a lot of freedom in the quests, choices and storyline. There are many interesting characters and great dialogue. Definitely recommended, although a new player probably needs some time to get used to the interface (tip = click on place on the map and press space to move automatically. You can move automatically while map is open to save time).			"

												I want to like this game.  And since it has been on sale several times it was a resonable price.  While it has many features that I like; character advancement, attributes that make a difference in gameplay, good combat, different weapons (or weapon advancement), construction of traps and baracades. It just falls a little short across the board.  While the features are there, everything lacks a little depth.Of course to add the depth that I would like would probably increase the cost of the game.

												Let me start by stating that this is not an action game. Focus is not on combat. If you want a turn-based tactical game, this is not it. If you want a game where your choises (based on text) makes a difference, then this is it. I'd say it's a RPG-manager game more than a strategy game.There are a few things that could have been more polished, but overall the game is very entertaining and has a decent replay value. 20 Euro is a bit steep IMO, some features feels more basic/older than that, but I still recommend it.

												Very immersive game - the story and text is very well conceived and written, if a bit short. You get actually rerally attached to the characters, and having one die is really hard to take! I'd love to see a deeper expansion, covering the incas and with more complex and divergent plot pathways. The tactical battles are surprisingly fun - I expected them to get stale, especially with the absence of fantasy or space monsters, but in fact the tactical situations are quite varied. There are some real nail-biting moments in battle, and the cannon in just so much fun! I'm definitely buying any DLCs or sequels. Definitely stick with this game, even if it takes a few campaign restarts to get the hang of it.			"

												A little rough around the edges, but I enjoyed it a lot. The strategy/combat, while maybe not Xcom, is satisfying enough. The story, resource/ally management, and variety of interesting choices add a great deal of depth. There is a stronger relationship to your followers than in most games of this genre. Each recruitable character has distinct personality traits which will support or clash with your in-game decisions. There's incentive to keep your followers happy, but some are much easier than others. One interesting example is Bonita Blanco, a hunter with 2 somewhat contradictory traits: ""Peaceful"", and ""Racist"". Since many choices in this game are simple cases of ""kill or spare"" whatever Aztec savages you may be dealing with, she can be a difficult gal to please. If you kill the savage, her racism is appeased, but her peaceful nature disappointed, resulting in +1/-1 morale. As you might guess, sparing the savage has the opposite effect, yet both ultimately produce no change in her morale. So how did I satisfy her unnecessarily difficult personality? Food! Giving a unit double rations has a chance of boosting morale. My Bonita Blanco was so fat, she occupied 4 hexagons at once.			"

												It's a little bit like the Heroes of Might and Magic series, minus the fantasy. The setting is interesting and not often explored in games, so it's nice to see it done justice here. The combat is challenging and fun, and the management aspects will require you to pay attention. Each team member has a story and a personality, some will vehemently disagree with your decisions and others will come to you for advice about their personal problems. Graphically, it looks ok and runs well on older hardware. The soundtrack, although short, is excellent and I often find myself whistling the tunes when I'm not playing the game. You can choose to be a care bear, a ruthless genocidal maniac or something in between. You will often face tough moral questions and your decisions will impact the moral of your followers.If you are interested in this period of history, or if you like turn-based strategy, or even if you are suffering a bit of genre fatigue and want to try something different then Expeditions: Conquistador is definitely worth a shot.

												HMM! where i start... It would be unfair to Start on a negative. Expeditions: Conquistador is far more than a reskinned King’s Bounty, exploring a historical moment with confidence and skill. The combat system is effective and while some aspects of management become a chore, the focus on stories and characters means that there is almost always at least one interesting plot on the boil. The maps will be the same if I play again, so I doubt I’ll revisit but if there are more Expeditions to come, I’ll certainly pack a bedroll and hop on board.RPG/Strategy/Turnbase- the game breaks down into four parts: exploration of the map, turn-based combat, party management and roleplay. It’s in the latter that the game finds much of its quality, offering meaningful choices during well-written dialogue, and decisions that have a bearing on the world, and characters’ relationships and concerns. The RPG aspects feed back into party management and while there is levelling, equipment and skills are doled out from a mass of shared resources, which diminishes the tales of personal progression. Equipment, particularly, is odd. Rather than finding items out in the jungle or buying them, upgrades are a numbered resource, which can then be applied to characters, moving their belongings up through the tiers that relate to their profession.Bad...(just my opinion..) - Wish game longer..(Where the DLC? )-only 2 Map(this include prolouge map..)-Racist NUN!

												I've just finished the first part, and am about 1 hour into the second game arch. This game is fantastic. The gameplay, the story, the art, the sound - it's all done so well. The game sets you up with a backstory which isn't unique to each time you start up the game from what I've been able to tell, but it's written well enough to support the rest of the story. Soon after the game starts, you must choose your crew members for your expedition that each bring different skills to your campaign as well as three character traits that vary from peaceful, aggressive, cautious, pious, racist, etc.As a general tip, choosing expedition members that are similar will make your game easier, considering that a lot of the choices you make along the way will favor certain character traits above others, which will either boost or lower your individual members' morale depending on which choice you made. I ended up choosing a varied group that made the game a bit harder. On one of my saves, I had a mutiny due to the choices I made and just some general bad luck. The game does a great job with presenting you different choices along the way that feel authentic, with very little circumstances where the choices didn't matter or felt like there was only one ""real"" choice the whole time, as is often the case with games of this type. There are no true ""right"" choices, especially when dealing with groups that are either pious or racist, and later on in the game you will actually have to think about some choices because either way you're going to have a bad time dealing with the political consequences. I found the combat to be simple, and completely engaging. The majority of your battles will deal with 6 of your expedition members. Each battle proceeds the same way, usually: you are notified that you may ""begin battle""; you must choose 6 individuals for this battle, with the ability to move equipment around and read their stats before you make your selection; you *may* have a preparation phase depending on the circumstance where you can set up traps on the board, or position your units in more advantageous ways; your turn is usually first, and is played by A) moving your units if you choose and B) Attacking with your units if you choose; then the opposing force has their similar turn; you do this until you either win, lose, or surrender; after which, you will have to treat your wounded individuals with your doctors and whatever medicine you have available. It’s worth noting that you don’t actually lose units in battle. Instead, you lose them from your inability to treat them afterward.I haven’t finished the game, but so far it is completely engaging and fun. My expedition has a total of 14 members so far, and I believe I may keep it at this level because it *right* at the line of being too much of a drag on resources while still being able to achieve a lot via their character abilities. Pros:+ Amazing Art+ Great Story+ Fun/Addicting Gameplay+ Difficult, especially in the beginning+ AWESOME level design - very creative ways they implemented different battle scenarios. + Great UI design, with tooltips available to almost everything in the game, which was a great way to keep the player informed with all sorts of data without creating a cluttered UI. Cons:- The only thing I can really say if I HAD to be critical, is that it feels ""indie"" only during the few cutscenes they had. Instead of moving animation, they were still graphics with subtitles. They could have made these parts more engaging just by adding sound, music, and acted dialogue. However, there have only been 3 (more or less) of these cutscenes so far, and the rest of the game is so well done that it doesn't feel like an indie game at all when it matters. - I would've liked to see more sidequests. This may be a plus or a negative depending on how you see it. The game creates an engaging story for the main campaign, but neglects any sidequests. I only bring this to attention because it says ""RPG"" as one of the tags, so it is worth noting. Rating: 9/10 Would highly recommend to anyone who likes turn-based games, especially if you are a pre-Columbian era/European colonization history buff. "

												I have over 700 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #59 - Expeditions: ConquistadorI was intrigued by Expeditions: Conquistador, as there aren't many games with a 16th Centry New World setting.  But I was happy to find a few more reasons beyond just the setting to enjoy myself.First, I'll say I was surprised by the emphasis on the story.  I guess I am used to playing turn-based games which are pretty light on the story and more about getting you to wander the map and fight things.  Instead I discovered there is as much emphasis on the RPG as there is strategy.  One warning, other than a little voice acting at the beginning, it's going to be a lot of reading, so depending on how you like your RPGs presented, this may be a turn off.I imagined as I set out that I'd be doing my share of exploring and fighting, and I wasn't entirely wrong, but it didn't play out the way I expected.  Instead of being in charge, I found myself having to work for the local governor, and starting out as an errand boy of sorts.  I enjoyed the fact that the story was twisting my expectations here.The game does provide a tutorial of sorts.  Before you can go exploring you have to go through a friendly battle in the town, and this gives you a chance to pick up some of the basics of combat.  What I liked here is that the basics were pretty easy to pickup, but there is definitely a deeper strategy at play.  The characters you command will have different classes, and each class will have a specialty.  So for instance, you'll have characters that focus on melee attacks, or ranged attacks.  Each class also has a special ability, such as the doctor who can heal an ally.So the combat starts out pretty straightfoward in regards to moving around and attacking things from either up close or at range.  But then the tutorial starts to layer on some of the other aspects of strategy like taking cover, flanking your opponent, and attacks of opportunity.Once you finish the first fight, you are able to leave the starter town and explore the area.  Although before you actually leave town you'll visit a few places of interest around town, and pick up a few quests along the way.  You can also stock up on additional supplies (like food) before leaving town to go explore.Exploring felt a little different from other games I have played.  You still have the concept of turns and only being able to travel so far in a single turn.  But once your day is up, instead of just advancing to the next day, you make camp for night.   Camping actually involves a few different activities that you assign to your crew.  You'll have someone guarding the camp.  You can also go out and hunt for food to add to the food stocks you already have.  Also, if you have people who have been injured, you can treat them with your doctors.   You can specify all of this manually, but the game also has an auto-assign to help speed this process up.My first fight outside of the town did not go well.   The quest I got from the governor directed me to this temple where I proceeded to get into a fight with it's inhabitants.  I ended up retreating from the fight after most of my crew got injured, and limped my way back to town.  What I found interesting was, I ended up failing the quest.  I'm used to either having to reload or do the quest over, but in this case, the story simply went on in spite of my failure.  This also made me realize that this is not an easy game, even on the easy difficulty.  And that's where I ended my first hour of play.  It was enough to get a good sense of what the game was about, but otherwise barely scratching the surface of it, and definitely leaving a lot left to learn.   I can see where the early game may be frustrating while trying to learn everything and figure out the right strategy.  But even so I certainly enjoyed my first hour of playing, and have no problems recommending this to others.			"

												This is not a polished turn-based strategy game. Basic elements are featured but not refined at a level that would propel Expeditions: Conquistador ahead of it's pack. There is no confirmation button prior to moving, any misclicks can potentially be fatal mistakes on the player's part. Low replay level. The story is not very engaging and the choices you made along the way hardly changes the overall outcome of the game.   Quest missions that involve recruiting additional followers are known to be bugged. Many people restart their games because there have no fixes to these problems. Crashes have been known to occur in certain situations, you can read about them in the game's community hub section.The only saving grace is the gameplay itself. Although unrefined, the game's difficulty levels become quite challenging. Generic skills from each class provides strategic advantages when used correctly. Effectively utilizing attack opportunities and flanking is a must. There are better turn-based games out there, I cannot recommend this. Enjoy bad movies, not bad games.			"

												This game is rock solid. It has a high learning curve for map exploration and party management, and the turn-based battle strategy is fun and well-balanced. The battles were all fairly unique and didn't feel repetitive. The RPG aspect including dialogue, choices, consequences and party members' interactions are reminiscent of old school RPGs like Baldur's Gate. It's a good combination of strategy and RPG. However, every time your party runs out of movement points on the map, you have to manage your party as you put them to sleep (make sure someone hunts for food, make sure someone creates healing herbs, make sure someone guards the loot, make sure someone xxx). While this aspect of the game is captivating for the first 3-4 hours, it quickly becomes tedious. Other than this one drawback, however, the game is quite fun.			"

												I saw this in a bundle a while back and was interested in it, but never bought it considering the general lack of quality in most bundles (Humble Bundle aside). Well, I finally bought it and boy was I wrong. This is a superb game and it is a shame that in the past it's been bundled with subpar games. Expeditions: Conquistador might not have cutting edge graphics but it has plenty of charm, personality, and fun and challenging gameplay. The mix of role playing with squad turn-based tactics works very well and the characters and story do a good job of keeping you interested and moving forward. It also has resource management and is vaguely reminiscent of Civilization in respect to the world map while playing similarly to XCOM in the battles. Highly recommended. This developer and this game deserves much more praise and attention than it's humble pricing suggests.			"

												Well this a hidden gem if I ever saw one. It was sitting in my Steam library for years before I finally got around to playing it too. I don't know what took me so long.Everyone praises the XCOM games. I don't get the appeal. I think the tactical combat in it is fantastic, but everything else seems more than a little lacking. Take that type of gameplay and apply it to a proper RPG, though? Now you're speaking my language. Harebraned Scheme's Shadowrun series is that, and I loved those games. Expeditions: Conquistador is that in a historical setting.It does a few things different from the games I'm comparing it to though. For one thing, the percentage to hit mechanic only applies to ranged weapons. This doesn't make the game easier or less frustrating. Instead it forces you to change your tactics with almost every battle. The battlefields are extremely varied too, and overall this game is much harder than any of the Shadowrun games.There's a bit of The Oregon Trail in here too. It's up to you to properly manage resources such as rations, medicine, and your party's morale. You can only travel so far per day and the game is filled with random events that will screw you over or help you out.As for the roleplaying options and historical accuracy, well, it's gonna depend on how you form your party. You choose who joins before the game begins. So you can go in with an all white male party of racists, or you can go with a more modern gender balance and an emphasis on open minded people. It's up to you. There's also a random button and I highly recommend going that route if you want to hear everyone's collective groans with every other decision you make, as you're unable to make everyone happy no matter what you do.It's pretty awesome. I highly recommend it.			"

												I'm.. a bit biased.  I backed this one on Kickstarter and wrote a couple of events for it.That being said, Conquistador is a really good game.  The writing is excellent and there's tons of it, there's a lot of freedom once you reach Mexico, and it really is a true roleplaying game in that sense.  The combat is fairly simple, but it's fun and there's enough going on to keep it from getting dull or repetitive.  If you like RPGs and are interested in something that's not filled with lazy fantasy cliches, Expeditions: Conquistador is worth checking out.			"

												Recommending this because otherwise Jonas kills me.Kidding aside, it's a good game! In a setting you don't see often. And it made me try other turnbased games like X-com, still totally not my gametype though.Also features long conversations and many choices, my personal favorite element of the game.And if you wonder why I barely played it yet on Steam is because I spend a LOT of time on it during beta that I need a break now. Also, huge backlog of other games I never have played vying for my attention.If RPG is your thing, get it. If Turn-based combat is your thing, get it. If you like both, you probably already have it!			"

												I'd definitely recommend this game although it's not for everyone, I mean its for those who are interested in conquest of new world. Game has interesting plot, you can learn some facts/myths concerning spanish conquest and motives that conquistadors were driven by. It puts you in front of moral dilemmas, so you can choose how you resolve different situations, meaning by violence or diplomatically. In spite of that, game is quite linear and as a result replayability is limited. It could have more side quests. Soundtrack fits well to entire game. Combat system is poor in comparison to for example Age of Wonders 2. I mean there are not many tactical moves you can perform. I know it's quite different game in terms of world and reality but genre is the same. I don't mind you have to fight with enemy that overwhelms you in numbers, but you should have possibility to deploy to battle more units, regarding you have more than 10 under your command. Six is little funny number comparing to other strategy games. I know that muskets and arquebuses were quite inaccurate, but if unit is taking aim at another one that stands next to it and it misses most of the time in spite of the fact, game shows 70% chance of hitting the target, sth is wrong about that. It doesn't apply hunters and trappers who are designated for ranged combat but other classess that possess ranged weapon have extremely poor chance to hit enemy. In spite of those few pitfalls, game is worth playing, especially if you're fan of turn-based strategy games and want to feel like explorer in new world for once.			"

												Marginal recommendation, and only at discount prices.  I really enjoy the flavor of the setting and the ability to play according to a variety of motivations (gold-obsessed conqueror, religious evangelist, pacific explorer, etc).  You also have a lot of room to customize your team, which is much larger than a typical RPG party and gives you a lot of flexibility.  Upgrades offer customization but in general there are some obviously-superior options and others that you'd never take in a million years.The story lags a bit towards the end if you've clear-cut the map, and the end-game is a bit anticlimactic - you have potentially changed the geopolitical landscape and it just doesn't register as deeply as it should.  However, there is a wide array of stuff to find, and if you are someone who *doesn't* try to find everything, then you will probably finish the game well before it overstays its welcome.Significant downsides are that the gameplay gets very repetitive, and mechanics are clunky.  At times this feels like a video game about text-based, micro-managed camping and foraging, which is not exciting.  Movement is a slog, and the camera angles are locked in so tightly that it makes long-distance travel require a lot of scrolling back and forth on the screen.  Combat is pretty weak and can be laborious.The story and setting are great, though, the developers are mining very thought-provoking and educational territory, and those are what rescue this from a thumb down.  This is a very thoughtfully-made game in terms of the story and historical setting, and I give the developers credit for an outside-the-box, ambitious attempt.  However, for any spinoffs, they really need to upgrade the mechanics and gameplay - they are serious liabilities, they got old quickly, and they prove to be a moderate drag on an otherwise innovative game.GAME ADVICE: Bring at least 2 Doctors, you can get random events that leave a team member injured, and you could probably get stuck in a tough spot if this was either right after or right before a difficult fight that sidelined your best fighters.Sword/shield is a great general skill for everyone, including Doctors - you can passively block a lot of damage with a shield!I never deployed a Scout or Scholar in combat and it went just fine.  Usually I went 1 Doctor, 2 Ranged, and the rest Melee.  If I remember correctly there were a small number of fights with 4 team members and I either went 1 or 0 Ranged in the crew (but ALWAYS a Doctor).  I preferred Sword/Shield by a wide margin, but I had a few Pike-based fighters because they were philosophically compatible, and because one was an Amazon (and they are mobile widowmakers).Oh yeah, make sure when you pick your team at the beginning that you don't mix and match too many party members with conflicting philosophies, unless you want to manage dissent and mutiny.

												This game is really a hidden gem - unknown to the wide public, but a great pleasure to play.Pros:- Tactical combatAlthough the combat system may seem too simple and limited at first glance, it nevertheless allows for a wide range of tactics to employ. The rules are sort of unique due to mainly melee-oriented combat, and you will find quite a few of challenges to overcome- Setting and storyThe not-so-popular Age of Discovery setting is great not simply because it is fresh, but the game does a lot to really engage you in atmosphere and spirit of those days. The story is also quite interesting, not the usual 'kill the arch-demon' type.- Role-playingYou will really have choices to make, and you will face the consequences. You can be the conquer-the-savages type, or you can try and be more tolerant (maybe even too tolerant by the 16th century). The followers characters are sadly not unique, but defined by a number of traits. Nevertheless, you will have to deal with them having their own opinion.Cons:- 3D graphicsThis is an indie game, but I still think that the 3D world and animations are mediocre. The combat is a bit better. 2D art is good though- InterfaceMainly the adventure interface can be frustrating. Limited camera, bad pathfinding sometimes and the annoying bug when you're near POI but instead of interacting with it the game sends you to a journey around it.Still, I had a great time in this game. With King's Bounty not available on Linux, Expeditions: Conquistador is a nice replacement. "

												considering it reappears in the bundle star, just write a note on this game. The gameplay is a turn based strategy game,with a main line compaign similar to M&M hereos serie. All types of units have its unique level tree, which is similar to that of Enemy Within/Enemy unknown. The plot is the same as the title describes: to explore the new world with your squad. All you team members have their traits, some are brave, others may be caustious. All your choices will change their attitude towards you and some of them will eventually get furious and leave you. Overall,  its a nice turn based strategy game, better than blackguard in my view. Definitely should give it a try if you like this genre.			"

												Explore life as a 16th century Spanish Conquistador in this indie, turn-based RPG. The game consists of 2 campaigns that follow on from one another, with the second campaign being noticeably longer than the first. Gameplay consists of recruiting your party members, exploring the world map turn by turn, whilst managing resources like food and morale. Every turn, your party must make camp and then you assign a different camp duty to each party member (hunting, preserving meat, scouting, guarding etc.). Where you choose to make camp will affect the probability of success of different activities. Resting will then trigger different scripted and random events.Encounters can be resolved peacefully or aggressively - if you end up fighting, then (turn-based) combat is resolved on a separate hex grid. Party members have different classes and gain new skills as they level up, in traditional RPG fashion.Warning: the turn based combat can be brutally difficult even on the default difficulty level if you aren't prepared!Pros:+ Incredible atmosphere full of lore and flavour text+ Excellent soundtrack and voiceovers really add to the immersion+ Challenging turn-based combat+ The game tries to follow history by allowing you to be a completely evil, racist conquistador if you wish. You can massacre and enslave native villages in the name of God and the Spanish king. Innocent villagers will tremble helplessly in combat which is a nice touch.Cons:- In the second campaign, the scripting can be a bit buggy. You are tasked with rebuilding a fort and sometimes it can fail to be completed. I recommend focusing exclusively on this quest to make sure it gets completed.- The camping mechanic gets a little repetitive after a while.- The world map view feels too zoomed in and it is easy to miss objects and locations on the edge of the screen.- Graphics are adequate but feel slightly dated.The followup game Expeditions: Viking is due out in 2017 - can't wait!Score: 8/10 "

												Such a complicated game. A hex-based tactics game wrapped in Heroes of Might and Magic style exploration. Framing this is a liberal, but just recreation of a time period with a morality that so quickly becomes alien to that which we know today. I love the way the most expendable of characters have their own personalities and motivations, which come to clash frequently and often violently. This game understands that humans cannot be so easily classified into good and evil, and even trying your best to be the good guy, you are forced to make choices which reveal some real ugliness buried within. Play the villain, on the other hand, and nobody will be on your side, the game becoming harder in very subtle ways. It's very rare that I feel as though I am actually playing a role in a ""Role Playing Game"" but Expeditions provides this feeling above all else. You're forced to be someone other than what you know yourself to be and have to deal with the consequences and failures and victories of that person. The choices are so well integrated into the game's actual game system (with loyalty and injuries) that you never feel like any choices are just throw away choices. You know that one click could be the difference between a safe escape or half your crew being wounded and having to scramble for medicine. Between a victory or a mutiny. It's a damn good game, and anyone looking for a good RPG should consider it.			"

												A ""Turn based strategy RPG""; this game has a heroes/disciples style travel and tactical combat system, combined with rpg elements of a progressing party (a la X-com) and with a focus on story and choicemaking (a la fallout, etc). This ambitious combination, furthermore, is executed within a very accurate (well, mostly) historical setting and a very intriguing narrative. The immersion level of this game is simply amazing, and the fun factor of its gameplay parallels this quality. It has been a while since I've seen one from the ""tactical RPG"" genre this well executed, so I'm not kidding when I say this game deserves to be in the same shelves with the classics of the genre. (Yes, I've got the original fallout(s), and x-com in mind).The soundtrack is addictive, the graphics are immersive, and the story is vey interesting. From romance options to various decisions you make, choices have important effects on both your followers (the party) and the shaping of the story - which in turn increases the immersion further.I really can't find much of a negative aspect to say. Bugs are near non-existent, replayabilty is there. The only thing I can think of for the moment, and that is only for the Steam version, is that the (Steam) achievement system is somewhat bugged, resulting in achivements sometimes not registering until you reboot the game. I'm pretty sure it will be fixed in an upcoming patch.One last thing to mention (again, for the Steamers): while I was browsing the forums for this game, I saw that the developers are very active; they engage in discussions, provide help and are awesome people.I find it surprising actually that this game is so underrated and underheard of as the awesome game it is.

												Finally a game that can successfully blend genres.Really enjoying it so far. It has that old school rpg feel where you have to actually read dialogue to get the story and characters. It's done well. It's never pages and pages of reading where I get bored and start to skim. It's just the right amount and done mostly as dialogue so it immerses you in charcter rather than a random narrator. This is an important balance that many modern ""throw-back"" rpg's don't do well. The turn-based battle is done well with the shoot/attack them when they move idea. Keep the doctor and ranged units safe. I feel like i saw this in Jagged Alliance but that was 15 years ago so I'm glad it's back. I'm a save ♥♥♥♥♥. I failed my first battle and re-did it, but I see I got 50 points of XP either way. It was just my self-esteem that took a hit so I had to reload. I like that it's not eay and you have to plan well. This game really has strategy, you can't rush in. SO many of the newer turn-based games are basically over power with the highest tech style. This game has battles that require thinking, planning, and timing. Well done. Although only a few battles in I see it as 4 soldiers, 1 hunter, 1 doctor. Is there a better strategy? Perhaps when I level a scholar or scout they might have skills to use that overcome the damage of a soldier. One thing I would like to see is larger maps, the ability to see the move limit on enemies.So it's an RPG STrategic tactical turn based game with elements of survival, plus exploration. To the DEVS: I only know this game because I just discovered steams ""suggestions for you"". I took a look at Citadels but the reviews were so horrible I couldn't bare to get it even for 5 bucks. I hit the suggestions button again today to find that it's on sale. Why not advertise a bit? Get people talking. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT INDIE GAME. This is what indie games should strive for, and at a discount at 5 bucks which is too low IMO you could pull in many more people.Well best of luck to all, I only have a few hours in and maybe it gets boring but there's many a $60 AAA purchase that I've found less fun. If it never played again I've gotten already my $5 dollars worth.			"

On top of this you have a survival/profit metagame which combines to make a very interesting whole.

The decisions you make during the quests may influence the gameplay, like players comming into your party or being killed.

												This game is pretty fun and I do enjoy it, although like a lot of indie titles it does have some annoying quirks. The setting is very unique and the game does not push you towards certain moral choices. You can be as altruistic or selfish as you wish. The game is also unique in that when you lose a battle the game doesn't end; it incorporates the defeat into the plot/questline, although the repercussions of that defeat may make the game next to unwinnable in a chain reaction of bad consequences. Each rock you trip over makes the next rock harder to get over. Expeditions: Conquistador is very difficult (I feel that some missions are virtually unwinnable) and very rewarding when you accomplish a difficult mission. It feels very similar to the XCOM reboot with a historical twist.This game is utterly punishing in some of its RNG events.  Alligator bites your soldier in a random event. Soldier can't guard camp at night. Camp gets raided. RNG your troops have to fight off attackers with only knives while outnumbered. You lose battle, doctor killed, other party members injured. Doctor can't heal party members post-battle, so most injured party members die from infection. Load last save.The leveling system is a bit flat. The classes gain fixed activated abilities and combat stat boosts as they level up with a list of passives to choose from, some of which seem next to useless while others are clearly superior.  The combat can get somewhat tedious. When your 6 soldiers are facing 8-18 enemies with no form of fast-forwarding the opponent's turn, the battles really start to drag. Some parts of the game are opaque. Native units have some abilities that I'm completely unfamiliar with (that guy cursed my guy...what does cursed do?). One unit can reduce the defense of one opponent by 10, but on your units defence is rated in % damage reduction. Should that be 10%? Another ability allows the unit to ignore 7 points of armor on opponents, but you don't know how much armor opponents have (or if some opponents lack armor), so it's very difficult to see the effect.  Don't let the less polished parts scare you off, I'm glad that I purchased the game and look forward to wrapping up the campaign.			"

												This game both excells as an rpg and a strategy game. A very immersive experience, and an excellent game.The game let's you make the decisions as you play a conquestador from Spain: are you an explorer, a seeker of new and lost civilizations? Do you seek peaceful trade? Or are you here for personal glory, or to conquer lands in the name of the King? How do you treat the people around you?The tactical combat system is turned based and simple at first, but complex enough to keep one interested. There are five base classes, and you usually take 3-6 into battle. Often your troops are outnumbered and outmatched, and you will need to use strategy, cunning, and well made traps to beat your opponents. Many rpgs have a trap system, but most of them are clumsy and feel more of an after thought. This game does a great job at allowing you to set up the battlefield before battle with the resources you have (unless of course you are caught unaware!), and makes trap placing easy, useful, and sometimes necessary.On the world map you must manage resources as you explore the unforgiving jungles of the new world: Food and rations, lest you grow hungry; medicine to keep the inevitable wounds you will receive from turning fatal (wounds received in combat will digress unless treated by a doctor with medicine!); and various resources to build traps, tools, and equipment. You will be ambushed in the night; your scout might wake up having been bitten by a poisonous insect, and must be treated immediately; and numerous other random encounters. You will keep the company of doctors, scouts, hunters, soldiers, and scholars, and your party members will talk to you as you make camp making them feel as though they are a part of your adventure, and not just units to command. The morale system is more than just a combat mechanic, but your choices will affect the way party members perceive you based on their personalities, and may even provoke a mutany.The skills system does a nice job of separating the combat and non-combat skills, so you don't feel as though you're limiting yourself by taking one over the other; and, every skill feels useful in some way (so there's no useless character builds).Again, really well designed rpg.

												Quite a nice little game if you enjoy being a colonial pig with exploration, rpg and aztec bashing all chucked in to keep your murderous uncompromising hot blooded compatriots in check.  The battles play out like x-com games, not quite as polished but enjoyable all the same.  Glad they didn't put in any voice acting mind you.  I'm still in the early stages would be good if they made it a tiny bit supernatural towards the end who knows maybe I will be hacking at the ankles of vast aztec gods at some point instead of wiping my disease riddled crusty asse with leaves in this never ending jungle.

												This Indie Kickstarter game is a strategy RPG that takes you back in time to the 1500s.  You play as a Spanish noble who arrives in Hispaniola, ready to explore the New World.  Will you follow in Cortes' footsteps and conquer Mexico for Spain?  Or will you play a more peaceful, open-minded leader who forges alliances with the natives?  You have choices in this game, which is reasonably historical yet a little lighter in tone than history was.Gameplay focuses heavily on exploration (with foraging, supply management, and random events) and on strategic combat.  Both are fun, and the gameplay is long enough (at around 30 hours for a complete playthrough) to give you your money's worth.  Recommended to fans who enjoyed the isometric style of Fallout 1 and 2.			"

												Actually I came by this game while skimming through products on steam sale; I purchased it based on the positive reviews. To be honest I was expecting nothing fancy but this game surprised me. It is a well-blended mixture of exploration adventure, strategy, RPG, tactical combat. It has well implemented ideas and mechanics to make you enjoy this mixture while throwing in some fresh ideas as well.The story is captivating enough to make you wonder what is coming next, the travelling mechanics, class based party setup, resource management were all adequately well done.  But the combat (I believe which was not enough) is the part where this game shines; you just can’t get enough of it.A single play through takes between 20-30 hours but other reviews say that there is a lot for replayability for experiencing the alternative branching storylines. In my opinion a single play through was enough fun but pacing through the same map again just to make a few different choices seems a little bit farfetched and may spoil the fun of the game cause some aspects of the game gets repetitive after a while.At the end of the day it is a good game.		8.5 / 10 "

												I don't actually think I've ever actually seen a game do a better job with the period than this. The presentation and interface of the game is sort of iffy, but the voice work is good and the writing is even better. The developers obviously read up a lot on the period and made really thoughtful decisions about how to present the period. When you study history for a living you generally don't have high expectations for games and movies covering the area you read so much about, so when something comes along that goes above and beyond the norm in doing a really great job, you want to tell everyone about it. This is one of those games.Also, ignore the playtime counter, I have no idea why it thinks I've played for less than 2 hours. It is a mystery.			"

The travel and camping systems are sublime, distributing rations and assigning tasks to your men every night.

												This game is awesome! Its an indepth tactical turn based RPG. And you are a Capitan of a conquistador squad. You choose your squad, and everyone has a background, personality, likes/dislikes ect. So say someone who is Courageous might lose morale if you run, but the Cautious guys would like it. Or if you see natives performing a religious ritual, and ask them about it and leave them be,  the Pious and Racist people wouldn't like it. (I don't allow Racist people in my group. F'n bigots!)Then you set off for high adventure. Movement is similar to HoMM, where you have a set # of steps a turn, then you must camp. During camp, you must feed your guys and assign them tasks, and random things can happen. Battles are similar to Fallout 2/Tactics. The tutorial makes everything easy to understand, so there isnt any head scratching. Theres one really annoying common bug (infinity death), but I guess the devs are working on it, so pick this game up ASAP, you won't regret it!			"

												This game is really good.  I hope there is gonna more of it.+ The story is interesting enough.  I like how you're not out to save the world.  In fact, what you're out to do is pretty much up to you.  I also like the historical setting.  This particular setting is not that often explored and they haven't been shy about it and didn't fel in the total PCness or gentle savage BS.+ The narration is good.  Except for some voice acting (which is good btw) at the start and at the end, it's all text.  Fortunately, it is  not badly written.  + The character you choose on your team matters.  Really.  Not only for their stats but also for their personality.  They all have qualities and flaws and you'll have to deal with it.  Really.  Some character won't get along or won't agree with your course of action.  This is a really intersting mechanics and it is well implemented.+ They make you care about the character on your team.  Because they have a personality and will react to your decision you will grow to love them.  Or in some case, hate them.  I could have added this to the previous point but, it is so good, I had to make another point for this. + The choice you make have consequences and some of those choice are mutualy exclusive.  This is not a game where you'll be able to see everything in one playthrough. Also, the consequences of your choices are not always obvious and I personnaly enjoy the subtility.  Something something is gonna reward you, or come back to bite you, futher down the line and you might have not expect it. This also means the game has a good replay value.  You might want to try one game where you're a do-gooder diplomat and one where you're an evil tyrant. + Multiple endings that account for what you've done throuought the game.  Not only for one or two choice at the end but also things that might have seemed not so important at first. + Team management during exploration with random events.  You have to make sure everybody can eat, that food doesn't go bad, that injured people get healed and you can research some techonologies.  Your teammember can also get hurts during hunting, or  your cart can break and you loose your movement for the day or, you can get attacked during the night.  And those attacks can be really though.- There is not enough variety of random events and you often see the same one coming over and over again.  At one point, they lose their magic. - You can solve the team micro-management.  At some point, when you have enough competent member on your team, you'll have it figured it out.  The injured will be healed, everybody is gonna be well fed, medicine and traps will be produced, etc.  May be there could have been a little more strugle there.+ Comabts where stategy matters.  Fights can get tough, you have to think and use your skills to overcome.  Not only you will to choose a good team for the fight but you'll also have to use the environement and, if you can, prepare the battlefeild (with baricade and traps). + The game doesn't necessarily scale to your progression.  You can venutre and encounter groups of enemy way stronger than you currently are.  And you probably will. And get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked. + Loosing a fight is not the end of the world.  Even some important fight in the storyline can be lost.  The game will account for it but there is no game over screen.  Adjust to the defeat and carry on.+ Land exploration is not just to get to one point to the others.  You can find stuff.  Not only treasure but also quest, ally, ressource and even village.  It doesn't feel like you're just going through; ou have to explore and discover. And finding your way is not always easy.- A lot of quest have you go around from point a to point b.  Those are fine when point b is new to you  but when it's a place you already visited, and you have go do a lot of back and forth, it can get boring.+ Music is good and appropriate.- Sounds effect are not that great.- Graphics and animation are not the best. Also, the whole color palette is really bland.  I guess they were going for something more realistic but I wish they would have opted for more saturated colours.  - There is no enough of it.   Ok, this is not a real objection.  My first playthrought took me about 23h.  Pretty decent for a 20$ game.  But seriously...- The map is a little small.  May be, once again it is just that I want more but, at first, the world seem really vast then, you realize it is no so. That's about it.   I hope this will help you make an informed decision.  Final score: 8.5/10			"

												Now I played my fair share of RPG and TBS games, but somehow this one really stands out!! It has a compelling storyline, great atmosphere and challenging TB battles. But what makes this game so special is that you are not running from  battle to battle, as a matter of fact you can avoid battle a lot if you want, but the building and sustaining of your team everynight at the campsite is the part that's different and most fun. That is when you keep morale up and hand out chores for obtaining food or healing or researching or making traps and so on. Also you give out food rations and talk to team members sometimes. Everything has a consequence: if you decide to attack a tribe than maybe your peaceful team members will lose moral or if you are too cautious then your adventurous team members will lose moral, then there's pious ones, altruistic ones, narcissistic, courageous etc. Every member has three traits that determine how he/she will react to your actions. Very well done and very hard to keep them from deserting you.  Recommended!!!!!!!			"

What was the point of hiring all those people if I can never use them all?My friend recommeded this game so highly that I bought it when it was on sale but after trying to play the game everything about it felt stale - combat was very limited and extremely dependent on the RNG gods loving you.

												While I do like the setting and the characters for this game, this game has many problems that force me to give it a thumbs down.  The main problem is that your characters tend to miss more than 7 out of 10 attacks when they have a hit chance at 80% or more.  The enemy characters make 9 out of 10 attacks with a hit chance at 80% or more.  This can make you lose battles that on paper you should win.  For me this made me lose interest in the game very quickly as I lost way more battles than I won.  Overall this was a poor attempt at making a game set in the Spanish exploration in America.  This game is not worth the money.			"

												This game is a gem.The tactical turn-based combat is great, mixing the simplicity of combat from tile-based games like Heroes of Might and Magic with carefully planned encounters and maps to keep things interesting. The remainder of the game is a blend of adventure, resource management and RPG which is also reminiscent of games like HOMM or Kings Bounty, but with the resource management component focused on you and your party of Conquistadors (keeping them busy, feeding them, and tending their wounds) instead of managing an empire of several cities.The overarching plot provides an insight into Spain's pivotal and brutal role in the fall of the Aztec empire and the colonization of Central America, and was a learning experience for me, who wasn't familiar with the history of the region.

												For an Indie game, this is amazingly smooth and bug free, it's also incredibly flexible, there is a storyline, but the pace and the outcome all depend upon player choices - your actions have consequences!  It's a highly immersive game (my playtime was at 12 hrs before I realised there are no voiceovers) with a smooth and flexible combat system and an ongoing resource management minigame in the, ahem, camp system.  Your followers are individuals with minds of their own, your decisions will raise or lower their morale depending on their personality traits, you can pick your group with a certain type of roleplay in mind and your followers will keep you in line.A very fun game with quite a lot to it, but without a massive learning curve.

												This was a surprisingly good game.  The combat piece is nothing new, but the depth of storyline and intra-party interactions are top notch.  The development of the story does a great job of putting things in a historical content while still allowing the user to dictate the course of that history.  The personalities of each party member selected vary drastically, even past their contribution to combat and camp activities (which, ironically, can be a bit on the generic side).  The party mix and user choices drastically affect how the game unfolds.  Although the stagnant maps can seem to limit the replay value, the potential of learning more of each potential party member helps to make up for that.  Overall, I definitely recommend this to fans of plot-driven as opposed to action-driven RPGs.			"

The first game or two can be brutal and frustrating until you know a few tricks to get a decent team equipped and supplied. Overall I give this game 9/10.Spoiler alert. The tips I share below may contain spoilers of a sort. Or not.Tips. Set the game to easy mode on your first play through. Do the tutorial. When the tutorial is through, grab all the quests in the starter town. Run the bibles to the village. Use your money ( Treasures) to buy as many supplies/food as you can. Wander around in the jungles, away from the roads, and hit the camp button often. Look for ""harvest medical herbs"" in the contextual window on the right. Harvest and process these herbs into medicine until you are low on food (around 20-30 rations) then go to towns/villages and trade the medicine for equipment and more food. Rinse and repeat as many times as you want. But at least fill the equipment slots on your main six fighters/healers/support team.   Lastly avoid looking for the rebel camp and Esteban at the mines until you do all the other quests in this area. This will prevent the random battles where the rebels attack you, often with a surprise attack. And you are almost always outnumbered. Or,  fight these battles to hone your tactics.Mexico, wich is your next area, is huge and the enemys are better equipped and smarter (if you have the settings on normal or higher) and getting your main battle group fully equipped and leveled up a few times before getting there will allow you to have fun instead of getting your butt kicked by the AI.

Avoiding game problem/crashes would not be much of help.====2nd Review=====Ever since the patch 1.6.6, thus eliminate all the crashes finally I can play this game peacefully. Thank God!1. There are tons of choices that you make in game, whether you wanna be the bad guy or the good guy. You wanna slay all the way into the game? kill them all2.  There are cheat codes. God I love games with cheat codes!3. There are another cheat codes4. Oh some cheat codes5. There are trainers out there lurking6. This game have simple equipment for your troops, all you need is assign equipments to your units and make items to be deployed in battlefield. It's a plus or minus, but I consider it as a plus.7. There are light romance, wish they add more! come'on this is expedition with lots of people out there and you tellin' me there won't be love?

I've just begun to forage (I think I only have 8 ""days"" in game on expiditions) so I have not yet crafted any traps or such to use in battle. But I already love the feel of it.

												Great turn-based strategy/RPG game! The one thing that stood out to me is the dynamic of having to balance the different personalities and prejudices of your party. A great exercise in leadership decision-making that you don't normally see in this type of game. Of course, with enough resources, you can eventually get back into the good graces of even your most disagreeable party members, but those resources are at times woefully limited. Choose your party based on your style of gameplay and they will follow you anywhere!			"

												A turn-based rps set during the age of discovery in the Caribbean and Mexico? Count me in. It's really a pity that instead of beating the nazis for the zillionth time, we aren't often given the opportunity to play games set in other very interesting eras, such as this one. I generally mistrust all these crowd-funded projects that have been trending lately. But the setting and style convinced me to give this game a shot when it was on sale. 30 or so hours of playing later, I'm happy I did.Despite obvious similarities to HoMM on the campaign map, the setting and its heavier RP elements help it make its mark. The story is loosely based on the actual events of the Spanish conquest of Mexico and is quite compelling. The game allows you to choose the path you want to follow and how you will interact with your troops and NPCs. You can be a friend of the common soldier, or a distant general. You can be a ruthless conqueror, or a friend to the natives. You can be an ally to the Aztecs or their scourge. And so on.Moving on to the tactical part now, the game offers a combat system which is both tactical and hard. The game has a finite and pre-determined number of battles. Which on one hand means that quite some attention was paid to them individually. On the other hand, there is only so many different ways you can play the same battle before you get bored of it. It would have been interesting to see what the combat system could do, if the game included completely random battles as well. Focusing some more on the negatives, it generally feels that the game lacks polish. There are several bugs and it becomes quickly obvious that it sorely needed more funding and work. There is also the question of content touched upon when talking about battles earlier. To put it simply: I wanted more. I'm not implying that the game is short, at least by modern standards it isn't. But by the time I finished the game I haven't had my fill yet. I felt that the game could give much more than it did.Still I will recommend this game. It hasn't really made me a believer as far as crowd-funded projects go. But at least it showed me that even in such projects, there are good ideas that can actually make decent games. I certainly hope the team will have better luck financing their next project.Verdict: Buy on sale.			"

												Should you spend 15-20 dollars on this game… YESLet me start by saying most likely you will play the first 5-6 hours of this game a few times. The learning curve is steep. But once you get it down; those extra features make the game a great play.What do I mean by the learning curve… 1)MOVING- knowing that you can rotate the camera 365 degrees (right mouse click) or the fact you can use space bar to move horse, or  select a point of interest on the map and it plots course for you.2)LEARNING CHARACTER UPGRADE-  When you upgrade units you can select skills in those upgrades (do you go for block… do you need a good patrol person or a guard) understanding how those work in game takes a little time… 3) THE EXTRAS—let person X work on a cart, or a axe, or cannon balls. How much armor do you want on each person… ECT, ECTOnce you know that stuff.. this game is fun (though makes you want to do a face slap sometimes).THE REASON YOU SHOULD BUY THIS GAME—1)The devs spent lots of time in the story (true historical fiction) some of the people/places are real and historical.2)upgrades you can see… a shield when you have stronger armorand small things like that3)combat maps… you are not always on a 16x16 map like other hex games.. sometimes in a large map, sometime a long skinny one… lots of varity4)you can change you party based on if you want to be a ruthless killer, or maybe more civil (but who does that) "

												I have no idea where this game came from. I heard nothing about it. I just saw it on Steam the day it came out, and thought it looked interesting. Now, during the Steam sale, I had a moment of weakness and bought it (which I really really really really shouldn't have.) I'm glad I did. I absolutely love this game. It's got a board-game-ish feel, and it's one of those games that I can see people thinking is boring due to it's slow movement and pretty much being entirely based on exploration. There are really two games in my opinion that dance the line of being boring and being absolutely amazing; Expedition: Conquistador, and Sid Meier's Civilization. Civilization has long been one of my favourite games, and now this game has rocketed it's way to being right up there as well. There are some things that could have been polished better and it could be a bit smoother sometimes, but that's all visual stuff, and I feel either some patches or possibly (hopefully) a sequel with iron out and make this game perfect. For now, it's just gonna sit pretty on my list of favourite games. I love it.			"

												Initial reaction (about 12 hours in): I was very surprised by just how solid this game was. Wonderful writing, a feeling of freedom in terms of choices and approach, plenty of choices that seem to matter - love the hundreds of little decisions this game requires. In all, this game has completely sucked me in, in a way that I haven't been in a long time; Wasteland 2 might be the only game I can say that has recently pulled me in like this has. There is a learning curve here, and there doesn't appear to be too much out there in terms of guides/tutorials in english. This matters obviously in terms of the learning curve, but also because not all of the reactions based on character types are at-all obvious (sometimes they are, but still, I found myself surprised by negative party responses on a couple of different occassions). In any event, I found that just jumping in and playing through the initial learning curve was quite doable, even if it requires a restart. This isn't a paradox type game where you literally might not know what to do to start. The map movement is a little clunky as well, but given just how wonderful this game seems to be it is completely forgivable. I'd recommend it.Will update review again as i play further.			"

												Despite the largely uncritical representation of violent European Colonialism, this is a really good turn-based tactical game. The world map survival stuff is only a challenge at the start, and you need to pay attention to it to advance, but really the overall game is pretty good. Combat is comparable to Blackguards but I actually liked this better. There's a few different story options so it rewards a couple of replays.			"

												Much fun, all aspects.  The player can often choose to get along with the locals, or help some groups.  Someone in the group is going to be unhappy every choice, though, so keeping up morale is interesting.  Camping is a constant juggling act of roles -should one hunter guard and beef up security?  This reduces the risk of bad things like thieves stealing rations or equipment, but also reduces the chance of the hunting party bringing home food!  The content is great though fairly short, and there are very few random battles.  I wasn't able to build up a truly awesome group before winning, and without any randomness, replay is limited.  Still, I'm ready for part 2, or expansions, or new maps!			"

												While a good game for story, choices and some slight management, the combat kills this game for me.  There feels to be a generally lacking department as far as the battles go.  I've only just finished the first area of the game and moved onto the second, but it feels the same and its getting really boring for me personally.  Battles almost always play out the same, with only a few differences being when you have to outlast a certain amount of turns, but generally I do the same thing every battle as it seems to be the only way to get through them sensibly.  That being said, the choices presented in this game through party selection as well as ways to approach encounters with both foes and friendlies alike is some of the best I've encountered in a while.  I say give this game a chance, maybe you won't find the combat to get too repetitive for you.  I'm going to personally continue this game and perhaps the combat will continue feeling dull to me, but I feel like I need to complete the game just to see how the story plays out.  Unfortunately due to combat, it'll only be in short one hour segments every day most likely at this point.			"

												Expeditions: Conquistador is a difficult & story driven turn-based game!-Easy to learn mechanics. Once you have them figured out, it's easy to use them, but you need to be smart with how you train your crew members-Character personality. Although the characters don't get involved with story as much as i would like them to, you do get to know them pretty, especially when you read their backround.-Build your own expedition team! Choose the characters YOU WANT.-Decision making. Many of the decisions you make greatly effect the story as well as the situations you find yourself in.Now about the negative stuff:-Many enounters are roughly the same. THIS DOES NOT ruin the experience or make it less fun, but it would be a nice addition. Most of the battle maps that you fight in are small,. You cannot be very strategic without barricades & traps which are hard to come by BUUUUUUT, the same makes up for it with it's unique design and terrain. You can use rocks, buildings and other things to hide behind, and use for ambush points! Conclusion: The game doesn't offer the most strategy that it could, but it still offers a lot.-If you lose ONE FLIPPING BATTLE, it greatly effects you to a huge extent. To the point that you will want to reload your last save. When you lose, all your troops get injured and you CANNOT use them in battle... So, all your weak guys are left, and the enemy you lost to will attack you again.In the end, it is still a fun game so long as you play it correctly. I have played almost 20 hours, and am still not finished. That's $1 an hour... That's pretty good. "

												Being a fan of ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"" I've decided on the spot to play this one on ""Hard"", even though I had no experience with this game before and I need to say that this game is one awesome spanish conquistador simulator/tactical cRG with some survival & magic elements put for fun in it. You can play this game as a bloodthirsty, even mad conqueror or as a courageous and just explorer. The art is great, music is awesome and plot is very interesting. You can learn quite a lot about the New World around in XV and XVI century.Quests are fun and doesn't leave you with this bad aftertaste of being repetitive. Characters have their own classes and small sub-plots that enrich the experience and actually makes you like them easy. Difficulty level can be adjusted to your personal preference and strategy vets can really feel the necessity to make important decisions pretty much on the spot.I'd only wish this game showed the fall of Aztec civilization and evil doing of player's expedition more explicitly in art instead of written description (fall of Aztec Empire was a dark time).On the tactical level, Expeditions: Conquistador provides player with interesting battles that can be often approached in different ways and player needs to keep his expedition in shape and manage the risks coming with leading his party into deeps of the jungle as many risks await for him there...In overall, I give it a clear 9/10 score. Must buy for fans of history and tactical cRPG's.			"

												I've played through Expeditions: Conquistador multiple times, and likely will again someday. There's just so much here. To wit:- The tactical combat is excellent. You will be punished for mistakes - especially on higher difficulties - but you can also win against the odds with careful planning and team composition.- The storytelling is fantastic, and every possible combination of characters you take with you subtly changes how your expedition unfolds.- The ""tutorial"" island before arriving on the mainland is so good that I can't imagine playing a full game without it. It does more than introduce you to mechanics. It tells its own compelling and entertaining story.- The soundtrack is awesome.- The UI is functional, though hardly groundbreaking.- Ditto the graphics.- The game throws some excellent surprises at you if you explore enough. Indeed, this is the rare game that - while ostensibly a tactical RPG - is truly about exploration. Take your time. See the map. Once you learn how to survive in the wild, you'll be rewarded for poking into every corner.- Ironman is truly rewarding. It's an accomplishment to make it back to Europe in one piece, much less to achieve higher glories and honors.On the whole, I unquestionably recommend this game to cRPG fans and tactical strategy fans of all stripes. The biggest caveat I would make to my recommendation is that there IS some randomness (more than some) build into Expeditions: Conquistador's core mechanics, and at times it feels unfair to miss that 95% chance. You can and should strategize around those possibilities, of course (in a long game, 1 in 20 will happen!), but players who get frustrated when RNG doesn't go their way will likely want to play on the non-ironman setting.

												Expeditions: Conquistador is a turn-based tactical crpg set in the early years of spanish colonization of the Americas.Visuals are decent, nothing too fancy. It looks okay from afar while still acceptable from close-range. Battle units look good with easily distinguishable appearance. An extensive amount of bloom applied at some places, especially in towns which looks awful. It can be turned off, but other areas will look rather bland if done so. Also, most of the map consists of forests and places with vast foliage and the view is getting obstructed too often by objects. Some sort of transparency or alternate view would have been good.The game itself features various South American locales. You are some rich kid who set sails to conquer the new world but soon realizes that there are already people who control places where you do not have as much influence as you hoped for. There are tribes to handle and deserters to slain. The options available during quests and various encounters are similar to those seen in old crpgs like Wasteland or Fallout, however much simpler. It is still nice to read background stories about your people who you picked by hand at the start or settle disagreements via diplomacy instead of violence. It feels disjointed and without proper consequences at times, but gives the game the illusion of choice a bit.Gameplay is pretty much Heroes of M&M with a few extras like survival aspects and without the extensive kingdom-building. There are towns where quests can be taken. You have unique people with classes whom can be leveled up with the gained experience. Classes are soldier, scout, hunter, doctor, scholar. Each of them has their own use both on and off the field. The survival part means that turns become days and camping is important for survival. You have to assign people to hunt, patrol, guard, tinker or preserve materials. The system is simple with exact numbers, however the randomization can be quite frustrating. You can lose stuff during the night because of one bad 'dice-roll'. You can save anytime while being on the world-map, but there are a few encounters which happen no matter what you do, even moving to a safer place and having 90% of guard at night result in theft. And these are not even the story related 'hard-coded' events. The game screws you over from time to time no matter what you do. World-movement is also pretty clunky. The game automatically sticks to the road - because it is faster I presume - but if I run out of steps on a path I will have a big chance that I get robbed during the night. I constantly have to move away from the road which sometimes really hard to do due to movement and camera restrictions. And the camera is really restricted. No proper zooming, so you can only see things around you. Also, camera is stuck into tree and other objects. After some time I started to constantly use the ""vontrier"" 'cheat', which detaches the camera and allows free spectating.I am not a big fan of the overall system and I would not say that I am satisfied with combat either. It is turn-based with hex-movement. There are combat skills. Flanking is present. Everything seems to be in order at first glance, however right in the first battle I noticed that those percents which would show how likely is for a ranged attack to hit the target are pretty much useless. My archer with 72-76% hit chance missed 4 out of 7 shots, while my soldier missed only once out of 3 with his supbar 30-35% chance. I do not know if there is some kind of background balance, but the interface should show values that I can base my choices upon. This one thing makes the combat a frustrating mess. Melee attacks succeed all the time - though they can be blocked -, so it is easier to gank the hell out of the enemy with a few soldiers. Battles could be tedious after some time because there are not many type of units. Most of the time I fight against soldiers just like mine which is either boring or frustrating because even freaking fishermen look and fight like well-equipped soldiers. Even with higher level well-equipped units I did not feel more powerful. In one pre-determined situation my camp was attacked by rebels. I faced 10 of theirs but I could only use 6 of my 11 people as always. Unfairness once again comes to mind here and the game full of these unlogical punishments. Also, their hunters are much better than mine for some reason constantly hitting my troops while I never had the chance to use them properly due to the high miss rate. This just does not make any sense whatsoever. One more thing that I have to mention is how chaotic the battlefield is due to the absence of any kind of tactical view where I can see all the troops and movement tiles clearly. Foliage is ever-present on these maps thus it is really hard too see anything sometimes. Actions are also hard to make due to everything including troops, rocks, tents, etc. get in the way both visually and mechanically. It would be much if I would only have to select the tile where I want to perform an action instead searching a dozen of units for a clickable point.The audio presented in the game is quite bland. Sound effects are repetitive and low quality. Ambient soundscapes are really plain. There are no voice-overs for dialogs. Music is good but repetitive. I feel that despite being a lower-budget title EC should have better assets as the ones featured in the game are pretty inconsistent and overall insufficient.Content wise the game brings a fair-sized world to explore. There are two campaigns available. Decent amount of land can be covered. Repetition should be the main concern here as the filling is pretty much the same during the whole game.The ideas implemented into Expeditions: Conquistador are rather mixed. There are really good parts of the game which should be developed further and worse which should be reworked from the ground up. The handling of units, questing, dialogs and basic combat is good. The randomization and unfairness the game hands out to the player is far from it. Being difficult is one thing but the constant punishment just makes the game frustrating which does not go well with the flawed controls and sometimes repetitive nature of the game.MY OPINION: 6.5/10 (AVERAGE)Graphics: 7/10World Design: 7/10Gameplay: 6/10Sound: 6/10Replay Value: 7/10			"

												If you like turn-based rpgs with replay value and micro management, this is right up your alley! This game has me completely addicted. Multiple followers and stats to choose from during campaign creation, hex-grid, your choices have an influence on the story and rewards thorough exploration, and explore you will! Easy setting is very easy and I recommend it on the first playthrough to learn from mistakes. There are several dozen achievements to raise the stakes as well- The only downside is that the game is relatively short. A single playthrough takes between 20 and 30 hours.All in all, I sincerely recommend this gem. I can't wait to see what similar game these Scandinavian wizards release next. I'll be sure to buy it!

												For an Indie game, this is amazingly smooth and bug free, it's also incredibly flexible, there is a storyline, but the pace and the outcome all depend upon player choices - your actions have consequences!  It's a highly immersive game (my playtime was at 12 hrs before I realised there are no voiceovers) with a smooth and flexible combat system and an ongoing resource management minigame in the, ahem, camp system.  Your followers are individuals with minds of their own, your decisions will raise or lower their morale depending on their personality traits, you can pick your group with a certain type of roleplay in mind and your followers will keep you in line.A very fun game with quite a lot to it, but without a massive learning curve.

												This game is a sleeper.. The first time you play it you will be convinced you don't like it. The interface is a little daunting. I was pretty sure I was not going to continue playing.. but for some reason I did. Then you take your party out of the city and your play sessions get a little longer each time. Next thing you know you are thinking about it when you are not even in front of the computer.It is by no means easy. You really have to 'learn' the game. You can't waste a single resource or let your party sit idle at camp. Don't let fresh meat go to waste, preserve it! Turn those herbs into medicine, you will need it! Just figuring out how all that works was like a victory in itself (there are tutorials but they didn't work too well on me lol)The encounters are fun, not always battles, but moral decisions too, and you realize you can't please everyone in your party with every decision you make. The battles can be frustrating. I don't know if I have ventured too far too fast, but you come up against some tough guys. It seems like losing some fights is all part of the game. If you lose a battle, the game isn't over. You tend to your wounded, salvage what supplies you can and move on. It is demoralizing to lose but there is always next time, and when you pull off a flawless victory it makes it all the sweeter.This game is like the great great grandchild of Seven Cities of Gold. The same sense of exploration and mystery is there. You never know how a village will react to you, or where your next meal is coming from. Sometimes diplomacy works, and sometimes it wastes time and loses you the initiative in an inevitable battle where every move counts. I can't tell you how many times a battle has turned because I made one bad move (damn that 'attack of opportunity')I have a feeling I will be playing this one for a while yet, and I look forward to it more and more after each session. Recommended, but beware it might take a bit of time for it to really hook you.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game.  The turn-based play style is refreshing and lets you plan out your tactics.  The story is rich and interesting, and the visuals are nice if you like to drink art in slowly.  The writing is solid, and the characters are well-nuanced.The game is not going to be enjoyable if you don't enjoy reading or paced progression, though.  I was disappointed that the main character never enters the battle; you just enhance your followers.			"

												This was a surprisingly good game.  The combat piece is nothing new, but the depth of storyline and intra-party interactions are top notch.  The development of the story does a great job of putting things in a historical content while still allowing the user to dictate the course of that history.  The personalities of each party member selected vary drastically, even past their contribution to combat and camp activities (which, ironically, can be a bit on the generic side).  The party mix and user choices drastically affect how the game unfolds.  Although the stagnant maps can seem to limit the replay value, the potential of learning more of each potential party member helps to make up for that.  Overall, I definitely recommend this to fans of plot-driven as opposed to action-driven RPGs.			"

												Pros:        1. Smooth animation.         2. Decent graphics.         3. Excellent sound effects.         4. Controls and user interface easy to navigate.Cons:       1. The first game or two can be brutal and frustrating until you know a few tricks to get a decent team equipped and supplied. Overall I give this game 9/10.Spoiler alert. The tips I share below may contain spoilers of a sort. Or not.Tips. Set the game to easy mode on your first play through. Do the tutorial. When the tutorial is through, grab all the quests in the starter town. Run the bibles to the village. Use your money ( Treasures) to buy as many supplies/food as you can. Wander around in the jungles, away from the roads, and hit the camp button often. Look for ""harvest medical herbs"" in the contextual window on the right. Harvest and process these herbs into medicine until you are low on food (around 20-30 rations) then go to towns/villages and trade the medicine for equipment and more food. Rinse and repeat as many times as you want. But at least fill the equipment slots on your main six fighters/healers/support team.   Lastly avoid looking for the rebel camp and Esteban at the mines until you do all the other quests in this area. This will prevent the random battles where the rebels attack you, often with a surprise attack. And you are almost always outnumbered. Or,  fight these battles to hone your tactics.Mexico, wich is your next area, is huge and the enemys are better equipped and smarter (if you have the settings on normal or higher) and getting your main battle group fully equipped and leveled up a few times before getting there will allow you to have fun instead of getting your butt kicked by the AI.

												While it has a few shortcomings like the the buggy interactions between missions or the replacement of the ""fog of war"" by an annoying camera movement restriction, I was surprised to heard it is an indie game, With only a few small bugs, it is certainly fun and entertaining. The theme is quite well implemented and I don't recall a better way of exploration/conquest on this period.It very easy to condemn the actions of the conquistadors took so long ago but when you are in their shoes you have some difficult choices to make and you can play however you like.

												My friend recommended this game to me; I now recommend it to you.This is a turn based strategy game with you leading a party of Conquistadors on a mission to explore Mexico. On your way you get delayed and presented with many choices on how to proceed.Battles are enjoyable. There are multiple ways to come out on top. You can make use of your RPG skills to scout the terrain, or deploy scouts to get an idea of the enemy party. You also select your party for each battle. The makeup of the party, their equipment, rank, and skills, all affect your success. Several difficulty levels allow the game to range from pretty easy, to quite a challenge.I didn’t have any trouble with the game. Some previous reviews mentioned crashing and the need for patches, so maybe waiting two years before playing is a good strategy! With all of the text in the game I expcted many typos, but only found one. (Someone wrote seize instead of cease, if anyone wants to fix it)The story is great and remains interesting until the end. Several reviews mention historical inaccuracies, and freak out because there are too many women in the game… Just pretend the game is based on events which took place on Earth, but in an alternate dimension. There is a lot going on in this game, and if you want to fully enjoy it, read the guides so you’ll better understand the interface, and mechanics before starting. You may also fail your first mission and call it a learning curve. Your second party will make it much further. I couldn't figure out how to equip or use the special equipment (traps, barricades, lenterns, torches...etc.) on my first mission. "

												Quite nice little game, although the graphics drive me mad!Not that the graphics are bad, they are quite adequate for a turn-based strategy game. But the terrain gets in the way and obscures your view so you literally can't see your unit for all the trees! You have to zoom and pan the camera around to see, and that's a really frustrating design flaw in my opinion.Early in the game the mentioned problems made me think ""f*** this I'm quitting"" but I'm glad I didn't after all. The story is very good, and the characters you meet and recruit have their unique personalities. There's a bit of a history lesson in there too.I'd be happy to see a sequel with a bigger map and campaign, and updated graphics and interface. There's a lot of potential in this material.			"

												This is a very tentative positive recommendation, since Valve did not see fit to allow neutral reviews.The first impressions of this game are outstanding. Starting by choosing a group with contrasting characteristics emphases the strategy which will have to be employed in making decisions throughout the game. Getting into the game itself, you are met with lush visuals, quality writing, some genuinely interesting strategic and moral decisions with branching results and nice music. There are lovely little touches, such as echos to sound effects when combat is in a confined area.Over time, though, flaws emerge. Combat is the major one, being a significant part of the game. It is remarkably difficult and frustrating - not through particularly clever AI (indeed, it can be quite dumb, including soldiers standing still while you take potshots at them on one combat map) but through overwhelming numbers and often superior quality troops. Melee combat is overpowered and classes are unbalanced.Combat can be quite sluggish, and the lack of a fast-forward key is an oversight (there is an option to increase the speed generally, but that's it).The camera is frustrating, with your view on the world map constantly blocked by trees. Some aspects of the game are quite unintuitive. For instance, some quests need to be turned in at a town in the first map. Once you have triggered an event in the main quest, though, going into the town will only allow you to access that. Win that battle, and you still can't turn in your quests. A very frustrating situation for players - at least those who don't somehow intuit that you will be able to turn quests in again a couple of days later. The biggest problem, though, is constant crashes. These problems have affected a number of users and the only potential solution is to turn down graphics settings - even on some systems which meet the recommended requirements  (which really should be revised) - and even then it does not always assist.That's a lot of negativity, but I still lean towards recommending it. It's rough around the edges, but well-written, attractive and challenging games deserve attention, especially when produced by a novice studio like this one. By all means give it a go, and I hope you don't suffer the same crashes that I did before buying a new system.			"

The tutorials do a fine job of teaching you the game.  The only thing I do not like is the top down view being blocked by the trees during the combat sequences.  You spend alot of time trying to spin the view to see your soldiers.  The zoom capabilities need some work as well because viewing the area around you on the main map is sometimes challenging.

I GOT A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN SOME GUACAMOLE MISS BARTHELWITZ! Expeditions is depicts (at times) a rather ruthless expansion into unsettled territory, the gameplay fits the bill akin to Pirates Gold! overland map and your tactical XCOM-esq combat.  While the gameplay works just fine, the interesting part is resource management and your relations with the locals and your own party.If you initially hire on peace faring hunters, doctors, etc you may find them abandoning your expedition for going out of your way to engage the enemy.So if trying to run an Expedition is your bag go ahead and try Oregon Trail: Spanish Adventure.3 out of 5 Chiliwigs			"

It really is a solid piece of writing.  And failing a mission is often as interesting as succeeding.As I write this review, there is a special play-for-free offer going on this weekend.

												I was really looking forward to this game as I enjoy tactical RPGs and am always intersted in games with rich settings, espeically historical ones.  Unfortunately this game doesn't do justice to the historical setting it's placed in.  It takes the complexity of the Spanish exploration, colonization, and conquest of the New World and reduces it to a politically correct misrepresentation of the era.  Feminism is endemic in the game and, if my first interaction with natives is any indication of how the game treats religion, you're either stuck making live and let live decisions or you're oppressing and murdering people in the name of God, Church, and country.  There was no middle-ground.  I guess I should have expected this given this line from the game's description: ""Re-write the history of the Conquistadors: Forge diplomatic alliances with the natives... or crush the savages and bring civilization to the pagan tribes!""  It's still disapointing to see such a fascinating and rich piece of history represented so poorly.I found the gameplay to be less egregious but not terribly entertaining.  The camera in the game's traveling mode was maddening in how limited it's field of view was and the tactical battles were boring.I think the game had a very promising concept.  Certainly one that really hooked me into buying it.  It also has some interesting features and mechanics, but nothing so great that I was motivated to keep playing after experiencing the above.			"

												It's amazing what can be done with great writing, an untapped period in history, and hex-grid combat. Expeditions wastes very little time in diving right into the feeling of being a conquistador at the head of a company during the age of colonization, from the politics to the racial divides to the different choices and approaches that you, the player, can take, and how those choices affect the setting and your team. And these aren't faceless dolls or pawns like so many other strategy games, but people with their own policital stances and beliefs and skill sets derived from a pre-made backstory. They have their opinions, and there are regular events that highlight those opinions and how they connect with the rest of the company. This game takes roleplaying to its core and makes you feel like a leader of friends and allies rather than a commander of disposable people.That said, it's not all perfect. The in-game economy of always needing to buy rations or hunt for food can get tedious and irritating when you're in a hurry to get somewhere, the camping system, while interesting, has a bit of a learning curve, and the ranged weapon hit percentages can be horribly misleading. I don't think I've ever missed so many times with an 80% or higher chance to hit. Also, the directions in the second half of the game can get a bit hard to follow. There are quests to be done, but I'm not sure what they are in the service of, while the first part of the game was very well explained and set up. But these are minor when the writing is excellent, the tactical maps and combat AI are both fun and challenging, and the sense of immersion thatt he game introduces is top-notch.All in all, I'm having a real blast with Expeditions: Conquistador, and would recommend it to RPG and strategy fans alike, because there's a lot in here for both. And if you like both of those genres, then it's well worth its price. A different story and setting from the mainstream, gripping characters with very real beliefs and politics, and the feel of responsibility, or power, that comes with making decisions that affect the company and others in the game all combine to make for an excellent gaming experience.Buy it. At full price or on sale. You won't regret it.			"

												BLUF: I recommend this game for the player who likes tactical turn-based combat, mixed in with some exploration and resource management.-Interesting story where your choices have actual implications in the game world-Combat can be brutal, but there are ways to win most battles. You may have seriously wounded party members at the end, though. In some cases, bringing fewer than six members into combat encounter is key to victory. Scouts can move really fast....-Pretty solid underlying game mechanics. While some players may not like the design decisions they are mostly consistent in their approach. Bad player decisions lead to bad outcomes and loss of troop morale, for instance.-Resource management can be a challenge at first. Random travel events can quickly cause loss of rations, valuables, and medicine if you don't assign party members to correct tasks.My only minor issue is the interface. Camping screen is click-intensive and can become tedious, considering you will be there several hundred times during a game. Likewise, a few more hotkeys for combat would most welcome.Overall, a game worth a look for the right kind of player.			"

												It's amazing what can be done with great writing, an untapped period in history, and hex-grid combat. Expeditions wastes very little time in diving right into the feeling of being a conquistador at the head of a company during the age of colonization, from the politics to the racial divides to the different choices and approaches that you, the player, can take, and how those choices affect the setting and your team. And these aren't faceless dolls or pawns like so many other strategy games, but people with their own policital stances and beliefs and skill sets derived from a pre-made backstory. They have their opinions, and there are regular events that highlight those opinions and how they connect with the rest of the company. This game takes roleplaying to its core and makes you feel like a leader of friends and allies rather than a commander of disposable people.That said, it's not all perfect. The in-game economy of always needing to buy rations or hunt for food can get tedious and irritating when you're in a hurry to get somewhere, the camping system, while interesting, has a bit of a learning curve, and the ranged weapon hit percentages can be horribly misleading. I don't think I've ever missed so many times with an 80% or higher chance to hit. Also, the directions in the second half of the game can get a bit hard to follow. There are quests to be done, but I'm not sure what they are in the service of, while the first part of the game was very well explained and set up. But these are minor when the writing is excellent, the tactical maps and combat AI are both fun and challenging, and the sense of immersion thatt he game introduces is top-notch.All in all, I'm having a real blast with Expeditions: Conquistador, and would recommend it to RPG and strategy fans alike, because there's a lot in here for both. And if you like both of those genres, then it's well worth its price. A different story and setting from the mainstream, gripping characters with very real beliefs and politics, and the feel of responsibility, or power, that comes with making decisions that affect the company and others in the game all combine to make for an excellent gaming experience.Buy it. At full price or on sale. You won't regret it.			"

												Very good game. Just one *very* important detail:If you're trying to get the ""historical"" ending, google the victory requirements. The game gives you NO HINTS about what you need to accomplish it until you're basically finished!!! SAVE OFTEN! And use multiple save files. You're bound to run into some VERY nasty choices during the game.Getting screwed out of the ending you want was a pretty bad oversight by the developers in an otherwise stellar game.			"

												Truly surprised at how much I enjoyed this game. If you liked XCOM: Enemy Unknown but want a more story driven experience, I highly recommend trying this out. In all my years of gaming (about 20 or so), I don't think I've ever really played a game with a story that felt so mature. It's extremely refreshing and I think that everyone should try it.This game has a lot going for it+ Really good writing. The writing in this game is a serious step above your average video game writing. I'd love it if more games put this much effort into their writing. The characters you choose to join your party all have really interesting backstories and personalities. This is definitely the strength of this game.+ Tactical combat that is challenging but still forgiving. One of the great things about this is that even though your people can go down in battle, you can still bring them back once the fight is over, granted you have enough medicine saved up. The game ties its combat and survival mechanics together nicely. There's even a little economy system. It's very basic supply and demand, but it's nice to see thought put into all the little aspects of this game.+ Meaningful choices and consequences that aren't always obvious.+ Catchy music.Things not so great:- Graphics are simple I suppose. I honestly thought this was a game that came out in the 2000's. It's not going to put your PC to the test.- Minimal graphics. The game really only has two views: overworld and battle mode. The story is mainly told through dialogue with portraits next to them to show who you're talking to. They do not change expression based on their dialogue. Instead, emotions are conveyed (very well) through character dialogue.- More reading than most games that will probably intimidate people who don't liked to read. Now I know that sounds pretty bad, but I feel like I should point out that I don't read anything other than the internet. So don't think you have to be a book worm to enjoy this game. The game's solid writing and the fact that it asks you to make choices that actually have some weight will keep you engaged in whats going on. There are rarely ever walls of text. I'd compare reading the dialogue to participating in an online conversation with fancier vocabulary.I really cannot recommend this game enough. It's really nice to see a game not pull any punches and just be so driven by its narrative. I honestly think this game makes a great case for video games being art. Play this game.			"

												I was really pulled into this game; its immersion factor was quite high. There is much to say, for I have played it at great length and to completion. Warning: spoilers ahead. Things I liked:The tactical combat was rewarding. I found that most battles tended to end as either Flawless Victories or defeats; there didn't appear to be much middle ground in terms of outcome. I relied on a team of 2 soliders, 2 scouts and either 2 medics or 1 medic and 1 scholar. At first I eschewed the medics, as I felt that the in-combat healing was a little too fantastical for what I took to be a historical RPG. (More fool I, for the apparent rise of 3rd wave feminism 5 centuries early should have clued me on to the fact this game is quite fantastical.) Things I didn't like:""Your guards failed to prevent the theft of 2444 valuables during the night."" What in the holy hell. I understand the concept of RNG, but it felt like A) this happened way too often, as though some factor was not accurately reflected in the Guarding percentages (I never camped at below 85% and always tried my best to max it out at 95) and B) the amount stolen was way out of proportion to the value of other things that could be stolen, such as medicine, rations or various construction materials.  As a result, despite discovering El Dorado, I finished the campaign with Carlos♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at me for bringing back a paltry ~15000 valuables. And that's another thing. El Dorado. While I enjoyed the quests and puzzles, I found the reward in valuables to be quite underwelming. Anti-climatic, even. In fact, I will say the same about raiding Quetzequoatle's temple. I wish I kept track of the figures, but I'm fairly certain my scouts rounded up more valuables on their nightly patrols getting there and back to Tenochitlan. I felt robbed of my glorious victory upon slaying Monteczuma. If I had known I didn't have enough troops in my barracks back at the Stone House, I wouldn't have embarked upon those final quests. I had resolved early on to do as the historical Cortes had done, but could not. I had to let those dirty savages keep their filthy empire of heresy. This was outrageous. The fort/barracks mechanic was introduced too late and not very well explained. I guess I was supposed to have my hermandad sit around and do nothing until some arbitrary number of soldiers was recruited. Part of why I went into the ending when I did (and thus losing Mexico for Spain) was that I was sitting on more XPs than I could spend and so felt that it was time to wrap this game up. The leveling needs some work. More promotions. More things to spend XPs on. I did use my hermandad from the Hispaniola campaign, so perhaps that explains the overage, but honestly, why wouldn't you use the same character?The equipment system was flat and unimaginative. It inspired me neither in terms of cool factor nor in utility nor in versimilitude. Am I to believe that my 15th century Spanish soldiers would find value in weapons made of glass? Or in armor made of feathers? Give me the classic model of equipping units anyday; weapon, armor and accessory. Arquebusses are♥♥♥♥♥♥ Not the♥♥♥♥♥♥ but♥♥♥♥♥♥ These weapons were a big part of how the conquistadors did their thing. That they were inaccurate is well represented, but remember, these ignorant natives had no conception of black powder weapons. Where's the shock and awe? I tried using them but was profoundly dissapointed. Not even a leveled up hunter made them worthwhile. The battle maps were sometimes confusing. It wasn't always clear to me if I could move into a hex or not; sometimes foilage would cover the grid. ConclusionDespite my criticisms, I did find myself playing the game to completion. I think at some point it became an obession. Which is highly to be desired in one's video games. I do not see much replay value in it, but I do look foward to the Expeditions: Viking game, which I will most certainly be purchasing.			"

												I love this game! Definite buy!This feels like how a PC game should feel. Good RPG and squad level tactics. It is not real-time and is turn based, which is great for gamers like me who like strategy and thought vs. twitch.The story is really interesting and really feels like a Choose Your Own Adventure book. Replayability is there with the many options. My only real criticism is sometimes navigating the world map can get a bit clunky (like for example trying to find a mountain pass). I can't wait for an expansion or the planned Expeditions: Viking.			"

Wasn't enough doctors in the group to pull me back from that. Graphics are acceptable and I found the story somewhat interesting to begin with but after 8 hours I just started clicking through things. Easily worth the small price they're asking for.			"

												I was looking for a RPG with an original setting, and was not disappointed.OK, not really a RPG to be honest. If you think computer-RPG à la Baldur's Gate, it isn't. Expeditions: Conquistador is more an illegitimate child from Heroes of Might and Magic series:- explore the map day by day with limited movements- tile movement combat- micro management of your partySo to be short, what's OK and what's not.YES:- setting, perfectly captured and rendered- graphics, I've a small computer and the game runs at maximum details 1920x1080- sounds (you can almost feel the steel and gunpowder in combat)- music (world, combat and story, special mention to the eerie title music, which is just perfect)- immersive story- most of the game mechanicsNO:- healing kinda sucks: no way to heal in a town (seriously?). To heal your party you must camp outside in the woods, with the right amount of medicine. If you fail to do that, you lose followers.- morale management is... strange. You'll have hard time to raise your party morale (thanks to quests and tough social decisions), but hunger alone will ruin it.- camera is fixed on your character, so you'll lose precious movement points losing yourself and taking the wrong path.Fortunately (unfortunately?) to these NO, there are cheat codes, respectively heal your characters (I authorize this to myself only in towns because DAMN), modify your party morale or add rations, and release the camera from the character.Despite these small gameplay flaws, I recommend this game, notably to HOM&M fans, and historic games fans.

												An immensely enjoyable game that makes you really care about the people and the story.  The combat is satisfying to think through and a lot of swearing helps to ward off the inevitable frustration at the combat rolls and produces a similiar feeling to playing old AD&D combat.  Great game and price. Really looking forward to the Vikings!			"

												Straight out of the Sid Meiers playbook, Expeditions: Conquistador is literally all in the name. You go on an expedition as a conquistador and do basically all the stuff a conquistador would do (in a top down strategy game.)PROS: This game really does well with the easy to use tactical commands and team building. There are some challenging battles and a lot of quests/missions to do. You are pretty much on different open islands to explore, but ultimately you are on a linear story. You choose how to play the story and it is different based on choices. Pretty cut and dry.The combat is tactical top down hex grid based which is nice. It's familiar and easy for an average gamer.4/5 StarsCONS: To someone who has never played this style of game it can be daunting to see the different options at the start. The UI isn't as good as it could be and occassionally I get confused when I'm cycling between characters (since they all look the same in their pictures and names.) A huge con for me in this game is actually one of the tactical commands. They don't describle combat at the start. You literally are just thrown in without explanation and you have to divulge on your own that movement and your ability to attack after moving are color coded. Once you learn yellow and orange and green colors and what they stand for you figure it out, but ultimately a counter or icon would be really nice. You also don't learn the abilities without trying them out, which is really annoying when you want to level characters up. The abilities are all kinda the same. Gain 5% of this or 10% reduction of that, but short of using a wiki or researching the games best builds you are stuck just going with your gut. Honestly they could have done a better job with the abilities and just scrapped them all together for pre-made builds. I think it would speed up my leveling and make me focus more on the story and less on the numbers game that E:C creates that ultimately isn't that important.			"

												Conquistador is one of those games that depend on you making your part in the make-believe world. But if you do, you really get attached to the characters. When my scout, Vidal, got sick, I found myself clutching a fist to the skyies and cryed: ""Whyyyy?!""			"

And offers a grand adventure that has amazing replay value due to the different outcomes of events, with so many variables also in terms of your expedition members (who you grow attached to - and who make the adventure) in terms of whether they live or die, or how certain events will affect them.I highly recommend this game, been some time I think since ive enjoyed a game like this.

												To those of us who loved to play PC games back in the early 90’s it can be hard to play modern PC games.  There is so little attention played to the actual game but rather to the flash of graphics or racy women.  Expeditions however is a game more akin to the golden era of PC gaming.  A refreshing reminder of why the PC is the best medium to tell a story inside a game.  Ok enough love, how does the game play you might be asking?  Expeditions is a deep game with a decent but not top notch story.  Game play options are good enough to allow for different tactics and game play methods.  This variety provides a lot of the fun and replayability.   The music and art is what I believe put this game over the top, they work so well together with a the story and gameplay mechanic that I almost feel I am there.  So few games can take me away and capture my heart and imagination, Expeditions can.   So what doesn’t work, well for one historical accuracy has been thrown out the window with female Conquistadors.  I also think the ending is lacking in that it’s a bit of a let down.  However these two poor elements don’t take away enough for me to give it bad grade.      Grade   82/100			"

												This was a very fun game, although, it has many minor flaws. I definately recommend it to turn-based fans. The richness of the story, challenging camp management and engaging dialog more than make up for the so-so combat, which can be very frustrating at times, espcially when the game seems to cheat openly. ie. when every ranged attack seems to fails for you, but the AI lands all their lower probability ranged attacks, on a regular basis, I call that cheating...

												I played this game a lot when it first came out, and I made a lot of progress with my band of merry conquistadors. Giving it a second look, I find that it is not as easy as I remember. I won the turorial battle easily, but I just got creamed in my first encounter with the natives. That's OK; we learn by our mistakes. At four years old, I'm thinking development is finished for this game, but some voice actiong would be very welcome if they ever do an Expeditions 2.  At $22.00 it is a bit steep for what you get, but I'm sure I bought it on sale. At $9.95 it would be worth snapping up if you like squad based combat.			"

												There is a review for this game on Rock Paper Shotgun that NAILED how I feel about it.  It asks you to play a conquistador with all your modern feelings about race and gender equailty, has a very strange exploration system that leaves you blasting randomly into the bushes for scraps, and a potentially interesting camping system that ends up being a lot of busywork and number balancing.Still, the story is great, the interplay between the characters is cool and brings back memories of Jagged Alliance 2, the combat is fun, strategically nuanced, and hard.  I keep coming back to it in 3-4 day bursts, and have no regrets buying it.			"

Trying it out nonetheless was a quite fortunate choice though.A party of 10+ people which still makes you feel like your characters have some depth, an open world with cool encounters, interesting turn based combat and quite enough variety to keep you going all the way and ask for more. Rather than a game I didn't like, Conquistador turned out to be one of the very few games in the last years I've played through completely.If you're looking for turn based strategy and have played through all the major brands, look no further.Big +1 from me! :D			"

												First things first. I like this game. I really do. Round-based strategy HoMM style, with a blend of RPG elements, exploring unknown lands as a Spanish Conquistador. I really like this concept.But this game is UNPLAYABLE in its current state. Too many crashes. I have finished the first introductary map and so far I must have experienced around 30 crashes. I can't play the second map, because it won't load the first battle I've run into, no matter how many times I restart the game. UNACCEPTABLE, since this is not a free game.You want to leave to the main menu? No, you can't. Game crashes. You wan to leave to the dekstop? There's also a big chance the game crashes.Furthermore, the map also bugged a dozen of times, covering again with FoW lands that I have previously explored. Over and over again. I can accept some minor deficits in a game, but this is too much crashing for me.NO, DO NOT BUY. Too bug-riddled, too much crashing. Let the devs fix it first.			"

												This evil game loves to ♥♥♥♥ with the player's emotions. It makes you grow attached to your party members only to kill them off because you didn't have the medicine to treat their diseases and lacerations. They'll become crippled in battle and grow hungry throughout your expedition. This is not a very pleasant game and your party's survival is a constant struggle. The writing is quite excellent and reminiscent of older RPGs where we were expected to have some form of reading comprehension. The moral choices you make are actually tough decisions. Do you put down a revolt by force or do you leave the rebels alone (knowing that the rebels seek to create a free nation in this new world)? Do you smite the pagan tribe in the name of economic expansion or do you leave them at peace? Do you fight to the death or cut your losses and retreat?This game truly forces you to slow down and think about your actions and their consequences, since every decision has ramifications. It's a refreshing change of pace from the linear and bland first person shooters that we get today that have no challenging thoughts whatsoever.The only real issue so far is that you can't really pan the camera all that far, so it can be difficult to navigate the map. If you're looking for a mature gameplay experience with a gripping tale, strong strategic combat, and freeform gameplay, this game is for you.			"

												This game is severely underpolished--the combat lacks variety and is highly unbalanced, the overworld map and camping mechanic are boring and repetitive, the quest system and main storyline are stilted, and the characters are so interchangable (right down to the graphics) that you don't care if they live or die. It's a game that could've been good with more development time, but they didn't have it for whatever reason, and it really shows. I'm surprised the team behind this game hasn't made any attempts at updating or finishing their product, and the price point of twenty dollars is borderline ridiculous for a game that's technically complete, but clearly not feature-complete. I can see there were some interesting ideas here, but they just didn't have the time or money to develop them, and the result is an incomplete game that's basically the indie version of shovelware.

												If you enjoy turn-based strategy RPGs and history then this is pretty good game. The world is interesting, the combat is often challenging, and the character building is okay. There are several ways to build your characters ranging from which weapons to use and which skills they are good at, and since permadeath can occur for them you will invest time and effort in trying to keep the people you like alive.

												Expeditions is a turn based combat exploration game where you set out to plunder the riches of the new world by either gaining the trust and assistance of the natives or keeping it historically accurate and putting everyone to the sword with some good old fashioned conquistador zeal.At the start of the game you get to select your band of fellow adventurers and each has their own basic personality traits. This stage is a lot more important than it appears on the first play through as your selection could end up with you having to put up with some serious bickering once you reach your destination. There are five classes Doctor, Scout, Hunter, Soldier and Scholar. Each have their own uses in combat and in resource management. Also it is important to consider the party make up as you are going to get pretty hungry if you have too many soldiers and not enough hunters. The game is split up into two sections, the first is a small tutorial island that you need to complete before you get to move onto your final destination, the mainland. Along the way you can pick up various additional companions from the native inhabitants that give some additional flavour to your band of adventurers and can help fill in any gaps you may have in your party.Essentially the game has three main elements, map exploration, combat and party management. There is a general questline for the game with different endings depending on your actions and lots of side quests activated by exploration of the game map.Map exploration follows a view similar to that of mount and blade where you direct your party using the mouse around a top down view map. The map for the mainland is large and there is plenty to explore, make sure you go everywhere you can before getting too bogged down in the main questline as there are lots of missable locations. Along the way you get treasure chests to loot, herbs to pick, animals to kill and locations to explore. During the map view you are occaisonally interupted by party dialogue or quest events to which you need to respond. Your dialogue choices do have consequences to morale and mutiny is an option if you repeatadly act against a character's personality traits.At first the party management can seem a bit complicated but once you pick up the basics you should be able to keep everyone fed and healthy. The main concern outside combat is resource management, your troops are going to get hungry looting all that gold and medicines are needed to get the injured back on their feet. When you camp for the night you need to assign everyone takes, hunting, patroling, preserving food, researching and mending equipment. After the first few times it is pretty easy to get the hang of and after picking up a few tricks you should be able to keep everyone fed and healthy. The fun starts when that great hunter you have gets injured in a fight and you have to try and compensate for the lost food he would have provided.Combat is a turn based affair, you can select 6 members of your party for each encounter and each character class provides different skills and bonuses. There are different types of combat from a straight up fight to death, defending your camp for a set number of rounds, fleeing from a situation and more. Different scenarios require tweaks to your party compositions so there is a lot of room for different tactical approaches. You can equip troops with melee weapons or rifles and in general a good mix is the best approach. After combat you gain experience to level up your troops and select various abilities. It is always worth remembering to spread out the experience. That high level fighter is great but when he gets injured you need someone to cover his slot in your party who needs to be at least a bit competent.In general I really enjoyed the game and would definitely recommend it. At first it can seem a bit overwhelming trying to keep everyone fed and giving everyone tasks when you camp but it is relatively easy to pick up (the tutorial island gives you a good grounding in the game) and once you have the basics all that loot is there for the plundering.

												this game can be pretty interesting if you dont mind the slow pace. It has 2 campaigns that you can do, hispanola and mexico. I didnt like how the hispanola campaign forces you to explore a lot.. and if you dont get all the tasks done before the town closes for battle your pretty much screwed.The mexico campaign is far better. however the weapons and upgrades never really get powerful enough to mean much which is a let down, but in the mexico campaign you can pick up different people into your group, build a fortress for your people and deal with a lot more resources.. where in hispanola your pretty much broke a lot of the time. the game is all about strategy and living with your choices. the game is pretty unforgiving with mistakes without ironman mode on. all in all if your patient and enjoy strategy over eye candy this is a good game.

												I've only completed the first part of the game and it took me about 22 hours to do so. At first, the pace was very slow as I had to learn the core mechanics of Expeditions: Conquistador. After almost ten hours, I could easily complete quests and win battles without heavy casualties while playing on hard difficulty. From this moment on, I really fell in love with every bit of what makes this a truly great game.First of all, the game comes up with a deep and rich combat system which lets you experiment as many strategies as you want. You can flank your opponents, hit and run, trap them... The AI is not that smart during the first fifteen hours. But as soon as you are about to complete the first segment of the main story line, things are really getting started. The AI is much more agressive and for instance, tends to focus on either your doctors or the biggest threats. It is also able to flank you and to incapacitate your team members in order to quickly win the match.Besides, I really enjoyed the story so far. As a planescape torment fan, I was surprised to go through so well written quests. Wether main or side quests, every piece of adventures I came across was fantastic. You'll spend most of your time reading long texts but they are so interesting and thrilling... What a divine pleasure nowadays! Then, don't even try to succeed without being proficient at managing your party turns after turns. You may lose a battle but you'll surely have to face the consequences. Moreover, you are accountable for every choice you make and your followers will react accordingly to their beliefs and ethic. Thus, sometimes you will be offered the possibility to know more about them and their background.Finally, if you can bear to spend the few hours required to dive in the core mechanics, you'll be rewarded with a wonderful and well written adventure as well as a very deep and complex battle system.

												This game is really fantastic. It really reminded me of how excellent a strategy game can be. The overworld mechanics really added alot of depth to the experience, AND the combat was awesome. This game is uncomprmising in it's excellence. It felt like each part of the game was really fleshed out. Having party members that can get hurt from the environment outside of battle was really challenging, and having to balance the resources was cool. I loved how sometimes having to get some medicine meant that maybe you couldn't upgrade your soldiers because your equipment wouldnt matter, if everyone got sick and died before any fights began. The options you could take with shaping your party leadds to alot of variety in how you can wage war. I ended up outfitting my party with lots of meele troops and cutting through the natives most of the time, but don't let that make you think this game is easy, a lot of the time I found myself trying to form shield walls and trying to form up in chokepoints with my guys b/c otherwise I'd get surrounded and slaughtered. Running around the overworld was great as well, It reminds me the old school Heroes of Might and Magic games in the best way possible.If you liked the XCOM game that came out in 2012 you should give this game a shot, they are similar in some ways, but very distinct takes on the strategy rpg genre. Is this game is better than XCOM? I think that's up for debate, but this game is harder.			"

												If you are into strategy ""thinking"" games with a historical bent you will love Ex:C.  It has several qualities that have kept me interested for 40 hours (and still going on first playthrough):> The writing is fantastic.  The story revolves around your character, a spanish captain charged with exploring the new world shortly after Christopher Columbus made his initial ""discovery"".  You hand pick your expedition members each with well conceived bios and character traits. The story unfolds as you encounter new people and places, and is told through text and stylistically drawn images and portraits... the writing is so good I find myself hoping that the next village or encounter will have some description associated with it.  Honestly this adventure could be converted into a book.> There are hard choices to be made. Most encounters provide an opportunity to choose your response, often with very tangible benefits and consequences.  Like the Walking Dead telltale series, the best choice is not always obvious.  Many times I left the choices up on the screen and went to do something else for a while to think about how to respond.  Although I could have simply chosen one reponse then reloaded the game if I did not like the outcome... the ""role playing"" feel is so intense doing so would break the immersion.> Its an excellent survival simulation.  This game captures the feeling of being at the mercy of the land, and effectively manging your available resources to survive... especially at the beginning of the game.  > Its historically accurate.  Many people and places you encounter are based on historcal fact.  There are historical codex entries that unlock as you encounter them... this adds to the immersion.> The tactical battles are fun.  The battles are based on a hex grid and are turn based like most games in this genre.  The battles can be very difficult in the beginning until you learn how to work with the available terrain and get the right mix of skills on the battlefield.  Once you unlock more advanced weaponry then the real fun begins.I honestly did not encounter any bugs.  There are a few things I might change to fix some immersion issues:1. Let doctors heal themselves.2. Make using a lantern or cannon expend a party members turn.3. For the cannon, make it necessary for someone to be next to it.Very minor things that at this point I don't really worry about.  An excellent game and if there is a sequel I will snatch it up immediately.9/10			"

												This game has character and you decide what that character may be.Although the game may look pretty basic on the surface, it has a good amount of depth to it (it has been compared to the original X-Com, although I can't say this from experience). Decisions you make impact your experience playing through the rest of the game.You start the game by picking what character stats you want. Two of the more important stats are diplomacy and tactics. You can focus on diplomacy if you want to talk your way out of situations or you can rely on tactics if you want to intimidate or gain a favorable position at the start of battles.Next, you decide which expedition members you want to take with you. This choice not only impacts who you can take with you into battle and how well you can survive off a foreign land, but also personality traits of members affect their morale & loyalty based on decisions you make. The game itself is turn based fighting/exploration/diplomacy done with an isometric view. You need to camp after a set number of moves while exploring and there are random encounters that always keep you on your toes. The dialog is not only decent but at times it shines by providing lots of character to your expeditions members and some of the other NPC's you meet.For an indie title, I am amazed at how well this game delivers in both scope and presentation. I look forward to any future titles made by the developer Logic Artists.			"

												I never expected this game to be so engaging.. I heard it was good but I had no idea.My first playthrough I played on Hard difficulty plus adjusted some settings to make it even harder,such as Ironman, and possible Death from my followers, as well as resources being more rare.As of this review I played 6 hours and completed the first chapter.Though admittedly I rushed a little, and I technically should have failed; and so wish to re-do my playthrough.The game had me at the edge of my seat though.. most of the time resources were very scarce,my people were barely scraping by.. I even had a mutiny at one point and lost a couple people to that.In the end only one person in my expedition survived, another reason i want to replay.Though luckily if I wanted to continue to Chapter 2 I could take that one person as well as a swath of freshrecruits.This game reminds me of a mix between XCOM and Long Live the Queen.Imagine XCOM if you actually really got to know your soldiers, their backgrounds and history.Having them ask your permission to depart on a different expedition temporarily,or having them be kidnapped and sacrificed by heathens.I really felt attached to each of my expedition member, and was truly sad each time one of them died for onereason or another.If you enjoy XCOM-type games and/or visual novel-type games then I highly recommend this.Very engaging story, very engaging combat and just overall a good game.If I had to point out some flaws I'd say I wish there was more.I have yet to see how long Chapter 2 is but I have a feeling I'll be sad once this game 'runs it's course' and runs out of content.Also though the environment is well-detailed, I wish the character models were better detailed.They're not bad by any stretch but their textures are a little muddy and I could see through some of their seams in their necklines and stuff.(Though it's cool to see their armor update when you upgrade their armor in-game; from light to heavy, etc)Again, highly recommended if you're into this type of game.

												I really enjoyed this game. Old school (it could easily be 10 years old) turn based strategy/RPG but done very well, feels well-polished and the writing was excellent.  The AI was a little stupid at times and the battles got a bit formulaic but there was just enough variety in the various quest scenarios to keep it interesting.The game also does a good job at introducing a bit of history but it always remains light and fun.  Perhaps it could have been a bit darker by offering more reward for bashing the natives and more punishment for helping them to try and illustrate the historical attitudes of the Europeans of the time.I got his on the cheap from the Humble Bundle but I’d happily pay its advertised price and will look out for future games.

												First of. I’ve played this for several hours offline but Steam doesn’t show that. This game is not great. It’s truly indie in the sense that you clearly see the budget restraints. See, you walk around as a conquistador. You fight locals and make choices. The choices however make little to no impact. They effect you straight away or there is just a dialog box explaining how it effect NPC:s you never see or talk to. The gameplay outside of fighting feels unfinished. You have to think about resources and where to sleep, but rarely is it an actual problem. It’s like hey, you have to think about this. Except it’s not much thinking. The core of the game is arguable the fights. The fights are ok but again not all the way there. The percentage for hitting with bows are way of, making bowmen louse. The enemy hits way more often than you will. The weapons and armour is just called equipment. You can have several equipment on a weapon which makes it better. Why not have actual different weapons and armour? The fortification you get later in the game is a fun add on but does not lift the game enough. You have to go back and forth there a lot. The characters are fine but leveling up and choosing perks is very generic and with no creativity. They have put effort in making soldiers and characters of both sexes. This is appreciated. One miss step on this is the beginning though. If you choose a female character as leader you will have obnoxious choices in the dialogues. The character screams “is it because I’m a woman?” or “Women can do this to.” completely unprovoked. The weird thing is that during the rest of the game it’s not a big deal that two sexes exists. Some are female and some are male, nothing special about that. It’s great.I put hours in to this because I really like this genre of games. There is however so much better games in the same category. XCOM for example. Don’t settle for this, you are worth better. PS: It works on LINUX!			"

Were it not for poor playtesting and difficulty curve management, this'd be an average game with some good ideas, I'd say a 6/10.  If the devs gave this type of game another go, with a bit more attention to detail, playtesting and polish, they could come up with something very special.			"

												I only played this game on Ironman, Hard difficulty. Thus far, only 0.9 % of players received the ""Masochist"" achievement ( for playing on Ironman mode ) 0.8 % received the ""Pizarro"" achievement ( for finishing the game on Hard ).I first noticed that this game had an unusual design, in that the jungles were so lush, that you could not sometimes see your own character! Your screen is often filled with green, tree top canopies. You get a visceral, authentic sense of wading through a jungle.There are two campaigns.I think that the game trailer is misleading. Similar to 1990's RPGs, in terms of the time spent, this game is 90 % exploration, 6 % questing and 4% combat. The percentages are off, but that is only because the game is so exploration-heavy, that it's hard for me to get an accurate handle on the numbers. As an example, it took me a couple of days, just to uncover the fog of war, for each campaign.You assemble your expedition of ten team members from the following classes: doctors; hunters; scholars; scouts; soldiers. Each class has three statistics of varying degree. As an example, a soldier would be better at ""guarding"" and ""patrolling"", whereas a doctor would be better at ""herbalism"" ( first aid ) and ""tinkering"" ( constructing mechanical traps ).As you explore, you find washed up crates, containing random amounts of: wood, metal, rope and oil. You use these materials to construct different traps that can be used in combat, such as a spiked pit trap.You have to manage food, morale and medicine.During the turn-based, hex-style combat, the AI is fantastic and has fuzzy logic built in. On Hard difficulty, the AI will perform optimal moves most of the time and make mistakes maybe 2% of the time ( similar to playing against a strong, human opponent ). There is a separate slider, to increase the AI to maximum ( which would turn the combat into chess, I'm assuming ). There are 6 levels of escalating injury: ""harmless""; ""moderate""; ""severe""; ""critical""; ""fatal""; ""dead"".The quests are fairly straight forward and the writing was ( surprisingly ) very professional.It took me a while, to warm up to the 18th century art style but the artist is talented.I love the music, especially the combat music ( which is featured in the game trailer ). The ambient sounds of birds and crickets chirping is perfect.The game is stable ( as a game with an ""Ironman mode"" would have to be ). In 119 hours, the game only crashed once and that was when I alt-tabbed into a different window, to chat with a Steam friend.It was a joy to play a game, with such a well programmed, clean and intuitive interface. I'm looking forward to other products, from the developers. I think that I paid less than $4 for this game, which was a steal!			"

												Got this game not long after it came out and stopped playing it, couldn't remember why.  Picked it up again this past weekend, now I remember why I stopped playing it.  My advice:  Recruit as many pious followers as you can, because you're going to need divine intervention for the RNG not to screw you every chance it gets.  Camp for the night, bad RNG keep you losing medicine and supplies.  Get in a battle, your team MISS, MISS, MISS, MISS, MISS, MISS, MISS...the enemy HIT, HIT, HIT, uses skill DOUBLE HIT, HIT.  The game forces you to use barricades and traps, if you don't have any, here's your 10 on 6 battle, survive MISSing for 10 turns.  What a joke. Plus, the game is horribly optimized.  On max settings it was doing it best to fry my video card.  Not only did I have to turn down all of the settings, I also had to create a custom overdrive profile to seriously underclock my video card to keep it from having it's fans spin at 100%.  For a game that isn't graphically demanding, this is just silly(probably a Unity thing though).  Plenty of posts about this...and something else I remember from when I tried this game before.   Running it at 1920x1200 makes the text so small it's uncomfortable to read, with no option to adjust text size.Plenty of other turn-based strategy games to spend your money on, I'd avoid this, even for a $3 sale.

												Explorer heavy game with Xcom like combat and team importance in a Spanish 16th century era of South America. While the graphics wont win any awards its functional and the game is full of FTL like encounters with choices to make.Everything has pros and cons and ""evil vs good"" type choices seen in other games have been replaced with more realism than is some times comfortable. Half of your soldiers are racists? Well, maybe you will be forced to make a racist decision in order to stay in charge. Want to help out a small group of farmers, but your group is low on food? Well, maybe taking the food by force is a eat or starve choice instead of being good or bad... and so on. Its a very interesting game that is different from most in a good way.Recommended.			"

												This game has turned out to be a ton of fun, I would recommend it to anyone who likes tactics or strategy games. It takes all the fun things about Oregon Trail and adds on elements of tactical RPGs to make for plenty of turn-based combat but also resource management and some customization and leveling of your party. The visuals are decent and the sound is pretty good, and the story really immerses you fairly well since you are getting plenty of dialogue and party management choices in addition to random events that crop up for you to tackle along the way. The controls are intuitive and even though there are a number of things to manage, the tutorials do a fair job of explaining without being cumbersome.			"

												Ambitious. Bugged. Beautiful. Cluttered. Revisionist. Old School. Historically-inaccurate. Ultimately...flawed.This is a game that I wanted to love -- that I still want to love. But unfortunately it's flaws are both asthetic and mechanical, and lamentably myriad. EG: The game crashes when you try to return to the main menu, and it does so every single time. No matter how well-trained and well-equipped, your units will ALWAYS perform poorly, while enemy units will always perform with expert precision (even if unarmed, outnumbered, and incapacitated). It wants to push very particular 21st century political reinterpretations of the era of the Conquistadores, but it does so while simultaneously pretending that 15th-16th century Spain was an egalitarian culture in which men and women alike served in the military, in academia, etc. Kind of hard to push the ""EVIL-WHITE-MEN-RUINED-PRISTINE-PERFECT-UTOPIAN-PRE-COLOMBIAN-AMERICA"" narrative when you're presenting the conquistadores as a gender-and-racial-inclusive 21st-century-style group to satisfy the tastes of modern, historically-illiterate players... Etc. etc. etc. What you wind up with is a game that looks lovely, and is full of potential, but which is all the more frustrating and disappointing because of that. Its flaws make its merits into flaws, since they highlight what might have been and emphasize how far short the programmers fell of their apparent goals. I'd give this a pass. It'll only break your heart (and drive you bonkers if you're a historian).			"

												Good tactical turn-based RPG.  However I cannot recommend for the following reasons:-All combat goes down the same way and gets repetitive.  Not as many options as a game like X-COM.-The strategic view invloves running around doing missions and potentially getting sucked into battles.  This is most of the game and it is tedious.  You ensure the party has enough resources to camp then go to point A and speak to character X, then to point B to speak to character Y, then BACK to point A...			"

												This seems to be a combination of a hex map TBS, Oregon Trail, a game with text-based events that require some cultural understanding sort of like those in King of Dragon Pass, and an RPG where you can freely roam around a ""world map"" in a non-linear fashion. The TBS aspect comes in when you get into a fight and must fight a turn-based battle, somewhat XCOM stye, except it's on a hex map. Like Oregon Trail you have to worry a lot about hunting or trading for food and medicine, as well as processing herbs you find into medicine, preserving any meat you can't eat right away, crafting objects to use in battle (like barricades and traps), and researching ""inventions"" that do things like improve your movement rate. Unlike Oregon Trail though, nothing is linear and your followers (except for your slaves/servants) are not anonymous statistics; they speak up and interact with you as events occur and will urge you to do things or object to things based on their beliefs.One good thing about the game is that you have the choice of whether you want to act like a racist conquer, non-racist diplomat, or some combination of both, but regardless of what you pick the game won't go easy on you. If your party is full of aggressive rascists they'll be forced to work with the natives at times and forced to negotiate their way out of stuff, non-rascists will still be forced to deal with the rascist attitudes of others in society, and the peaceful will still be forced to fight. So whether you want to subjegate the heathen savages for the glory of the Spanish crown or promote their acceptance among the Spanish settlers, you won't be able to get by acting only according to one attitude or the other.The mechanics of the game seem pretty well balanced, and they're rather unforgiving when it comes to things like running out of food or being unable to treat your wounded whether due to lack of medicine or doctors. The game is not quite as unforgiving as XCOM when it comes to death; if someone's ""hit points"" (endurance) reaches 0 in battle then they aren't automaically dead, but they have a good chance of being anywhere from lightly to severely wounded after the battle. This is a major problem because wounded people require a dedicated doctor and usually something like 5-8 medicine per day to treat, with one day of treatment needed per severity level of the wound. To make things worse, they can't hunt, guard, patrol, or do anything else useful until healed. On the other hand, the reason you get such an opportunity to save your casualties is that you can't just hire new people like you can in XCOM. While you can sometimes get a new fighter, hunter, doctor, or scholar, you have to *find* them and sometimes convince them to join because they're all essentially one-off special characters, not faceless minions.Overall the game is a well made combination of several different types of game mechanic that I haven't seen all in the same game before this. When I was in high school all the kids used to play Oregon Trail and start out with 10,000 ammunition and no food or medicine because they just wanted to play the deer hunting minigame the whole time. I'm betting the same kids playing ""Expeditions: Conquistador"" would have their bloodlust satisfied by the TBS battles and they wouldn't have to pursue a really silly game strategy just to get in enough fighting. Because of that they might actually learn something while playing.			"

It's like Heroes combined with Sid Meier's Pirates!, but without the fun pirate ship sailing bit.  In fact, this is pretty much a heroe's clone, without city building, just the manage your hero and party supplies part.So what didn't I like?  The story, combat, and atmosphere.  The game really, just made me feel claustrophobic, and I was uninterested in the story, at all.  I found myself just wanting to kill everyone I met, but couldn't...just serve one lord after the next, doing suicide mission after suicide mission.  The combat wasn't great either.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't keep me up all night playing good either.			"

Like this, I would recommend it only for fans starved for turn based combat games. If they had kicked this strange map gameplay, drawn a nice 15th century map and used this for moving, while putting the free resources into the combat, this game would have probably been a new favourite.

												GAME HAS DECENT STORY LINE BUT OVERALL VERY BAD PERFORMANCE. DONT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. CHECK OUT ALL THE PROBLEMS MANY BUYERS HAVE WITH CRASHES. YOU WONT HAVE TO LOOK FAR TO SEE WHAT I MEAN. IN MY OPINION IT HAS TO DO WITH BAD CHOICES AND BAD PROGRAMMING, THEY LIKE TO HINT ITS  TOO MODERN A GAME FOR MANY COMPUTERS, ITS NOT THE CASE MOSTLY AS MANY PEOPLE CAN PLAY THE LARGEST AND MORE MODERN GAMES ON STEAM WITHOUT A GLITCH. VERY FEW GAME HAVE THIS KIND OF PROBLEM. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE, THEY SEEM TO BE HOPELESS AND HELPLESS TO FIX ANYTHING SO I THINK THE CHOICES THEY MADE IN STRUCTURING IT ARE PRETTY PERMANENT. ASIDE FROM THAT, DESIGNERS MADE 50% OF SOLDIERS AND CHARACTERS WOMAN. YES YOU CAN CHOSE YOUR CHARACTERS AND CHOSE REALISTIC MALE SOLDIERS BUT YOU THEN HAVE TO PICK SOME PERSONALITY TYPES THAT WILL CAUSE YOU PROBLEMS WITH YOUR STYLE OF PLAYING WHICH YOU DONT WANT. SAVE YOUR MONEY HERE, LET THEM DESIGN GAMES THAT WORK.			"

												A very graphically-challenged turn-based game, that has you move people, without the ability to actually attack the enemy, or that feature was missing from the poorly designed tutorial, that does not show you how to turn your screen, leaving you to having to look in the settings repeatedly to find the correct keybindings to locate the rotate screen buttons so that you can see the person you need to talk to. Also, the movement of the player is very glitchy, sometimes its works, most times, it does not.			"

												This game is legitimately hard.Expeditions: Conquistador is billed as XCOM set in an Age of Explorers historical fiction.  And as far as that goes, it is accurate.  Expeditions: Conquistador is in fact substantially more complex than XCOM, and also quite a bit more unforgiving.  The moment you leave the first island fort-town in Hispanola, you will end up fighting outnumbered, outgunned, and outclassed.  To wit, I have yet to win a non-tutorial fight.Am I merely doing it wrong?  Have I utterly failed to do some basic this-or-that which would make the game play more smoothly?  Perhaps so.  I don't know what it would be off-hand.  To the extent that there is immersive schadenfreude in getting run off by spear-waving Caribbean natives, this game is effective.  But is it too much to ask for the newbie levels to be a little more forgiving?  It's one thing to sally forth into the jungle with your caravan laden with equipment and supplies only to return a couple weeks later starving, robbed, and bleeding; and quite another to have at least some success early on.I suspect I'll give Expeditions: Conquistador another run in time.  But for now, I'll suck my thumb and play something that won't flay me for having the temerity to hit the New Game button.  Hello Kitty Island Adventure was certainly not on the island of Hispanola.

												All in all quite a dull tactical/adventure game.Also the RPG elements I bought it for are severely flawed.Just distributing "" a generic resource"" to boost characters stats just kills my feel of development and Individualisation of your Party (and thus diversification of tactical options) is nigh impossible. Loot is also just another stat so progression in the game loses the feel of being meaningful.Storytelling is also not strong enough to cope for lacking gaming content.The game strongly feels like a casual one.I bought it also for a lot of strong reviews, but I cannot really see why they happened other for cash/free keys.

												I can't really recommend this game yet. Battle screens can be incredibly frustrating, since it is not possible to zoom out far enough. For example, there is an encounter where the goal is to move your party to the exit point within 8 turns. The problem is that it takes a good 15 minutes of attempting to scroll back and forth to find just where that exit point is. Then each time you want to move one of your party, it takes another 15 minutes to try and locate where each character is and then you can only hope that you have them moving in the right direction. Repeat for each round. Would be very frustrating even without all the trees blocking your view! Better just to quit out (and the game will crash at this point) and restart in the hopes of avoiding that type of encounter.			"

Nothing wrong with the game as such but I personally don't recommend it because I felt it is a tad boring. The graphics as well are a little stressful for the eyes. They really need to improve their camera control. I will keep a watch on the developers forthcoming projects as they do show potential. This game just wasn't of my taste. Thanks.			"

												I tried this game because it's one of the firs turn based games for Linux and was extremely disappointed.As I was playing I only participated in 3 fights. The first tutorial fight, the second tutorial fight involving baricades and a fight for treasure on the beach. I lost all 3 fights and it seems to me that the RNG is broken and always favors the opponent. It works by lowering your chance to hit the farther you are and when you are closer you have a higher chance to hit. Except my guys missed 90% of the time even when right in front of the opponent. While the opponent could stand on the other side of the map, through rocks and barricades and almost always hit (and for some reason almost always got to attack twice).I am not sure what this game is gaining by rigging the opponent to have higher chances of landing ranged attacks, but it is very frustrating to miss 6 shots in a row right in front of a guy while they are landing shots from more than 10 tiles away and through a barricade then getting to attack more than once per unit. It is definitely an impossible game even though they say otherwise when you can never win a fight?Please fix the RNG, it is severly broken.			"

												SILLY RESOLUTION seriousely game is off the screen on my 3.2ghz quad core 8gb ram 1gb nvidea graphics pc, just because my monitor is small and only goes up to 1080p, so the game is entirely off your screen and you can't change the options in the menu to get it on screen, if such options even exist, game should detect your settings and go to a suitable setting or even just start at the lowest and you can set higher width.  But as a result I can't play it or do anything, its a silly silly setup.  Maybe they might change it later but I have to point this out that in this state if you have a laptop or a pc monitor with 1080p width YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY THIS GAME. Buy something else.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, since it's such a facisnating period of history. But this game is beyond historically inaccurate. Any benefit of the doubt that it might have had goes out the window when it you have Spanish military units not just containing women soldiers, but with women commanders. The feminism pressure to change history also extends to the Indians, as does the knee-jerk anti-westernism. Bernal Diaz's history of the real events describes nothing like this. Then add the fact that you waste a lot of time gathering herbs and watching your characters sleep.			"

												Conquistador has been an unexpected delight.  With combat similar to X-com, mixed with team RPG leveling and a great survival aspect, this is an overall great little strategy game.  I got this on discount and would of probably been just as happy paying full price. The main pros of this game come in the rich story, beautiful graphics and battles.  The music is good and I can often find myself playing for long periods without noticing time at all.  The game isnt perfect, and its beyond a challenge to be fair.  At night random events  can seem relentless, harming parties or loosing equipment.  But the game IS hard make no mstake.  I went in without reading any manual first time and my people all died within a few days, second time same again.  Playing on easier modes is less fun, though you can fine tune the difficulty in regards to battles and survival.  Any game that allows you to massacre innocent women and children gets a thumbs up from me, give it a go especially if its on a discount and you like X-Com			"

												I bought this game when it was on offer, not expecting a great deal. I was wrong. I've only scratched the surface at the moment and am struggling to keep my followers alive due to a lack of rations. As a result I had to attack a village and slaughter the people there to obtain their food. I didn't want to but it was either that or starve. Do you want to be a killer or a pacifist? The game gives you those choices but morals don't mean a great deal when your people are starving. And you will learn to care about your people. Some you will like and some you won't. I've played role playing games before but something about this gives you a bit extra. Great game well worth the money			"

												I definitely recommend this one.  For the very reasonable price, you get a clever game that balances some unique logistical mechanics with some more standard game elements, including some great rpg content.  The game forces you to make some tough decisions about how you're going to make your way through the world, and the difficulty is high enough to really tempt you to make some questionable moral choices in order to survive.  Character advancement and tactical combat are fairly standard, but well done - and they do a great job of reflecting the technology level of the setting (i.e., guns suck).A unique gaming experience, and plenty of content to keep you busy - while I'm not sure that I would replay, I've already invested 60+ hours of play time.

												I didn´t enjoy a game like this  in a really long time. You have everythig. Strategy, adventure and a piece of history, in a incredible simple and endearing game, with the style of the firts FALLOUT. Of course the history it is telling here is so tragec, but you can made it a little bit softer. and  understand that the real conquer who was able to destroy completely, the amazing aztecas warrior were more than any, the epidemic. Without the epidemic and the help of another enemy  tribe of the aztecas. spain should have not eonugh resorce for to do such as big campaign.Sorry I think this coment is a bit long. just to say that I am waiting for the second part, may be the avedture of: ""Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca""Thank you for the game.

												This game is actually very interesting.   I picked this and 13 other titles up for $4.99 from http://www.bundlestars.com/all-bundles/adrenaline-bundle/It has some interesting takes on RPG and strategy.   It is interesting that you are the leader of a band of explorers.  You are a conquistador.   There are some training elements for combat that fit really well into the story, but it is also possible to play for a very long time without combat if that is your choice.   You can instead explore, hunt, trade, etc.    The first quest I completed I completed without any combat, though combat would have been an option.    This game is actually pretty refreshing and as part of the above bundle (if you happen to read this in time) it is a steal.			"

												Super fun.  The writing is unusually good and will surprise.  Combat took me a while to pick up, but when I got used to it I got into it.  The party personality trait system is clever, though it doesn't hold up as well on repeat play-throughs.  Resource gathering isn't particularly exciting, but it's not bad for what it is.Definitely worth buying, and worth the time it takes to get used to the game.  I hate a steep learning curve and this game didn't put me off.			"

												This is probably the best western RPG I have played since Baldur's Gate II. The fact that you will not see flashy 3d fights or angels falling from the sky helps you really get into the game. Everything you do is believable and every character you meet is beatifully portrayed. Not many games manage to pull a level of immersion like this. I felt like I was writing and reading a history book. Also it really makes you feel responsible for your actions. Altough you don't need to do a single evil deed to win the game, you will be tempted to, and that's where the game manages to shine. You start off as a conquistador. You dream about the new world, land of riches, maybe you'll be a king someday! But you get there and realize it's not easy to run an army, and most certainly it's not easy to become a king in a land that was doing fine before you even arrived. Wil you be a curse or a saviour? It's all up to you. The game becomes a bit low-fantasy near the middle, and there's also some historical liberties like seeing a lot of women fighting (in the game sexes are evenly distributed while in real life spanish sent very few girls to the americas and the natives didn't send women fight either).The combat system is easy to understand and complex enough to keep you coming back for more. It feels like a bit like Disciples II, but realistic. The choices you make have long-term consequences and it's quite clear the developers do not count on you winning all battles, nor do they punish you for it. Also, the developers are super active on the forums.The game does have a merciless learning curve, however. Do yourself a favor and read the manual before starting, or play on easy. http://logicartists.com/dl/ExpeditionsConquistadorGameManual.pdf "

												I definitely recommend this one.  For the very reasonable price, you get a clever game that balances some unique logistical mechanics with some more standard game elements, including some great rpg content.  The game forces you to make some tough decisions about how you're going to make your way through the world, and the difficulty is high enough to really tempt you to make some questionable moral choices in order to survive.  Character advancement and tactical combat are fairly standard, but well done - and they do a great job of reflecting the technology level of the setting (i.e., guns suck).A unique gaming experience, and plenty of content to keep you busy - while I'm not sure that I would replay, I've already invested 60+ hours of play time.

												This tactictal-strategy gem was made with love by a Spanish studio who's proud of their heritage.  These brave conquistador's adventure is filled with spunky characters, ambient events, game-altering choices, and a verdant mezo-American world to explore.  No other game captures the feel of an expedition like this.  I would't call it a stretch to say this game should be the new Oregon Trail.			"

												I drew some enjoyment out of this game but that doesn't mean I recommend it. In fact, I do not recommend this game.The best summary I can think of is this: ""Things go poorly and people die.""This is a game about being uncomfortable and frustrated, facing the harsh reality that enthusiasm and hope do not produce sucess. You will run out of food, and will have to decide who goes hungry. You will run out of medicine, and must triage your party to determine who should survive a failed hunt or even a spider bite. You will lose combat encounters because you are consistently outnumbered and have only the same options and attributes your enemy does.The caveat is that despite all of your failings, the game will rarely, if ever, hand you a simple game over. Enthusiasm and hope may not produce success, but tenacity comes close. In the end, though, success in Expeditions: Conquistador won't  look like traditional video game success. It will look like you failed forward with some unknown force preventing your necrotic body and hollow spirit from simply dying and escaping this hell.To reiterate and elaborate: I do not recommend this game. But, if you read all the above and still want to experience limbo and/or eternal damnation in the form of Spanish Conquistadors exploring Hispaniola and Mexico, by all means go ahead and purchase the game.

Good luck on it because I'm done. I lost my best soldier,a blonde girl called Blanco, due to a several bone fracture in her face which deteriorated without treatment.6.5/10 because I'm bad at it hahahaAnd I'll set a 'yes' here because i don't think it's fair to make a bad critic on game just because you aren't good.

												A turn-based strategy game about exploring Mexico as a Spanish explorer. Graphics and sound are fine, story is pretty detailled and there's a good amount of events to read as you progress through the main storyline. The setting is pretty unique to me (not used as much as a world war setting) but don't expect complete historic accuracy.You travel across the overworld and do quests, events, collect resources, and progress the storyline with the end goal of returning to Spain. It's turn-based so there is a limit to how far you can move each turn. As you do quests and events, you get XP to rank up your followers (which improves combat stats, unlocks a skill and increases equipment slots). At the end of the turn, you're forced to camp, set rationing of food, and set tasks for your followers (gather food, convert herbs to medicine, convert supplies to battle items, heal a wounded unit, patrol for a chance to find supplies, and guard to prevent theft). The resources you have to gather are food (each follower requires 1/day), valuables (used as currency and how well you did at the end of the game), medicine (used to heal followers), equipment (used to improve follower combat stats), and craft supplies (used to craft battle items).You can lose a lot of resources from theft so may want to end your turn off the road (which has a very high guard difficulty) if the terrain nearby is any better. In the second part of the story, you'll find somewhere to store your valuables (instead of carrying them around to be stolen). However, since you deposit in intervals of 100, you can end up with a negative balance (which is kind of weird).The camera is an overhead camera that gives you some degree of control but there are a few quirks. Going uphill seems to mess with the zoom so after you go downhill you need to manually zoom out again. It feels like the overworld camera is restricted for artistic vision (you can only see so far ahead of you) but I would've liked to zoom out a lot more (with fog for unexplored areas and unlit areas to show vision range) so I could see further and reorient myself easily.The battle camera is alright but I'd still like the option to zoom out more for a big overview so I could quickly check where each enemy starts at the beginning of battles (instead of holding alt and panning around).In battle it would be nice to check enemy stats in more detail than rank and class.You can only set waypoints on the map on points of interest, it would have been nice to create your own waypoints anywhere. It's a little annoying that your movement waypoint disappears if an event box pops up so that you need to set your destination again.All in all, I enjoyed playing through the game. The story and events were the best part of the game for me. They were fun to read and it was nice you could roleplay a personality through different choices. The combat TBS part was good enough- there was unit variety, skills, combat cover, traps, and tactics. It's worth a try if you like reading story and turn-based strategy games like heroes of might & magic (without the fantasy setting- no magic/spell system).			"

												First off, A lot of reviews state that this is a bit like X:COM:It isn't. The combat system is turn'n'tile based, but the similarities end there. AI seems very basic and 'battle arenas' seem too small and lacking (although to be fair i've struggled to stick with this game, so combat arenas MAY be more interesting, if you can hack the snails pace) and the whole combat experience leaves me feeling that more could have been done to make it interesting.Biggest problem is the time it takes to travel anywhere along with the camping system, which comes acrross like micro-management for micro-managements sake with bizzarely some elements being over-complicated and others hugely simplified which makes the whole thing seem half-arsed.The world and the writing does seem alive and interesting, its just that with the time it takes to do anything it leaves me un-interested due to the endless plodding through needlessly dense micro-management, Which is a huge shame as the travelling is so 'stop/start, stop/start, repeat endlessly' it detracts from the interesting parts of the game, as they are sandwiched between huge glufs of dullness. Also the vast party of characters you are given to babysit right from commmencing the game just adds to the feeling of shifting through lists and pages, seemingly just because the game designers have decided thats what a RPG is about. But for me, it seems like a dense barrier which stands in the way of any pace the game has.TLDR:All in all, a interesting world and great ideas thats unfortunately executed poorly.Would be great if it wasn't hidden behind a dense, clunky, dull User Interface that for me, kills the experience stone dead.

												Conquistador has been an unexpected delight.  With combat similar to X-com, mixed with team RPG leveling and a great survival aspect, this is an overall great little strategy game.  I got this on discount and would of probably been just as happy paying full price. The main pros of this game come in the rich story, beautiful graphics and battles.  The music is good and I can often find myself playing for long periods without noticing time at all.  The game isnt perfect, and its beyond a challenge to be fair.  At night random events  can seem relentless, harming parties or loosing equipment.  But the game IS hard make no mstake.  I went in without reading any manual first time and my people all died within a few days, second time same again.  Playing on easier modes is less fun, though you can fine tune the difficulty in regards to battles and survival.  Any game that allows you to massacre innocent women and children gets a thumbs up from me, give it a go especially if its on a discount and you like X-Com			"

												A VERY fun strategy game with some rpg elements in it,  You are a spanish soldier exploring the new world who can choose to decimate the indiginous population, trade with them or make some sort of peace.  The only down-side is the combat.  You can quickly enter into battles that will destroy you, that doesn't end the game though.  After battle loss, you can limp back to town where some or all of your troops will need healing.  If you can't afford it, the only way to then get money is to go and finish missions at half strength or less.  Really, if you lose a battle it's best to load a save anyway.  Save early and often!

												I'd recommend this game to all people who love turn-based rpg. The game's graphic is great comparing to its budget, and the story is quite good and it's non-linear. However, the characters and combats should be more complex--traits alone are not enough to make them different and there are too little combat skills to be used. Finally, intro's narration should be muted because of bad voice.			"

												Super fun.  The writing is unusually good and will surprise.  Combat took me a while to pick up, but when I got used to it I got into it.  The party personality trait system is clever, though it doesn't hold up as well on repeat play-throughs.  Resource gathering isn't particularly exciting, but it's not bad for what it is.Definitely worth buying, and worth the time it takes to get used to the game.  I hate a steep learning curve and this game didn't put me off.			"

												Conquistador has been an unexpected delight.  With combat similar to X-com, mixed with team RPG leveling and a great survival aspect, this is an overall great little strategy game.  I got this on discount and would of probably been just as happy paying full price. The main pros of this game come in the rich story, beautiful graphics and battles.  The music is good and I can often find myself playing for long periods without noticing time at all.  The game isnt perfect, and its beyond a challenge to be fair.  At night random events  can seem relentless, harming parties or loosing equipment.  But the game IS hard make no mstake.  I went in without reading any manual first time and my people all died within a few days, second time same again.  Playing on easier modes is less fun, though you can fine tune the difficulty in regards to battles and survival.  Any game that allows you to massacre innocent women and children gets a thumbs up from me, give it a go especially if its on a discount and you like X-Com			"

												Wow, that one has been one of the best surprises I've ever had in games, maybe only reached by another indie games!!Seemingly, this one is a quite typical game with exploration and turn-based combat... Nothing we haven't already seen, isn't it? Then, wich is the point about it? An incredible well- writen script, for the Story itself and for the team we're building up. Each one of our companions have a story of their own to be telled and discovered while you`re discovering the New World, even constructing it. Every decission, every movement will have a consequence, don't doubt it, and you'll face them in the near or further future. If you like turn-based games, purchase it! If you like well-telled stories, purchase it!!! If you want to mix up with the native aztecs and Toltecs, or want to destroy them, PURCHASE IT!! :P			"

												Good turn-based combat. * Increase the AI difficulty, otherwise it makes dumb mistakes too often.Also, note that you only take five guys into combat. Deck those guys out with all your equipment.Rich story, party options, and events. You can do different play-throughs where you choose to be a bad guy one time, then a good guy the next, or mix it up.I do wish there were more random combat events. Once you clear out an area, the wandering does seem a little pointless.			"

												Bought this on a whim, and am VERY pleasantly surprised by it. Very well written strategy/RPG set in a not-too-often-seen setting (16th Century Central America, in Hispaniola and Mexico). Game plays like a mix between Heroes of Might and Magic/Kings Bounty while on the world map venturing around, and in battle like a mix of D&D and Fire Emblem.The characters (you choose from 10 of about 30 at the start, and can get a few more during the game as well), while they fit into classes, are all unique personality wise and many (though apparently not all) have interesting backstory events. They'll weigh in on your decisions, offering you advice, as well as reacting to choices you make causing them to gain/lose morale based on actions. Some are pious, adventurous, altruistic, greedy, narcisistic, etc and respond based on these traits. You can lose units for good (though not as easily as say, Fire Emblem, as falling in battle doesn't guarantee the unit dies, especially if you win anyway), as well.The package is a little rough (graphics aren't the best, nor is the music or interface) but it's definitely extremely fun and I heavily recommend it.

												Charming RPG with focus on turn-based tactical battles on a hex grid. Great atmosphere, writing and characters, lots of interesting random events. The combat is very good and strategic. You might fight one battle and get obliterated, but then revise your tactics and try again and you can win with no casualties. It's a unique game, there's nothing else quite like it. Moving around and exploring the world map is a little clunky, but it's fine. The combat sections are just about perfect. I've always been interested in Aztec and Mayan cultures, and I believe they are both represented accurately and with respect.Definitely worth playing if you like turn-based strategy games!			"

												Well I beat the game, here is my review.Story 10/10 - the written dialog is the best part about this game, you will fall in love with it! unless you hate reading alot.Combat 3/10 - The combat system is very basic and brutally unfair at times, often outnummbering you and leaving you                   only with 6 max units at all times, It gets so bad at some points your standing against 18 vs 6 thats not good odds, and sometimes you have no choice but to lose... I did play on ironman mode to be fair (only auto saves), but I was between the second hardest diffuculty and normel the hole game, until the end where I had no choice but to lower it to easy, because I had no men left to fight with because they were all wounded from battles before. And don't smash me saying I just suck at commanding, no I dont I would almost win in all the stupid crazy hard battles but near the end I would be over run by the last few enemies because my men have no health left!Sound 4/10 the music is basic and often repeated.Graphics 3/10 but given its not a triple A title I wont be to harsh, it is kickstarter backed and the enviroment is nice and the graphics are not bad don't get me wrong, but they wont catch your eye.Characters 10/10 this relates to the story rating abit, the people in this game are amazing and there is a crazy amount of them to! Not to mention the realistic emotions and writting style.Length 5/10 The main story only takes about 20-30 hours if you only focus on playing that. the side quests and other content maybe add 20+ hours if you look hard and take your time.Replayablity 5/10 I am guessing here because so far I have only done 1 playthrough but I would say its most likely ok, but given the one direct path story line, only your choices would change anything.Over all Gameplay 40/70 or 6/10 -Best book I ever played!

												After playing Expedition Conquistador for the last several hours I have been compelled to write a recommendation for this amazing indie game. This is an under-the-radar hidden gem that deserves a huge player base because it is simply that good,As the name suggests you take charge of a group of Spanish Conquistators venturing to the New World. Are you there for fame, glory or riches? The choice is yours! The game itself is an excellent mixture of RPG, map exploration, character/resource management and turn based combat. You can be diplomatic and seek alliances with natives to add local units to your group and peacefully aquire what you need ... or .... you can cut down the savage  and take what you want fom them without pity! Its great that a game like this doesn't shy away from topics because of politically correct considerations and just lets you play however you want.; as a bloodthirsty conqueror, a peaceful diplomat or somewhere between those too extremes. The battles are a lots of fun (and genuinely hard! even at normal difficullty) and take the form of  turn based and hex-centered combat. The games graphics aren't astounding like say, Skyrims are, but they are in my opinion definately above average for a game that focuses as much on the RPG side of things as the combat. I took a chance on this game because it was on sale and because  I love the period in history its based on . However, if I could go back in time I would honestly have donated to the kickstarter campaign for this game and/or bought it at full price. It really is that good, and is probably one of only a handful of games I would ever say are worth their full price on SteamThis is a completely underrated gem that I would highly recommend to anyone and everyone, you could honestly pay full price for this game and not be disappointed. However if your still not convinced, add it to your wishlist and get this the moment its on sale.So, what do you say ... are you man enough to seek your fortune across the seas in the New World? Are you a modern day Christopher Columbus or Hernán Cortés? Play Expeditions Conquistatdor and find out!			"

Good luck on it because I'm done. I lost my best soldier,a blonde girl called Blanco, due to a several bone fracture in her face which deteriorated without treatment.6.5/10 because I'm bad at it hahahaAnd I'll set a 'yes' here because i don't think it's fair to make a bad critic on game just because you aren't good.

												I drew some enjoyment out of this game but that doesn't mean I recommend it. In fact, I do not recommend this game.The best summary I can think of is this: ""Things go poorly and people die.""This is a game about being uncomfortable and frustrated, facing the harsh reality that enthusiasm and hope do not produce sucess. You will run out of food, and will have to decide who goes hungry. You will run out of medicine, and must triage your party to determine who should survive a failed hunt or even a spider bite. You will lose combat encounters because you are consistently outnumbered and have only the same options and attributes your enemy does.The caveat is that despite all of your failings, the game will rarely, if ever, hand you a simple game over. Enthusiasm and hope may not produce success, but tenacity comes close. In the end, though, success in Expeditions: Conquistador won't  look like traditional video game success. It will look like you failed forward with some unknown force preventing your necrotic body and hollow spirit from simply dying and escaping this hell.To reiterate and elaborate: I do not recommend this game. But, if you read all the above and still want to experience limbo and/or eternal damnation in the form of Spanish Conquistadors exploring Hispaniola and Mexico, by all means go ahead and purchase the game.

												A turn-based strategy game about exploring Mexico as a Spanish explorer. Graphics and sound are fine, story is pretty detailled and there's a good amount of events to read as you progress through the main storyline. The setting is pretty unique to me (not used as much as a world war setting) but don't expect complete historic accuracy.You travel across the overworld and do quests, events, collect resources, and progress the storyline with the end goal of returning to Spain. It's turn-based so there is a limit to how far you can move each turn. As you do quests and events, you get XP to rank up your followers (which improves combat stats, unlocks a skill and increases equipment slots). At the end of the turn, you're forced to camp, set rationing of food, and set tasks for your followers (gather food, convert herbs to medicine, convert supplies to battle items, heal a wounded unit, patrol for a chance to find supplies, and guard to prevent theft). The resources you have to gather are food (each follower requires 1/day), valuables (used as currency and how well you did at the end of the game), medicine (used to heal followers), equipment (used to improve follower combat stats), and craft supplies (used to craft battle items).You can lose a lot of resources from theft so may want to end your turn off the road (which has a very high guard difficulty) if the terrain nearby is any better. In the second part of the story, you'll find somewhere to store your valuables (instead of carrying them around to be stolen). However, since you deposit in intervals of 100, you can end up with a negative balance (which is kind of weird).The camera is an overhead camera that gives you some degree of control but there are a few quirks. Going uphill seems to mess with the zoom so after you go downhill you need to manually zoom out again. It feels like the overworld camera is restricted for artistic vision (you can only see so far ahead of you) but I would've liked to zoom out a lot more (with fog for unexplored areas and unlit areas to show vision range) so I could see further and reorient myself easily.The battle camera is alright but I'd still like the option to zoom out more for a big overview so I could quickly check where each enemy starts at the beginning of battles (instead of holding alt and panning around).In battle it would be nice to check enemy stats in more detail than rank and class.You can only set waypoints on the map on points of interest, it would have been nice to create your own waypoints anywhere. It's a little annoying that your movement waypoint disappears if an event box pops up so that you need to set your destination again.All in all, I enjoyed playing through the game. The story and events were the best part of the game for me. They were fun to read and it was nice you could roleplay a personality through different choices. The combat TBS part was good enough- there was unit variety, skills, combat cover, traps, and tactics. It's worth a try if you like reading story and turn-based strategy games like heroes of might & magic (without the fantasy setting- no magic/spell system).			"

												Playing this on Ironman mode really makes you weigh your choices before making a decision.  It seldom makes you think that one decision is in the best interest of all your companions and the others doom them.  Plus, a hex grid for battles is always a plus.  Overall, I've found it worth the money, though it's not the best tactical RPG I've ever played.			"

												Now this game here is a real gem, a tactical RPG that almost has it all: lots of companions each with their own stories and skills who react to the choices you make through the game and to eachother, resource management as you scrape together resources to survive and a deeply satisfying tactical combat, that'll make you use every skill each individual unit has to offer, and building your army to your personal playstyle.And on top of that some great roleplaying with several though choices and multiple endings.The only drawback to some might be the simple graphics, I personally found them alright and quite pleasing to the eye, though on the other hand this means that you can run the game even on a toaster.

												  The Conquistadors have never really been touched by video games before. How many Zombie games are there? We have done WW2 to death then, LITERALLY, raised it up as a Zombie and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it to death again, then said hey WW1 come sit on our laps for a while ya? We have the revolution covered, Pirates, Knights, Ghosts, Aelins, Space Empires, Greek City States, Rome it goes on and on. But the Conquistadors...if you look up the history it was not like so many people think, Cortes did not go with the full power of spain, it was a handful of men, and entire Nations of people abused, enslaved, sacraficed and eaten by the Aztec empire. They asked for his help and against all odds one of the craziest episodes in History played out. These men went to another planet and fought (and worked with) and empire of MILLIONS. Here is your chance to re write history of oversee the routes it took. Will you be Benevolent? Or Cruel? Or somewhere in the middle, help who you can while filling your coffers. YOU EVEN START A TOWN, oversee its productions and construction and defend it from enemies. 10/10 UNIQUE experience			"

												Wow, that one has been one of the best surprises I've ever had in games, maybe only reached by another indie games!!Seemingly, this one is a quite typical game with exploration and turn-based combat... Nothing we haven't already seen, isn't it? Then, wich is the point about it? An incredible well- writen script, for the Story itself and for the team we're building up. Each one of our companions have a story of their own to be telled and discovered while you`re discovering the New World, even constructing it. Every decission, every movement will have a consequence, don't doubt it, and you'll face them in the near or further future. If you like turn-based games, purchase it! If you like well-telled stories, purchase it!!! If you want to mix up with the native aztecs and Toltecs, or want to destroy them, PURCHASE IT!! :P			"

												A tough fund adventure. Just a few hours in but I'm definitely hooked. The story is compelling and the combat is turn based combat.The game centers around selecting your men (or women) from various classes; Hunters, Soldiers, Medics, Scouts and Scholars. You traverse the overworld map finding resources, doing various quests and managing your camp when you've run out of movement for the day.The combat is solid turn-based action. You earn XP which can used to level up your followers and give them a wide selection of active or passive skills.I'm definitely enjoying my time and highly recommend it for anyone even slightly interested in the title.

												This is an old-school PC game, with lot of saving/reloading. It consists of Heroes-like overland map and Fallout-like combat and dialogues. There's lot of adrenaline battles, as when your last expedition member succumbs to the last surviving enemy, or there is one last enemy alive when time's out. Combat is never repetitive, as environment, day cycle, number/type of enemies and goals always change (kill everyone, survive for certain number of turns, get to the escape zone or kill everyone in limited number of turns). There are plenty of nasty random events on the overland map that add spice to the gameplay and can be fatal sometimes. I was outraged by this game at first (because it is so different from today's typical Steam offering), but believe me, it's a gem!			"

												I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys turn based strategy games. There are RPG elements, but I would say that it is primarily a turn based strategy game. My only gripe with the game is that some elements are a bit confusing. The overworld map is unique and takes some getting used to. The game is also more difficult than much of what is currently out on the market, it is very possible to get to a point in the game where you cannot complete it due to choices you made or battles you lost previous. Not necissarily a bad thing, but will turn some people off. Overall, I loved it and look forward to future games in this style.			"

												This game makes you feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There are dilemmas that stretch from the plot to the game's mechanics themselves. This game doesn't have ""Moral Choices"" this is the new world, there is no morality, only survival. You constantly have to be making decisions in this game that kill people, and most of the time it's up to you if those people are part of your party, or the locals. You're gonna feel like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by this game's conclusion, because being nice is just not pragmatic. Many of the hardest hitting moments in this game are non-scripted events, you may lose your best soldier to disease or desertion. You may have several random conversations with another soldier under your command, learn about their life, their family back in Spain, and then lose them to a native ambush. Maybe you really wanted to tend to everyone's wounds but you have three wounded men and only enough medicine for two. In most other games, the moral choices are usually nothing more than fodder for repeat playthroughs, they might effect the plot or maybe your character's appearance, but the moral choices in this game always tie directly into the game's mechanics, maybe you really do want to be the generous savior of all the people, but if you gave that starving village some food you would be left with none of your own. I always felt like each choice actually mattered, but not in some telltale games way where characters react to me differently, each choice mattered because it was the difference between being alive and guilty, or dead and innocent.

												Play as the devil in a game resembling Oregon Trail but with battles. It's very slow with your limited moves per ""day"" on the map being used up quickly, and you'll find yourself on the camping screen a lot. Yet despite being on the evil side of history and moving at a glacial pace, I found myself coming back to this game anyway.The main weakness is that it badly needs an editor. I read that the ""writing is good"" but there are typos and bad grammar everywhere. It feels unprofessional.I'd still recommend it if you enjoy wandering around and exploring, which was the most enjoyable part for me.			"

The combat system is turn, the one i like. You have some resources to spend for upgrading your fortress/team/weapon. I love Iron Mode, it's similar to Hardcore mode in Diablo3: a character can die permanently. My vote is A.+Story+Combat system (turn)+Fully localized+Unique game+Lot of difficult levels-Short, if you run into main story. "

The game can be time consuming as there is a lot of area to explore but, that's what I was hoping for when I bought it. There is some micro-management with your AI troops and that pretty good also. The graphics are not fantastic but good, the gameplay makes up for the average graphics. This is not something that can be done in a few days, at least not if you plan on playing for enjoyment. A big thing I learned is, this is a game where you save often, even if no natives are around, events can happen when you camp for the night, saving may save a lot of future problems, especially if you lose people in a battle.The more I play this the more I like it. I use a triple monitor system but run this on a single monitor, I think the aspect ratio may be off with 3 screens but I'm going to try it again as having 3 screens in this game is a big help for the player. This is more then worth the sale price of $5 but even at full price most will be happy, IMO. "

												Only 3.3 hours into the game (I've had to reload back to the beginning too) and I am unsure about this game. I get that it's meant to be D&Dish with the combat but when I'm being constantly hit by a bloody savage with a bow and poison arrow, or being crit hit multiple times in a row and my ranged musketman can't make a pointblank shot with 72% chance to hit multiple times in a row. I don't know, maybe I'm just unlucky, but I am constantly being rekt. Other than that, moving around the map is actually fun, exploring new areas, foraging and living off the land along with the random events that occur is actually quite enjoyable. Maybe get it if you're feeling lucky or just want to try your hand at killing dirty, heathen, savages.			"

												Enjoyable turn based strategy game set in Conquistador Mexico. The game has solid mechanics and graphics. Only the skill system could be better to allow for more interesting character builds. Combat is fun and requires some strategic thinking. The story is okay and various decision points allow you to make it your own. However, I would have enjoyed if the smaller decisions had more impact. There is two factions which you can side with that alter how the game unfolds. There is side stories based on which characters you picked, but they are not worth mentioning. After having finished the game once, I am not sure I willing to replay the other faction though, as there will likely be a lot of repetition. But recommended anyways.			"
