												Overall, I had to say that I enjoyed playing this game. When I first started it, I was encountering some crashes but someone's suggestion on the forum quickly cleared up anything and I never saw a crash since. Regarding the gameplay, I enjoyed it. The combat did feel grittier than a Souls game, and I like how the magic in this game was much more 'supportive' rather than primary, as it can be in a Souls game (as an aside, I feel like magic ruined Dark Souls 2, but that's just an aside). The boss designs were decent--they could use improvement, but I did enjoy some of them. I also did enjoy all of the little details they put in the game, like different ways to defeat bosses, different ending paths based on choices (which did seem a little hardboiled at times but was still a nice effort none the less). The only thing that frustrated me from time to time was the level design, which seemed labyrinthine.There's lots of weapons in this game, and plenty of loot. The armor and weapon design were all decent.All in all, is it ""Souls-like""? Yes, it is. Do I care? No. It's not like Dark Souls was the first Action RPG. Is it a fun game? Yes, yes it is. Do I hope they make another one and improve upon the first? Yes.I think what sometimes people forget, especially with original titles is that to criticize it needlessly and blast it with negative reviews, and to make statements such as ""don't support this publisher"", will ultimately lead to less variety, innovation, and entertainment. This is not a defense of bad games, but it is a defense of ""improvement"". If they make another, and I hope they do, I hope they can improve the formula, add some additional features that make it interesting and continue to innovate on this extremely fun genre. The more the merrier, I say.			"

												Lords of the Fallen gets a lot of things right, but is also blasted by many people for not being as polished as Dark Souls, or for even trying to be like Dark Souls.  Wherever you stand on that issue, I personally think the expansion of that sort of gameplay into a proper genre is good for business overall.  I want more games like Dark/Demons Souls, not less.If you can get over the fact that yes, the game is very similar to the Souls titles, I think you'll find it to be quite a good game.  It lacks some of the bells and whistles of the Souls titles, such as the persistent and interesting multiplayer found in those games, but I believe it totally nails the combat, and is absolutely packed with secrets, both of which are some of the top reasons I enjoy the Souls games.The story is a lot more straightforward than those titles (Sorry for all the comparisons, but the genre is still in its infancy and there isn't much else to compare it to, and this game wears its inspirations on its shoulders.) which can be both good and bad.  Good because you have a fairly clear motivation, bad because, well, let's face it, the voice acting is pretty mediocre and the talking animations and lip synching are actually kind of embarassingly bad.  Characters gesticulate wildly when saying the simplest things, all while retaining their stiff, wooden, doll-like faces and flapping mouths.The stilted facial expressions clash furiously with the rest of the visuals, which have a distinct Warhammer (read: big shoulder pads, intricate armor, you know whether you enjoy that style or not.  I do, but you may not.) feel that is very consistent.  Having a very solid art style and beautiful technical work and then seeing Playstation 2-level facial animations is jarring to say the least.  It's not too big of a deal, but they put it in there, so I figured I'd give my two cents.  Also I feel it prudent to remind people that while the Souls games had decent voice acting, the characters rarely ever moved at all while talking and mouths never seemed to move at all, so, uhh, just throwing that out there.So, let's talk about gameplay.  This game is said to be easier than the Souls games.  I never found those games to be particularly difficult so much as games that forced you to be patient.  Few fights ever required a high degree of dexterity, just that you observe and wait for an opening.  I think this game handles that just right.  But I warn you: If you're looking for a challenge, choose something besides the Warrior play style.  That class is a lot like the spell-casting class (Noble, was it?) in Demons Souls, where it was basically an easy mode for new players.  Try weird weapons, if you feel too tanky, wear super light armor.  I say these things because if you want the game to be difficult, then the default selections are not for you.The game has fairly lengthy attack animations, longer than the Souls games in many cases, but it also has a bigger impact.  With my great hammer during a well-placed attack I can physically knock enemies across the room, and when it strikes the ground the sound design and visual effects really sell that I'm swinging a huge, deadly weapon and that it is not to be trifled with, but it also takes timing and understanding of each type of swing at my disposal.  I can out-poise some enemies if I wear heavy armor and just swing through it, or to challenge myself I can wear very light armor and rely on timing above all else.Enemies do have a bit of cheapness to them occasionally.  Not all hitboxes are perfect, you can get hit by attacks that appear to miss you by several inches, and sometimes enemies do a very familiar Dark Souls move of ""sliding"" forward at the end of an attack to force it to connect, which feels just as cheap here as it did in the Souls games.  Luckily, both of these problems are fairly rare and tend to be limited to just a few enemy types -- and thankfully after encountering them a few times I didn't seem to notice it happening anymore.  Shouldn't be there to begin with, but not as big of a deal as I thought it would be after the first few times it happened.I want to take a moment to warn you that I don't play these types of games quite the same way I think most people do.  I played a ton of Monster Hunter before I first played a Souls game, so I tend to rarely ever use the lock-on here.  I don't really circle-strafe enemies to fish for backstabs and I don't have many issues with the camera that allegedly appear due to what I assume is locking on in such tight quarters.  If you use lock-on for extended periods, you'll have to get that info elsewhere, as I can't provide you relevant critique on it.Of course, while it borrows from the Souls series, it also has its own little twists that I think are genuinely interesting that may help push the genre forward.  The ideas themselves aren't mind-blowing, but stuff like the experience multiplier for going longer without banking your experience is fantastic, as well as the experience degrading the longer you take to retrieve it after death.  To me, these are pure upgrades to the soul retrieval system in the Souls games, hands-down.  I hope this inspires future games in the genre to think of cool additions as well.I had quite a bit more to say, but this is getting very long for a Steam review.  So I'll wrap it up and give my conclusion:  Is this game as polished or as in-depth as the Souls series?  No.  Is it some blasphemy to the genre that you should be offended by?  Absolutely not.  It's a great game, marred right now by some technical problems (I knew I forgot something!  The game is crash-prone at the time of this review and while performance on my Titan Black is fine, on plenty of other rigs it's all over the place.  Check the updates to see if they fix that stuff in a timely fashion.) but once everything is ironed out I absolutely recommend it to any fan of the Souls series if they want more of that style of gameplay, or people intimidated by the Souls games' obtuseness.  This is a good gateway game to those titles.  Don't be an elitist, games like this will push the genre forward, not destroy or harm it!  That's my take on it, at least.  I heartily recommend this!

												Rating - 81/100Recommendation - Worth looking at, just don't expect Dark SoulsDisclaimer 1: Lots of people talk about crashing, but I had literally zero problems. I don't know if I'm super lucky or if issues have been patched, but I can't deduct points for problems I didn't have. Just be warned.Disclaimer 2: This game is not Dark Souls. If you're expecting Dark Souls, you'll be disappointed. If you're hoping for Dark Souls, you'll be disappointed. THAT BEING SAID, I will be doing comparisons to how Dark Souls works since it's probably the frame of reference most people will be coming from.I liked this game a LOT more than I was expecting to. Reviews for it were pretty terrible at first, and are only mediocre now, but the only thing I can think of to cause that is people coming in here with a mentality of ""let's see how different it is from Dark Souls."" It's clear from the get-go that the developers were trying to capitalize on a formula made prominent by the Souls games, but please try to judge this game of its own accord rather than compared to the genre juggernauts.Right off the bat, Souls players should feel comfortable. Combat is mostly focused on patience and energy (stamina) conservation, knowing when to block/dodge/strike, etc. Jumping in and flailing will get you ripped to shreds, and studying your enemies attack patterns = success. Killing enemies gives you experience, which you can use to level up attributes or spells at shards (save points). However, unlike the Souls games, using a shard doesn't respawn enemies in the world (that only happens when you die or leave the zone), but rather resets your experience multiplier. As you kill enemies, your experience multiplier increases, giving you a reward for taking risks and saving less often. When you die, you drop all your experience, and unlike the Souls games, you have a limited amount of time to pick it back up again before it vanishes. I liked the system a lot. It's a mild evolution on a formula, but it introduced just enough to keep things interesting.There's some frustration with combat, though. It's inconsistent and unreliable what attacks will break an enemy's guard, and even when you do, their shields are back up before you're even mid-swing. Harkyn (you), on the other hand, seems to get stunned for 8 seconds. It's frustrating. Fights with shield enemies are either shoot-from-afar-with-my-gauntlet or block-their-hit-and-hit-back-until-death. Plus, hit detection is not perfect. I had a not-insignificant number of sword swings and gauntlet shots that simply passed right through enemies. It wasn't a rampant problem, but it should NEVER happen.Story-wise, I actually liked this game a lot more than Dark Souls (I welcome your knee-jerk reaction downvotes). A huge part of Dark Souls' mystique and whatnot comes from a complete lack of communication with the player. Lords of the Fallen is not that game. You have objectives (story quests only), the world is laid out more linearly, and while your hand is never held, the difficulty in the game is in achieving objectives rather than figuring out what to do AND THEN doing it. The story is serviceable, and moves around enough to be interesting, but it's nothing groundbreaking.I think this game actually serves as a good halfway step between standard RPGs and Dark Souls. The difficulty is more approachable, as is the game world itself. You have a mission objective, but no map or direction markers, and side quests are never tracked at all, so it's up to you to remember where people/things are. I loved it. It still left some of the questing burden on me, but I never got that ""oooookay, what do I do now?"" feeling. You're told to ""fight to the top of the citadel"" but then left to your own devices.Hardcore Souls players might be turned off by that type of gameplay, but I welcomed it. No getting your intestines ripped out through your nostrils right away in the catacombs here. Don't get me wrong, this game is still difficult, but I had an easier time here than in the Souls games. I can't say for sure that it's because Lords of the Fallen is easier, since it's just as likely that playing through Dark Souls, Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 2, and then Dark Souls again prepared me for this one. New players be warned, this is not an easy game. You can't really wander into an area you're not supposed to be yet, though, so there is that.The world itself is not all that large (maybe half the size of Dark Souls), and there's a bit of backtracking, but it never feels all that repetitive. Enemies in certain areas will change and grow stronger as you play through the main story, so the parts where you do have to backtrack are at least interesting again. To be honest, most of the backtracking was due to side quests, which can be completely ignored. Fair warning, too, I did grind a bit (probably 4 or 5 hours' worth), but that's just because I wanted to try higher gear. I can't say for sure that it's necessary, although it did help.Speaking of gear, this is one of the game's weak points. The armor sets and weapons look beautiful, and they're almost all beefy and chunky, but all of the classes end up being built the same way. I picked the Cleric class (the healing spell is FANTASTIC) and built my character for speed, but could have doubled as a tank. By the end of the game, my regular sword (there's shortswords, swords, then greatswords) did more damage than all but 2 of my great-weapons, and swung faster. I had all but one spell level unlocked (there's 4 spells per class, each with 3 levels), and enough strength/stamina/poise to withstand direct hits from the final boss with no damage. I honestly can't see how building solely as a warrior would have been that much stronger.I suppose that's another thing I liked about this game, though. In Dark Souls, even though I played as a tanky build, I always felt extremely weak, even right up to the end. In Lords of the Fallen, however, I really got a sense of how strong I became. Maybe it's because it's easier and quicker to backtrack and fight early enemies, but it felt quite a bit more apparent what effect all that leveling up had.Overall, I legitimately enjoyed my time here. The graphics are fantastic, the game world is beautifully-designed (even if you are in gothic castles 98% of the time), combat is satisfyingly meaty, the enemies are varied and interesting, the bosses are a decent challenge (they all have hidden bonus objectives too), and aside from a few small glitches, the gameplay was rock-solid.If you come in to this game not expecting it to perfectly fill a Souls-shaped hole in your heart (and you have no crashing issues), you should enjoy it too. I thoroughly did, and I could easily see myself coming back to this game for another playthrough later.			"

												Short Version: Is it worth playing? YES. Is it worth the full price? HELL NO!Long Version:(WARNING: I will compare this game to Darksouls games a lot since it's obvious that it tries to mimic it's mechanisms and gameplay style.)PROS: 1. Semi-Darksouls action combat - If you like the way Darksouls I & II handles combat chances are, you'll probably like the way this game handles it as well. The difference is that the combat in Darksouls is faster and more flashy.           2. Beautiful Graphics - Although the graphics are brilliant and beautiful (scenery, armor, weapons, you name it...) some of them are a bit ""samey"". (More on that in CONS)           3. The story - Unlike Darksouls where you have to scrape the story from item descriptions and where most of it you decide and invent for yourself, the story here is way more accessible. You are a convicted criminal whose crimes are tattooed on your face and your mission is to redeem yourself by destroying a fallen god. Sounds fun! There are more hidden lore bits found out from the few NPCs and much more numerous log files.            4. Performance - I only played the game after the latest patch and can confirm that on my system (i5 3,5 GHz, Nvidia 770GTX, 16GB ram, SSD disk, every graphics setting maxed out) the game held a stable 60fps 99% of the time with maybe 2-3 times dropping to 45-50 FPS and only on specific places.            5. Bugs - with the recent patches most have been squashed. Haven't really noticed any during my gameplay.            6. Game Mechanics - There is a risk-reward system implemented in the game that works really well. The more enemies you slay before resting at a checkpoint the more it increases your exp. multiplier which in turn increases the exp. gain from other enemies. But if you are killed, that exp. will slowly drain away until you either collect it back or it drains completely. The only real big difference from the darksouls games.MEH: 1. Difficulty - Harder than most games, way easier then Darksouls II. To be honest I was expecting a more challenging game, but I guess this decision makes the game appeal to a broader audience.          2. Enemy variations - too little variations. Same enemy models reused through the game. Most of the bosses resemble ordinary units only bigger in size.          3. Customization - Oh my GOD. Everyone is overusing steroids in this game. From the main character to the lowliest mob. Want to role-play a squishy mage? Nope, here's a mage that bench presses 200 kg. Want to play as a sleek and agile rogue? Nope, here's a rogue with 140 kg of muscle. I prefer the big warrior class but to have the option to at least customize the face and a few sliders wouldn't hurt the game one bit.CONS:  1. Lack of NPCs - There are maybe 3 worthwhile NPCs in the whole game.             2. Dialogue - The dialogue with the said 3 NPCs is sometimes strange and somewhat out of place.             3. Replay value - Whereas I've played Darksouls I and II with multiple characters for months, After I finished this game, I'll probably finish it once more from the beginning this time trying to get all the collectables and the special weapons from the bosses. After that I'll probably delete the game never to play it again.            4. Game duration - It's too short. It took me probably 15 hours to finish.            5. ""Samey"" world design - Remember how in Darksouls you have very distinct and different environments? Well there's no such thing in Lords. The whole game is one big dungeon and castle interiors mixed with a bit of snowy exterior. It looks great but it's the same most of the game. And since it's all interconnected (something I like very much, reminds me of how Darksouls I handled it's world and shortcuts to bonefires) it results in being lost quite often, trying to find how to progress further into the game (something I hate very much).Overall Score: 6.5/10Verdict: Buy the game if you are a darksouls fan, but get it when it's on discount.

												Took me 20 hours.In the 20 hours, I have:- never had a single crash- never seen a single bug- never had a single framedropWhat I did have was a great fun. It is an easier game than Dark Souls (I finished both DS games), I finished most bosses pretty quickly. And yeah bosses are not as memorable as in DS games, mostly consisting of humanoid knights. But they were fun to fight anyway.The level design is pretty good. I enjoyed exploring it and the graphics is amazing (played maxed, but without nvidia turbulence stuff since I have AMD 280X).Considering the likely low budget and zero experience of the developers with this kind of game, I am super impressed with what they achieved and I hope they will keep this quality and improve upon in for the future games.If there are some nitpicks..I did not like many invisible walls, and I am still not fan of the art style. I do not hate it, but I do prefer more realistic style of Witcher / DS games. This is subjective though.As for the Denuovo anti-tamper, I had zero issues with it. Would never know it is there if it wasn't for the internet making a huge fuss of everything.			"

												Lords of the Fallen is a third person action-role-playing game with heavy emphasis on melee combat mechanics and tactics.The Great:- Melee combat is exceptional and some of the best in the industry- Significant weapon variety that leads to numerous differing yet satisfying playstyles- Each weapon's unique playstyle feels great and is fun to experiment with- Combat is timing and pattern based making each encounter important and fulfilling to complete- Game is gorgeous to look at even with details turned downThe Good:- Environments are beautiful and intricately crafted (if a little small)- Enemy and boss designs are interesting and show creativityThe Bad:- The story is forgettable, confusing at times and makes little sense given the scope of the game- The side characters feel tacked on, tropish, and overall of little value or consequence- The main character is meant to be a jerk, and there are few options to choose not to be a jerk- I experienced several game-crashing bugs over 25+ hoursConclusion:The game is buggy, and the writing of the characters and story leaves much to be desired, but the combat in both its precision and variety is able to save this game from the trash pile and ultimately make it one of the best RPGs of the year.9.0 / 10.0			"

												I played this game with low expectations since there are so many negative reviews. But you know what, I had a lot of fun and the game is surprisingly good.It's not as good as DS2. Lords of the Fallen is much shorter, easier (specially towards the end), cliche story, a few problems in its battle mechanics, but definitely not as bad as some people have been writting.I have to say I bought this game in a 75% off steam sales, but I'd say it is worth even at 50%.Give it a go if you enjoyed Dark Souls and Dark Souls2, just don't expect the same level of game!

												TLDR: Overall, moments of entertainment locked behind odd design choices and unresolved glitches that makes it impossible to recommend.EDIT: And I feel bad for not being able to recommend it because I did have some good fun and effort was clearly made.First the good: -The character/monster/environment designs are well done, it's all massive muscles, massive armour and massive weapons but if you don't mind that it's nicely done.-When the combat works, it can be fun.The mixed (subjective):-The armour sets are well designed, as mentioned above, but the standard as you go through set progression is inconsistent. For light armour for example, you get the best designed armour about half way through then get sets that seem much more 'vanilla' or are (I believe) reskins of previous sets.-The story isn't terrible, but I'm still unsure about the premise. Why exactly is Adyr the god considered a 'villain'? I may have missed an audio log that explains this, but then it is still missable.-There is a universal cooldown on spells, use one and they all go on cd (at least the ones from the same school do, can't verify whether it applies to other schools). On some combinations this may make sense, on others it seems overly restrictive. Keep in mind that without massive xp investment into faith (magic), the mana cost of each spell is likely prohibitive of chain casting anyway. Not impossible mind you, but when you factor in the cast time of each spell and the likelihood of interruption by enemy hits, a gcd seems superfluous.-Combat staggering seemed unpredictable across the board, both on you and the enemies. There seemed no way of knowing ahead of time whether Harkyn would get staggered by any given enemy's attacks or whether they would be staggered by his.-Certain classes may seem underpowered, mileage may vary. Rogue class definitely could have used some life steal baked in to a spell.-Majority of voice work is bland, not all but a lot of it.-The rune/crafting system seemed inconsistent. The game features a system where you can invest xp into locked runes  to increase the likelihood of better quality buffs but the return on this seemed very disappointing. Possibly rectified with better 'Luck' character stats but that's uncertain.The bad:-The hit detection is suspect. Weapon strikes simply may decide not to land, spell hits may just not register.-Enemy projectiles may not hit you when they should and may seek you out through walls.-Equipment stats are confusing. You are given numbers without context. Conversely some items have only 'fluff' descriptions.-The camera may decide to snap to a completely obscured perspective during 'backstabs'.-Spell effects may also overwhelm your vision.-The gauntlet is intrusive and frequently redundant. It seemed underpowered no matter which class or loadout was used, an enemy could always be reached to melee them anyway, using it costs mana that would 9 times out of 10 be better used on spell casting and it is unalterably bound to the stance swapping button which gets in the way during combat.-The physics are unbelievable in a bad way. Enemies may do a U-turn mid leap, defying momentum. The enemy also has a bad habit of tracking your motion during weapon swings that would likely snap their bones, also rendering combat maneuvering futile. This becomes more of a problem with the more fragile classes.-Pathing is incompetent. Enemies may get stuck on corners or non existent obstacles, may reset and speed off to their original point (no, not that one demon dog who is scripted to do something similar).-Harkyn's magic is wildly unreliable. Magic may simply not do what it is supposed to. Direct damage spells may just not land despite hitting the mark. Buffs may drop off before their proper duration or not do as described. Bad pathing also applies here.-Even after hours of play time, the cumbersome nature of the spell casting can still be infuriating. Enemy AI is unreliable as to attacking during casting, they may knock you out of it or stand there and wait. A hit the wrong side of a millisecond may interrupt a 'complete' cast.-Controls are unreliable, Harkyn may simply ignore commands. The most frequent suspect for me was the running shield bash attack, it simply didn't happen about 40% of the time and would land Harkyn in hot water each time. Dodges may simply not occur either.-Saves may not be complete, by which I mean you can save your progress at a checkpoint or even move to a new area and quit and when you reload, the game may simply not have saved to that point. On a whim.-Desktop crashes. Frequent and exacerbated by the above problem.			"

												I decided to write a review of this game because most of the recent reviews are from people who have barely played the game (some haven't even completed the game) with very little achievement progress. I have spent almost 200 hours playing this game, and have earned every achievement. This may go without ""saying"", but I'll ""say"" it anyway: I'm going to attempt to chronicle my way through this game and the process I used to learn about the mechanics and what I found frustrating. I used an XBox 1 controller, so button references will be made accordingly.Firstly, the game crashes. A lot. I did some research and the general consensus seems to be that one must disable ""NVIDIA Turbulence"". That didn't work for me, so I also disabled ""Volumetric Lighting"" and ""Postprocessing"" and that seemed to have worked.My first playthrough was with the rogue class, whose weapons are governed by the agility trait, which, in my opinion, is disgustingly OP. Part of a rogue's special ability is having a weapon in each hand, which can be strung together into a combo. I used LB, RB, LB, RT, LT a lot. By the end of the game (level 67) I was doing around 1k damage with ""claw"" weapons, at 28 agility, per combo. The other ability, which the rogue can do from the start, and which other classes can do later, is parry.There are 3 shield types, Tower, Kite, and Buckler. Bucklers are used to parry, Kite shields can stun enemies, and Tower shields can reinforce blocking. I've come to the conclusion that tower shields are useless. I began by spending the first few hours learning to parry, which can be overwhelming because I was getting hit. A lot. Which became frustrating. I stuck with it and realized the timing window for parrying is quite large. Gauging an enemy's attack is quite intuitive, which made parrying a lot easier. Definitely a plus for this game. If you decide to get this game, parrying is worth investing the time to learn. Be aware, however, that while every class can use the starting buckler, you have to invest in the agility trait to use the other bucklers, which are much better, found later in the game. The trade-off for a large parry window, at least as far as game mechanics are concerned, is a very small and awkward back-stab activation hit-box. Every enemy has a different hit-box zone and keeping track can become tedious. The other issue with backstabbing is, if you miss the back-stab and are using larger, heavier weapon, you won't recover in-time to block or evade the enemy's attack. This, by itself, isn't a problem, as the rewards with backstabbing is great, and so too must be the risk, but because of the awkward back-stab hit-box, the risk is artificially inflated.My second playthrough was with the cleric class, whose weapons are governed by the faith trait. I had a lot of fun with this class because most of the weapons available to this class are ""hammers"" and they're so fun to use in this game because of the move list. Two-handed power moves and rolling away was the strategy I employed for most of the end-game, especially the final boss. I didn't use the kite shield that often because I spent so much time learning to parry, so as soon I found the buckler, I switched to that. I found that fighting most enemies without the ability to parry their attacks became tedious; it was really difficult to fight around their shields or deal with their attacks. One of the major downsides of this game is that enemy attacks track you through the full attack animation, so the only option with rolling is to roll backward. If you try to roll to either side, the camera glitches out and you end up rolling around the enemy, directly into the attack. Another ""interesting"" mechanic is that enemies, especially bosses, will teleport in the direction of their attack, giving them added range, which, to me, is sloppy programming.My third playthrough was with the warrior class, whose weapons are governed by the strength trait. This was the most difficult playthrough for me. The warrior class uses heavy armor and sits at about 95% of his encumbrance which means your character will be ""fat rolling"". Of course, rolling isn't necessary, because, with heavy armor, your character will just poise through attacks without interruption. This didn't happen as often as I would have liked, since most attacks will interrupt your attacks, even from weaker enemies. The weapons were the most frustrating, as the start-up and recovery frames from attacks are extremely long. I found myself unable to recovery in-time to avoid enemy attacks, so I had to use smaller weapons to keep from depleting my potions (you can refill your potions at anytime at checkpoint crystals and you can add to the total amount of potions you have, but this resets your experience multiplier, which caps at x2), which, to me, defeated the purpose of the warrior class entirely. I couldn't ""roll"" out of the way or block because, with these heavier weapons, the majority of your energy (stamina) is used, especially if you do a power move (RT).The story is quite vapid. Without spoiling anything, the player isn't told why the protagonist is doing what he is doing. The protagonist doesn't seem to buy into the story and we're left wondering if we ought to ourselves. Dialogue choices are also frustrating as some options will advance the story but we don't know which. My first playthrough was riddled with accidental story advancement when I wanted to learn more about what was going on around me and why. No take backs in this game.There isn't a quest selection option either. All secondary quests are done when you remember to do them. You won't know when or how to trigger each side quest either. For this, I highly recommend browsing the wiki: http://lordsofthefallen.wiki.fextralife.com/QuestsSome enemy's attacks, I would argue all enemies, don't have recovery frames, something I've noticed with western studios. This means that there isn't a buffer between the end of one attack and the beginning of another. An enemy can go right into another attack as soon as the previous attack frames end. Your character, on the other hand, has recovery frames. Which means there will be a pause between attack animations. This is a personal pet-peeve. I had fun with this game, but I recommend purchasing it during a steam sale. Like most games, it was released before the game was complete and the game won't be updated beyond 1.6 even though there are obvious issues with it. $28 for the base game and the DLC is way too much for a game in this state.

												Updated with more structure.Why I wrote this rant:It sucks to know so many people are being turned away from this game due to the top review (which isn't the top review now, but it was at the time of writing this) being so negative. I read through the entire review, and came to the conclusion that the guy didn't like the game, felt like he wasted $50 bucks, and decided to write his first review on a good game that he couldn't grasp around what it actually is, in oppose to what he wanted it to be, and it's turning away many people from it. I was almost one of them, but all I could read was someone complaining about everything that this game is suppose to be. So, I picked it up, I have logged 8 hours into it, and I think, personally, he was wrong, but those are his opinions.Combat & controls rant:This game is great, and it has very fluid tight gameplay that beats that of the Souls series. And if you played the Souls games you'll feel at home with the controls for Lords. I'm currently playing as a brawler. So I'm heavily focused on heavy CQC. You got a heavy attack, light attack, parry, block, barrel roll, and all the cool stuff like catching the little♥♥♥♥♥♥in an epic attack animation by catching him from behind. Attacking is damn near perfect, and every weapon I have used so far holds its own weight, and requires you to change up your strategy because one heavy weapon might be heavier than the other, and that might prolong the hit giving the enemy more time to counter. The lighter the weapon, the faster the hit, but the cost is of course dealing less damage, but giving you more reaction time is always a positive. Blocking actually feels like blocking, and to my surprise blocking while two-handing a weapon isn't going to screw you over. The hitboxes are on point, and you aren't left questioning how you're caught on a hit even though you are not in the line of attack.Magic rant:This game of course uses its share of magic, but I feel like it is a bit limited depending on the class you initialing picked. I am a brawler so I have four magic spells: Prayer: You bring out a clone to divert the enemies attention while restoring some health over time.Rage: Gives you more attack power, and removes energy restrictions. Ram: Unleash a strong charging force that damages, staggers, and can knock down enemies.Quake: Giant hammer that comes down and wrecks face.Each spell is very useful depending on the situation, and can really save your♥♥♥♥♥ I don't really have much input on the spells really because I'm still on my first playthrough of the game, and this is as much as I currently know.Customizing rant:The customization in this game is great because it gives you an assorted list of good weapons and armors that you can actually use due to interest instead of picking up a bunch of useless gear to toss out later. It features armoring feet, hands, chest, and legs. Weapons are of course in variety such as swords, axes, fist weapons, polearms, hammers, etc. One thing to note is the equipping runes in your gear slots. Runes help in terms of boosting defenses against elements, or adding elements to weapon properties. It's pretty good when you add fire to your projectiles. Nothing beats some nice damage over time on ranged enemies. Leveling system rant:The leveling system is the same as any Souls game, but with a twist. Gather experience to level up attribute points, or gain spell points, and if you die with the experience on you, you'll lose it all, but you can get it back by going back to where you died. The twist here is that the more experience you carry on you the better and more frequent the drops become in game from enemies. You also get on a killing streak experience multiplier if you hold on to your experience. The more enemies you kill, the more experience you get. When you die you have a matter of time to get to your experience to get the full value since it has a percentage timer that goes down the longer it takes you back to where you died. Really makes you question if you should use the experience before a boss fight.Graphics rant:The graphics are great, and can be taxing on your computer, but so far I have everything set on high, and haven't run into much issues. I've gotten some framerate issues in areas heavy with particle effects like snowy areas, and encounter issues in tight corridor places as well, but they aren't game breaking, but they can be annoying. I turn down my settings to low when I stream on twitch, and the game still looks gorgeous. I love the PhsyX usage in the game. Some particle effects just make me cream everywhere. I currently run two Nvidia 680 4GB in SLI, i7-2700K, and 16GB RAM. Soundtrack rant:I've had some issues with character dialog cutting out here 'n there, and in some places the music gets super loud for no reason, and it'll go back to normal randomly. Aside from that the soundtrack is great, and it draws you into this gritty world. For some odd reason it reminds me of Diablo 2. I really can't break down soundtracks and music, so yeah. That's that.Story, characters, and enemies rant:The story is lackluster so far. You play as Harkyn, a criminal who did a lot of bad♥♥♥♥♥♥ and is looked down upon by everyone, but is freed by a monk who saw in him the ability to fight off the evil gods and their demons. That's as much as I know since I have yet to beat the game, but it's your typical story with a badass over-powered protagonist. But! I do love the characters in this game since they are so entertaining, and have their own unique humor, characteristic traits, and what not. The voice acting is pretty good though the lip-syncing is off. Enemy design is great and unique, the enemies all have their own characteristics that make them different from one 'n another, so it keeps it fun & challenging. One enemy will run at you with a constant barrage of attacks making you shield up, and go for the perfect backstap. Other enemies are a fortress of defense waiting for you to attack so they can parry, and wreck your♥♥♥♥♥♥ The bosses are kinda repetitive in design, but hold their own challenge. I won't go far into depth on bosses because spoilers. If you are a master at these kind of games you will own them no problem, but with me I died a couple times trying to get down the right strategy.Outcome rant:The game isn't punishing like Dark Souls which can be a good or a bad thing depending on who you are asking, but I think it is refreshing, and gives the new IP good ground to expand to something wonderful, and make this into a great series of games. I have fully enjoyed everything I have played of this game so far. I have played both Dark Souls, and Demon's Souls, and awaiting for Bloodborne. Huge fan of these kind of games, and this game fits in its genre as a little more casual, but definitely a lot of fun. I'd say give it a go. A solid 8/10 for me. I'm not much of a reviewer, but this game does justice. I just felt the need to say it.TL:DR~Pros:+ Great fluid combat, and spot on hitboxes.+ Plenty of customizing and armory to fit your play style.+ Leveling is easy to learn and use, and holds its weight in deciding how your going to progress through the game.+ Graphics are splendid, and the world is gorgeous.+ Soundtrack is empowering.+ Majority of the enemies hold their own challenges, making you switch up your style of gameplay to put 'em down faster.+ Most of the characters I have met in the game are pretty funny. Humor is always nice in anything.Cons: - The story is your typical save the world of mankind with a super strong buff dude who has to make up for his crimes.- Magic spells in this game can be useful, but overall they are pretty boring and can be forgotten.- Framerate issues here 'n there, but I'm sure this can be patched.- Character lip-syncing is way off, and it just looks silly.- Bosses are pretty repetitive.8/10			"

												In Lords of the Fallen, you play as Gruff McGrufferson, the gruffest, toughest dude around. But under that gruff exterior, he is actually a wobbling mound of jelly. Our pal Gruff the jelly man must wobble his way around a castle and a demonic realm, fighting a bunch of angry demons and their sickly looking pals.Unfortunately for our chum Gruff McJellyman, his wibbly legs make him less manouverable than an asthmatic sloth, and his wobbly arms mean that swinging anything bigger than a toothpick is a real struggle for our intrepid hero. Even more unfortunate for our dashing dispatcher of ne'er do wells, the villainous villains he encounters have some deviously diabolical tricks up their muscular sleeves.Every one of these no good rascals comes equipped with an invisible record player, which they stand upon. What this means for mighty Jellyman is that all these cads he encounters can swivel on the spot... without moving their feet! The KNAVES! The SCOUNDRELS! The UTTER CHEEK! Our poor hero must face large, brutish enemies, who hide behind mighty shields, have vast qauntities of health, and who only give miniscule openings in their defence. These dastardly fiends laugh at our delicious Jelly hero, for they know that further down the corridor, two more of their identical brethren lie in wait - and our gruff protagonist must face them all, lest he be overwhelmed! Oh the horror...Although, it's not all bad news for our gelatinous champion.On his quest, he is accompanied by his best pal, Jam, the friendly invisible cameraman! Jam eagerly follows Jelly Goat Gruff on his delectable adventures. Unfortunately, Jam gets a little giddy whenever his pal Jellyman charges into battle, and can't keep a firm grip on his camera.Also accompanying our damn tasty chum is Karlo...Kaslo?...Carlos? Whatever. Our ABSOLUTELY memorable pal Karlos freed the magnificent Jellygruff from his horrible jelly prison, where our hero was placed after attempting a coup against the Ice Cream king, to supplant him from the delicious dessert throne. Mage-o Kazooie brings Gruff McJellyjelly to Keystone to fight the nasty demons, because only he, with his superior reflexes, nimble footwork, and masterful weapon-handling, can save the day from EVIL!Our gastronomical hero also gains assistance from an amiable demon blacksmith!""I can inscribe your weapons with runes to make them worthy of Gods!"", he proudly claims.Lo and behold!, Jellyman was overjoyed to find that his now godly weapon turned a monster that previously took 12 hits to kill, into a monster that now takes a measly 11 hits to vanquish.Oh yeah, there's also this woman, Yetka or something. She definitely wasn't as memorable as Kazoozle, the COMPLETELY memorable wizard dude. Also, there was some bad dude who's name began with A. But who cares, he was just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Dare you join the mighty Jellyman on his quest?Dare you battle these fearsome record player equipped demons? Dare you slog through dozens and dozens of said demons, over and over again?Dare you wrestle with the dreadful beast known as the inventory? Dare you attempt to make sense of cryptic item descriptions that tell you nothing of an item's purpose?Dare you listen to grim and chilling audio logs?Dare you battle visually identical, yet stastically superior versions of foes you have already fought?Dare you behold Jam's shaky camera-work, while keeping your dinner intact?Dare you become... THE JELLYGRUFF?In all seriousness, I had way more fun writing this review than I did playing the game.			"

												LotF is a game I won’t be revisiting in the long term, but I definitely enjoyed it enough for the time I have spent with it up to now. I’d love to recommend it, but it falls short of expectations.LotF is a game that (predictably) uses a combat system similar to that in the Souls games. You control Harkyn from the 3rd person perspective and probe enemies for patterns & weaknesses before moving in to finish them off using a weapon of your choice. There's a relatively large selection of weapons & armour to choose from, with the game slowly allowing you access to more powerful items as you continue with the linear narrative. The combat is functional and usually fun, but can be a little clunky at times, and the spells are often completely underwhelming and are more useful for tactical purposes. If you like to play RPGs as a mage then honestly you should probably avoid this game. You have access to one long range weapon which you can use in a variety of ways, but I found it most useful for pulling single enemies out of larger groups.The game looks pretty good with a very consistent art-style, and the two major areas had very distinctive visual themes. The enemies were well designed and the environments were pretty, even if you could tell how constrictive they were. The armour designs were not to my taste (far too large and “showy”) and were a bit reminiscent of the kind of over-sized armour you see on space marines from 40k. The enemy animation was good enough for me to easily distinguish between what attacks they were winding up which allowed the combat to flow. The sound was not up to the same standard as the visuals: the scripting and voice acting in LotF are simply atrocious. Conversations often have sentences that don’t really follow on from the last, being said in tones that don’t follow the mood, on subjects you couldn’t care less about. The poor voice acting really impacts on the narrative too, as it is delivered in a very obvious and linear manner through conversations and cutscenes. The story simply plods along from A to B with few surprises. The audiobooks add meat to the narrative and are delivered with far more convincing speech than that from actual characters in the game, without them the story would have been paper-thin and completely forgettable (which is why so little of this review is dedicated to the story).I have a few more gripes about LotF as well. The biggest issue is that after finishing, not much changes in NG+ except that enemies have far more health, which really kills the replayability. My second largest issue is the scaling/levelling seems very oddly balanced: even when not using checkpoints for long periods of time to get extra XP, I rarely built up enough experience to increase Harkyn's capabilities in a noticeable manner; sometimes adding a point into Strength actually reduced the damage of my equipped Strength-scaling weapon and I have literally no idea why. Thirdly there are some technical problems: occasionally the game would outright crash, resulting in complete loss of everything you’ve done since last touching a checkpoint; the frame-rate would often bomb to unplayable levels; and sometimes the load times between areas would take unusually long.It probably sounds like I’ve panned LotF, but I did manage to enjoy my time with it despite its failings. If you like 3rd person fantasy RPGs then this is worth the price of admission in a sale.			"

												I really liked this game.No it's not better than Dark Souls but still it's a very satisfying gaming experience. The combat is one or two steps befind DS system but the visuals are one ladder ahead. The enviroments lack variety but the details in them are really something to look at. To be fair though I've only played DS 1 and 2 so I can't compare it with 3, but I played DS 1, 2 and this one after the other.I really can't find any excuse not at least trying this game and who knows, maybe you will like it even more than I did :)			"

												The game is great but the product is defective. I haven't completed my first play through of Lords of the Fallen because I simply haven't been able to.  Not because the game is too difficult or too long but rather because of endless crashes.  My first save file was ruined by a death loop bug that rendered the file completely unusable.  I looked to see if there was a solution or if others had experienced it.  A few had and some even were able to get out of it by rolling their character immediately upon loading.  ""OK"" I thought, ""It was only 10 hours on that file, no big deal.""  Now on my second play through (after having twiddled with the settings per all the common temporary fix threads out there) I just can't play for more than 10 minutes without a crash.  This is particularly problematic in a game in which one of the core mechanics is gambling for bigger rewards by not saving your game.  This, in itself, is a fun mechanic- I like the idea of having to risk your progress in the game for incremental rewards.  It's clever and potentially fun.  This is undermined entirely by the reality that bugs and crashes incentivize me to save as often as possible.  There are good things about this game, a lot of them.  The art is amazing, the game feel is heavy in a visceral way that connects you to what you're doing.  I can't recommend it until it's been fixed, however.  I can't even play it.  With a GTX780 and similarly big specs throughout the rest of my rig, there's no excuse why these glitches, crashes, and bugs should exist.  This game was simply not tested thoroughly enough. I hope the developers will 1- fix the bugs asap and 2- learn their lesson so that their talents aren't overshadowed by sloppy mistakes.Update 1: I have pushed through to NG+ perhaps due to a desire to harm myself.Update 2: I'm looking forward to the new patch which promises to fix stability issues; I will expand my thoughts.  Update 3: So far, so good.  Played for several hours without any stability issues.  Will get through NG+ before I decide to turn the frown upside down.  Clearly I'm enjoying the game a great deal or else I wouldn't be playing it.  It's still not for everyone.			"

												Originally the 'mixed' rating had put me off, but I decided to try this during a sale.  In a way that was a good thing, going in with low expectations and being pleasantly surprised.  The things that made me happy about it:   Good graphics  Gorgeous environments  Framerate not capped at 30 (ahem)  Difficult mobs/bosses  An actual storyline I had a read through many of the negative reviews and a lot of it is down to personal frustrations.  While in some places the game is actually quite unforgiving, I didn't think it warranted such negativity - difficulty spikes and overcoming them are part of the excitement of playing games like these.  The lesson I learned here was to take these Steam ratings with a pinch of salt.But to each their own, I will say - if you like fantasy-setting style games with difficult yet rewarding fights, try this out.I would advise you to have a look at a class guide first - I went in as a Solace Rogue and had a very tough time at some places but did manage to complete.

												Lords of the Fallen is the first true attempt from a Western developer to imitate and improve upon the formula established by From Software, and it's a mighty successful one. Though not without its shortcomings, the game fully delivers on its basic premise and it lays the groundwork for more games in the IP; with excellent graphics and solid action/RPG gameplay, fans of the genre should be pleased.A disclaimer from someone who could never fully get into Dark Souls to others like me: don't dismiss this game just because of that. Lords of the Fallen does a better job to help newcomers; you'll die and hate it at first, indeed, but eventually you will grow to love it.

												Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and the developers of Lords of the Fallen have made it no secret that they aim to recreate the magic of the Souls franchise. A series defined by brutal difficulty, ambient storytelling and a constant sense of despair, fear, and loneliness; Lords of the Fallen set quite a high goal, and it’s sad that it seems they weren’t able to make it all the way there.The story of Lords of the Fallen follows Harkyn, a gruff no-nonsense criminal released to defeat an invading enemy known as the Rhogar. Most of the game takes place in the Keystone Citadel, a vast castle set upon a snowy mountain at the peak of the world. The story seems ambiguous at first, with only mere mentions of Harkyn’s crimes and little backstory given other than the Rhogar seek to destroy humanity.There are developments, a few twists and turns, but they ultimately amount to nothing. The world is fairly uninteresting, and little inspiration was taken from the Souls series in creating a world that makes you wonder why everything has fallen to ruin. I cared little for Harkyn, and even less for the characters in the game. There are a few NPCs scattered about and a couple sidequests to complete, but really, this is a game focused on combat first, story second.As for the combat, it’s solid enough. You have a typical Souls control scheme, with light and heavy attacks, a dodge roll, a magic projectile-firing gauntlet, and the ability to two-hand or sword-and-board. Backstabbing is still the name of the game here, although the equipment and armor allow for a more tank-oriented player to hunker down instead of dodging and utilizing invincibility frames. Magic is also a tool at the player’s disposal, though the variety is rather interesting.There are three trees of magic you select from at the start of the game, focusing on certain strengths. All three trees receive Prayer, which spawns a decoy that any enemy, bosses included, will blindly attack instead of Harkyn. I only ever found use in the Brawler tree, where the abilities seemed extremely overpowered. Ram is essentially a fireball that goes through enemy shields, Rage allows unfettered use of an unending pool of stamina, and Quake is just straight-up a lightning bolt that wrecks everything in eyesight. There’s really no room for subtlety or complexity in this magic system, a plus for some and a minus for others.To be honest, most of the game’s combat feels much like the magic system: there is a sense of mind-numbing difficulty, but streamlined in order to not deter players who aren’t used to this sort of punishment. You’ll be challenged, but rarely punished. There’s a variety of approaches, whether you choose to strip off your armor and go fast and quick against the mightiest of bosses, or want to spam Ram on every minion in sight, and every strategy is viable.The trade-off is that there is little of the depth or complexity that enraptured Souls fans in the past. There is little variety in weapons, outside of the addition of gauntlets. Gameplay is interesting, but you won’t see as many gimmick builds or min-maxing as you would in a Souls game. This is furthered by the fact there is no multiplayer in any form; the lack of invasion gameplay and one-on-one duels means that your primary means of perfecting combat is against minions and bosses.Bosses are a major factor in any character action game, and even more-so in Lords of the Fallen. After facing encounter after encounter, your prowess and mettle is tested to the fullest by these monstrosities. The bosses are definitely special encounters, and stand out compared to the common fold of enemies. They’re difficult, and you’ll bang your head against the wall a few times trying to pass them.To be frank, the bosses of Lords of the Fallen are just not memorable in the slightest. It doesn’t help that they’re given little to no backstory, and labeled simply as “Commander” or “Worshipper” or “Infiltrator.” Souls games often had memorable encounters, heightened by the lore leading up to them and given meaning by the events of the game; battles against titans like Sif, Gwyn and Artorias have meaning behind them, and are a culmination of the player’s actions. The Rhogar bosses feel arbitrary, as do the rest of the bosses in Lords of the Fallen. They act as an end goal, a finish line, but signify little more than that.Lords of the Fallen can’t be painted over as simply a Souls copy, however. It does a few things to expand upon and innovate the mechanics of the pseudo-genre, and it does these well. The experience system of Lords is similar to the soul-collecting mechanic, where experience is earned from enemy kills and completing objectives, and dropped on the ground upon death.You not only have to recover these after your respawn, but you only have a certain time-frame to do so. The experience will gradually decay after some time, and eventually disappear. You also gain experience multipliers and extra loot the longer you hold onto your experience, at the cost of potentially losing it. You can “bank” you experience at checkpoints, but even this has it’s own set of risks. You can apply experience towards either a point for your stats or a point for your magic. These mechanics create a constant risk-reward balancing act, and is very fulfilling. I often found myself questioning whether to bank my XP into that spell point I was aiming for, or potentially lose it all in an upcoming boss fight where I wouldn’t have a good opportunity to reclaim my points.Graphically, the game is beautiful on high-end PCs. Console versions suffer from framerate issues, but on the standard gaming computer, this game will run at a clean 1080p at 60 FPS. The kicker for PC users is that they should prepare to deal with a wealth of bugs and glitches. I had several game-breaking bugs, which lost me massive amounts of progress and several chunks of hair. Also, camera control is abysmal in most hallways and corridors. While you have control of the camera, the automatic pans and swings around for backstabs or dodges are really annoying to deal with while you’re managing a million other things on-screen.Overall, Lords of the Fallen captures the Souls essence in a base sense, and provides a nice entry point for those intimidated by the series’ infamous difficulty. Where it failed to capture its inspiration’s essence was in the lore and storytelling, both of which fall flat in Lords. This is an enjoyable romp through a series of difficult bosses, and it does a nice job of making you feel like you’ve grown from a measly warrior to unstoppable force by the end of the game. Just don’t expect the same depth that inspired the fanatical cult following of the Souls games.			"

												Praise the  sun  \0/Review in Progress : will add on more Lord of Fallen is a beautiful third person hack and slash game that  is grim, challenging and reminds me of a of  Dark souls  with different hit mechanics, better graphics,  enemies with more abilities and a more articulate  plot.StoryThe game plets player assume the role of Harkyn as the words a different time and war pop up after the cinematic. Apparently, he is on a journey with another man traveling to a  monastery and has lost many men on the way. Only on arrival and opening the doors did they see that the monastery is completely empty and bodies' litter the entire room and demonlike enemies starts attacking....ClassesThree discipline  type for magic: Deception, Brawling, and Solace of magic to choose from and three equipments type to start off, Cleric, Warrior, and a rogue type class.Brawling is focused on offensive magic. Solace is focused on more protective and healing while deception is focused more on more of a mix of imparing and debuffing enemies.Variety of spells seems limited in this game for all 3 tree has similar spells.ControlsThe various attacks that can be performed are  weak and strong attack, rolling, running, jumping, back stepping, parry, frontal kicks, and dodging. The invincibility frames, however, are completely different and more precise when evading. There is a Magic and a Stamina bar so running, attacking, or evading use stamina while magic of any sort from spells to the gauntlet uses the magic bar.The initial layout for the controls is almost exactly the same as DS, if you know the controls, you'll understand this game right away. The only difference is the use of items and cycling it since it has to be favorite set or used from the inventory screen.When attacking you can chain combos with your weak and strong attacks, How hard you hold down an attack will cause it to use up more stamina so technically both your  strong attack have additional stronger attack. Included in attacks is also dual wielding or single weapons with both hands wields depending upon the weapon type. Later in the game players will discover a gauntlet weapon that will allow different type of attacks with spells such as range, aoes etc that uses magic. Runeslotting begins later on changing up items.The keyboard controls are bindable and the default is really decently bound through for this. The gamepad layout is similar to DS.EnemiesEnemies in the game starting off are a bit unpredictable due to having various attack patterns and having the ability to swing in various radius and also turning around. Some enemies such as bosses will have numerous fighting patterns that switched up depending on how much you damaged them. Stealth dispatching of enemies exist if you walk up to them slowly. Don't always depend too  much on trying to attack or evading from behind because you can still get hit from enemies when they swing their weapons near your character and they respond really fastSome of the AI is really stupid. I have seen my character stealth past them right in the front just by walking and not a single reaction from their line of sight at all and being able to do a stealth attack to kill them.Gameplay:After defeating  the first boss It seems that the points can be stored towards attributes or spells, Not storing can cause perma loss, but if you don't save or use your points  you can gain more experience and earn with higher kill streaks by playing on. Saving requires save shards nearby and going across the character development screen and where exp points can be banked. Upon dying players will have a limited time to gather their lost experience floating around that looks like a wisp which will need to be grabbed or you'll lose it. Most of the areas  of the game and map are open or enclosed  where enemies are plenty an ambush you along with  certain unique monsters hidden throughout that can cause your downfall so thread carefully, when enemies are encountered  lock on, swing and chain combos or your choice on bypassing them if you want. if you die or use a  save shard they will respawn most of the time. There are plenty of areas and chambers to explore.Combos are important for the play if one wants to master more damage and mastering them can be quite tough. Using your experience to upgrade your stats is also as important in order to do more combos, take more hits and gain more stats in surviving this world.During the story there will be certain choices players can take which are either evil or good. There are also dialogue options to help players better understand the story and situation at hand.Stats in the game fall under strength, vit, faith, endurance, agility and luckStrength for str weapons and to carry heavier gear, vit for health and potion effects, faith for mp pool and weapon magic damage, endurance for carrying more and stamina, agility for damage with fast weapons and energy, and luck for better items from enemies along with crafting material finds.There are also three types of armor in the game, Light medium and heavy, which affects your character in variety of ways with your stamina and movemen and def. Most equips found are part of set until next playthroughThe maps are dark but extremely detailed with destructible about such as barrels, book cases, benches, etc. with  decent physics. There are potions,chests, portals and  items hidden throughout and audio scrolls that tells the story of the game.  Graphics Looks amazing and well done, graphics are gorgeous and really detailed, many destructible all over the environment. Game runs at 30 fps for me for some reason. Trying to push or uncap for more. The interface is completely different in the inventory though and seems more sleek and clean. The game lighting is great, and the effects are top notch. The art reminds me of warhammer and the enemies   bodyparts/armor chips away as you fight them. The animations are seriously well done though sometimes I notice my rogue doing some really weird glitch through on attacks and hopefully that's a bug that can be fixed. Opinion?Game is awsome so far and borrows from DS well and DS borrows from Monster hunter well, Ds didn't invent the manual camera control style combat folks I've got games predating before DS. I also like the precision of hit boxes though it can be wonky at times, the challenges and boss fight  to this game along with the immersive  graphics, Movement feel so fluid with the character, though more work needs to be done to iron out the bugs. Many are going to compare this to dark souls because it's very similar with the camera style and controls, but yet it's different in mechanics  especailly enemy targetting. The game is ok overall and difficulty starting off seems really hard as a rogue class as in omg i am getting my face ripped.Pros so far+ Graphics looks amazing and really detailed. The Physics looks great when chipping at enemies.+ Dark soul's layout on controllers, the keyboard and mouse are really well bound and plays a bit differently+ Destructibles and physics DX 11 effects.+ Interesting classes to mix up, though spells are limited+ Great Voice acting and music scores that remind me of lord of the ring.+ Immersive environment, Blowing winds, snowfall, Shadows, Lighting etc.+ Enemy armors and weapons break as you attack themCons- No multiplayer- Optimization on this game right now currently is. Completely WHACK and first game for me to have frame drops at the wierdest places had to turn off some options to get it to run well.-The lip synching animation is horrible- Spells lack variety- starting  Bosses could be a bit challenging for some people.Yt video - Working on it, too busy playing the game.

												First time when i was checking on criticisms, i saw only negative feedbacks. So i had to try myself this game out, so what i got? Merciless enemies and bosses, game itself has beautiful graphics and armor/weapon designs, and that atmosphere? Oh boy..Since gamestyle is pretty similar to dark souls, i would call this game ""Men' s in heavy arms"" because of slow attacks and frustation because weapons lacks speed. LoF brings quite challenge all the time and therefore i say: Game is AWESOME in many ways, probably negative feedback was because of bugs? After 5 hours of gameplay i have encountered no crashes, no bugs. Probably fixed since last patch.But anyways Tl;dr: Loved Dark Souls? You gonna love this! :)			"

												Having played it back-to-back with Dark Souls I have to say it borrows a lot of elements but feels different overall - and that is a good thing. PROs: It's hard, to me personally even harder than Dark Souls was in the beginning. Maybe because of my non-standard starting combo (Hunter, cleric magic + rogue), maybe because I keep pressing B to dodge-roll instead of A. Combat is amazing, the controls are smooth and very responsive.  ""The more enemies you beat without using a savepoint/spending xp, the more XP multiplier you get"" feature. Loadscreen hints explaining stuff that I just had to google for Dark Souls. You might prefer it otherwise, I like when I can find all basic info inside the game. It looks absolutely friggin fantastic... CONs: ... if only Nvidia Turbulence wouldn't cause very frequent crashes (on a GTX 970 mind you, 0 crashes when disabled) it would be even prettier. Story feels kinda ""Yeah guys, we really should add some story"". A rather easily ignorable con for this game tho. A weirdly massive difficulty spike for the area between the 3rd and 4th boss really frustrated me :D "

												I am a huge fan of melee combat. The type you see in Dark Souls and orignal Age of Chivalry.Where your attacks matter and it's not just a spam fest with lol one button guaranteed counter (Think Shadow of Mordor, Assassin's Creed. Disclaimer: I dont think those are bad games, i just prefer a challenge and not my ""hero"" overpowered)So, it really just boils down to that, honestly. Do you love melee combat, slow tactical play, heavy weapons that feel heavy, armor that feels like it is heavy?Challenging enemies (each can end you if you get reckless), the sound of steel clashing with steel, being bruised and beaten, waiting for that perfect moment when the enemy makes a mistake? When the the time finally slows and your greatsword smashes him down? That adrenaline you get when you actually win a very hard boss fight?You do? Well get this, you won't regret it. Do you want to just mash buttons, get a combo streak, get one button multiple executions, fight 50 enemies at once? A nice map, waypoints, shortcuts, fast travel, road paved for you? Don't get this then.That's all you need to know about this game.Disclaimer: In my 26 hours of play, game crashed twice. Please, stop saying game crashes all the time because it doesn't.			"

												First of all, I really wanted to like that game, but it made it more and more impossible the more I played.From the beginning to the second boss, I enjoyed the game and thought it is a nice souls clone. But after that I started to notice issues that annoyed me the more I played.First, the enemies. While they are not really hard, there are enemies that take minutes to beat just because they are behind a tower shield. That would be no big problem, if your shield break and/or kick could shove the shield aside to make it possible for you to hit them. That won't work. Only thing that works is running shield bash, and even with that it takes way too long to kill them. The most stupid thing is that the enemies with the big shields have an shield bash + sword slash attack that is faster than anything you could do, even the light class + dagger doesn't offer that. Also, hitting enemies with big weapons doesn't seem to stagger them. There are unarmored crossbow wielding enemies that keep firing arrows at you while you hit them with a freakin'  hammer that has an attack animation of a train... The enemies are all very similar. The mutant knights you fought at the start keep appearing through the game with just more health and damage. That is true for all enemies.Next, the boss fights. I haven't finished the game yet, but what i have seen already makes me sad. The bosses are really easy, because they have 3-5 types of attack they repeat. A LotF boss battle follows always the same pattern. Get away when they do attack a, b or c. Roll away from attack d and attack for 1/1000 damage to their health bar. Repeat 10-20 minutes, you win. :(The area is relatively small and feels uninspired. At first sight, the game looks awesome and it does really have nice graphics. But later it is just repetitive and uninspired somehow. Also, after the second boss you don't know where to go. I went everywhere, beat the big shield guys near the back entrance and gone through the graveyard to the ""catacombs"". The NPC weren't at the place he supposed to be to let me into the other dimension/world. After I got out there i where supposed to go through the catacombs again. Also, catacombs is no area name but is the quest location. Confusing. Levers and that kind of stuff is hard to make out from the background of rubbish and debris.The checkpoint system makes the game unnecessarily easy. The enemies only respawn after you die, so you can replenish your health and vials infinitely while progressing through the area. While the bonus exp system is there to balance that, it doesn't work. The bonus is just not enough to make it worth to ""gamble"" for it with less healing.The character development and crafting is very disappointing. You choose one of three classes and then stay with 4 more or less useful spells. Crafting is not existent. There are runes you can put in some of your weapons and armor, but they are only a few and not really interesting or game changing in any meaning. Also, you do get the ability to put runes into your stuff only after the second boss. ... if you found the right way directly. A little bit late for my taste. The story and NPCs are not overwhelming but also not bad. Standard mediocre medieval monster stuff. Nothing impressing or interesting.The whole game feels slow. Really slow. Take Dark souls and make it 3 times slower. I don't see any gain from that. I want slow attack speed with ultra greatswords but not with small axes. Also, fast roll feels slow. Moving is slow, magic and shooting is slow. Not really fun to play like that. Souls gave you options, LotF gives you nearly nothing. Of course there are differences between light and heavy armor, but it's just too little in my opinion.The controls are badly programmed. Locked on an enemy, rolling/stepping backwards just seems to be a lucky occurrence. If you press back and are just one millimeter of to one side your character roles left or right not backwards. While the enemies even turn 360` with their hardest attack, you get hit all the time. It felt for me that there is nor invincible frame with rolling, too. The lock-on is clumsy and sometimes just annoys the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.Conclusion*First impression is nice, later gets boring/repetitive*Bad enemy and boss design, not hard but time consuming boring battles*Too easy checkpoint system*Character/Skill development nearly not existent*No crafting, only runes with small impact*Area small/repetitive design, way not clear/confusing*Story nothing special*Everything is slow, turtle on dope in gelatinous mass slow*Controls sometimes not direct/on the point*Nice graphics and sound design*If you liked souls series, do not expect something similar good from this game. Only buy at high discount!I give it 65 out of 100Side note: I played the game with maximum graphics fluidly and with a controller. "

Overview: Borrowing gameplay and design elements from Dark Souls, Lords of the Fallen is a deep, gorgeous looking third-person action RPG. Sadly, it also made some crutial sacrifices in the name of accesibility that went a bit too far, and ultimately spoiled much of the potential that the game had. In the same year that's given us the brilliant Dark Souls 2, I can't recommend Lords of the Fallen.Pros: Beautiful graphics, fluid animations, runs smoothly without many bugs (the developers have released a few patches that have seemed to cure many of the launch issues).Fun, satisfying gear. Weapons feel different, armor weight affects mobility.Semi-randomized loot drops makes collecting gear a lot of fun. Some of the best looking armor I've seen in gaming.Interesting risk-reward system where your xp and loot find modifiers increase with each kill, and reset to zero when you rest.Cons: Too easy! This is by no means an easy game, but starting with light armor my character soaked up a ton of hits, even from bosses. It only gets worse as your gear easily overpowers enemies later the game. The challenge just isn't there (see below for more).Most enemies (bosses included) can only really be fought one way. Wait for them to attack, dodge/block, hit, repeat. There aren't multiple ways to approach each battle, so the gameplay feels quite stale after just a couple hours.Character development is very limited. You're a warrior whether you like it or not. The game tries to mix it up with a 4 skill tree (either healing/defense, sneaky backstabbing, or more warrior stuff), but none of it really changes the combat up much. Also there's a projectile gun-type weapon, for some reason.No multiplayer. None. No co-op, no PvP.Conclusion: I really wanted to like Lords of the Fallen. I really did, and I really tried. CI Games deserves some credit for bringing it's own style to the Dark Souls type of hard core action RPG. Despite its many short-comings, we can be optimistic that they will keep working and deliver us a fun and challenging sequel. I'll sum it up with this, in my own words: Dark Souls scares me. That's why I keep playing it. I feel like Dark Souls is one step ahead of me at all times, that I'm never fully equipped for what the game is throwing at me. That's what makes it so special, it's David and Goliath and if I keep trying, I can bring down the giant. But that's the fundamental problem with Lords of the Fallen. In this game, I'm the Goliath and there are a bunch of Davids running around poking at my feet. It doesn't scare me, and it just doesn't have that satisfaction that I want from this type of game. "

												Deserves better reviews than it has. Apparently was riddled with bugs when released (lots of crashing, poorly optimised), but I had no problems running it on high settings with a modest mid-range rig (i5 3570k, AMD 7870, 8GB RAM). It also gets compared to Dark Souls a lot, and rightly so, but I don't think any game should be negatively reviewed for being 'not as good as Dark Souls', as that's a pretty high bar. So without further ado, lets dive right in and compare it directly to Dark Souls!Similar to Souls: Checkpoint system, red floating crystals instead of bonfires. Replenish HP / MP / potions, enemies respawn. Melee combat mechanics - parry (only with subset of shields), backstabs, stamina management, dodgerolls, staggering, light attack, heavy attack, running attack etc. Similar range of weapons. % Equipment load determines movement and dodgeroll speed. 'Weighty' feel to larger weapons. Weapons (but not armour) have stat requirements. Some weapons scale with their relevant stat. Loot - set loot gained through chests, enemies have a chance of dropping 'runes' (for upgrades) or equipment (rare). No duplicate armour / weapons. Level design - sprawling areas that loop back into each other by unlocking shortcuts. Lots of secret items and areas. Leveling - bank experience at checkpoints to level up attributes / spells, each subsequent level requires more. Upon death your exp is left as a 'ghost' with a timer on it, or until your next death. NG+ and NG++ for multiple playthroughs. Decimate furniture by rolling into itDifferent from Souls No fast travel from checkpoint to checkpoint, not a massive problem because; Smaller world, fast traveling would have been nice at times, but overall not a big problem. Shorter game, could be finished in maybe 8 hours if you don't explore much. Personally it took me around 15 hours. No invincibility during dodgeroll that I am aware of. Causes some moments of anger if you're used to Dark Souls, but you get used to it. Magic - each class (warrior, thief, cleric) has a set of 4 spells that can be unlocked and leveled up at checkpoints, separately from attribute points. There is also a gauntlet that has 3 modes of fire (basically different ranges), which gains power with more Faith (cleric / magic build). Both share an MP pool. Much more straightforward story, quite typical dark fantasy stuff, not too abstract or anything. Equipment upgrading is done through a 'rune' system - you gain sealed runes from defeating enemies, and unlock them to reveal type (eg power / fire / luck), runes range from 'lesser' to 'flawless' and can be attached and detached at will from equipment that has slots. No multiplayer aspectOther notes: The game looks great - dark atmosphere, good enemy/boss design, weapons / armour look suitably fantasy, so you get that extra bit of satisfaction from new gear. The melee combat is heavily emphasised, ranged combat is minimal (pretty much limited to gauntlet). Many weapon types have very slow attack speed, which can take a bit of getting used to, but there are claws and daggers for faster attacks (this is how I played) which are perfectly viable. It is not as big or complex as Dark Souls, but still holds it's own as a solid Action-RPG with dark fantasy flavour, good melee combat, and some side quests and extra exploration encouraged to flesh out the experience.All in all I really enjoyed my time playing Lords of the Fallen, and seeing as you can get it for disgustingly cheap when it's on sale these days, I don't see why you shouldn't pick it up.

												(TL;DR? This review is also available in video format for your convenience below.)With the recent success of the Souls franchise and its emphasis on precision timed combat and high difficulty it was only a matter of time before imitators would listen to the herald of success.  Lords of the Fallen brings its own take on the punishing hack n slash genre.  While there's no hiding its influence from Dark Souls, it doesn't manage to improve the formula enough to justify its own existence.The differences between the two titles will be immediately apparent.  You'll be moved throughout the game through a much more direct plot than the subtle nuanced on-goings of the Souls games.  You play as Harkyn, a prisoner released by Kaslo, to hold off an invasion from the imposing forces of Rhogar who are subverting the natural order of things in his world.  The story is rather empty and predictable for the most part and is told through clumsy character animations with flat voice acting.  It manages to do little else other than keep things moving along through the 12-20 hour campaign.  The visuals are solid for the most part and offer well lit, moody environments to explore.  Initially, the world feels large and expansive with a host of optional areas to explore but you'll soon come to realize most of these areas will require you to delve into them at one point or another throughout the story, making the interconnected albeit small castle that you spend the majority of the game in feel limited.  There isn't a huge variety in locations either as you'll generally be exploring the snowy exterior of the citadel or its gloomy interior.  The whole thing feels pretty underwhelming by the time you finish it all.Game play is very similar to the sword and board melee combat of Dark Souls but with a much more limited assortment of spells available to its three classes.  You'll also be welcomed with a large pool of life, a recharging mana bar, and a steady supply of healing potions that make the encounters considerably easier than its counterpart.  Bosses are intended to offer unique fights but by the end of the game you can overcome some of the more difficult bosses by simply buffing yourself with magic and pulverizing the boss to death before they can inflict enough damage back to offset your relentless assault.  The camera can also be a bit irritating as your battles can be hidden by hanging banners and other furniture with dips in the frame rate being commonplace. Enemies also tend to offer little variety with only around a dozen types with the shielded ones being the most annoying to fight since they rely on blocking a little too much causing conflicts with them to become prolonged and irritating.  All of that being said though, while not meeting the standard that Dark Souls met and being a little slower, it still manages to be competent enough to enjoy the game's short duration.The items that you acquire are all well designed and offer a much flashier aesthetic than what you'll find with most of the armor and weapons in the Souls games.  While you can upgrade gear and items with its rune system, you'll be frequently re-socketing pieces as replacements since upgrades will come frequently.  The soundtrack holds its own but doesn't manage to leave any lasting impression as is a common theme with the game.  One of the cooler aspects of Lords is the risk/reward mechanic behind its gameplay that rewards you for holding onto a larger amount of experience that can be cashed in with a multiplier that rises with each enemy killed, although it unfortunately only caps at 2.  You'll also be urged to return to your body quickly as the amount of experience you regain is based on the speed at which you reclaim your corpse.  Although the lack of overall difficulty in this compared to Dark Souls trivialized this aspect a bit as I was always able to run by enemies and regain my corpse quickly on the few occasions that I died.  Upon completing this game you'll be rewarded with a New Game + option that raises the difficulty and unlocks more spell trees but that's if you're able to get to the end which leads to Lords of the Fallen's biggest problem, game breaking bugs.While clearing out the missed collectables and locked doors throughout the world that I hadn't gone back yet to open just before the final boss I fell down a hole which killed my character.  Instead of respawning at my last visited checkpoint, the game quick saved and spawned me at the bottom of the hole which I was unable to escape from, or reload a previous save.  So with that, I had gone as far as I could without restarting the game on a new save file and playing through the entire game again to finish the final act.  Glitches like this are inexcusable in a finished product and should've been tested out before release.  Luckily, I wasn't too wrapped up in the story to care that much of whether or not I saw the end.Lords of the Fallen manages to feel like Dark Souls Lite, it offers similar but simpler, slower combat.  An interconnected but small world when compared to vistas like Lordran, and a risk/reward system with little actual risk.  In addition to all this it lacks any of the creative multiplayer features found in the Souls games.  If you're looking for something to hold you over until Bloodborne, Lords of the Fallen offers a strong initial impression that can scratch that itch for a very brief period of time.  Just be sure to watch your step and go into it with much lower expectations.This review is also available in video format:

												TL;DR: Buy Lords of the Fallen if you have a decent PC to run it onA lot of people bash this game, as you can probably see up there under the user reviews percentages.Most of those people are folks that live, breathe, eat and sleep Dark Souls or one of the other souls games in general (or bought it on launch day, more on that in a minute ) and as a result they spew bad reviews at it simply because its a similar game/competition, not harcore enough or simply ""Not the same!"", Its rather unfortunate really.Lords of the Fallen was really buggy on launch, like game destroying buggy, but now all of those bugs have been fixed and now the game works flawlessly. Having put 20+ hours into it I havent encountered a single bug or issue since it was patched up, like this ""animation lag"" or ""crash"" people falsely throw at this game nowadays ( once again, to make it less appealing than a Souls game because of blatant bias )Having a high end of average rig, I get a super stable 60fps when playing, and not only does it run smoothly the game looks amazing, so amazing on ultra, especially with its later armour designs  that frankly Im disapointed that Dark Souls 3 didnt end up looking this good. Animation quality with the exception of one or two characters is great and frankly its one of the few games wearing a cape actually looks cool as opposed to it looking like a sack of buggy Gmod crap.Gameplay and combat are pretty much what you expect, its a souls style game, a big open-ish area to area world. Combat consists of the usual light attack, heavy attack, block and then a parry/special shield move, also with a block-breaker, spriting, rolling and jump/lunge attacks. Dodging works just fine but heavier armour makes your dodge less viable etc etc, less emphasis on range, though you do get a ranged weapon eventually. Kill bad guys and fight a boss, if you die you lose all your experience until you can go visit the spot where you died to get said experience back, die again and its all gone. Stats n' the like work a little differently, but the idea behind them is the same, use gained EXP to level up, but if you hold onto your experience without visiting and saving your progress at a checkpoint you gain a multiplier to your EXP, which is good when you need to farm for levels and cuts out on some that needless busy-work time.While Lords doesnt have any multiplayer components, it places more emphasis on the story, and while the narrative is 'okay' thats where it all falls short. The main characters themselves with the exception of your main guy Harken, are sort've shoddily done. But there is dialogue choices and lil' sidequests where you have to make a decision that affects the reward you gain at the end. If you dont care so much about narrative as you do gameplay, you wont mind how bad the story is that much.Bosses are fun, each one with a little secret 'extra' way to beat them to gain a boss-item/weapon from them, the secrets can be fun to find even if some of them are somewhat missable or hard to figure out. Quest-lines, hidden secret weapons and armour, runes to upgrade you weapons and armours with, its all just filled with really good stuff.If you have a decent rig/desktop PC to run it on, and you want something new and fresh from the Dark Souls monotony, then just buy Lords of the Fallen,			"

												The game is over all pretty good. It takes a number of keys from the souls series and builds on it in it own way. While its not as hard as Dark souls 1 its still got some challenge too it. Right after fighting the 2nd boss its ramps up and gets a bit harder, not by much but it's still noticable. While at the time (10/29/2014) the game has a number of bugs and fps probelms its still pretty good to play. In its current state (10/29/2014) I would give it 7.5/10, however once its bugs get patched and sorted out it will be a solid 9/10.			"

												It's a pretty nifty game which I would normally recommend and say is worth the money. However, due to the batshit crazy amounts of crashes I've experienced, even starting to see god damn patterns to why I'm crashing, I think this game is more NAY than YAY. Never thoughts I'd say this, but get this for console instead of PC. The PC version crashes so much I'm actually going to give up on finishing it. Real shame that such a big game could have that dumb of a problem in it. PC port version of the game gets a 4/10, sorry CI Games, sorry Deck 13, but you ♥♥♥♥ing blew it.			"

												It's pretty hard to launch an all-new triple-A game nowadays due to the huge risk, the adversity towards it by the current video games industry, as well as the pretty finicky nature of actual players, who might judge things a bit too harsh.Even so, Polish studio CI Games, formerly known for the Sniper: Ghost Warrior titles, together with German developer Deck13 Interactive, decided to bite the bullet and roll out Lords of the Fallen, a brand new role-playing game that features big characters, huge monsters, and tough combat, not to mention some pretty impressive visuals.Lords of the Fallen follows the adventures of Harkyn, a prisoner whose crimes are written on his face. While the world is busy finding ways to vanquish all evil, an ancient god awakens and sends his Rhogar Lords to destroy it. As you can imagine, Harkyn is apparently the only man fit to go up against those demonic legions so he, together with mentor Kaslo, go on an epic quest to stop them from crushing the world. They get to explore a fair amount of environments and interact with different characters. Unfortunately, while you can make quite a few choices along the way, many don't have consequences and quite a few of the supporting cast members either use stereotype attitudes or are undeveloped. Plot moments are kept to a minimum and cut scenes do a decent job making things clear, without wasting time on things that don't immediately matter to the player. The world of the game gets fleshed out a bit more thanks to the audio diaries, but not many players will actually pay attention, which is a shame, as Deck13 and CI have done a great job in terms of world building.Lords of the Fallen tries to combine the traditional role-playing mechanics with those seen in hack and slash titles, delivering a result that works pretty well. Harkyn isn't remotely as agile as Devil May Cry's Dante, but his moves are pretty swift and his blows pack quite a punch, depending on the equipped weapon type. You can pick between three classes – Warrior, Cleric, and Rogue. Each has its own magic category, relying on spells to buff survivability and damage for the warrior, healing and enemy manipulation for the cleric, or stealth and critical hits for the rogue. Leveling allows you to spend points in either the stats category, thereby boosting your health pool, your damage, and other such things, or the magic one, where you can unlock new spells to unleash, depending on your available Faith level. The combat relies on regular and heavy attacks, with the beefier ones requiring a few moments of build up before they're ready to go. Without a doubt, fans of the Souls games made by From Software will feel right at home, but there are quite a few more elements added on top to draw in more people.Among them is the XP multiplier system. Each kill results in Harkyn getting more experience. When you reach the bonfire-like checkpoint, you can opt to use those points, thereby losing your multiplier, or you can keep going and see it increase exponentially. This high-risk, high-reward system is quite good, and if you die, you have a set amount of time to get back to your XP pile before it vanishes forever. The loot system is quite well done, and besides offering better and better armor or weapons, it also allows players to collect runes that can be used to provide great bonuses to your existing gear. These can often make or break a tough battle, so spending some time to analyze their pros and cons is essential. Unfortunately, you need to wait until you get to an NPC that can unlock the runes, so at least in the beginning you can only open certain chests with them.The environments look quite impressive, but they don't vary all that much, as you'll often be fighting through ruined castles or snowy areas. The world of Lords of the Fallen certainly looks amazing but it's not explored all that much. What's more, the lack of a map or at least a semblance of a waypoint system means that you might end up going down wrong paths filled with enemies only to encounter closed doors and other such things. Thankfully, the enemy variety is quite solid, with a decent amount of monsters wielding different weapons, spells, and attacks going up against Harkyn during the campaign. Some of the Rhogar Lords require quite a bit of out-of-the-box thinking, but sufficiently leveling up certain skills, especially on the warrior, make a few of them die rather easily.Of course, like in Dark Souls, the difficulty, at least in the beginning, is grueling, so expect plenty of deaths and other such things. Unfortunately, until you start leveling up your attributes and spells, you'll have a really tough time, especially when you go up against enemies that know when to use their shields. Some of their attack patterns are also erratic, so don't be fooled into thinking you've memorized their moves. Enemies are also quite agile, and in some cases, this exposes a few problems with hit and collision detection. Speaking of problems, you'll also find that there are no difficulty options. This means that experienced RPG fans might soon feel like their version of Harkyn becomes a bit too powerful towards the end stages of the game. There is a New Game + option that buffs difficulty but also allows your character to unlock a second type of magic spells from another class, so things get even easier if you make smart choices.It's also worth noting that, at least right now, the game is quite unstable on the PC platform. It crashes in all sorts of moments and the framerate spikes when transitioning from inside areas to exterior ones. Enemies will sometimes freeze in place, and if you attack them, they'll immediately fight back in a flurry of frenzied blows.Lords of the Fallen is a gorgeous experience in terms of visuals, delivering realistic graphics but with plenty of rich colors. Provided your computer can run it, turning on all the different effects makes the whole experience look even better. Character models are sharp and textures look amazing in quite a few situations, although in some things get blurry. Animations, unfortunately, are a bit erratic, especially when characters talk to one another, as they flinch and gesticulate even when they deliver regular sentences. Also, expect a lot of clipping when it comes to your character's cloak and shield.Lords of the Fallen is a decent role-playing experience with some innovative features but it's weighed down by the balancing problems and the technical issues. After a few updates, it might become a good and challenging RPG, but for now, it falls short. It is still very much worth playing, so don't hesitate to pick this up on a sale.Recommended "

A Very Good Game UnderratedAfter completing the game just now, I cannot refrain from writing anything but a positive review when there are so many negative ones here bringing the rating of this game down which is real injustice and a shame. Sure the game lacks Dark souls level of polish and there is the issue of crashes when the fighting gets a little too intense during certain boss fights and especially when magic spells are used too often in such scenarios but this in my opinion does not take away all the goodness this game offers overall. Being a carbon copy of Dark Souls in most aspects, Lords of the Fallen starts feeling like an entirely different game after a few hours. With a decent story, great graphics with spectacular lighting and particle effects, clever use of magic, tricky side-quests, hidden secrets and npc interactions, it creates an experience which is different from the Souls series which actually is a good thing in my opinion. LOTF is an easier version of Dark Souls with a merrier environment - much for the pleasure of a casual gamer though still only a Souls fan would connect to. First timers with no prior induction to Dark Souls kind of gameplay might find this game tough enough for few bouts of frustration.The graphics and lighting are really good and almost all armors are intricate in design. The music is satisying, voice acting good but the animations that support it look stiff most of the time. Combat feels strikingly similar to Dark Souls with identical button mapping on the gamepad which is a good thing for a Souls player. The loot is diverse and a few of the weapons and shields are awesome. For example, a shield called 'Twisted Ways' (DLC content) has a rotating map on it. How cool is that? Talking about map, the overall size of the game world known as Keystone is quite big and most of the time would leave you scratching your head as to how to get to a particular spot which had a locked chest that you now found a key to. With twisted dungeons hiding secrets, a castle holding plenty of hidden areas and a portal to a whole new dimension, the whole process of exploring every nook and corner can be daunting. Enemies and Bosses aren't that tough compared to Dark Souls and what I like most about them in LOTF is there is a knack in taking them down. Ofcourse, Dark Souls has it written all over it but in some areas in LOTF, especially in one or two boss fights you might want to think out-of-the box to avoid taking damage which is something spectacular when you discover it yourself. However, some boss fights are crash-riddled if you do not own a beefy PC and the DLC boss is such a pain to beat. End of the day, bad optimization is where the game loses at and If it weren't for this it would've received rave reviews for sure.Simply put, this game might fall short on optimizations but it is a very good game if your PC can power it. Following the footsteps of Dark Souls and yet bringing a whole new feel within is purely refreshing. LOTF is best played with keeping Dark Souls' gameplay in mind and might do enough to frustrate newcomers. But to those who are well acquainted with the Souls series, LOTF is yet another epic journey.To sum it up:   + Good Graphics - Needs a beefy PC   + Varied Loot - Some areas require polish   + Interesting Secrets/ Replayability - Can be frustrating to the uninitiated  MY SCORE: 80/100 "

												Ok, ok, this review has gone through a few iterations so bear with me people.When I first played LOTF, I absolutely despised it.  Being a big fan of the Souls games, I was looking forward to some Souls-esque but-without-getting-stomped-by-overpowerd-invasions fun.  But dang, Harken was slow and seemed to spend about 10 seconds winding up his attacks before actually throwing them, and I quickly grew bored of this game and its unresponsive controls.  So, my first review was rather scathing, and lo many a fan boy/girl posted some rather immature and insulting comments, most of which have been deleted.  I’m a stoopid noob and I should go back to candy crush saga, apparently.  I also need to 'git gud' even though the difficulty of this game (which isn't much) was never an issue...Being a cheapskate and wanting to get my money’s worth out of the game, I forced myself to complete.  And you know what?  LOTF is not a bad game.  I might even have enjoyed it a wee bit.  But I would not recommend this game unless it is on sale – because there are much better games (i.e. Dark Souls) which do everything LOTF does only much better.Still, LOTF is bloody gorgeous, looking like Todd Macfarlane and Warhammer Fantasy got together to make a Cannibal Corpse album cover.  The armour and weapon designs are so ludicrously spikey and evil that I want to break out my old Slayer albums.  Sound is also great, with satisfying clunks and crashes giving combat a satisfying feel.  The bosses are super cool too.  I also particularly liked the system up upgrading weapons and armour with runes, which is very simple but kinda nice anyway.However, I found the controls to feel really unresponsive.  No matter what class you play as, there’s a significant lag between actually hitting the attack button and Harken swinging whatever oversized spike metal thingy he is carrying.  It lead me to a lot of frustration, as I signed in vain while the enemy would rush off for a cup of tea, do the washing, then come back and put their shield up in the time it takes Harken to wind up his attack.  Second, the game is not really challenging, and it doesn’t have difficulty settings.  Most enemies can be overpowered just by circling endlessly and button mashing, and many of the bosses can be easily beaten on first try once their attack pattern has been seen a few times.  I understand that NG+ is more of a challenge, but I’d already lost interest by then.In summary, my opinion, which you don’t have to agree with, is that LOTF is an ok Dark Souls-lite game, but I wouldn’t recommend it because Dark Souls, even Dark Souls 2, does EVERYTHING infinitely better aside from graphics.  Furthermore, if I’m in the mood for some fantasy hack and slash and I’m not in the mood for Dark Souls, I’d play Devil May Cry, Darksiders 2, Dragons Dogma, Revengence or something long before I’d go for LOTF.  but hey there seems to be a lot of ppl who really loved this...what does a stoopid noob like me know anyway? git gud or go home...Edit - Now that Dark Souls 3 is out there is no need to even contemplate this game.  Or go with Salt and Sanctuary if your a 2d indie hispter - that said, if they make a sequel i'd give it a look as, if they got the gameplay right, this could easily be the Slayer album cover made flesh the never-dying 12 year old inside me is always looking for.

												FINAL UPDATE; Removed Original Review to make room;Well, I made it to NG++. IIRC, the First Warden on NG+ hit me for like 8 damage in full heavy armor. On NG++ he hit me for 12. I played a bit further and noticed a very sharp increase in damage from certain monsters in the first area of the game; so yeah, the difficulty technically increases.The shame is that it took so long to get this way. The gameworld is quite small once you run through it once and that ""newness"" feeling wears off. Its cramped, short and leaves me wanting. Lords of the Fallen is a decent games with Dark Souls mechanics, but after the first playthrough the game loses its drive very quickly. 7/10 is the best I could rate this game, especially with this crashes that I have also fallen victim too.Bottom line;+Great graphics+Dark Souls mechanics...ish+decent story and voice acting+has a feeling of drawing you in; presentation and atmosphere is well-done.+music is fantastic++catacombs area is perhaps the best area in the game.+cloth/cape mechanics are the best I have EVER seen in a game. I totally wish DS has this type of technology as well as other RPGS-relatively short. I finished the first run in 11-12 hours. NG+ was perhaps the same if not quicker because I was very powerful.-Feels cramped and the world is not nearly as large as the impression gives you. In ratio size, the game world is probably 1/3 of the DS series; that includes anyone of the games.-difficulty feels like its wildly overtuned on certain mobs while rediculously undertuned on certain bosses-less variety of monsters as one would expect-magic itself is remarkably similar to itself; all spells utilize a flaming avatar to accomplish what the spell would give you. Feels too generic and similar and ""Mimic"" was downright frustrating.-underwhelming crafting system. +/- defense in an element and/or attribute scaling and one would have hoped that putting a ""Fire Rune"" onto my weapon would make it burst into flames and set enemies on fire; nope. Only truly useful rune was the the attribute scaling one which doubled my 2h output to be able to put out enough DPS to kill the final boss on NG+ after over 12 attempts.-NG+ = shards for loot or you pick up any armor from the chests that you missed on your first playthrough. Incredibly boring-I genuinely expect to continue to progress my character throughout ALL playthroughs and leveling up my character in NG+ was a damn grind and chore beyond what I would have expected.I expected more. I bought into the hype and the game failed to meet my expectations. Im an experienced gamer. Ive been playing games through my days ever since NES. Im no stranger to game mechanics and progression. Get it if you want it, but dont expect to be floored unless you have low expectations and standards. I wish I would have waited for sale.UPDATE-2(Slight Spoilerish);;From what I have read playing as a warrior is generally considered to be the easiest form of play. This is using a shield and possibly a 2-handed weapon. I use this setup. I decided to jump back in and play a bit more on NG+. I have reached the Citadel and have noticed a large jump in damage to my character. I am using the heaviest set of armor with the best defense stats and a tyrant in the graveyard nearly one-shotted me with his overhead swing. It was a genuine ""WTF"" moment.Needless to say that I was quite suprised. I continued playing a bit more and noticed sharp rises of damage intake during set points. The catacombs boss proved an interesting challenge as he hit quite a bit harder which is something I was not used to. I actually died on the giant boss that you eventually meet in the area of the three statutes. He hit quite hard.I am not picking up anymore armor on NG+ which leads me to believe that because my defense stats will generally not improve except whenever I mod them fully with runes that I have picked up throughout the game and because the damage intake is steadily and sometimes sharping increasing as I get towards end-game sections; I do feel that perhaps NG++ will truly be where the actual difficulty lies that people most want concerning this game.Its a matter of deduction based on the information available. This is with the best defense AND without using spells. As such, I am now actually looking forward to NG++ to see just how punishing this game truly is.Also, because of the high defense given by heavy armor...this means that medium and light armor wearers will face significantly more damage and possibly one-shots on several abilities given by several mobs. This is not considering any defensive advantages given by the magic system in this game. It is purely utilizing armor and weapons.I have currently 13 potion slots and I find myself using them more and more. That is a good sign. I will update when I finally experience NG++UPDATE;After playing through NG+ to the halfway to 75% point I must say that I have to change my review to being recommended only if your dead set on getting a game that is similar to the DS series or waiting for a sale or unless your out-right starved for something new and exciting.Unless you enjoy the story and are set on keeping the same playthrough running as much as you can then you will not find hardly anything at all to keep you engaged with the game after beating it the first time...unless you want to make different choices to affect the ending slides; but you could just watch youtube, right?I saw the vids on youtube and even the tips during the loading screen. They said you will get new loot and stuff on subsequent playthroughs. The only thing that I have noticed are new lore drops specifically in the regions on normal that were not there but were then there on NG+As with regards to armor/weapons? I did pick up a light armor set which seems to be the rogue counterpart to the last heavy armor set I picked up for warriors. I could have missed it on my first playthrough, however, so this isnt saying much. I went through this entire experience of NG picking up shards 95-99% of the time. Very underwhelming.My thoughts are that what was promoted is not what was essentially delivered to a satisfying context.Im disappointed. The combat is good, but I feel that long-lasting value is lacking to this game and that is a damn shame.For the first playthrough, however, it was a blast.			"

												Most of the negative reviews are people who had crashes/technical issues.I've had 0 crash and played through the entire game.While not as good as Demon Souls or Dark Souls this game does have better graphics and pretty much the same gameplay albeit being MUCH easier.If you thought about getting into Dark Souls but are having second thoughts because you've heard its difficult I would suggest you start with this game and see if you like it, it can serve as a nice introduction and let you get hang of the gameplay, the controls are almost the same and much of the principles and gameplay are the same.TLDR : If Dark souls had an ""Easy mode"" this would be it.

												UPDATE: beaten the game and all opinions below still apply, honestly (I was about 8 hours in when i wrote this impression). I can say that if you don't like Demons/Dark Souls, you will more than likely doubly-dislike this game. So just to get that right out in front, don't look for this game to change your opinion on the Souls-style gaming, because it wont. Now to people who are looking for a Souls-like experience, in my honest opinion, you should NOT get your hopes up. While the game has an overall Souls feel when it comes to combat, as Lords of the Fallen (LotF from this point on) seems to borrow VERY heavily from the game, it's about as far from Souls-FEELING as it could be given how closely the mechanics work. The game- is SLOW. Like, ""snail trudging through molasses in winter-time"" slow. In every aspect that a game can be considered slow, LotF is. Player movement is slow, attack animations are slow, roll speed is slow, gauntlet attacks are slow, spell startups are slow- hell even the story is slow, but I'll talk about that later.If you go into this game thinking you're going to play it like anything other than that fat-rolliest heavy armored monster-weapon-wielding tank in Dark Souls, then you're going in with expectations far exceeding what the game allows. Unfortunately, it seems that many of the enemies and a few of SOME enemies attacks seem to be designed entirely around blocking the hit and then countering after their animation is done- which is fine for the most part, but when LotF advertises dual-wielding fast weapons and light armor with the option to dodge roll away from enemies, it's NOT fine. The level of reaction time a person would need to dodge some enemies moves borders on precognition, and this is coming from a Darks Souls 1 and 2 vet (nearly 800 hours combined with both games across PC and Xbox 360). Not only that, but many enemies have RIDICULOUSLY GOOD tracking on their moves. Which is GREAT for THEM, but sucks  for the player. Take all of the complaints of Dark Souls 2 humanoid enemies having auto-tracking overheads and you can apply that to almost every enemy in the game with nearly every attack. Granted you can still dodge them, just like in Dark 2, but it's still difficult, and if you're anything but fast rolling, the chances of you rolling far enough to be out of range of their next auto-tracking attack is slim. Take one of the later bosses for example- The Infiltrator. VERY MINOR SPOILERS  I dodge the first attack of her hit string, by rolling UNDER her, only to have her INSTANTLY turn around and hit me with her second swing because I could not roll far enough away from her. Very, very poor design. I wont get into the fight itself until later. The enemies in this game so far (as I said, about 8 hours in) are almost all humanoid. So circle-strafing almost completely nullifies the lesser enemies as a threat, which is fine. However, some of the enemies later on end up having such good tracking that it's nearly impossible to get around their shield. This wouldn't be a problem if after guard-breaking them with a kick my attack animation was fast enough to hit them before they recovered but sadly with just about anything other than claws or daggers, it was not fast enough, and I was left fighting a frustrating battle of ""wait until they attack and try to move in before they recover"" which also proved incredibly difficult. Okay, so how about blocking with my shield and allowing them to suffer recoil from their blow and sticking them then? Nope. They recovered before my hit landed and blocked it. OKAY. HOW ABOUT I JUST SIT HERE AND HOLD MY SHIELD UP UNTIL AN OPENING PRESENTS ITSELF. ahahahaha- no. He guard breaks me with a shield slam that is almost faster than my brain can even register and then follows up immediately with a slash that takes down 3/4's of my health bar. Mind you- this is all ONE ENEMY- but it's the perfect example to what I feel is just bad enemy design in general. You want to make your enemies hard, cool give it some of the counters above, but not ALL of them. I literally had to just run away from the damn things until my mana filled up enough to allow me to burst him with my gauntlet- which took 4 hits (and if you've played the game, just after you get the gauntlet, getting in 4 gauntlet blasts can take a long freakin' time with the slow mana recharge and how much it costs early game). Not only that- there were 3 of these enemies in the area, sort of following the same corridor. Hurrayyyy. I beat them but I was not at all happy with what I had to resort to in order to do so- for the gauntlet to be the ONLY reliable way to deal with them at that point just was not fun- at all. As for the monster designs, they're fairly simple. They don't do much poise damage, they mostly stagger off your shield, and some do fire or poison damage but it's all pretty standard stuff. Nothing to complain about, nothing to praise. Boss designs- SPOILERS AHEAD So many of you probably know that the first two bosses are tower-shield users. Basically you wait for them to attack and either dodge or block and retaliate. Standard stuff, nothing to talk about with the first one... The SECOND tower shield boss- summons adds. Which, if you're a Souls fan, you are probably of the same opinion as I am, that adding adds to your boss fight is basically admitting that 'yeah, we didn't know how to make the fight hard or interesting, so worry about these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s screwing with you while you're fighting this brainless boss"". Now I make an exception for this one, because the boss does not stay active while the adds are out, so you fight the adds and then go back to the boss- fine, whatever. Pointless? Sure. Harmful? Not really, it's fine. Now beyond that is where it starts getting irritating. The next boss I fought killed me a few times by doing an AOE attack that covers the whole entire arena. He has a startup and once you know what comes after the start up, you know what's on it's way- but the first time, you're screwed. Cheap death, cheap gimmick and utterly pointless once you figure out WHERE you're supposed to stand, which is not exactly made apparent when your first instinct is just to avoid the blue bulbs and hide somewhere they're not near. On top of that- he summons adds. Same with the next boss, Infiltrator. Adds, heals itself, mana is being sapped.. otherwise a boring fight with only a few actual attacks.The level design is-  okay. The game does take the open world aspect of Dark Souls 1 with areas looping back and creating shortcuts from other areas- but the problem is going THROUGH the areas is pretty linear. It's much more akin to something like Dark Siders 1 level design where you go the way they want you to go and then loop back around when you acquire a thing that you needed to get into an area you couldn't before- which is really just to create the ILLUSION of an open world game. On top of that, in my first few hours of the game, I saw just blatant copies of previous areas with just a few minor furnishing adjustments and enemy placements. Pretty lazy. However, the ART style is really nice, if you're into that Diablo-esque ""hardcore metal hellspawn"" style- which I am, aha. If all that wasn't enough to spook you, the game has performance issues. My PC runs  Shadows of Mordor on max settings without a stutter, this game drops inexplicably below 30 FPS constantly, and sometimes lower- and that's with settings set down on what are described as, or would be considered ""medium."" Very disappointing. Story is the most barebones ""i'm a tough guy"" story you could have. Don't come to LotF looking for anything more.Sorry. Can't recommend this game so far...			"

												Game is underrated because of somer players experiencing crashes. Those negative experiences are greatly overshadowing the people who are in game enjoying themselves. To people who are experiencing crashing: I was one of those people. An AMD Catalyst update fixed the issue for me. I'm running HD Radeon 7xxx series in crossfire and Windows 8.1.Please stop giving a negative review of the entire game because it's crashing for you. Every game release has issues. If the developers were ignoring our experience that would be one thing. But the developers are constantly replying in the discussions and releasing patches in order to solve the issue as best they can. It's too early to determine whether we've wasted our money. If you're still crashing then enjoy something else in life and check back later. You can't review a game you haven't played. Yes, you've spent your hard earned money. But. You. Have. Not. Played. The. Game. There's proof the developers are working and some people's crashes (mine included) have been resolved.EDIT [03/03/2015]:Interesting. I happened to check back at this review and saw all of the negative comments, which I can only assume are the same people having issues.Should the product have been a better quality upon release? YES. But the reviews people left gave a horribly false impression that the developers were not responding AT ALL, which was FALSE.This is where I had a problem and felt the need to write a positive review. My review offered what I thought was important to tell people that was lacking in other reviews (i.e., nothing explaining for the umpteenth time that it's a Dark Souls clone. Seriously, how many reviews do you need explaining that?). People were focused on negative experience of the game crashing; therefore, my review focused on the opposite side of that. My patience with the developers, WHO HAD RESPONDED to the crashes with attempted bugfixes, is not apologetic. I saw complaints. I saw responses attempting to address those complaints. That's progress in the right direction. And realistically, that's the best that can be done because magic doesn't exist. NO EXCUSE for a faulty product, but at the same time, leave a fair review noting that developers are responding.TL;DR (for the lazy ones): You have a right to do what you want with your money. Leaving a negative review because a game doesn't meet your expectations (e.g. doesn't work) within a certain timeframe is COMPLETELY FAIR. Just make sure you say THAT in your negative review. It is UNFAIR for EVERYONE to a write negative review suggesting development just isn't responding to problems. This is what my original review was targetting: the people writing negative reviews because they were crashing and claiming development was unresponsive. Some of us have been on both sides and would take a responsive development team fixing a faulty product over a decent product but unresponsive development team any day. I hope everyone is now in a position to enjoy the game. I won't be reading any further comments.			"

												UPDATE: After approximately 10 hours of play, I have to say that Lords is surprisingly well put together, fun to play, and perhaps most importantly (at least it was for me), LOTF FEELS like Dark Souls!-Blocking, movement, rolling, armor weight plays a role in your roll... Familiar and comfortable - which is good, because LOTF's combat is (dare I say it) deeper than DS!-The classes dictate your gameplay - the rogue is VERY different from the warrior, who is also very different from the mage. -Ph4t l3wtz r ph4t. A great RPG inventory, which leads me to...-Stats page! I don't want to spoil the game or the story for anyone, but everything here is a lot of fun. I've got 3 of the big bosses down and the game is still mysterious but scattered with ""lore"" drops that unlock more of the story. There have been a couple of side quests, and a Dark Souls-eque decision I had to make regarding an NPC (help him or harm him). I look forward to NG+, which I haven't said about a game in a long time. 8.5/10Buy it for sure, watch it for a sale if you have to, if you liked Dark Souls you will enjoy LOTF!====Update: After 3 hours of gameplay, I've re-rolled my character and beat the first boss twice. Dark Souls fans, praise the sun! This game is awesome!====A polished, working and serviceable Dark Souls clone. And I say that with the utmost respect, because it's fun, challenging and feels like a mix of Darksiders, Diablo and Dark Souls. If you enjoyed DS, you will enjoy this..... If it runs. As of this review the game is poorly optimized and requires tweaking to make it run properly. AMD users have no love at launch and many have issues, Nvidia users should change their Physx settings to GPU through the Nvidia control panel. If it is patched, this game is an outstanding achievement for CI Games, because it's well built and fun to play.			"

												Thank you to Deck13 and CI games for development and publishing Lords of The Fallen. I enjoyed the world and charcters you provided for me to escape.As i end my run of LOTF during new game + and reflect my on experience it reminds me of a successful turn-based game(Aarklash Legacy) that stripped away a lot of ""trending"" RPG systems to the bone while focusing more on gameplay. I think thats exactly what LOTF also has done though with mixed results but it has more me excited for a sequel rather than another Dark Souls.LOTF is a 3rd person action game in which you play as Harken(no charcter custimization) a criminal that has been sprung from jail from a mysterious monk named Kaslo. Kaslo insist you are the one to defeat the evil rhogar and the revived God Adyr as it takes evil to slay evil. Though Harken wears his crimes on his face with markings(very cool)it is only mentioned briefly from a run in with a guard and we never know what crimes he committed. A big opportunity missed in that regard. Along this story quest you will face a few decisions that will decide one of three possible endings. Its a good video game story with good voice acting but none of it was memorable. Its all pretty standard by now, but more effort is here than expected and its actually a story rather than pieces and speculation.Once you start the game you are only given 3 classes to choose the cleric, warrior, and rouge which for story reasons makes sense. All charcters have pre made stats so custimization is minimal. I chose the rouge class which from my understanding is considered hard mode and at the start it is very diffcult as a slight breeze seemed to kill me. Fortunantley you are able to level quickly but it took a good 10 hrs before i felt powerful. Leveling your character is pretty normal as you slay enemies and complete quests you are rewarded with XP which you will distribute through either upgrading your magic(4 spells x 3 upgrades) or physical (6 options STR/VIT/END/FAITH/AGI/LUCK). Again comapared to a lot of RPGs these upgrades while minimal i think actually made it easier to maintain the specific charcter you envisioned at the start. Gaining experience does come with its caveat of risk and reward. In LOTF the longer you stay alive and kill enemies a multiplier for XP will continue to increase(x2.0 max) and If you die your 'ghost' will be waiting for you to return. However, your ghost will dissolve based on the stregnth of the multiplier. The larger the multiplier the longer it will be visible and at 100%. I like this idea but it is basically null becasue of checkpoints are located everywhere. I can only think of one instance where i was not able to retrieve my ghost and it was just a dumb mistake on my part. LOTF also does not follow todays trend with a massive open world but a more confined semi linear castle exploration design. This made for walking around slow and steady and some of the levels are good but late near the end game i was totally lost and could not recall where to go. Dont be mistaken there are some levels that are outdoors but for the most part action is in tight hallways. The level and quest design also plays into LOTF no hand holding policiy which i love but if you want to make it easier on your self keep notepad and pen close. Not suprising as with any title today i recall LOTF did have some launch issues with some bugs and graphical glitches but other than a crash or 2 the game played and looks amazing. The envorments, weapons, enemies and charcters all have a heavy metal vibe and the sound design maybe some of the best for this type of genre i have heard. The thud of weapons against shields, echoes in the caverns and just the wind blowing all make for a very immersive experience.  As a rouge i moved fast and with the spells available i was pretty powerful late in game but getting in close against enemies was high risk. However a majority of fighting is always one on one so encounters are not too difficult. I pretty much used either daggars or these awesome wolverine like claws  as weapons and late in the game i found out somthing i did not know. Without spoilers it basically changed everything about my charcter and i suddenly became a real bad♥♥♥♥♥  If LOTF has its 'thing' its these hidden secrets about weapons, bosses and quests. After i completed the game and found out some of the secrets i was suprised how deep and how many there actually are becasue in In game you would never know. After my initial playthrough i started up new game + which a rarely do but becasue i wanted to see if any higher gear would drop and i was really dissapointed. Enemies and loot did not scale and i basically walked through the first 4 bosses without a scartch. If it did scale who knows i proabably would still be playing.LOTF is a good new action RPG that compliments other titles in the genre but seperating itself in some new and exciting ways.  It doesnt follow todays RPG trends of needing a huge open world, 100hr campaign, and deep crafting system it relys on good ol' game and gameplay and that is always welcome in my librbary. PositivesA solid 3rd person action RPG game that doesnt take 100 hrs to completeEnviroments, weapons, charcters and enemies look greatSound design is incredibleNice clean UINo hand holdingLevel design is ok, but i would like to have seen the world more interconnectedSome bosses are great A lot of 'hidden' content for quests, bosses and equip You can break the game making it easyNegativesToo many Checkpoints decrease the tension, maybe an option to decrease for difficulty?Enemy variety Some bosses were very basic in design patternNo scaling for enemeis or loot in new game +the balance of enemies and spells  fells off- you are OPNot a lot of difference in spells from each type of charcter choiceCrafting is quite shallowInventory UI could be better-cant drop itemsNotes:I played on my desktop PC with an R9 390 video cardI have about 30+ hrs in one full playthough and upto the 4th boss on new game +I played the game at 1080P/ 60 running smooth with 1-2 crashesI used an Xbox controller			"

												I paid full price for the game and can currently play 10% of the game.  After beating the 3rd boss, the game crashes when I load into the next zone.  Tried changing every setting in the book and nothing resolved it.  Contacted Steam asking for a refund, because releasing a game this broken should be a crime.  There are a ton of other bugs too, but no point in mentioning them when I can't even play past the first 2 hours of the game.			"

(Game looks amazing).-Armor and weapons look amazing.-You play as a beast.-Combat is rewarding and fun.-Experience multiplier risk/reward.- Three classes.Cons:-Some enemies swing with your dodges.-May need a few more tips or help.-No ingame map, or mini-map.-Bosses didn't pose much challenge.Solid game if you're looking for something similar to DS.

												Criminally underrated game, The majority of the negative review this game gets are from ppl comparing it to the game it drew influence from (Dark Souls) and expecting the mechanics to be a carbon copy which they are not.Combat feels more heavy and impactful and it uses hitbox angles to a bigger extend (enemies with shield might seem OP until you realize you can jump attack and angle your weapon so it hits above the shield etc).If you are a ds player don't expect to wear heavy armor a gs and be able to dodge and attack out of a roll, you can attack out of a roll but only with lighter weapons.of course the game is not perfect theres not that much variety  with the enemies and the look of the areas, magic in this game is more for support that instead been able to do magic builds.If you like ARPG you should try this out, is really way better than people make it out to be.

												It's Caffeine Free Diet Dark Souls, but still good. ""It's not as good as Dark Souls"" isn't really that bad a thing, since most games aren't. Lords of the Fallen is a decent effort. While it falls short in terms of character customization (there is none), the gameplay is fun, the few innovations are all positive, and the game looks fantastic even on the lowest settings.			"

												Genre - Dark Fantasy Action RPGSo this game is like Dark Souls, not as good, but in the same league. Dark Souls fastly became one of my favourite game series after a bit of trial and error. This game follows a similar format, fight monsters in third person with melee and a few spells (no ranged in this one I'm afraid). The combat flows quite well, although it could be a bit more accurate on registering a hit sometimes. The mobs are quite varied and will need different tactics to defeat. The same can be said of the bigger bosses. You also might need to grind a bit (not too much so far though) to beat some enemies, but this doesn't feel like a chore. You grab armour and weapons and can customise them with different level gems. The story is standard fayre but it seems to keep the game flowing. You only get the one male character model to use but with three different classes, sorry girls and girl wannabes. I have basically used this game after finishing Dark Souls 2 to give me a break before I jump into the next New Game +, and this game does the job nicely.			"

												Don't. The game looks pretty. It sounds pretty. The character development feels like it could be pretty.The combat though... isn't good. It's slightly clunky but managable at first, but then you run into an enemy with a tower shield and the fun just jumps out the window and the tedium sets in.It's a game that needs other options on how to deal with enemies, and pigeon-holes you into doing only one thing, regardless of what your spec happens to be. The fact that the rogue, for instance, needs FAITH to cast his spells (and be a rogue) should be a clue. The fact that a tank/warrior needs the same stat to cast HIS spells should also be a clue.The classes don't really work the way they need to.That's not even getting into how the combat feels, which is awkward.Weapons and characters do not interact as if they are in the same world. I feel like the animation happens, then damage somehow happens. I don't feel like the weapon is connecting with anything. The weapons certainly don't connect with the terrain, which is a shame.Weapon animations themsevles are largely dissapointing not just in visual appeal but also in practical use in combat. One of the first weapons you get is a greatsword from a boss, and it is arguably the best in damage for a strength based character but it is also almost useless due to it's slow animation speed and the fact that the move set is awkward in a fight.Dodges are completely useless. They are too short, the invulnerablity is too short, and enemies will follow you through a dodge and hit you anyway if they are charging.Sprinting is a pain in the butt on a controller. Holding down the same joystick you use to move is not a good idea for a sprint function. It's especially awkward since you need sprint to fight and you need sprint to JUMP. And jumping is required to get to certain areas.Leveling up takes too long and the rewards for leveling up aren't that interesting.Spells are limited and mostly boring at the start.Some enemies (especially those with shields) are tedious to the point of frustration because their guard can't be easily broken, dodging around them doesn't work (they stick to you and rotate very fast), the kick attack is erratic and unreliable, and they don't seem to lose stamina when you hit the shield. They certainly don't lose more stamina than you do, and you stagger yourself if you hit a shield anyway.The enemies animations always seem faster than yours, even when they are using a great weapon and you are using a 1h sword. For whatever reason, enemies always seem to interrupt your animation while it is very rare to interrupt theirs. This means you can be spammed to death by enemy attacks, while you cannot spam them to death. This is especially frustrating when dealing with multiple enemies at once. Gods help you if more than one of them has a shield, because using a strong sweeping attack certainly won't.There are more things to complain about, but they all center around the combat system and controls. The thing is, 99% of the game is the fighting, and the fighting itself is tedious and frustrating. Unlike in Dark Souls where if you beat a monster that has been giving you issues and you feel elation, in this game I feel nothing. Ultimately, it feels like I didn't win. I feel like the game just randomly allowed me to win. Skill doesn't appear to play a part in how the game goes, which is exactly the opposite of what I wanted out of this game.In short, don't buy it unless it is heavily discounted. I'm glad I waited and didn't get it at premium new release price ($50+) but I still feel that at $30 I could have spent my money elsewhere and been happier. The game looks really nice, but it doesn't play like a play-tested game. I feel like it was such a missed shot. They had everything they needed to give From a run for their money, but the one thing they didn't perfect bit them in the rear.			"

IntroductionIf you are that person thinking you might actually enjoy this game but hesitating because of the negative comment ratio, I suggest you not to. Just go out and get it, the content and quality this game offers is well worth its low price even without a sale. Now that being said, let's explain why;Artwork (9/10)The game has an amazing art style and very good graphics to display it. Environments, armors and weapons are of very high quality. Character animations are also well done.  Both movement and attack animations look very natural and feels right.Combat (8/10)Adapted from Dark Souls, the heavily punishing combat system is nothing original but works just fine with a large variety of weapon choices. Story (5/10) Altough we have an intresting main character, a not so bad universe and a few great dialogues, LOTF is not a story driven game. It does introduce us with some details of its universe with the collectible audio notes every now and then but since the game progress is slow due to its difficulty you never get caught in the flow of the story. Also the ending was rushed and looked cheap compared to the rest of the plot.Stability (10/10)I guess the game had some issues at the beginning hence it got a lot of negative comments about crashes and bugs but as for my 20 hour walkthrough I haven't experienced any crashes or glitches.SummaryLOTF is great choice whether you already like Dark Souls-like combat & atmosphere or you want to try it but don't really want to invest a big sum of money just to see if you would like that. It certainly is a very cost-efficient purchase and a fine game that I'd recommend.			"

												Ok, First of all: I had fun with this game. 13 hours of fun. It should have been 15 hours of fun. After ""The Annihilator"" Boss, he bugged, and I couldn't progress in the game anymore. This bug has been acknowledged by the devs since nov '14, and in april 15 there's still no patch to fix this. Ok. I hate when I can't finish games after 13 hours. I had to watch the lets play to at least know the ending, because I didn't want to invest another 13 hours for this bug to eventually happen again.So what's great about this game? + It's a Dark Souls clone, but it's a bit easier (if you like it to be a bit more casual)+ Great graphics and ambience+ way more simplified classes than in Dark Souls (things can get confusing in DS)+ not as ""Dark"" as Dark Souls, so maybe appealing to larger audiences+ it just feels more epicWhat's bad?- lip sync and dialogues. Wow they suck. Also the characters are moving like 1990 half life characters when they talk- Could have done without characters at all. You're not invested into them the least- Bugs. Game breaking bugs. And crashes.- Rather easy (more casual than DS)All in all, I would have loved to play this some more, or at least finish it myself. But as it is, for me right now, I can't recommend it - because not being able to play the game to the end SUCKS. This doesn't mean that this may happen to you, and as I said, the 13 hours i DID spend on this game were fun.			"

												Lords of the Fallen is actually pretty great. I had held off picking up the game for a while because I'd seen a lot of ""Meh"" comments about it, but I actually really enjoyed it.Is it Dark Souls? No. Does it scratch that same itch? Absolutely.GraphicsThe game's gorgeous. From an artistic (design) perspective it's not on the same level as Dark Souls but they do a lot of great things with lighting, physics (except for some hilariously bad rag-dolls), and particle effects. There's also a lot of great texture work here. Cranked up, it's a very pretty game. It also has some of the most badass armor designs I've ever seen in a game, and none of them look bad, from the earliest ones to the stuff you pick up late game.CombatThe combat is quite fun if you're a fan of Dark Souls/Monster Hunter's style of deliberate pacing. It's got some pretty challenging bosses too - most of which I'd say are fair but tough. I think there are a few too many variantions on ""Dude In Armor"" enemy types but it's not too egregious. One thing I'll say is that it clearly has a primary focus on melee combat. You get a gauntlet which can be used for projectiles, and there's magic in the game, but the problem is that the magic skills are on timers and both it and the gauntlet share your magic resource, which regenerates fairly slowly. Both the magic and gauntlet aren't bad in terms of being effective, they just seem to be mostly supplemental and are designed to accompany your melee attacks, not to replace them.StoryThe story's kinda bleh to be honest - it's not exactly bad but it's a bit on the generic side. I think part of the problem is that they kindof drop you into the middle of things with very little context and I often felt like there were missing pieces - there's very little character development to speak of (there's really only a handful of speaking characters, for that matter), things just kindof happen as you progress. Most of the backstory comes from collectible audio logs (which are oddly represented by pieces of paper, but are literally referred to as ""audio notes"" while they're playing haha).ConclusionOverall I definitely think it got a bad/unfair rap primarily because it's a whole lot like Dark Souls but not quite as good. Outside of that comparison though, I actually think it's a really fun game. The combat is good. The graphics are good. It's challenging and scratches the old Dark Souls itch even if it's not quite on the same level. Recommended!			"

												Lords Of The Fallen is not an incredible game, but if you are a fan of the Souls genre it's good enough to keep you entertained until the end. There are a few things which feel a bit rushed, mostly the magic and how it works. I did my run without it just beause I didn't like its mechanics. The story is also nothing incredible, but I still appreciated the effort: it's well told and gives you choices.As for the rest, the game actually surprised me with a lot of attention to the details, a great art style, secrets, shortcuts and so on. It's not as hard as Dark Souls, so if you played any of the 3 this will be easier for you, but it might still be difficult for newcomers of the genre.			"

												I just finished my first playthrough in 25 hours. In this time I didnt have any crashes, fps drops or anything, I played on high preset, and game is great looker, (I have pretty much recomended gear according to steam page, only CPU weaker) Smooth gameplay, very nice fluid combat and movement (IMHO better than Dark Souls 2), challenging bosses if you dont overlevel like a MF. I rolled fighter and dont trust that you gonna soak lots of damage in heavy armour, some - yes but not a lot thats why I gone for sword and board style and it worked really nicely - charging, knocking down and backstabing was great. Im deffinitely gonna try other two classes.I picked it up on sale (because of all the instability talk) and dont regret it, deffinitely recomending it (also artstyle of this game is gorgeous, but thats personal taste)			"

												Short version: I recommend this game, it is fun but don't constantly compare it to Dark Souls instead keep your mind open.Long Version: Pretty good, I find it more difficult than dark souls as timing is even more important due to the speed at which most weapons are swung.  This may be a con for some people but I do not mind it as it is much more realistic.  Also unlike dark souls where you can dual weild greathammers larger than your character this game has much more realistic human abilities.  Some of the very large weapons must be two handed to even use (I like this, some may not).  Also just an fyi, armour is much more important in this as opposed to Dark Souls.  I was finding the game borderline impossible because I was barely armoured and getting 1-2 shotted by most everything.  Once I started wearing some heavier gear though it became much more possible.  As of right now (2 days after launch) the game has major crashing issues and I am upset that this is taking so long to patch as this should be a day one patch.			"

												Length of Game: 10 HoursOptimization: Awful, worst port I've ever played,Difficulty: Difficult at first, far too easy 3 hours in.Design Choices; BadDon't buy this game.  Don't support the developers and don't think twice about it.  To detail why I don't think this is a good puchase, I'll start with the enemy variation.  This game does a good job initially at giving a wide variety of enemies to fight.  They all have unique ways to kill them and they stick out pretty well.  A few hours in, you will not only be fighting these same monsters, but you will get a few more that are anti-fun to deal with.  It's not that they're difficult, it's that you either have to wait forever for an opening or they have mechanics to bore you to death.Allow me to explain, using 2 enemies as examples.  There are very large soldier looking characters with a big shield that will block all your attacks.  You can't kick their shield out of their hand so you're left with two options.  Wait 14 years for them to lowe the shield to attack them or sprint at them and bash them with a tower shield.  Once you do option 2, you realize EVERY enemy is weak to that.  How very exciting, eh?  Second horrible mention is the mages that not only explode when they die, but pretty much have a kill move if you attack them during a certain period where they put white sparkles around them.  They do a TON of damage as well, which isn't necessarly horrible, but it's very cheap when you're beginning the game and when you kill them, they explode and kill you, forciing you to keep doing it until you figure it out it.  And while this wears its novelty off fast, you will encounter these things when you have plenty of health and they don't hurt you, but they still knock you down every time they explode, making it increasingly annoying.Let's move to bosses.  4 of them will most likely be somewhat difficult for you, probably.  I killed them in one go, and those first four bosses is the hardest this game will ever be.  The rest of them you either have too much equipment, or they just don't have interesting enough mechanics to worry about avoiding.  It becomes a mess, where your character is so Godly unstoppable that you juts completely wreck everything on screen.  It might be fun for some people, but given the way the combat system works in this game...it feels very cheap and hollow.  The reason for this is, you have a stamina bar, so you're not just going to wrack up tons of kills altogether, you STILL have to wait constantly for that to recharge, but without any challenge or thought as you progress in the game.  Rather than having to deal with difficult situations or enemies, you're dealing with boring enemies that you meet in the first 3 hours of the game, and bosses that die in a few hits.  It's very flat and not fun.Graphics are great, they look nice and have an art style that anyone who plays World of Warcraft would most likely enjoy.  They are not, however, optimized, and you will crash more than a blind person in a food store.  You will find enemies later will explode, which is a boring as♥♥♥♥♥♥mechanic by itself, but will often cause the game to crash to desktop.  This happens REGULARLY on the most annoying ♥♥♥♥ing stage in the game.  There's a maze like area later in the game in which you have to pull 3 switches and these fire dogs are EVERYWHERE in it, and ONE of them will crash your game.  This is ridiculous beyond belief, there's not way this should have gotten through Quality Assurance.While the game has just released for almost a week now, the developers are trying to show care and fix their game up, but I feel the damage has been done and hurts their credibility.  If they cared to fix the game up, there's no way they should have had so many game breaking bugs, bad balancing and generally boring gameplay.  If you're looking to scratch that Dark Souls itch, I highly recommend playing Dark Souls 2 on NG+. as they add completely new monsters to areas, and add more boss mechanics.  Or whatever your favorite game is, don't let me tell ya how to think.Thanks for reading!			"

												This is a mere first look review, as a dad and a gamer my time is very limited (sad face).  However I put a good almost solid 7hrs or so in it so I can at least give you all an idea of what to expect and how it plays.First of all, do I recommend this game?  Sometimes this can be a tough question, however Lords of the Fallen is very well built fundamently enough to give an absolute yes.  If you love the Souls series you will get a more refined experience of risk and reward.  Is is better than Souls?  I feel the two have their own place and one does not outshine the other.  However Lords of the Fallen has a loot based gameplay which does drive you to go onward to see what else you can find and being able to switch gear and adapt to what you want to play as for that specific boss or sceniro is greatly appreciated.  I'll break down things in categories to give a better understanding of things.The StoryRun of the mill and not very interesting in the least.  The characters you meet you will not give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about as they don't even seem to have a personality.  They are nothing more than virtual mannikins.  However the lore (audio logs you can find around the world) and atomsphere is something to behold.The CombatThis is where I feel the game shines.  The combat is very fun and engaging, there is no animation waitout so if you are mid-swing and need to dodge you can do just that.  You can react to your situations with near instant input reaction.  You can also play to your style and not be punished for it, sometimes on the Souls series there were bosses and encounters that pretty much required a shield build to stay alive (or praise the sun for some god damn luck), this game allows you to play to your strengths with the build you want.  You have stamina which will affect the amount of swings you can do before you have to take a breather, which adds some strategy in the way you will be attacking your enemy.  You have mana which allows you to use your abilities and guantlet to shoot enemies from afar.The Bosses (Lords)The absolute best part of this game is the boss fights.  Not only are they scripted to do different things for each phase but the complete strategy you had planned out will change drastically.  This gets more and more apparent as you progress throughout the game.  You will feel as you are fighing epic bosses and feel accomplished after defeating them, much like the Souls series you will die and die alot.  Each boss plays on the area that they are in, what I mean by this is they sort of interact with their surroundings and you need to use it to your advantage.The Loot/EquipmentThere is chests to find and loot off of enemies and Lords.  There is legendary versions of items as well which normally has to do with defeating a Lord with a certain condition or challenge.  The loot seems to be varied and happens enough to where you want to keep going into your inventory screen and seeing if what you got is better.  The equipment comes in 3 classes (light, medium, heavy) and has a weight value which will help you determine if it is right for your build or not.  Obviously if you want to be a rogue you would want light armor to help you roll and dodge with no restrictions.  However you can mix between light and medium to find a perfect middle ground, much like how you would avoid ""fat rolling"" in Souls.The ""Level Up""So the unique thing about this game is that there is a risk vs reward, one that capatilizes on what the Souls series did but takes it one step furthur and makes it attractive to hold on to your xp.  The system is designed where you accumulate xp by defeating enemies, that xp is not safe, if you die you lose your soul and you have to go back and get it to get your xp back much like Souls.  However the cool thing here is, the more xp you carry with you the better the loot drops and the better the xp bonus.  For once a system that rewards the risk.  If you care not for the risk, you can bank your xp at a crystal in which you can transfer it to spell points for your abilities or stat points which allows you to ramp up your base stats.  This system is by far what makes this game interesting and questions ""Is it worth trying to beat this boss with my 10k xp?""The ControlsI feel these are refined and really excellently laid out.  There are toggle keys to switch your weapon types, spells, and consumables on the fly.  This is the first game in a long time where I felt the keyboard setup was actually more usable than a controller.  That is normally a huge flaw when it comes to action games, this however just works and works well.  After trying a boss with the controller just to see if it was an easier experience, I quickly switched back to the keyboard.  I'm a keyboard and mouse guy, with Souls I had to use the controller since the input lag was horrid, but with this game I am happy to say, awesome keyboard and mouse controls.  The GraphicsVery well made textures and models.  It is a very beautiful looking game.  There is interesting set pieces and things out in the distance to catch your eye.  The snow falling, the wind blowing, all great stuff.  However the game does seem to randomly slowdown in certain areas for little to no reason other than unoptimize graphical elements.  The snow falling and looking in certain directions can cause your frames to drop quite a bit.  Hopefully they fix this soon, a smoother experience is always a plus.OverallLords of the Fallen is a satisfying experience overall and I highly recommend it to any Souls fan.  It has its kinks and issues, mostly random slow downs, but I have heard of issues where characters popped in and out of cutscenes or graphical elements missing.  I've glitched a few bosses to the point they were unbeatable but resetting the fight will fix the issue and it seems to happen if you disrupt their phase change somehow.  It is a rare occurance was only able to do it once.  Have fun killing the Lords!			"

												Not so hard as Dark Souls, but does it really matter!? Hell not! It's a good game. A gameplay that make you feel quite powerful and yearning to smash the enemies. If you are the kind of person that likes to play as a badass human giant-demon-killer in a cold and relentless environment, this game is for you.			"

												After all the technical glitches and bugs seem to be (mostly) fixed, the game is now playable, but beware: Bugs weren't the only issue plaguing this beautiful game:First off, let me say I have played and beaten both Dark Souls, soul level one challenges, Ng+7 and etc.. Now.. to Lords of the Fallen.      Pros:- You start in a beautiful looking world that truly does remind one of ""next gen"" with partical and lighting effects only adding to this goregous game. - Combat takes some getting used to, however is not terrible once you seperate Darksouls and lords, as they are two different games. - You feel very weighty, weapons are slow and powerful feeling, sending a mob flying across the room from a well timed hammer strike is always a good feeling.      Cons:- After playing through the game, I honestly must say the biggest fault is enemy design, the devs wanted a difficult game, they got one -- For the wrong reasons. - Confusing levels, and no map! While some might like this, I again found it merely to be a time sink -- Confuse the player on where to go and they'll play longer and like the game more! Thank goodness enemies only respawn if you die.- Many enemies have one weakness and only one for the accurately leveled player; ranging only taking damage from spells, to having a shield that is practically unbreakable. (""Just shield break!"" any seasoned dark souls player would say -- One issue, you cant in Lords of the Fallen, making turtling NPC's one of the biggest time sinks and inflating the time you'll spend in an otherwise short game.)- Boss design: Easily the biggest con for me, bosses weren't difficult in a dark souls fashion, they were tedious and annoying. Sure, dodge the big hits, deal with the adds they summon, run away from the big one shot mechanic, and the boss has full healed again! Time to widdle away at his HP for the 15th time in a row. The last boss especially being unkillable unless your character is built for damage and damage alone, tanky characters or slow hitters -- Enjoy never killing this boss due to its ""difficulty"". - Story. Well, it was lacking, and kinda there. Almost felt like the writers watched Elder scrolls: oblivion being played on mute and wrote their own story to go along with it.			"

												EDIT 2:  End-game, some bugsEDITED: Read bottom for help against stutter and potential decrease in crashes!After an hour of gameplay there ain't much to say. But the game is awesome so far, controls are a bit different than Dark Souls but there actually is alternative controls which makes it EXACTLTY the same. The game itself is amazing, love the graphics and the combat is brutal and realistic, get caught in a combo and you're dead. Much like souls, exp drop on death and is reclaimable, but there's some other things too that is different and maybe a bit more... Creative?For souls fans, I really would recommend. There's no customization (sadly) other than new armor/weapons (looks amazing though).Edit 2: End-game, some bugsAlright, so I have reached the end of the game and I'd like to share my complete opinion.The game is still really good, I freakin love the various, enemies, bosses, armors and weapons throughout the game. Having said that, there's still some bugs and the game is... Resource heavy. My rig (GTX 780, 16GB RAM, i7-4790K CPU @ 4.00GHz) crashes after a while of playing and I get a message about my graphics card crashing, probably overheating. I'm no expert, but I'd say the game needs some tweaking, because there's obviously something wrong.Some bugs I've discovered: http://fextralife.com/forums/p686398/bug-report-various-bugs-big-or-small/#p686398Edit: Stutter and potential decrease in crashes!Got some more time in now, the game is really good and the bosses, storyline, creatures and equipment are really interesting. The only problem that seems to bother people are lots of crashing and I experience them too. Hopefully this will be fixed ASAP as announced by the developers.Things that might decrease the crashes and stuttering:-Turn off Nvidia Turbulence and/or Vsync in the Advanced Display Settings in-game (Announced by dev, might help).-Optimize the game with Gforce Experience!- Might help to configure the PhysX settings in the Nvidia control panel: Changing processor from auto to CPU helped for some (in my case it got worse, I use my GTX 780)			"

												Hello all, first off, i haven't played dark soul so this review will be for the standalone game and no comparison between it and DS.The game remind me a bit of bound by flame, or even darksiders 2. The sad thing about is that most of the game, the stamina bar only feel like it is there to slow the action down. I can understand the wish for realism, but getting winded in 3 swings to instantly recover 2 seconds later.., i am not a fan of the mechanic as a whole. The game rpg roots are solid, using xp for ability and spells investments rather than actual level up (each investment count as a level up and require more to increase as you do it). Along with that you have a gamble mechanic where you can lose XP. Being defeated drop a xp ghost that you have to gather back or recover using items, otherwise the xp is lost. The more enemy you kill in a row without stopping increase the reward gained which is enticing, as some players may want to challenge themselves and end up with 40 levels worth of upgrades sooner than expected.  The bosses tend to be challenging and require patience or varied approach as your game play style can greatly vary depending if you're the heavy armor self healing type or the nimble rogue-style stabber.The game visually remind me of dark fantasy settings and is passable. At launch the game had a few stability issues, but they have since been fixed, for me at least. most of the few bugs i have seen weren't game breaking.The rest of the game is a rpg experience that focus on action and combat rather than storytelling, which may be something some players are looking for these days. It is not my best rpg of the year but, with the replayability, i am still glad i bought it.Have a nice day all!-Lost			"

												Interesting combat, beautiful locations and character designs, although buggy and a poor story.I really enjoyed Lords of the Fallen. I've never played Dark Souls, although I have heard there are many similarities to those games, so if you've played those I suspect you know what you're in for. Fans of the Dark Souls games have criticised Lords of the Fallen for being too easy. This could be true, I certainly didn't struggle for any amount of time on any boss fights, although there is a level of challenge to learning how to fight effectively and to levelling your character up. Plentiful health potions and several of your spells can make the process feel easier than it may have been without them, and the dodging system is generally fairly generous in what counts as a hit or a dodge.The story is fairly standard fare, with no surprises and some terrible dialogue. It hits a few tired cliches along the way too, such as 'man is the real monster' and characters that are clearly going to betray you 'shockingly' betray you at the opportune moments. Having said that, the story worked enough that I wanted to continue playing and see it through to the end. The environments are beautiful, and a real draw. Set in a mountain monastary, I enjoyed unlocking the various areas and whilst there's a lot of back-tracking, it didn't take too long to reach anywhere else, with some areas feeling like hubs that you can branch off from. I've heard complaints of the areas not being distinct enough, I'm not sure I agree personally; there's some real variety, and the alternate 'rhogar' world you visit is quite striking, I feel there's enough variety without feeling like the game goes through a cartoony 'theme' for each zone.The game is relatively short (I completed it in about 15 hours), although it offers New Game + and New Game ++ modes for those looking for more, apparently offering a little more story and new treasures to discover. The game does have quite a few bugs, notably the game crashed completely on me three times in my 15 hours. Some enemies would bug out and stop moving, and I died for no apparrent reason a couple of times too. All that aside, I still really enjoyed the game, and if you're looking for something fun and not too shallow but not too deep, I'd recommend giving this a try.			"

												Game isn't perfect, but it received a patch (that cleared most/all issues i had) within 24 hours of release. some might argue that it should have released like that... smarter people might realize the sheer scope of different hardware, etc. and how most other developers don't respond that quickly. On to the game itself. the difficulty is that of Dark Souls (duh) but not in a bad way. each enemy is different, requires different movement/weapon choices. the character voice animations are pretty bad, but the textures are beautiful, and the combat feels fluid and dynamic. story seems interesting, albeit short and to the point in delivery. Would give 8/10 and shall recommend. (if you liked souls, then try this. it is a lot of fun, and refreshing to see a positive take on said gametype)			"

												To preface this review, I beat lords of the fallen in 7.5 hours. on my first and only character.As a massive fan of dark and demon souls(well over 200 hours combined) I was very excited to bite my teeth into something even resembling dark souls. the beginning of the game is a blast, difficulty is on the low end and you are just murdering everything. first 2 bosses are a joke and took very little thinking to kill. about 1/3 way into the game, for no apparent reason their is a difficulty spike. the same brain dead enemies you were killing now have 4X health and damage. this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off more than anything some enemies are much more stronger count parts of them self. yet the game doesn't give you a visual queue or even a different enemy model / weapons to show this difference. you will go into a room with 1 strong and 1 weak version of the same enemy, this can offset your play style and often can result poorly from you thinking 1 of the enemies is a weak version instead of a strong version. once you are past the difficulty spike which isn't terrible it just really came out of no where, its a complete breeze again. HEAVY ARMOR RULES EVERYTHINGall I used was heavy armor in this game while 2 handing my weapon. beat the game using the codex. 3 enemies coming at you? who cars just face tank right through them and you'll win.about the 5th or 6th boss? is the one with 3 legs and my god that boss was a joke. I literally just stood in front of it casting rage and destroyed the boss only drinking a single healing potion. it had mechanics I could see but why play around mechanics when you can just face tank something and win?RAGE IS OPwarrior spell rage allows you to use your weapon with 0 energy cost, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is that powerful and super OPif you're in heavy armor have a relatively heavy weapon and use RAGE you will kill anythingshield bros? no problem use rage break their guard and kill with your infinite stun lock you have on thembosses? no problem slap on rage and get an easy 1,500 damage at the cost of taking a few hitsyou literally don't need to worry about enemies as long as you keep up a constant assault on them, since heavy weapons often do mini stuns you can combo and enemy or boss to death by just using combos with infinite energy.BOSSESbosses are for the most part a joke in this game.the only boss that I died to was the one where you travel dimensions and you have the option of fighting him in the open area and he uses 2 swords. forgot his name, but thankfully you had to do a little bit of thinking to kill him and it took me 2 tries to kill himevery other boss I downed in the first tryNow this all may seem like a lot of negatives, or positives if dark souls was to hard for you. But, somehow I had a reasonable amount of fun playing this game. graphics are superb if running on max settings. (ignoring the frame rate issues, crashes etc.) it was a decent hack and slash game. I enjoyed breezing through all of the late game content face taking and murdering everything. difficulty wise the game is not there but its a good amount of fun to load up and kill some stuff in. I plan on beating it on NG+ and NG++, to see if there are any interesting armors/weapons. lords of the fallen is the toddler version of dark souls, yet I still managed to have a good bit of fun being a dark souls vet.is it worth the 50 dollars? - probably not but I plan on speed running this game seeing how broken I can make itis it fun? - despite its issues and shortcoming I had a good deal of fun with the gamerecommend? - can't beat dark souls - start with this.dark souls vet? - pick it up and see how fast you can wreck everything in the gameit's a good bit of fun, id advise everyone just to try it out.

												Edit: Just when I said it wasn't quite as hard as Souls....Holy S**t!! After the 2nd boss the game cranks the difficulty up quite a bit it seems. There's an enemy I would compare to the Black Knight that uses a tower shield, that dare I say it is harder than the Black Knight. I figured out that if I timed it just right that I could stagger him with the RT power attack with the Persistance greatsword. I died countless times, and finally was able to take him down an get some nice XP and a ""Codex"" sword. As I said, it seems to be improving as I go along. One of the strongest similarities to Souls with LotF is how movesets, tactics and timing matter more than just sheer damage and speed. LotF REALLY punishes you for being careless with your armor and weapon loadouts. If you think you can just plow through everything with the same weapon and armor loadout you're sorely mistaken. Also, a BRILLIANT mechanic that I've been BEGGING for in the Souls franchise, shield charging bashes that can stun/knock down enemies. It is so much fun to use this mechanic. Also, one of my favorite mechanics from Dark Souls that was taken out in Dark Souls 2 has returned in Lords of the Fallen, KICKING!! I LOVE this mechanic, so much fun to use and does more for combat than you would expect.Terrific game so far, it's being way underrated. And this is coming from a major Souls fan here. It's gotten better and better as I go along. Despite strong similarities to Souls, it manages to really capture it's own feeling. It has a very unique feeling to it, and it's combat is unlike anything i've ever seen in a good way. Takes some time getting used to cause it's a bit weighty even compared to Souls, but it's very fun, challenging and satisfying. Not QUITE as hard as Souls, but I struggled a decent bit with only the 2nd boss. Great weapon/armor variety as well. Beautiful weapon/armor design, as well as great enemy and level design. I plan to update my review as I go along, but if anything it seems to be improving as I go along which is great. So far i'd say it's easily an 8/10. Kevin VanOrd from Gamespot and GameInformer were right on the money with their reviews. Not really seeing what the other reviews have an issue with that scored it lower. Take the game on as it's own ARPG experience like you SHOULD, and you'll have no issues seeing how good it really is. Something I think a lot of reviewers have failed miserably at doing. I LOVE Souls, and while I still would say it PROBABLY is overall better, that still does NOT make it the be all and end all of ARPG's, something apparently a lot of people need to come to terms with. Lords of The Fallen is a success in my humble opinion, and I recommend it 100%.			"

												Alright so this game has recieved a lot of bad reviews for being derivitive of the DS series, however I believe firmly that this game is very much on par with the souls games for a number of reasons. If  you don't want to read the whole review let me sum it up for you: if you enjoyed the souls games and were looking for something similarly difficult and fun then you will most likely enjoy this game. Here are the reasons why you will enjoy this:1. Visuals. This game has stunning visuals, much better than DS 1 & 2. The bosses, the textures, the armors and weapons all look ♥♥♥♥ing sweet. Very ambient lighting as well also sets a great mood for the game.2. Difficulty. Similar to the souls series, this game is extremely difficult and is paced much the same as the souls series (ie. kill enemies to gain something similar to souls, which you use to level up and if you die you lose your souls and can retrieve them on your next life and if you die again before getting them they are lost).3. Bosses. The bosses in this game look awesome and are extremely hard. If you beat one on the first try then kudos to you, but it's taken me at least 2 or 3 for most bosses and sometimes more. This difficulty leaves you with an extremely satisfying feeling when you finally understand the patterns of the boss, and their attacks and kick their asses and take their loot.4. Story. So in the souls games, the story is very vague. You hardly ever understand what you're killing and for what purpose, as well as your character because it is created by you, has no back story that you know of. Sure you get a general idea at the beginning as to what you're doing, but no real explaination or plot thickening occurs and you basically walk around killing♥♥♥♥♥♥ LotF however has a nice little back story to the game, as well as much more interactable NPC's within the game that really give it a better, more complete RPG feel. So basically that's it. This game is thoroughly enjoyable and I would highly recommend buying it ESPECIALLY if it is on sale as it is well worth  you time. This is an criminely underrated title and if you have any love for the format of DS's games then you should give this a shot.			"

												If not for near release day crashes, performance issues and negativity for copying Dark Souls.  It's a pretty decent game. (Patch 1.2 improved the game greatly, just completed first playthrough.  Highly recommended as of now)Supposedly the companies first big budget title (can't confirm or deny).  I for one, welcome our new western dark souls overlord.Pros:-Plays like a slower version of Dark Souls (Combat wise) (Huge perk imo)-Neat moveset variety (Per weapon, One handed, two-handed/duel wielded and a magical gauntlet)-Everything feels like they have weight to it (Heavier weapons will feel heavy, large shields will be near impenetratable)-Amazing graphics and breathe-taking views.-Replayability due to different playstyles, magic selection and NG+ (up to 3 times)-Decent upgrade system via runes (Discovered some weapons can change if you use the proper runes on them)-Lore is available if you want to look for it-Very fluid combat (Any attack into any attack)-High risk, high reward style of play is rewarded (Obviously, by name itself)-Intense moments where it's either kill or be killed-You can spec heavily into your playstyle (be it heavy weapons, a flurry of lighter blows, turtling-Enemies all have a niche, although sometimes shared (Immortality until you obtain their heart, two lives, tanky/high threat)-60FPS/1080P or potentially beyond ( I can now run max settings with almost no fps problems )-Most cons can be easily fixed with a patch (They have just done so)Cons:-Randomly crashes, one known to me with the fire-fiend explosive enemy(ies) (FIXED)-Major performance issues outdoors (FIXED / IMPROVED GREATLY)-Upgrade system is small and could be expanded upon (four choices with different rarity/power)-Once you know an enemies' weakness you can easily exploit it for a quick win-Heavy armor is easy mode and basically required unless you drag a fight out (Rephrase- more forgiving than relying on dodges alone which can be difficult)-Sidequests can be cut off by progressing too far into the main story-Most of the lore is hidden within discriptions and items you randomly pick up and not get a prompt to delve into.-You can't tell if you're going the wrong way until an enemy wrecks your♥♥♥♥♥♥br>-Reused areas and replaced mobs when you defeat a lord (Game always has you returning to places you've been (zzz same environment)-Borrows heavily from Dark Souls (Combat, some boss moves (I.E. Worshipper's ground spike move reminds me of Gravelord Nito's blade dance/scream)-DON'T LOOK AT THE BLOODY SUN, OH GOD MY EYES, LENSFLARE EFFECTS-Blotchy ""snow sticking to camera"" effect, bland hexgon like shapes.Protip: This is an opinion, please don't argue it.Edit: As of a couple hours ago patch 1.2 rolled out, I can now highly recommend this game as the crashes I have encountered have been fixed and outdoor FPS and other performance issues are a lot better.  A week from release and they fixed their game pretty damn well.			"

												This is essentially Dark Souls for casual players. It offers very good graphics, gorgeous armour and weapons, impressive sceneries, enemies of great variety, bosses with many interesting tactics, a dark and mysterious background story - just as the big model. Dark Souls II was too frustrating and stressful for me - this one, I had fun with. Pity that it is so short and the game world so limited.			"

												A good game that was long awaited by everyone. It rises up the the challenge and delivers on it's RPG promise. Some bugs here and there but well worth the buy and at this price, having spent over 55 hours in the game I can easily recommend it to anyone since it's got a good bang for buck. If you're a fan of Dark Souls series then this is a must buy.			"

												Not sure what graphics engine they used, but this game was pretty.  I really enjoyed my play though with this game.  Some frustration with slow attack animations, but nothing game breaking.  I had read sites saying that this game considered easy mode Dark Souls, and I would have to agree.  Although it was still challenging at times, I did find as you got new gear the difficulty went way down.  Like most games, you will get a feel for a certain way of attacking, certain combos, and spells to use.  Once you master your technique this game is not very challenging but still wickedly fun.  This title may not have the depth, challenge, and longevity of the souls games, but for someone looking for a moderately challenging and beautiful ARPG this is a worthy pickup.  I would suggest anyone who is not familiar with action RPG titles play this one before attempting Dark Souls to understand some of the battle mechanics and frustrations that come with ARPG games.  Most definitely recommended.			"

												Not a bad game, not a great game. If you haven't played Dark souls, play Dark souls. if you have played Dark souls, play this and grow more appreciation for the master pieces that we have. But seriously, the games alright but it could have been so much better if the combat was better, there weren't only like 5 variations of enemies, the storyline was interesting, the lore was more interesting, the environment was more dynamic, the bosses had better mechanics, magic was better, the voice acting was better, the questing was better. I can go on. But despite all this, the graphics are really nice, the weapons and armor are designed nicely, the game in its entirety is so heavily influenced by Dark souls that it could never really be a bad game, it's still worth playing if it comes into your possession somehow.

												If you've played and enjoyed anything similar to the Dark Souls series, this game is right up your ally! After reading all of the negative ""clunky"" reviews, I had to investigate further - this is simply just players not familiar with an action RPG, and managing stamina/energy during combat and actions, or taking into consideration the weight management of equipment you're carrying. I haven't played a lot of the game, but can hardly wait to play more! This is seriously an under rated gem. Which is unfortunate that many will most likely not experience as a result of the reviews. The git-gud or git punished style game play is pertty similar to Dark Souls, but definitely has it's own flair/twist, and is quite enjoyable. I would say it's even more forgiving than a DS game, and is a great into into this style of game.			"

Lords Of The Fallen ReviewI personally really like this title. Now, before I dive deep into this review I just want to clarify a few things. I had originally played this around November of 2014 on Xbox One. I think it ran at about 15 - 30 FPS. So I didn't see it worth it on Console. I never made it past the second boss a.k.a ""Commander"" while playing this on console because there was no difficulty option. I have waited until 2016 to pick it up because I bought a GTX 970 paired with my AMD FX-6300 so I can play it on PC. I haven't completed the game, because I am taking my time with it and exploring everywhere I can.Pros: Beautiful graphics. Good level designs. Sounds! The sounds are amazing in the game. From the footsteps of your plated boots hitting the ground to opening a demon chest and hearing it ""roar"" until completely opened. Options menu. I would have liked to see more, but what they have now is fine The ""Feel"" of the game. I love how heavy you can feel when wearing heavy armor and how light and agile you are when wearing cloth ""rouge"" armor. Weapons. There are plenty of weapons to choose from and having certain runes slotted into them makes the weapons more deadly! Looting. Oh man, looting in this game is so much fun! From looting armor, weapons and runes I can't get enough!Mixed: Combat. While the combat is somewhat balanced, it just feels ""okay"". We do have some special moves you can pull of depending on your orientation to the enemy and/or type of attack, I think is kinda boring. I've spent most my time with the following on every enemy. 2 Heavy attacks + 1 Regular + 1 Heavy.  AI. The AI in this game gives me a mixed feeling. The AI scales with your characters level so it makes sense to make them hard or challenging. Well, with the different types of enemies you encounter (Excluding bosses) I feel like some of them ""cheat"" or are more difficult than they should be. Music. (The Pros about sound were specifically on the in-game sound design, not the music) The music is okay, while it's nothing great, it does provide a certain feeling. I just wish they had a little more variety. While playing through the game you'll find yourself listening to the same audio tracks over and over again.Cons: Boss fights. I am a few bosses in and had the weapon ""My Axe"" and the ""Symmetry"" armor set. While wearing this armor you get a 15% (I think) Damage increased when two-handing a weapon. So, I had two runes added to ""My Axe"" one High Poison Rune and one Low Fire Rune. I literally hit the ""Annihilator"" Boss about 6 times and killed it. Certain bosses are hard and certain ones are too easy and predictable. Characters. I really dislike how all the character are introduced. Harkyn, a criminal we know that, but what for? Why was he chosen by Kaslo just to help ""save"" the world? Kalso, No idea who he is, besides a wizard/mage that was travelling with Harkyn and broke him out of prison. Anntanas, the guards look up to him as if he is a god. No real back story to him. (Keep in mind this is based off of not finding every single audio note and a general play-through of the game)_____________________________________________________________________________________________________Overall is a nice game. It's solid and is worth picking it up. I personally waited until it was on sale from $39.99 to $9.99 USD. I would spend $9.99 again on it in a heart beat. So, if you want to play dark souls or have tried and it seems too difficult for you then just pick this up. It's a much more relaxed casual look on a ""Hardcore"" Action RPG.Rating 8/10.			"

												At the time of writing this review I have still not played very far into the game, but I feel like I need to add a positive review among all the negative ones.First, I have played both Dark Souls and Dark Souls II, and I enjoyed them a lot. The second game wasn't the same blast as the first game, and that's why Lords of the Fallen has felt like a very refreshing change for me.The game is beautiful and modern in a way the Dark Souls games aren't, if you care for that kind of thing. The combat is in many ways very similar, but still has it's own feel with weapons, animations, movement and so on.So far I have beaten three bosses, and I got to say the game feels very cinematic in a way the Souls games aren't. The battles are dramatic and hard, and while I beat almost every boss in Dark Souls II on the first try, it felt good to get my♥♥♥♥♥kicked for once. The same thing as in Dark Souls apply though, that when you learn how the game works and the pattern of the enemies it becomes a lot easier.I have had a few crashes, and the game could be better optimized but I haven't had any big issues that most people have. Then again I have a GTX 980 and i7 4790K, so keep that in mind. I will probably update this review later, but I personally really enjoy this game so far and encourage you to watch some streams on twitch and make up your own mind. I can't understand why there are so many negative reviews, really.If you like hard games with a fantasy setting this is for you.			"

												Not bad. Enjoying it. Let's say this game is ""inspired by Dark Souls"". I find this game not too difficult, but that may be due to previous Dark Souls experience. Only downside is it crashed every once in a while... once during a boss fight which was... annoying. But the story is ok - if basic and the combat is enjoyable. Recommended if you are looking for something like Dark Souls but not Dark Souls.			"

												If you like dark souls then you will probably like this game.  There are several problems with it though.  First off there are definetely performance issue which I suscpect are present because this game was written mostly as a console game which both consoles use radeon, and I use a nvidia card.  Also in regards to the gameplay I have found it to be much slower combat than dark souls.  In dark souls I often found myself going without a shield, carrying a big damage weapon and rolling to avoid most damage.  I do not really find that strategy to be all that effective in this as the enemies have more health and also seem to hide behide shields.  This isn't nessesarily a bad thing, I view it as kind of the opposite direction of where bloodbourne is headed as they are going for a more offensive playstyle.  The weapons in this game I think really need balancing.  The weapons you expect to deal high damage (clubs, greatswords, ext.) do far less damage than the staff weapon which attack much faster and consume less stamina.  Maybe I am missing a gameplay mechanic here but I really think axes and the like should do more damage than staves.  Something that I think is a huge streagth for the game is the magic.  The spell are so different from the ones in dark souls and it is something new.  I hope this is the first in a number of games that follow this dark souls like formula, a genre of fantasy rpgs with combat that doesnt suck.			"

												So far this game is really awesome. Graphics are beautiful. I like the third person view distance, just right. The movement of my character is smooth/fluid with good combat mechanics. Is this game hard? Yes at first, but does get easier as you level up & get better weapons/armor. Each monster has its own style of killing you & you must figure out how & when to execute your weapon. It can be brutal, especially at first. But it feels rewarding when you figure out how to kill these jokers. So far the game runs very smooth. At the moment, my character is doing pretty well overall. I am still being killed at times, but with only a few wrong moves rather than just one wrong move.			"

												It's unstable and crashes all the time. I'll update this to positive and write about the good aspects of this game if it ever gets fixed. At the moment it's defective and shouldn't even be for sale without a warning that explains as much.Edit: to add more details for those wondering;I have left my PC running at times as I do other things, I've probably played under 10 hours. I'm not saying this is a bad game or not worth looking into, especially if you love the souls games as I do. What I'm saying is buying this game now may severely reduce the potential enjoyment you can get out of it. I've lost progress from crashes, I've had crashes halfway through boss fights 3-4 times in a row, I've had to save my game reducing the XP multiplier out of fear of losing progress because of crashing, I've had to reduce graphical settings in the hope of reducing crashing despite spending thousands on a beast PC which can run this game with max settings. That's why it deserves a negative review. I bet a lot of people put a lot of effort in to making this game and I bet one or two a**holes forced the release before it was ready for reasons that are anti-consumer. I estimate I've played 10 hours and crashed 25 times. My PC is fast, extremely stable, runs cool, is up to date with no beta drivers.Play this game.If and when they fix it.			"

But now, they fixed the issues and didnt experience a single crash. If you love dark souls, definitly give a chance to this game. Of course Its not as amazing as dark souls. No online features etc. But Lords of the Fallen has its own taste that you will like.			"

												(Early impression of what I have played so far.  I will edit this to a review soon!)If you are a fan of the third-person action game genre with light RPG elements, I would highly consider this. The visual presentation is excellent. A stunning game. The combat and overall gameplay is FUN. The game isn't arcadey easy, but it does present you with a good amount of challenge. I hate to bring up the name here, but it is not Dark Souls hard. But that's the thing, it is not suppose to be Dark Souls hard.The premise of the story isn't all that bad, and reviews have clearly exaggerated this aspect of Lords of the Fallen.  I would say it is pretty in line with other third-person action, adventure games.  But one could argue that it is a loss when a game lacks a good story and plot.  Voice acting in LotF is also another element in the game that isn't awful.  It is average, but not to the point where you would want to cover your ears, singing ""La, la, la, la, la, laaaa.""  It did not make me cringe either.  I love the art style, the presentation, and the combat. There's weight to every attack and the weapons and armor that you cling onto for dear life as you battle hell and its minions. Despite this positive note, often times movement feels sluggish, and swinging a weapon feels too slow.With that said, you can really tell that the developers put a huge amount of work into this game. There is no doubt about it. This game took WORK. It's beautiful and stunning. It plays great. Runs great, even with the short-changed framerate lock (with vsync enabled). The lack of proper Steam overlay support and fix does bug me because I want to take those amazing screenshots.Speaking from the heart, because we all should, this is not a poor man's third-person knock-off of another game.  And I am not referring to ""that"" game.  I am speaking in general.  Have you ever played a third-person action Viking or Templar video game lately that was great to excellent, let alone good?  Yeah, I dream of those games for those time periods.  While this doesn't exactly fit those fantasy bills, this game is not a Mickey Mouse job from the repair shop.  It is a well developed game, that could use a few more weeks being polished because of the few technical issues that I may be just knit-picking here.I was going in with really low expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Yes, I have played Dark Souls 1 and a bit of Dark Souls 2 on the PS3.  Well, if you are slighly interested and curious about Lords of the Fallen, you will need to treat this game uniquely as its own, and nothing else.  I have friends that played Dark Souls religiously that play this game and they agree that it is a good to great game.  Give it a chance, or better yet, give it a try.My rating: 8.0 out of 10(highly recommended)			"

A text review is provided below-Lords Of The Fallen is a third person action RPG bearing many similarities to the Souls series. The main differences lie in the persistence and reuse of the world, the loading screens between certain areas, and the fact that this game does not support multiplayer of any kind.So right off the bat the gameplay is golden. This is the only game of this type in which I was capable of using a keyboard and mouse to play. The movement of the camera (which seems meant for a controller) is a little off-putting every time I start up the game, but as I actually begin playing I get used to it very quickly so it’s not that big of a con. The actual action and fighting of this game is very fluid and very fun. The lock on mechanic for me sometimes seemed to mess up and I couldn’t scroll between enemies. I don’t know if that was my fault or if the game had some sort of issue with that.What story there is in Lords of the fallen is sparse but refreshing. This game allows for far more story than any of the Souls games have. This helps to give you motivation to keep trudging onwards against the increasing difficulty the game throws at you. It allows you to make some choices as well and gives you dialogue options in a very RPG like manner that I did not expect, coming from the Souls series. Definitely a plus. And this game can be difficult when you’re first learning the enemies. There were a few regular enemies I found that kept killing me, and finally being able to kill them was a huge turning point and always gave me a sense of accomplishment. This game is also packed full with lore you can find spread throughout the world in the form of audio recordings which is always a nice touch.The boss fights in this game are intense, difficult, and long-lasting depending on your playstyle and whether or not you research the bosses beforehand online, which I did not do. Some of the bosses have some pretty nasty tricks that you will not be prepared for in this case though. Either way, I haven’t played a game with such engaging boss fights in quite a while. This game can really surprise you too. You can be walking through an area where you already killed one boss and then BOOM, another one jumps out at you. And this game has a LOT of bosses in it. In fact it even reuses the first boss as a regular enemy. The first time I saw that I was completely not expecting it and got my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me. Of course once you realize what you’re up against you can face it again and win, but that’s part of the fun of this game is learning and adapting. Getting better with every attempt.This game also has a very intricate level design that I really enjoyed too. Everything is connected. My favorite part was how in the first fifteen minutes you get to watch someone go flying through a door just before a boss fight, and then 7 hours later you unknowingly walk through the same doors from the other side to face a mini boss.The graphics of this game are absolutely gorgeous for 2014 and still damn good for today. My only complaint in this department is in the animations. Some of the ways characters move around as they talk to you is extremely silly and when you pair it with the extreme fail that is lip syncing, then watching someone talk can be the most entertaining part of the first 10 minutes of the game.Unfortunately this game has a lot of glaring issues that stop it from being game of the year material in my opinion. The biggest issue? Bugs. Visual bugs. Skills not doing what they say they’re supposed to. For example, this one rogue skill that lets you go invisible, but unless you use it before combat starts the enemies still know where you are. Hitbox bugs which cause your attacks or your skill attacks to miss. Strange unexplainable bugs. And finally the worst of them all...crashes. All of this may have at most made me rage for a bit and refuse to play for the rest of the day, but the game was just so damn good I had to come back the following day.Then there’s the fact that just like the Souls game this one refuses to even slightly guide you. Just got 5 new side quests after fighting a boss? All you have to go on is the very vague directions the npcs gave you. I had to search on google how to solve most of these quests. The game also doesn’t let you keep track of side quests so make sure you are paying attention to the dialogue. But then again there are some sidequests that are as simple as finding a flint and using it to light a fire, no dialogue included. Seriously. That’s a side quest. I don’t know where I got the flint, but I got like 1000xp for completing a side quest once I lit a fire with it. And then I got attacked.The lack of any form of competitive or cooperative play in Lords of the fallen kind of fits with the design of the levels which can sometimes be very narrow, but combined with the lack of any friendly npc companions to help you in fights? This game’s world can feel very lonely. This does help to put you in a very survivalist mindset though; knowing that everything you find is against you. I wish that they gave you something to make the world feel less empty. Even the generic NPCs you find standing around that are supposed to be friendly REFUSE to fight enemies that are right next to them!Overall though I really did like Lords of the fallen despite the issues it did have. But to have so many bugs rampant in your game 2 and a half years after your release is laughable. Lords of the fallen gets a 7/10. It’s a good game, but far from perfect. It is buggy, it requires many google searches to make sure you don’t miss anything, but it is still fun and new game+ and the following mode add plenty of new things to the game to give it two more playthroughs of replayability. I definitely recommend this game at full price if you enjoy these kinds of games and enjoy doing new game plus. A half price sale is good enough if you just want it for one playthrough. But do make sure you can be tolerant of this game’s flaws.			"

Dear Deck13!Now, that you stole my money, its time to have some worthy programmers.My only wish is, that someday I can play your game, because now its so broken, that i cant review it. 0/10 The first point comes after it runs ...An early acess game runs better than this ...Oh and I forgot, the Game begins with the ""NVIDIA The way its meant to be played"" :-)Really is it the way its meant to be played?

												I have done all achievements in this game. I highly enjoy this brutal, clunky and beautiful game. I think that ""darksiders 1-dark souls 1 hybrid"" is a good explanation what this game really offers. Add modern graphics to this, great soundtrack, few glitches and you get Lords of The Fallen. This game is superb imho.			"

												BEWARE: The game is currently optimized pretty poorly and has a lot of technical issues for some people. Be sure to check the forums to see if they have been fixed!Lords of the Fallen is a western take on Souls franchise. It borrows a lot of things from Souls and tries to explore the possible developments of the genre with a couple of new features.The game immediately feels like Souls game, yet there are enough differences to justify its existence.The biggest thing about LotF is that if you are looking for the complexity and difficulty of Souls - you won't find it here.This game is much simpler and easier. But if you always wanted to play more of that fantastic Souls combat without suffering horrible through each encounter - this game is for you.Combat is extremely close to Souls and quite enjoyable to play.Well, may be aside from ranged combat and magic spells that are pretty basic in comparison to Souls games.The world is as well much smaller than those offered in Souls. And since game is quite simpler, you can beat it in ~20h or so. Which in my book is pretty much good for a $60 game.The game does have some issues with balance: spells are overpowered, there's no way to use spell points once you'd level all your spells up to max, UI could be a bit better, world could've been a bit bigger, targeting autounlocks from time to time which is annoying.But most of those are pretty minor and don't stop you from enjoying a good combat, fantastically looking world and cheesy storyline.More detailed look and gameplay in the video:

Dark Souls enemies feel unpredictable and hit you with unexpected combos unlike LOTF.Overall it is good but you should wait for a sale when it is $9.99. Definately worth the price!			"

												This review supposed to be negative but i just can't give it a No because the game itself is really enjoyable and good but  the bugs and problems that you encounter throughout the game just suck the joy out of it and if this was before they fixed the crashes this review was a NO for sure cause that was just wrong couldn't even play the game for 10 minutes.As for now game still has some bugs but the biggest problem for me was the crashes and they fix that so at the current state i will recommend this game and i hope they fix the rest of the problems.I'm a huge souls fan i'm not saying this game is better than souls but in my opinion this game did somethings even better than souls and i really liked the level design and that fantasy art style of this game So play it just don't use that stupid buggy greed trinket.

												I am a fan of the Souls series, and when the gameplay trailer for this game came out, I was excited. A similar type of game but with way better graphics.Gameplay is smooth and fun. Combat feels very realistic as I can feel every swing of the sword or my characters hammer.Boss fights have been fun and a bit challenging so far. But when it comes to difficutly, Lords of The Fallen is nowhere near the punishing difficulties in the Souls series. The games exp and loot system is interesting. More like a gamble... If you decide to collect your exp without spending them on any attributes or spells, your exp multiplier increases. Thus increasing  your loot quality and luck.So it is up to the player to decide. I would give it a 4 out of 5.RPG and action game lovers would definitinely enjoy this game. So too for Souls fans.			"

												I hereby crown this October 2014, Broketober, because the must-buy releases just keep coming (Alien Isolation, The Evil Within (if you can run it), Wasteland 2 (I know, that was September) and now this beauty!**After 5hrs+:Still continues to deliver, a bit of long loading at times during travel transitions (40-60secs) occasionally and sometimes the locking system (like other games of its type) will get you killed but the game continues to be interesting, challenging and rewarding as these games should be. Go with a 8-8.5 out of 10 thus far.**Early days but I like to give a first impressions when I hit the 2hr+ mark and will update as I go along:Great game for me so far. It is without doubt heavily inspired by 'that' game series (you know which one) right down to the control system with only the primary buttons differing slightly (and you can actually pause the game).Everything controls really nice, the combat animation is smooth and varied (you seem to be able to use different weapon types earlier the DS), the risk / reward system of the xp drop is interesting as you have the risk of losing it all but keeping it going while killing nasties means more xp faster via a multiplier and better loot drops (I think I was at 1.40x when I first hit the outside and got a 27 damage butcher knife (most start stuff was 16 I believe and DLC stuff 19-26) which was a pretty damn sweet payoff, I think that's how / why I got it, I could be wrong though).Difficulty (using the rogue with 2nd / green tier magic option) is nicely balanced thus far for me (with the first boss taking me 4 attempts due to my 'one more hit' greed) but the game does a great job at giving you the base game dynamics info in-game rather than leaving you to have to potentially go online or work it all out cryptically.So, so far, so great.**Technical issues / notes:-Playing on everything maxed except textures with is on 2nd highest (high as opposed to very high). I had about 40mins fluffing around with settings because the options menu contains no info on settings so it's pure trial and error for the most part.-Anisotropic filtering seems to stay on 4x when I change the setup to custom. I also had one crash but haven't had any issue since (did set the game exe to Admin rights just in case so that may have cured it). -I'm assuming setting Texture setting to Very High requires graphics card ram of 3GB or more since it goes really, really slow in places with it 'on' on my 2GB NVidia gt750 ti.-Camera can be a bit whiley-fox / hyper sensitive at times but not a major issue, just worth mentioning-Also it seems a lot of the negative reviews for this game are stemming from technical issues so I will update if I experience anything game breaking / stopping and give my full spec as to help those that are unsure their system will be ok with it or are having trouble:GeForce GTX 750 Ti 2GB, 8GB Ram, AMD FX 4100 Quad-Core 3.6 GHz, Windows 7 (64Bit) @ 1920x1080p			"

												Great looking game.  I personally haven't had any crashes, only some occasional lags (e.g.: outside around the towers - but nothing major or game-breaking) on my i7 4770 16GB, GTX 670 2GB (344.60), on Very High Settings.  I'm a fairly casual player and haven't played DS like everyone compares it to, but for just grabbing the game and playing, it has been a lot of fun.  While it isn't an open world or anything, the maps seem fairly decent in size.  They were a lot larger than the impression I got when I first started playing.  Like I mentioned, I'm not a hardcore player...so for someone like myself, some sort of map system would have helped out.  I spent my share of time running around in circles.Not a ton of character customization, but a lot of cool weapons and armor to be found.I've seen a few people talk about the voice acting, but from my end I found it (the voices themselves) pretty good.I can understand people's frustrations if the game is crashing, but I can't really comment on it as it has actually ran well on my system since the launch.  As a ""non-crashing"" game, I would definitely recommended it.EDIT: I started off playing with Mouse/Keyboard, but fairly early on switched over to using my X360 controller and it made a world of difference in fighting.  It's probably just because I'm not as coordinated as I use to be, but the game became a lot more enjoyable after using the gamepad.			"

												An above average action RPG with a weighty, satisfying combat system. Comparisons to the Souls games are inevitable given that it borrows quite heavily from the mechanics of the series, and whilst it lacks the excellent pacing that makes those games so memorable it has enough of its own ideas to remain enjoyable throughout.The vast majority of the bugs the game had at release have been worked out, but it still requires a reasonably high-end GPU to play.

												I'ts Hard to do a proper review on this game.First of, this game doesn't have any major flaw on tha game itself.Gameplay is great overall and the story match the game pace quite well. (not anything spectacular, but worth a generic A-RPG)Mostly of the issues of this game are related to game optimization.I had my own crashes and issues back when I played. But I've played the game normal.At the same time I know people that had to literally re install their windows to remove it from the computer (shenanigans).I recommend this game for:- Fans of Dark Souls that are looking for the same gameplay experience.- People looking for a less flashy eye candy A-RPG with more serious-looking PvEI do not recommend this game for:- Players chasing the same difficulty levels as DkS. This game is far from being hard. Something around medium difficulty depending on your build choices. Still it's the hardest ARPG released at Q3-Q4 of 2014.- A story worth of Square in the 90's. Seriously guys, stop chasing ghosts of the past.Some Tips for starters:- The gameplay is NOT sluggish. Every weapon has at least one attack thatss faster than the moveset that works as a opener. Make sure to study the whole moveset of your weapon instead of just spamming R1 like DKS.- Heavy Armor = easier game. Playing on Light armor may surprise even experience gamers. It's your choice.So far, assuming that the game loads on your computer without any let downs, I don't see how you wouldn't like this game.			"

												Lords of the Fallen is, at it's core, a Dark Souls knock off. For those who think Dark Souls is a little more challenging than it's worth but love the idea, Lords of the Fallen is here for you. Mechanics:You start off by picking a generic class type: Brawling, Deception, and Solace (Warrior, Rogue, Mage). Each class type gets a unique set of 4 spells, with 3 levels within each spell type. Within these classes, there are sub class choices made up primarily by beginning stat variations. You level up your attributes by killing mobs, and gaining experience. You get an experience modifier that scales up the more enemies you kill without saving. Dying loses all experience, and you have to run back to your ghost and claim your ghost to regain lost experience.All class types can wear all types of armor, with a burden rate that slows down your character as it becomes more burdened. They can also use all types of weapons, but weapons have stat requirements that make most weapons outside of your class unlikely to be used. Occasionally mobs will drop runes that can be ""unsealed"" by a mystical ghost armorsmith to varying levels of usefulness (i.e. common luck rune vs. flawless luck rune). These can be slotted into armor and weapons for bonuses. There are a handful of trinkets that can also be equipped that are seeded throughout the world and add additional bonuses (more weight carrying, health regen, additional magic regen, etc.).Magic and Energy is used to cast spells and swing weapons respectively, with spells and weapons draining set amounts on casts. Once the bars are drained, the respective ability can no longer be used until it's regenerated.Armor and weapons never break, and can't be sold. They are collected, and stored and swapped out at any time (including mid battle). You also have a set number of potions that grows as you find more empty potion bottles, which can be refilled (partially) at save points (eerily similar to Dark Souls flasks and fires). In addition to potions, you are given consumables which grant fire resistance, energy points, etc. Energy and Magic regenerates but health does not.If all of that sounds pretty standard, that's because it is. Lords of the Fallen does not provide anything new, and instead provides a healthy dose of mediocre. It's like watching an action movie that you know wont be great, but you've watched all the good action movies already. You'll settle for that movie. It'll hit that craving, but you wont go out and tell your friends to go and watch it. That's Lords of the Fallen.Story **SPOILERS**:Where Dark Souls makes you curious about the world you're wandering around in, Lords of the Fallen teases it ever so slightly just enough for you to realize you (and likely the story writers) don't care at all about it. But you don't play Lords of the Fallen for the storyline. You play it to kill monsters.The game immediately throws you into the middle of a storyline, requiring you to suspend your belief and understand that a lot of things happened before you started this game, and you don't need to know about them, nor will you ever learn.Facts:1) You're a criminal (Harkyn)2) You're following a monk (Kaslo) who has apparently let you out of jail.3) They tattooed your face so others can recognize you as a criminal.Why did they let you out. You don't need to know. Why are you following this monk instead of just killing him and running off? You don't need to know. What did you do to land you in jail? You don't need to know.You start off right in the action, in Keystone Monastary, where Antanas the king of everything is holed up. You fight the Rhogar, a demonic race that is invading the human plane, and killing humans. You find out that Anatanas has found a way of seperating the evil of man from the good, leaving only the good, and it is hinted that this might be want has spawned the Rhogar.Kaslo lets you know that it is your duty to fight the Rhogar Lords. Throughout your journey you run into Yetka, another warrior in the area who is looking for ways to translate a book left to her by her parents in a different language.You fight your way through a number of bosses including the First Warden, Commander, and Worshipper (in the graveyard). The first two are fairly simply knight type bosses, with the Worshipper summoning demons that you can kill before they hatch. Once you kill this Demon, you enter... THE RHOGAR REALM. It's here you meet the Crafter, a floaty blackish ghost being whose evolved in the Rhogar Realm to travel dimensions. Who was he before he evolved? You don't need to know. You find out very little else about him In the Rhogar Realm you kill some of the Rhogar Lords in order to stop the Rhogar invasion, so you do, and come back to planet.... not Rhogar. Here, you meet back up with Kaslo and fight your way back through the Rhogar's invading the Monastery to get to Antanas. Through audio clips picked up by floating scrolls you find out that Antanas is obsessed with evil after losing his wife, driving him mad. Kaslo seems to sense that something is wrong, telling you he will stay behind to investigate, while Antanas sends you back to the Rhogar Realm to kill the remaining Rhogar Lords, and draw out Adyr the god who controls them.So you go and kill the Rhogar lords back in the same map you used. You meet Yetka once again who is still deciphering her family text. Turns out it's written in Rhogar! You come upon a beast, and she implores you not to to kill it, because it can take her to her family. So for once, you show mercy, and let her take the time traveling beast back to her family.... and that's the end of her storyline. Why was she trying to find her family? You don't need to know.Finally you make it to Adyr, who shows you the ghosts of all the bosses you've defeated (with stats on how many times you died and how long it took you to kill them. Thanks Adyr!) and he tells you... (PLOT TWIST!!!) Antanas is the bad guy all along *dun dun dun*. He never shows up, and gives you a magical rune to use against Antanas to kill him, and let the Rhogar win once and for all. And so you... BUT WAIT! Kaslo shows up in ghost form, and reveals that he is in fact also a god, but a watcher, sent to restore balance.And then he sends you back to the Monastarey where you run into Ghost Crafter, the being you know  almost literally nothing about? He mentions offhandedly how pretty your new rune is, speaks a riddle, and presents you with a choice.  Do you forge the rune into your armor, your weapon, or just let him have it. Apparently this choice alone determines whether you let the humans win, the Rhogar win, or balance the world. Why does he need the rune to balance the world? Why him? You don't need to know.So you give him the pretty rune given to you by a god literally not twenty seconds earlier, and fight your way through soldiers to reach Antanas only to find out he's turned into a Rhogar himself! (dun dun.... dun.....). So you kill him, and the game is over.Congratulations.			"

												Just finished a playthrough and started new game + on my cleric. The game fairly long, standing at 15 hours with almost everything explored. As many have said, it connects dark souls-combat (albeit heavier) to a diabloish universe. The monster and item design was cool, and the numerous hidden secrets make for an interesting experience.  Many of the boss fights were lovely, although the damage I inflicted upon them felt neglible and the overall length of the fight was very long, boss kills ranging from 3-10 minutes. However, seeing that the game itself focuses even more on windows of opportunity and the rare occasions of being able to load a combo (which many weapons have, interesting mix-ups of light and heavy attacks) on an enemy. The level design is also solid, feeling threatening, seeing closed portculli and doors right and left, only for you to find that it was a shortcut to the section or activated by a pressure plate. The entire scenario is very much a mix-up of the Painted World of Ariamis and the third act of Diablo 3. I will be honest in my opinion that there was room for improvement at times, regarding the story, characters, overall itemization  and ranged combat. Most of the times when I hit a brick wall in terms of multiple monsters or a strong individual one, I resorted to spam projectiles with my gauntlet (which uses mana as a resource and allows you to deal dmg from afar, and through a shield in most cases) killing them as easily as a ranged fighter in Souls games in general. The game left me asking for more, even though the ending itself was quite weird and basically left a chance for a season pass to come, and there still are several things I want to see regarding hidden gems like alternate boss kill challenges and what happens if I choose otherwise at sidequests.  The game was very stable on me, and I only experienced minor lag during a session of multiple hours, although the loading screens and transitions were quite long.  I will be on lookout for the announced puzzle-oriented Library DLC, and wish the best for those who have poor experiences with the game regarding performance issues.Overall, I rate graphics(played on high with a stable 30-40 fps) 9/10Story and characters 6,5/10 Gameplay 8/10 Souls feels 8/10 would bangbringing the total score to 8/10			"

												Soulborne player will dislike this game, i can understand this due to the sluggish and slow movement of the character, especially on heavier weapons like polesword or greataxe...But this game does not as bad as people claimed. I will give my short review based on my personal experiences with the game:Pros:-Decent graphics for the time-Interconnected world-Weapons and armor look detailed and beautiful-Runes and shards system-Similar gameplay to Soul series (i'll take anything that similar to souls game)Cons:-Too little variation on enemies (mostly humanoid creatures)-Movement seem sluggish (as mentioned above)-Bosses are uninspired (a boss named Beast, wut???), very predictable and their attacks are easily telegraphed-Late game is a piece of cake, especially with Luck based runeThe core gameplay mechanic of the game is not bad, but it's unpolished. The story is kinda cliche with forgetable NPC. For example Kaslo just appear a couple of time in the game, say something then disappear. Most of the dialogues are badly written, except one ( you'll know what i meant if you manage to get that far). The world is small and required backtracking. The multiply exp system is a good idea but most of the time it's not worth the risk due to the small increase interval. Pick this up on sale if you like souls game, dont buy it at full price, not really worth it "

												One of the absolute best ARPG's I've ever played in my life. I'm a major fan of the souls series and any ARPG's in general. However even with the release of the wonderful Dark Souls III that I had been hyped about all year, and I sunk hours and hours into... Lords of the Fallen still remains the best ARPG I've ever played. The story may not be the best, and in comparison to the souls series and it's deep, rich lore... this game has got nothing.  However I didn't go into this game expecting a great story. I wanted a fresh, polished, unique ARPG... with memorable boss fights. That's exactly what I got. A unique and refreshing take on the ARPG genre, absolutely breathtaking visuals, an amazing soundtrack, extremely memorable boss fights with solid and challenging mechanics, and a satisfying ending. There is even the added bonus of massive replayability. When I really love a game, I try to go all out and get all the achievements and that usually means replaying the game a few times. In Lords of the Fallen I had to replay the game 4 times to get all the achievements, and yet it didn't stop there... I replayed the game 3 more times after that simply because I loved the experience that much. Lords of the Fallen will always hold a special place in my heart, and I will always cherish the experience I had with it. I sincerely wish the developers would consider making a sequel in the future.Side Notes:- I didn't buy the game immediately at launch so I never experienced any of the bugs or preformance issues that earlier players might have.- The DLC ""expansion"" was absolute garbage and a rip off. They added one small boss in an annoying and gimmicky maze and it took me around 30 minutes to beat. AT A $10 price tag. There are hundreds of other games you could buy for that $10 that are way more worth the money. I was very disappointed in the DLC.Synopsis: One of the most refreshing, unique, memorable ARPG'S I've ever played and probably ever will play. Great for fans of the souls series, and players new to the genre alike. Massive replayability. Breathtaking visuals. Incredible soundtrack. The DLC however is a total rip off at $10 as it takes around 30 minutes to beat and has a rather annoying maze. I wouldn't recommend buying the DLC unless it's on sale and you really want all the achievements.			"

												Nice Game, but after finishing the third time i think i wont play it again.From the difficulty Lords of the Fallen is a little like Kingdoms of Amalur Reckorning.The Start is a little hard, but from the mid game on, your Char is over levled (overpowered) you hit the Enemies 3 times and finish. Why is that ? If you die all enemies are back when u respawn. And you die often.Graphic and sound ar great, gameplay is a little slow due to heavy armour and weapons.There´s no fascinating story and I soon found myself skipping dialogues to not waste my time.Apart from this I was satisfied with the game and had fun playing.

												This is masterpiece! Absolutely great game, hard, challenging but also very satisfying. Visuals are simply stunning, everything from environment to armors, weapons and characters. Love how levels are designed at first it seems linear but it connect in many places you just have to open blocked doors, pull lever, remove magic seal etc, this help a lot with backtracking, looking for secrets, moving faster to mission objectives etc. There are tons of weapons and armor to find, almost every weapon feel different, have different attacks and you have to learn how to use it to stand a chance again your enemies, this alone give you huge amount of replay value and opportunity to test different weapons and play styles. You can really feel how heavy your weapons and armor are, the heavier it is the slower you move and loosing more energy to swing your sword or hammer, it can even make to the point that you don't have enough strength to swing some super heavy weapons even once :) Overall really great game, very well crafted, lots of content and hours of playing, definitely thumbs up from me! :)			"

												Lords Of The Fallen is a solid and fun game. It's no Dark Souls, we've all heard it. But in it's current state, with a price tag going super low in sales, it's quite a bang for the bug.Nice graphics and style, while performance never really sucked on my older system. Most of the time, it ran very well. Especially the armor and weapon design is great, everything feels quite heavy. Combat speed depends on your character build, but I opted for an axe swinging warrior and it felt and looked like leading a tank against tanks. Some animation-locks are bummers, but most of the time combat felt fluid.Story is okay-ish, a bit shallow, characters a bit chlichée.But still, give it a chance: It's a rewarding dark fantasy action rpg, and something I'd most def go back to. Solid 7.5/10 "

												Very Early Review, only a few hours in so far with the first 'Boss' down, and I have to say I'm loving it so far. As a huge fan of the Soul Series and From Software ingeneral, I feel this game is going to fill 'Dark Souls void' until Bloodbourne comes out. The game engine is very smooth, attack animations are very fluid and the sounds to go with are amazing and very immersive. If you're a fan of Dark Souls  PVE   than you will not regret this buy! Will post more as I play through.Playing through abit more one of my complaints would have to be the camera control or positioning at times, it can feel kind of buggy at times and lead to a few irritable deaths. You'll also notice how heavy of an influence the weight of your armour makes on the speed of your dodges, again like in dark souls. But I feel you're more penalized for using heavy armor in this game, atleast early game.Pros so far:Immersive EnviromentDestructable EnviromentsSoundtrack & Voice ActingFluid Gameplay MechanicsIntense and long lasting Boss Fights with some awesome mechanics and attack animationsGauntlets (A Shield/ Magical Projectile item)Lots of lore filled items and audio logsOptimized very well for PC, no crashes and consistant high frame ratesReplayability with new game+ and different classesAttacks feel 'real' a 2handed power attack takes a decent ammount of time to follow through giving the attacks a very real feeling with a tactical approachCons so far:No Character CustomizationCamera controls/anglesGame pace is very slow No mini map or quest markers which can lead to getting lost quite oftenNo Co-opNo multiplayer / PVP3 Classes (Warrior/Cleric/Rogue)My PC Specs and Settings:Intel Core i3 3220 3.3ghz16 GB RAMGeForce GTX 750 Ti SC (Overclocked quite abit)Running on High settings with x16 Anistropic Filtering			"

												I have like 800 hours of play between Dark Souls 1, 2 and 3. I have never played Demon Souls or Bloodborne as I have never had a console and will never own one. Period.I have just installed Lords of The Fallen as I finished DS3 three times and got enough of it.And…So far so good...It is not Dark Souls game. In some aspects it is familiar to DS, but it is more fantasih with a touch of D&D. The plot/story feels more significant and clear than in DS with a touch of mystery.I also do not understand all the hate towards this game. I do feel it is hugely underrated on Steam.Pros:-	Beautiful graphics – I find the graphics way better than in Dark Souls 3. The game is simply gorgeous.-	Performance/Optimization – again better than in DS3 – On full QHD and everything maxed out (all details on very high and antis on x16) I can run it 50-60 fps on my laptop. Whereas DS is only 40-45 on just full HD with occasional drops to as low as 30.-	Apart from occasional Memory leaks I have not encountered any bugs yet-	Lore – I like the logs you find throughout the game-	Atmosphere – proper Dark Fantasy Game with more stress on Fantasy than in Dark Souls-	NPCs  - so far I encountered like 5 of them and I found every one convincing and interesting-	Plot – so far so good – mysterious and stimulating -	Character development – very intuitive -	Equipment – armours and weapons – well developed – imo better than in DS-	Portals to the other worlds – I like the ideaHard to say-	Fighting system – it is okay but comparing to DS it feels much slower and clunky; I can still enjoy it though. Especially with some final hits that feel so powerful-	Levels design – I am still in two minds about it; levels seemed well connected but in the same time felt too small and shorts; I need to play more.-	Voiced Protagonist  – he feels like a really badass criminal – maybe not my type but I am able to impersonate while playing so its good and he has a good voice… but still I prefer the solution like in DS where you can shape your protagonist the way you like. Cons:-	You can’t hit a wall with your weapon like it is always too far. That feels really unreal-	Enemies – so far I have not seen anything special, just humanoids with shield, few assasins with daggers or crossbows and mutes – I will change this if I encounter more interesting enemies-	Bosses – so far I beat two and they were very easy + very similar – I will change this if I encounter more interesting bosses-	Rolling – it just does not feel right, even when not almost overcumbered it is slow and has short range. I barely use it-	Enemies that are covered behind their shields at all time – I find them really frustrating especially when using heavy slower weapon-	Memory leaks – it kicked me out like 2 times during 3 hours of play to the desktop with a message to close apps in order to free some RAM. I have 16GB of RAM and it is just not right; I am not sure if that is the game’s problem or Windows 10. Same thing happened to me with Fallout 4, but not in DS3-	Move set – only light and heavy attack + roll attack – is that right or am I missing something-	No multiplayer – that is too bad; I like the DS multiplayer and I think same thing could have been implemented here My Ratings:DS 1: 9/10DS 2: 8/10DS 3: 9/10Lords of the Fallen: 7/10UPDATE:+ I really like this game for it immense and hard to find secrets:)UPDATE 2: Finished it after 24 hours (I know it is long for this game but it’s just me I like to take my time a lot while playing focusing on all the closed doors and secrets) and my final feelings made me to decrease my rating from 7/10 to 6/10 and here is why (some spoilers ahead)-	After finishing it I realised I do not have the desire to go into NG+. Why? It is hard to say but I have got a feeling this game has nothing more to offer and I kinda do not want to go through this story again. I have had like half an hour on NG+ as an assassin and I felt fed up (2 out of 4 assassin’s skills are almost exactly the same as warrior’s) + the only thing NG+ changes is the enemies health what means you just need to hit them more like in Fallout 4, sponges-	(All the) Bosses are like super-easy; no challenge there at all; The most it took me to take down a boss was 2 tries and I had to do it only with 3 bosses. The biggest let-down was the last boss. I entered a room for the first time with just 4 potions (out of 12) and I won... It took me like 15 minutes, being careful with my life but it was just… too easy-	The story climax and the ending was disappointing; [SPOILERS WARNING]  first off why did I have to betray humans and Antannas? Why couldn’t I fight the god and help Antannas? No choice there and I was expecting more. Ending itself was poor as well.-	Monsters variety – not enough and too boringBut despite all the above I would still recommend this game to anyone to try it out. It was fun for me for one play through and the game has a lot of nice touches to offer (like graphics, atomosphere, secrets and lore). For me it is strong 6/10. After finishing it I can say (no remorse) it is in different league than Dark Souls; it is a different game but in the same time feels a bit short and lacking in some aspects where Dark Souls shines.

												Lords of the Fallen delivers well made sword duels and brawling.Compared to dark souls, it has less depths in character variation, gear customisation and overall content.But, the graphics are beautiful (even if sometimes a bit cheesy #lensflares), and the game drives you to dive deeper into the game mechanics and story to the point where you will fully understand every enemy and boss (which you'll never achieve in a souls game). Still it gives you the feeling of having spent 10-20 hours of enjoyable combat and intense boss fights.			"

												11h played - not a single crash. Sometimes I have fps drop down on highest settings but nothing that makes game unplayable. Im playing on Phenom II x6 1090T 3.2Ghz, GTX650, 8GB RAM so my rig isn't high end. Overall game is very good, Playing heavy armored tank it's kinda easy mode but medium/light armor is another story. Maybe on NG+ you will need more dodge and monsters attacks will crush you. Bosses are fine, nothing ""epic"" but compared to boring ones from DaS2 they have more interesting mechanics. There are some things that annoys me a lot like ""invisible walls"", a bit too much of backtracking or minor bugs. Controls and combat are same as DaS games (with same terrible run-jump mechanic) with some addition like shield charge (run+shield button) or fluid combo chain light+heavy attacks. I find LoTF more responsive than DaS2, kinda same good as DaS1. Graphic is beautiful, art style, locations, armor and weapon models, everything is top notch, especially compared to DaS2 terrible graphics. Animations are also great, ""feel"" of heavy weapon swing is one of a kind. There is no map, no objective mark or other easy-mode features so if you don't like exploring locations on your own and being lost (dmn those catacombs) think twice. There are also features like other dimension trials - some sort of side missions. Story? Really? This game is about combat and nothing else if you want good story go buy a good book for yourself. Overall it's very solid title and if CI Games will patch it and fix performence issues (for other ppl?) and minor bugs it would be even better. In general DaS1>LoTF>DaS2 (in terms of gameplay cause LoTF it's very short compared to DaS games)			"

												Lords Of The Fallen is a soulslike game set in a dark fantasy universe very similar to the one seen in Warhammer. Sounds good on paper, however I can't really recommend this game. Let's start with what's good.PROS: - Beautiful art style, lots of interesting details in the environment and in the gear. - Decent graphics with volumetric lighting. Sometimes the picture on the screen gets borderline gorgeous with all the ashes and sparks from hits flying around. Breathtaking. - Good combat system. Similar to the one seen in Dark Souls, yet with it's own twist (the addition of the Gauntlet is a nice touch). I love the timing-based combos — no more angry button smashing, you have to be careful with when you attack. - The Sound in this game is fantastic. Love the clenching of metal and heavy footsteps of the character.CONS: - Good God, camera gets atrocious sometimes. You're supposed to fight mobs, instead you're fighting game's camera. - Some mobs and bosses auto-aim on you. Meaning that while you're dodging their attack - they will follow you. - Speaking of Bosses. What was that? They all look the same! And why are they so easy? Beating the final boss in my second try is not good. - Story? What story? That plot-twist was borderline ludacris. - Mundane voice acting - Game's world navigation is frustrating. I've been cycling some areas over and over again, just because a narrow path was hidden between two bigger objects. Not really a good design decision. I personally think this happened because the image lacks depth. - Speaking of Game's World. It's really small. Loading screens between some areas are extremely frustrating and why are they there anyway? Damn. - There's only, like, 10 variations of enemies. - Game finale doesn't feel satisfying at all. - While Risk-Rewarding Check Point system is a great idea, there's really no risk to it. You can put all of your experience points into stats straight away without saving.All and all, this game is not hopelesly bad. It has lots of potential, yet somehow, at this moment, the developer didn't seem to push it hard enough. I can't recommend this game, however, I'll keep my ear to the ground for The Surge, see if Deck 13 will work on their mistakes.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC JUST YET! The game crashes every time I play it and I have a new £3000 PC, so thats not the issue. I have only used the main menu to exit the game twice since I didnt need to every other time I have stopped playing it. The game is ok and the graphics are really good. The trash mobs are too easy once you know what to do and most bosses I have killed on my first or second attempt, so its not really in the same league as Dark Souls when it comes to boss fights. I did pick up a legendary weapon early on that scaled with my main stat, so that has made a lot of the game trivial. If you are thinking of buying this game, just buy Dark Souls 2, yeah the graphics are good but its pretty short and you can only go to new game++. At the moment the best I can give this game is 2/5 which is a shame.			"

 A Good Buy For  Open-Minded Admirers of Action RPGs I think the main problem people have with this game is they compare it a little too much to and hold it up to the standards of multimillion masterpieces like those that From Software makes. Sure, this game has similar systems to Dark Souls and may remind you of it from time to time, but this is its own game and should be reviewed as such, not how it holds up to the game of another developer. On its own, the game is moderately entertaining in how it approaches the combat system (which does feel very different than that of a Souls game), but in the end suffers to its lack of enemy variety and formulaic liniarity. After all, I was a little dissapointed to see that the first 2 bosses were guys with shields and swords, a standard knight archetype, and how you will see the same 5-6 enemy variants most of the time in the opening hours. This may or may not improve in the late game, and ill push through to the end to find out, but the goal of a game should be to grab the player's attention early on and maintain that interest, building on its systems and mechanics. Lords of the Fallen fails in this aspect. Some commendable early-game attractions would be the combat and loot systems. The combat feels much more Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning esque than Dark Souls, be that good or bad is up to you. It feels slightly more fast paced and less methodical than Dark Souls too, giving the impression that this game is a little less about careful life or death combat choices than its counterpart. Though don't take this the wrong way, Lords of the Fallen is still a difficult game and at times, especially during boss fights, you will feel closer to the Dark Souls style of calculated blows and dodges. The loot early on feels a little like a Diablo game. There is plenty of loot (armor, weapons, such) in the first couple levels allowing great customizability in playstyle, especially when it comes to the weapon variants and the variety they give to your approach to combat.Over all, do I reccommend this game? For the price of $19.99, I think any open-minded admirers of Dark Souls or other difficulty based Action RPGs will enjoy this game. Idealy, find it for a deal, but the asking price is fair. At the very least, it's a good play so that you may have an example of how Action-RPGs can have shortcomings and how to avoid them. I respect From Software so so much more now and appreciate their arts now that I see how much work it had to be for them. I look forward to a sequel, where maybe they can iron out any flaws in the design and generally improve on the core aspects of the game they have made. "

												Impressive graphics and a dark setting serve well to make this game stand out from the competition. I didn't have a single crash as mentioned by other reviewers. The latest 1.4 patch fixed a lot of issues. Since I haven't played Dark Souls, this game is quite challenging for me and not too easy. It isn't frustrating either as the checkpoints are well placed. Had so much fun fighting the very first boss and this is one of the few games that actually made me scared and not feel overpowered.			"

												This is actually a very nice just underrated game. Difficulty is present and game can be hard and annoying at times. But every fight, every victory feels really great. Visuals are pretty amazing, though main hero may feel a bit sluggish. Music is good too, sound effects are good, you feel when you swing a light sword or a hammer just by sound alone. Combat itself is good, not great, but decent paced and at the same time pretty deep. Timings are everything.In conclussion, this is a great game, especially on a discount. And for those who dare to try it, and may say anything about it's difficulty: enemies are bound by the same rules as you. Sure bosses may hit harder, have more stamina and HP, but they still behave like a big version of you. Keep that in mind and you'll win. (even at the start of the game, tutorial says that )			"

												If you miss dark souls 1 style gameplay and want your dark souls 1 fix without going back, then this game is perfect for you. Im going to make this review short as my last review was rather longThe gameplay is reminiscent of dark souls 1, you can't walk around in full heavy armor light rolling with a great shield and heavy weapon unless you fully invest into weight carrying. Enemies know how to get around shields and they know how to use shields, you have to learn their weaknesses. Boss design is well done, i'll admit after the first two bosses being guys with tower shields i was worried, but the bosses get better from that point on. One thing i personally liked about the bosses is that they each seem to excel versus certain types of characters while being weak to others. As a rogue i had issues that i saw knights just breeze past and vise versa.Gameplay is heavier than dark souls 1 and it is fulfilling, armor designs are a little more stylized but in a good way. While the general enemies are not exemplary, they never felt out of place and they were spaced out logically, i was never swarmed by one enemy type.Anyways this review feels incomplete but i said it would be short so all i have to say is this game is very much like dark souls 1 except with new story and visuals, gameplay is fun and i will probably be playing alot of it until bloodborne, if you like DS1 you will most likely enjoy this game, and if you want to get started into games like the souls series this game is a friendlier version for new players.

												Lords of The Fallen is an action RPG with gorgeous graphics, superb sound design, and great music. As a lover of Demon Souls, Dark Souls and Dark Souls II, I can only recommend this game as its gameplay is just the same as the Souls series only more fluid movements and animations. You can basically choose between 3 different play styles, though you are free to mix and match as you desire:Heavy armor with slow powerful weaponsMedium armor with magic and mid-weight weaponsLight armor with fast weaponsEach has their own style of gameplay, with weapons that feel and play differently. Just like in the Souls series you have to earn experience (souls) from slaying monsters. You use them to level up your character and learn new spells. There are 4 for “class” chosen at the start, and you can unlock a second and third set on your second and third playthroughs respectively. If you die, you respawn at the last save point, dropping your experience. Just like souls, in order to retrieve it, you have to make it back to the point you died without dying. The longer it takes you, the less experience you recover, and once you’re there, you can choose to leave it on the ground temporarily in exchange for a few buffs that might help you defeat a difficult enemy. This game is as hard as the Souls series and Bosses even drop different bonus loot depending on how you killed them and what weapons you used, or didnt use during the fight.It’s safe to say that this is just Dark Souls with a more linear level design, though not by much. The story is very clearly told, though it isn’t very compelling. But really in a game like this, who really cares?			"

												A Dark Souls clone?Thats definitely not it, its far from similar to DS in terms of atmosphere and the overall experience. Its just the mechanics that have been 'borrowed' from the souls games. After playing the game for ~2 hours i can tell you that its definitely a game worth giving a try, although dont expect a literal Dark Souls clone, its a game of its own. The one thing i can praise the devs for is the combat system which feels waaaay better than the one in Dark Souls, im not really a fan of the armor and weapon design, if someone digs 100% fantasy design which would more than likely never work in real life then thats the game to look out for.Onto the graphics, the game looks aesthetically pleasing with well designed locations and great attention to detail, the places ive been to actually feel like they have been abandoned just a few moments ago. Positives:+Satisfying combat+Great atmosphere although could've been better+Their XP system is a nice addition (the more you kill the more XP you get, untill you go back to a checkpoint which works like a bonfire, then the multiplier resets)+Pleasing graphics+Really well designed locations+Soundtrack, although might sound a bit generic, works great.Negatives: -Overdesigned weapons and armor-Interface could've been improved in many ways.-Pretty linear-Voice acting is rather poor-So is lipsync and the gestures-Inventory window looks all nice and dandy, but id prefer it being more useful than looking 'nice'.-Not impressed by the boss fights so far-Not really challenging, at least in the 4 hours of playtime i have.Summary: If Dark Souls was a genre of its own, then this would be just another game in that genre, its not necessarily a clone but at least a 'heavily' inspired game, its trying to be a Souls game without being one, if that makes any sense.Graphics: 9/10Sound: 7/10Gameplay: 8/10If you can get it for less than 30€, give it a try.

It's difficult, frustrating... REALLY frustrating, but if you like rpgs, action adventure games and games which make you rage. I'd say go for it, plus, it's graphically gorgeous as well. :)			"

												What can I say about Lords of the Fallen. It's a solid game for a Dark Souls clone or inspired game if you want to call it that way. It's obvious for anyone who played LotF that this game has a lot of similarities with Souls series. The similar combat style, the similar experience loss on death, health and stamina management is also here. But it doesn't mean the game is a blatant rip-off. The developers took some interesting ideas and mechanics from Souls series and created this game. But unfortunately taking something good doesn't mean the final product is going to be good. The story is here and they are trying to tell it to you but after all I'm stil not sure what happened during the game. Combat system is slow and in most situations forces you to play defensively. And to be honest it's way to easier to play with huge sword and tower shield than trying to roll and dodge. At least for me. The game is also pretty short. 11 hours to complete NG seems just not enough for a game like this. I know there are NG+ and NG++ but I don't see the reason to complete them unless you're aiming for achievements to unlock. I heard right after the release people had some technical issues and crashes with this game. But it seems the game works fine now after they patched it a couple of times. Well at least I didn't have any problem with it.As the final verdict I'd say Lords of the Fallen doesn't worth the full price unfortunately but if you managed to get it during the sale you can have some fun with it. 7 out of 10.

												Considering that i'm a little more than halfway through the game now, I guess it's about time I wrote a review for it. And I have to admit: it's one of the finest RPG's I have ever played. I stayed away from it for a while because I got involved in Dark Souls, but I think that this game is better than Dark Souls And Dark Souls 2. This game definitely does not deserve the negative attention that it is getting because of performance issues. Well, if anybody had taken the time to look into the settings, having the shadows set to low will fix many of these problems. And you can't say it works fine for me because I have a fancy computer; All i've got right now is a GTX 760 and an AMD Phenom ii x4 820, and on high settings (aside form shadows) I get 60 frames/second consistantly without experiencing game crashes. Enough said about my computer, here's what I think of the game itself: Never once have I felt bored with this game so far. Many people would compare this game to the Souls games, saying that this game is terrible. In reality, as I mentioned before, it's better than the first 2 Souls games. Nothing can beat Dark Souls 3, but did it really have to take them Demon's Souls and 2 more games to figure out how these games are supposed to work? I'm not saying that the souls games are bad, it's just that this is better. Realistically, there could be a larger variatey of enemies and more classes to chose from, but it's the gameplay itself that got me hooked. How there are multiple NPC'S for you to interact with and actually respond to is what makes the story engaging. And these NPC""S have their own emotions and personalities as well. And as for the combat- there couldn't be anything better. The control is smoother than it is in any other RPG I have played (other people say that the controls are clunky because they are probably not familiar with this type of game). The hit detection is precice, and every battle you come across has life to it- even if it is just 1 enemy you are facing.As a final note, if you have played and BEAT a Dark Souls game or Bloodborne, then you sould only get this game if you want a more relaxed experience, as this is easier than those games. It still has it's difficulties, but overall it is less stressful playing this game. If you have NEVER played a souls game, then this is the place to start. Overall, it's easier and more enjoyable, and it has more story involved in it.And my final thought is that this game has one thing that I have always wanted to see in a souls game: YOU CAN SAVE YOUR PROGRESS WITHOUT SPAWNING ENEMIES!!!

												First off, yes it is a Souls style game, but do not let that fact effect your decision on whether or not to purchase it.  All in all its a good game, there are times where it will fall short but it makes up for it in other aspects.  The combat can be repetitive but its still fun.And the graphics are rather nice if a bit hardware intensive at times. All in all its a great game to get if it is on sale and you want a Souls style game that is easier than the actual Souls series.			"

												Short version: Yes I recommend this game, 7/10As someone who has not played a Dark Souls title, I really enjoyed playing Lords of the Fallen. I have heard that this game keeps crashing for most players which is a let down although I played it in high settings (can check my screenshots) and did not crash once...I completed the game within 12-13 hours as a rogue and spent 6-7 hours messing around on other classes at the beginning of the game, so an average of 30 hours played which nowadays is pretty good for a £30 single player game. As someone new to this genre I was disappointed that there is no way to view/keep track of active missions/quests and I got turned around and confused on where I was meant to be going and doing. The graphics for this game are amazing the voice acting on the other hand... could use work in places, the combat felt very well polished with a decent control layout and the NPCs behaviour felt really well done. The inventory menu is easy to use although something where I could store gear I am not using would have been nice instead of it always being in my inventory an having to scroll through like 20 different weapon to find the new set of daggers I got.

												Graphics are beautiful. I like the third person view distance, just right. It has elements of say Diablo 3, in that you can build your character with armor sets & weapons of various types, that look amazing & have their own unique approach. You can even socket some of your gear with runes. The movement of my character is smooth/fluid with perfect combat mechanics. Is this game hard? You better believe it. Each monster has its own style of killing you & you must figure out how & when to execute your weapon on each monster. Is it frustrating? Yep! But that is part of the style & fun of this game. My character has been murdered A LOT! I've even had to turn off the game & walk away for a bit, then come back & try again. It can be brutal. But the sun shines & the birds sing when you figure out how to kill these ♥♥♥♥♥♥. So far the game runs very smooth with no crashes & no glitches whatsoever. At the moment, my character is doing pretty well overall. I am still being murdered at times, but with only a few wrong moves rather than just one wrong move. How to deal back some of the punishment? Gain experience points, use a bit of magic & find better weapons via chests. Will quitters enjoy this game? Nope!			"

												Yes, it's heavily inspired by Dark Souls series, so what?It's still a great game, with awesome looking gear (Warhammer fans will love the whole game design), great fight mechanics, and unique bosses to kill. In fact I enjoyed LOTF more than Dark Souls - it looks better for me, mouse/keyboard steering and camera control are done much better. It has also great replayability value: 9 starting class combinations is something to chose from, you can complete the game 3 times with each of your unique characters, and fish for all those achievements.

												Yes I am recomending the game with a caveat.The game is fun, very similar to Dark Souls.  I am terrible at DS and actually gave up on the series, but from what I played, this game is very similar.  But for me, this game kept me engrossed in it, which DS never did for me, and I stuck with it.  Early on, the game is challenging, especially for someone who isn't really a DS veteran, but as I leveled, at the moment, I am finding it relatively easy.Only thing is right now, it does tend to crash a lot, more for some, less for others.  I honestly believe, it the crashing was fixed at it was more stable, you would see Steam list it as having mostly Positive, rather then mixed reviews. because at its core, the game is fun.			"

												I like it! There are some points that must be taken before buying:1. It is 1st game of this type for this studios, so make ""discount"" on your expectations if you are hyped or playing only ""10/10 games""2. STOP thinking that it is ""Dark Souls"" or clone, if you want DSes play DSes, surely it borrows some mechanics and ideas, but it is well done WestRPG, who punish you because you made mistake, but you can fix it3. game is slower than ""average"" action RPG, it is good and bad, good because you have ""weight"" of battle and bad.. welll if you expect action-packed kungfu-speed massacre4. game is not very DEEP in terms of classes (only 3) and magic (only 4 spells per class)5. almost every battle is like little dance (IMHO)For me game is good even with full price.

												What can I say about this game. The best way to surmise it is, it's like being in a relationship with an abusive partner, that requires you to abide by very strict rules but doesn't abide by the same ones. Did I finish the game? Yes.Did I have fun at points? Definitely.Did I continue to play after that? Yes. Mostly out of spite.Here is an example of what I am talking about:Me: Enemy, why didin't you die? I have fought you many times before and you have always died with one hit?Enemy: *shrug* Suck it nerd.Me: Why the hell did I just die? I jumped and landed on the platform!Platform: Your pinky toe was kind of hanging off a little bit, @sshole.Me: I AM HITTING THE ROLL BUTTON! ROLL FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD!Game: Meh. I didn't feel like it.Me: I swung my weapon but it didn't cause any damage? What is going on, this doesn't make any sense.Enemy: Oh we're supposed to make sense now? LULZMe: OH MY GOD I AM GOING TO BREAK MY KEYBOARD INTO LITTLE PIECES AND BURN THOSE PIECES! I WAS DOING A COMBO, WHERE IS MY COMBO?!?!?!?!Game: Hahaha. Go ♥♥♥♥ yourself.Now, these things wouldn't normally be a big issue, as no game works 100% perfectly. The problem is this game expects you to play absolutely perfectly but doesn't offer a perfect platform to do it on. Ultimately, this game does have a lot of cool things to offer, great graphics, somewhat interesting story (very short though) and actually pretty good replayability with the Game+ feature. I just cannot bring myself to recommend it as it will probably cause you many hours of suffering and possibly a broken keyboard or gamepad.			"

												From what i have played so far the game is brilliant, the combat system is very much like Dark Souls. If you did not enjoy that kind of combat then do not buy the game. There are a few key features that i like about the game and a couple that i anoy me a little.To start with the game has a brilliant combat system that has improved on the dark souls style. there are a few little things that just make it a bit more skill based and less luck/bruit force. there is a much better stagger effect that requires the player to time blocks on bigger enemies, this is not as hard as parrying and you have a much bigger window to do so. i feel that it just adds an extra mechanic to the game, your now thinking if its not worth trying to parry a super fast enemy at lwast i can try to stagger them.Another aspect that seriously made the game for me and i love it to death is that you now have a gamble when you gain XP. basically, you kill a monster and get xp, at these shine things you can Bank the XP and save it up to level up so that when you die you don't lose it. HOWEVER if you keep the XP on you, you get a higher chance of better item drops. I love this mechanic in the game and it seriouly makes you think.there is not much about the game that annoys me besides one thing that i think is worth mentioning. Tutorial. the game is quite heavy in the menues and can be a little confusing to start with. i feel that the game doesnt explain the menues well enough but this is nothing that time cant heal as you will learn as time goes on.If you are using a game pad (you should be) navigating the menues can be a ♥♥♥♥♥, i dont know if this is just me but having one of those circle menues that you rotate the analouge stick to get around is very annoying when you want one of the diaginals AAAAAHHH, i waist so much time on it.Other than the few very minor bad aspects of LOTF the game shines through brilliantly, graphics are amazing and the game runs so smooth for me, besides the loading screens but who cares.There is one last thing but if no one else is having this problem it must be my computer. the game has crashed a few times for me and im recieving graphics error reports. im running a pretty good GPU so i need to do some reaserch to see if others are suffering.8.7/10 Love this game, feels like a new take on Dark Souls combat that does not fail to impress			"

												First of all I have not played any of the Dark Souls games, so the closest game I played that I can compare LOTF with is Blade of Darkness, which I played way back in the day.That being said, the game was a mixed bag for me.The gameplay for starters is not for everyone. You either love it or hate it. So you cannot judge the game by it. I personally enjoyed it. It requires a certain degree of patience that many simply do not possess. For the good parts:The graphics are nice, the level design, artwork, animations, all very good.I finished the game in about 26 hours, which in my opinion is pretty balanced. It's not short enough to consider it a bad investment, but it's not long enough to get you annoyed along the way and not finish it.Now for the less then good parts:The voice and lip-sync animations are less then mediocre. The soundtrack is fine I guess, but it did not impress or remain in memory.The story is pretty simple. You do not get enough information about any character in order to have any sort of emotion invested.For me personally, at least 75% of the weapons i found were just collectibles. I never once used them. even those that were specific for my class. They do not seem to be properly balanced for the moment that you find them. I think i used a total of 4 weapons the entire game. I mean i used the same staff for 4 bosses in a row. The armor pieces are much better balanced however.The game allows you to ignore the class selection and use any equipment, as long as you have the stats. That is how i got to be a Rogue that uses heavy armor. The side effect of this is that you will naturally gravitate towards certain weapon classes and others you will never ever touch. The game has a design choice evident from the start, specifically if you want to uncover certain loot, you have to backtrack a lot. This, coupled with the fact that all enemies respawn if you either die or switch zones, has two effects, neither which I am a fan of. It's either a chore to go run around to open that one door/chest that you couldn't before, which makes the game feel empty, either you have to kill every single monster all over again, which in some cases was annoying as all hell because of the positioning of the monsters.The game crashed a few times for me. 4 times during boss fights, which was really annoying, and once during normal play. I however did not lose more that 10-15 minutes of playtime. In the end for me that whole experience sums it up to a high 6/10.The good features outweigh the bad ones for me, but not enough for a second playthrough anytime soon.The price for me is more than fair (15-20 euro). I do not consider it a waste and for what it's worth, I would recommend it to friends. If a sequel would improve on some of the bad points, it could become a decent franchise.			"

												To start off, since I've seen people mostly complaining about constant crashes, I've not experienced any problems with that. I don't know what I've done right, but I'm happy I didn't have to put up with it.Secondly, a lot of people are comparing this game to Dark Souls and the game really is inspired by the Dark Souls series. The thing is, if you played through Dark Souls series first, Lords of the Fallen will be incredibly dull, mostly easy, empty and boring to you. But if you're playing Lords of the Fallen first it probably would be pretty hard, but it would be just a tutorial for Dark Souls and you would simply be amazed by Dark Souls.Story:To be honest, I didn't really follow the story through, so I can't say much. But if you visit LotF wiki you'll see everything. I'm sure the devs tried to make the story interesting, but I just didn't want to keep track of what's going on. Probably because the game doesn't explain from where Harkyn (protagonist) comes from, what he's done, you only know he's a convicted criminal who now has a chance for redemption to kill some gods or whatever. I don't think wiki's got more than that.Combat:In the beginning you get to choose between 3 Magic types and 3 starting equipment. Rogue (light), Warrior (heavy), Cleric (medium). There are stats: Strenght, Agility, Faith which scale with weapons (meaning you have more damage with an agility weapon the more agility you have) and other stats like Vitality, Endurance, etc. In the game, it doesn't really matter with what you start with because you can build your character differently later. I usually play with light armor and fast weapons so when I did go as Warrior on my second playthrough I just ended up with agility weapons because I don't like being slow.The 3 Magic types give you different magic abilities which you have to unlock with experience and they sometime do appear useful, but I didn't use them that much because I wasn't going for Magic stat.And also you get The Gauntlet, which is a big gun, basically. It uses Magic to shoot.Most effective fighting technique is to do combos. With combos Energy (read ""stamina"") depletes less with each attack. Agility weapons like fists, daggers and shortswords have a special combo move on the 3rd and 4th attack, which can stagger opponents and deal fair amount of damage.Weapons:As I said, weapons scale with stats. Hammers are the only weapons scaling with Faith, so there's no point in going for too much Faith for damage because I find hammers awfully slow, but Faith also gives you Magic.The problem is, weapons, for example swords, all have the same animation and same attack speed. Meaning when you get a new weapon, you don't care what kind of animation it has, you just look at the damage you output. Again, if you look at Dark Souls, almost every weapon has it's own move set. And that's what the game is missing.There are also different damage types, like physical, magic, fire, lightning to be extra spicy and you acquire those from runes. When you find a blacksmith he can put runes in to your equipment.Armor:Nothing much to say about this. There are light, medium and heavy armor, depends on your playstyle. There is a weight load so if you put too much armor you'll move and roll slower.Armors are nicely designed, I really liked that.Enemies:There are not a lot of enemies, around 15-20 coming at you throughout the whole game. Enemies with shields are really annoying because they don't do anything besides sitting behind a shield and maybe attacking you one or twice before you manage to somehow kill them.Generally, they are all easy and... Basic.Locations you have to go through get recycled.Bosses:Every boss is nothing special, they all have some basic attacks and they are all extremely boring, because they have too much health and the fight doesn't progress at all. So it's just the same moves for 5-10 minutes straight.Music:Not bad when there is something in the background. It's quiet mostly.Love the theme song though.Overall, it's a good game to play, but I didn't find much worth in it. The devs tried at least.Just go play Dark Souls.			"

												I'm not huge on Dark Souls, and I've heard that Lords of the Fallen is supposedly much easier and more forgiving than Dark Soul, so keep that in mind if you're a super veteran who can complete Dark Souls 2 without dying once. But for people like me, it's a decently challenging game where you'll die a few times here and there until you recognize the pattern and master the control, and beat your enemy down with a small portion of your own health remaining. Then you kick open some chests and find some more badass loot, you move on and get your teeth kicked in by the next big bad monster. It's satisfying all the way through.The game looks great and sounds great, though the voice acting leaves much to be desired. The running, dodging and weapon wielding animations look fantastic, making you feel just how heavy each swing of your massive hammer is. There are some minor issues with some of the animations, and the game tends to have serious issues with cloth and armor pieces clipping through your shield and other parts of your armor. It's not a big deal gameplay-wise, but for a game that otherwise looks this good, it does put a dent in the overall presentation.Overall, it's a fun game. And I think it's the perfect gateway game for people who want to get into challenging action RPGs, but are intimidated by Dark Souls' notorious difficulty. Lords of the Fallen isn't a perfect game, but it's quite a bit of fun and well worth the money.			"

												The only reason why this game has 'Mixed' reviews, is purely because everyone is comparing it to Dark Souls.I have put 1300+ hours into the Souls games and I still really enjoy this game.Your character does feel heavy and the enemies seem to auto-aim onto you, even when dodging, so forget the whole no armor for better dodges like you would in a Souls game, equip decent armor and a shield.Once you get used to the different style of combat, it becomes a very enjoyable game.

												Yeah, we get it. It's not Dark Souls, but Lords of the Fallen is a relatively decent game with a few differentiating characteristics: chief among them include traditional storytelling elements, unlike the ambiguity found in Dark Souls, and a far more forgiving playthrough. Although it lacks the difficulty that DS is known for, it is more accessible for those with very little patience. Overall, it doesn't provide the same sense of accomplishment upon completion, but it was an enjoyable experience, nonetheless.			"

												Taken on it's own merits, LotF is great fun so far. I'm enjoying the combat system quite a bit, and the sound and animation do a great job of lending a visceral feeling to the game. Heavy weapons especially have a great sense of impact and power. I enjoy the art direction quite a bit (armor and weapon models are particularly impressive). There's a good use of color and contrast, and the game is vibrant without being cartoony or sacrificing a gritty feel. Overall it's gorgeous and runs smoothly on my mid-level system. No crashes yet (running the newest nvidia drivers).It's hard to avoid comparisons to Dark Souls. The mechanics are so similar. Personally I prefer the combat system here, as it feels more fluid. That being said, the game is a little less challenging and combat so far hasn't provoked that same rush of anxiety that I get when playing DS. I'm still having a great time with it, and I really enjoy the way they've tweaked some of the other systems like magic, leveling, and reincarnation.Bottom Line: Fun combat, great weapons/armor, well done sound and art direction. If you can play it without wishing it were Dark Souls 3, you'll have a great time.			"

												As one bad Dark Souls fiend, I was a little sceptical about this game at first and didn't expect much. As soon as I had watched the trailer, I thought, 'Well, alright, a game inspired by DS that seems decent, why not give it a try?'I've purchased the game right away upon release. It was somewhat obscure in the beginning - but I believe one has to develop certain habits and earn some experience to start steadily progressing in a game like this. I've only had a couple of crashes - and pretty annoying they were - but with release of 1.1 they were gone as soon as I disabled the Nvidia Turbulence setting.There is no multiplayer and there isn't that much content. But the existing content is gripping and full of secrets for the ones who love to explore. I've barely managed to stop playing the game to continue on the other day.It's not Dark Souls, but it's great in its own way. I would give Lords of the Fallen a 8.5 out of 10.			"

												Game crashed 10 times for me in my first 15 hours and compared to these other reviews I feel a little lucky. Also it doesn't seem to be optimized too well. I wouldn't recommend this game in its current state.Other than feeling slow, the game also plays slow. I tried to be patient with the slower combat but it just gets boring and repetitive, especially when fighting guys with shields. I played into NG+ for a bit and the game becomes frustratingly easy because you can level up so frequently. However, shortcomings aside, it is isn't a terrible game and you should give it a shot when it isn't totally broken and is cheaper.			"

												Screw the haters.Okay, here's the deal: the game is a Souls ripoff. It's also nowhere near as good as the Souls games. Does that mean it's bad? No.Lords of the Fallen takes the Dark Souls formula and twists it a bit. You got interconnected areas to explore, you got respawn points to find, you got deaths to do, it's all there, but it's got its own additions to the system. It does magic really well - even the gimmicky-looking but fun spells like Mimic have use - and it has a really cool attitude to subquests: yeah, they're there, but forget tracking and a journal - you remember to do them, or you don't. This may sound annoying and backwards but given the rather small size and huge interconnection fo the game's world, it opens a lot of rewards for exploration: you get this mysterious item, wonder if that guy who alluded to it has something to say about it, better go talk to him - on the way, oh look, secret switches I missed and a whole new area filled with giant ♥♥♥♥ing spiders.Completionists won't like it - or the fact that there's a bunch of choices with very definite consequences that can lock you out of rewards - but it encourages thorough approach and constantly being on lookout for secrets, and the game is chock-full of those.Okay, the elephant in the room and what most people hate: combat. It's slow. In addition to good old souls' stamina, attacks just come out slowly even with fast weapons. It's not very stylish or action-packed and emphasises strategy over reflexes. I can't really speak for the people who hated it but here's a tip: try out the biggest ♥♥♥♥ing stick you have in your inventory. Wielding slow and powerful weapons has rarely been so satisfying and I maintain this game has the best-feeling warhammers I ever cracked goblin skulls with.What else is there? The setting is obviously nowhere near Souls stuff and you will get tired of the endless snow, the story is really predictable (although the novelty of medieval audiologs helps with that a fair bit) and most of the bosses are variations on Big Guy In Armor. Mechanically they are mostly handed well (two exceptions aside) but could use a bit more creativity in visual department.What it really comes down to is this: it tries to be Souls. It's not. But it's a solid tribute and definitely a good game for at least the one playthrough when you get all the magic of exploring harsh, unforgiving and content-packed environments. The real ""failure"" of Lords of the Fallen is that it doesn't live up to the source material - but when the source material is brilliant, being just good is nothing to be ashamed of. I wouldn't by it at full price but this game is a very solid sale pick.Oh, and don't buy the DLC. It blows - about an hour long and ending with a boss that's just piling one idiotic design decision over another. "

												Game was extremely frustrating at first, only because I'm not used to playing this type of combat style. This game actually got me to play Dark Souls just to see the connection everyone was talking about, and I'll agree it definitely was inspired, but its so different from DS that honestly the only relevant link I can make between them is the combat style. A few key things to note about this game would be:- Every action you take animation locks you. Light weapons like daggers/fists are very short locks if you don't get snagged in a combo attack, and larger weapons like greatswords and maces have a longer lock (approx. 3-4 seconds per special attack swing). This is also effected by the type of armor you're wearing. Wielding Heirloom (elemental hammer) and wearing all light armor I was able to swing and dodge attacks significantly faster.- Know your enemies! This game is 90% about knowing your enemies and how to handle them. This isn't the type of game where you get in and steam roll through trash mobs to the boss. You need to wait for your enemies to give you an opening and move in for the attack. The more you play this game & the more you die, the more you'll get better at noting openings in your enemies. Once you get the timing down to make hits in the sweet spots, the enemies drop like flies.- Leveling. I found it insanely helpful to level grind for a while in order to progress to the area past the 3rd boss easier. The good news is that there's an experience modifier you gain from killing multiple enemies in a zone without going back to the crystal and healing. This modifier makes it insanely easy to level up and I recommend taking full advantage of it. (side note: bank your experience when you get the chance, it won't reset the modifier and you'll be thankful you didn't have it on you when that 1 mob decided to eat your face off in an area way far off from your last crystal touch).Things I would like to see them improve on with this game:- Combat system: swing/hit lag. There's been numerous times in a fight where I got hit by a swing that was actually 4 feet away from my face, as if the weapon has an invisible hit box on it that extends past the actual model of the weapon. There's also the enemies that swivel around to cornhole you when they should be stuck in an animation lock.- Combat system: heaviness. I enjoy how heavy combat feels here, but to an extent. I've fought quite a few enemies wielding a huge great axe with a heavy shield on that come at you swinging a mile a minute AND have time to swivel on a heel turn and block your attack with that big shield that begs you to question why this is kosher when it takes you 3-4 seconds to make that swing and sticks you in a deadly animation lock. If combat is going to be this heavy I would highly recommend making sure all the monsters suffer the same penalty.- Expansion to multiplayer/co-op. I really, really hope to see this game develop further into a state of being where other players can come in as other characters and assist. I realize at the moment everyone plays as Harkyn, so it's a bit unlikely, but this game has a ton going for it in all the right places and I would love to get the opportunity to play it with friends instead of having them watch me play. This game starts out a little raw in the beginning, so it'd be nice to have the ability to walk through it with a friend that's new to it and encourage them to keep going/show them the ropes.- Map. This game would have benefitted GREATLY from a map or at least a compass that points you towards lost experience points like the loot compass if you're really against maps for forcing exploration (I'd argue there's no reason you can't just have people unlock the map by exploration as they go though). I had no problem memorizing where to go and how to get there after a few runs of zones, but whenever I died I wasn't particularly paying attention to the exact location I was in and I'd have to run around for a while to figure out where I dropped exp. There was also a time where I died at the entrance and dropped 6k, but when I respawned the experience wasn't there, even though I still had 100% (6,438) on the screen waiting for me to pick it up. I had to just take a dive because I had no clue where it put it.Comments:- I would have loved to see the story developed a little further. We know very little about Harkyn, but are continuously reminded of his reputation. This may be intentional, leaving the player to their own imagination, but it makes it feel a bit impersonal. Also, the ending was....disappointing. I just wasn't really ever sold on this game story-wise. I played it for the challenge and the audio clips were intriguing to say the least, but that was about it. It could have benefitted from a little more world immersion, cutscenes, and an ending that's better than just a re-cap of what you accomplished and a snippet of story about Adyr.The ending feels rushed honestly, or like someone got burnt out and just needed to meet a deadline. It bums me out because of how awesome the game was otherwise -- but perhaps we'll see more great titles that improve upon this? :)I would love to see some worthy content addition that adds more areas to play in so we're not stuck in just this one castle. While there is one other area you gain access too, most of the game is played just in a single area with multiple zones you're entering into. It's huge, don't get me wrong, but I would love to see more.TLDR: I highly recommend this game and will be continuing to play with ng+ and ng++. It frustrates the crap out of me when I die but, I'm constantly challenging myself to beat bosses without taking any damage at all or meeting legendary requirements to make it harder on myself and taking advantage of every slow-mo death blow I deal while adding a ""BAM"" vocally for enhanced enjoyment, as is mandatory. Game takes a while to warm into if you'r'e new to it's kind, but stick with it and you'll get your monies worth.			"

												For the time being, I really like the game.It is difficult in the beginning, but I don't think it is as hard as Dark Souls.A downside is, that a lot of the basic stuff in the game, you have to figure out yourself, because the tutorial doesn't cover it all. I have for instance been stuck at a few bosses now, because I only just realized, that you could swap potions on you. It wouldn't have been so tough if I had only known that, but the tutorial said nothing about it.A great game, but you can feel the game is a port.Still it has great atmosphere, graphics and a decent story so far :)			"

												The whole experience is kinda strange. The mechanics are pretty good mostly because they almost directly copied from Souls series, which is actually pretty nice for I like Souls series. However, things that were taken from other games or made by the developer are not polished and kinda look like the game demands bigger budget than it actually had. The animation is pretty bad, the plot is scarce to the point of nonexistence. And it is not like in Souls where there is a nice setting and you can actually explore it, here the game is pretty linear despite the player being able to go back and forth throught the locations, and actually seems like it was supposed to be story-driven. But the player ends up hacking and slashing the enemies mostly just for the sake of hacking and slashing. The whole game seems like a start, a pretty good start, but that is just it. Even though i recommend the game. i cannot say that it is worth 60 bucks. And I would not have bought it for these money.			"

												First off, this is a good game. Everything is very well polished, it looks good, the story is decent enough, most of the combat is fair if not easy. There is a decent amount of mix and match with armor to stay at your desired weight level.Unfortunately it is pretty short. I've got 14.3 hours on it and I have beaten it. My actual play time is only 12h59m because - and this is the worst part by far - crashing. It's ridiculous how often this game crashes. There is some optimization issues present when booting up and every once in a while when loading between worlds/zones there will be some framerate drops.Lastly I just want to point out that this is not Dark Souls; it is much easier. As long as you do not go exploring areas that you are not ready for (Catacombs before closing the Portal) you will not experience any difficulty at all. I've heard and read that playing the rogue (as a rogue) makes the game a decent challenge but I feel that each class should present their own challenges which they do not. Overall though I think it is a decent start for the studio and hopefully a long line of Dark Souls hopefulls. If you come in expecting a 10/10 Dark Souls clone you are going to be severely disappointed. If you come in with the mind set that this could be an enjoyable experience that takes many elements from a game the devs love then I think you'll be satisfied.			"

												My first thought when I went to buy this game was of course like everyone else ""Wow this looks a bit like Dark Souls"". So what I have done is to try and not think about Dark Souls at all when I play the game. I am personally having a blast with the game (Admittedly I haven't completed it yet) and I am actually looking forward to trying new styles in the game. Longevity might not be the strongest point of the game, but if you are looking for a game that is sorta hard, with interesting combat and a style that I personally love, Lords of the Fallen might really be a game for you. If you are a hardcore dark souls player and will expect this to be ""Dark Souls, pretty colors edition"", you will be disappointed. I very much recommend the game			"

												Solid combat on par with its obvious inspiration Dark Souls / Demon's SoulsFeels uniquely heavy and arguably more realistic. Reccommend a first playthrough is done with heavier armor until you get used to it however. Light armor results in getting hit being brutally punishing.Highly reccommend learning how to use the sprinting shield bash well to help with handling the more tanky shield-toating enemies most people have loved to complain about. I found after some practice I was able to make quick work of them when at first they were genuinely difficult to handle.Also a huuuuuge note to those who might have crashing issues and feel they can't properly challange themselves due to being unable to use checkpoints to save the game and risk losing their exp multiplier: The multiplier is not based on how long it has been since you have use a checkpoint. It simply gives you more exp based on how much you are carrying on you. The only thing that will reduce this is if you use a checkpoint and actually BANK your exp into your AP or SP pools. So long as you are holding XP that you would drop on your ghost if you died, you will continue to build up your multiplier. The story is forgetable but enough to give some context to your actions. I'm more in it for the gameplay personally so this doesn't really affect me too much. The in game areas and vistas are incredibly beautiful and graphically this game is very much a looker. You will need a fairly beefy rig to get the best out of it, but after the latest update allowing you to disable the nvidia specific effects, it seems to run a lot more reliably and much more steady framerates.With Vsync turned off my rig runs this at around 60 - 70 fps, usually around a steady 70 fps in most areas. This falls a fair bit when first loading into new areas via a portal, but quickly evens out after just a few moments. Overall I highly reccommend this game to any veteran of the Souls series who is in it just for the extremely satisfying gameplay. You will feel some real accomplishment as you go from struggling to kill most foes to finding ways to easily dispatch them, and conquering some genuinely interesting boss fights. You won't find your intriguing and wonderfully subtle story line, but you'll find a generic fantasy plot decent enough to give you an excuse to slay more demons.			"

												Il start by saying that i enjoyed playing LotF until the end without any issues and 2 crashes only, mostly bc of problem i have on my graphic card (Sometimes stop responding), its a very entertaining game with interesting story with 2 key points that change the outcome of the ending you get.Im not going to make Dark Souls comparations, first bc DS didnt invented the wheel, only shapped to better what other games like Darksiders or Fable The Lost Chapter for instance, had already tried to achieve.Its very easy to fall into making new games rip off of others, but i think most have their own identidy, for instance i find the combat in LotF more polished that DS, but being more easy in term of challenge and specially bosses fights.The graphics and sound are very good and the story is interesting enough to keep you playing, the voice actors do decent job but sometimes lack ability to create link with the player but nothing special.The gameplay is fun and requires a little understanding on how to use things, and the game does a good job on that if you read the hints carefully at tutorial.Overall i find LotF good enough to make me wait for a sequel that is already confirmed by the Dev, there is still a DLC coming for this game with the last PC patch, but even without it i already made my purchase worth while with 30h of gameplay and half way out of the second playthrough, wich show that the game have some replay value, something that most games miss out now days unfortunatly.

												A much under-appreciated game. Hard and unforgiving. Especially in New Game Plus. Great graphics, solid swordplay, awesome art style. Only thing keeping it down is the story which almost doesn't exist and some repetitive enemies. The levels are awesome to look and traverse in. Remember it's not a hack n slash game so button mashing gets you killed as there is a Stamina meter. If you feel you're dying too much in the beginning, don't give up, it has an initial learning curve after which the game becomes easier, although the game is actually getting harder. You are able to handle the challenges better once you get the hang of the mechanics. Considering you can pick it up for real cheap from this point on, buying this if you're a gamer looking for a challenge, this is a MUST. My personal score 8.7/10			"

												I'm going to do some comparison between this game and the Souls series because of how similiar their core gameplay is. So, brace yourself.Lords of the Fallen is a short but fun game. Its core gameplay mechanics are highly similiar to the mechanics found in the Souls series. The difficulty and depth, however, aren't on the same level. I would describe it as a dumbed down version of the Souls series, but that would imply that it's a clone of that series. Which it is not. Story:The story is about an outlaw called Harkyn, who is freed from prison to help fight the invading rhogar. Not everyone is happy about this and you will notice it when you talk to certain npcs. As the story progresses, you will fight the leaders of the rhogar, the rhogar lords. The story is presnted clearly, with cutscenes and as background lore which is found in audio logs that you find as you explore. The audio logs are played in the background and they aren't intrusive.Gameplay:Gameplay is, as stated before, very similiar to what you find in the Souls series. There are backstabs, parries and ripostes as well as light and strong attacks. The overall pace of the fights feels somewhat slower than in the Souls series though.The control scheme on a controller is super similiar to the control scheme of the Souls series.You will start the game by choosing a magic school out of three different options. One provides stealth themed spells, while another provides defensive magics while the last provides offensive magics.Then you proceed to pick a character type out of three different options. There is the warrior, that starts with heavy armor and is strength oriented. Then there is the rogue, that starts with light armor and is agility oriented. And last but not least there is the cleric, that starts with medium armor and is faith oriented.Note: Nothing is bound to your starting character type. Any type can use any type of equipement, provided that they meet the neccesary requirements. However, you are not able to get any magics from other spell schools than the one you picked at the start.Your character has a variety of different attributes which you can improve with experience(exp) gained from killing enemies. This exp will be lost upon death if it hasn't been banked at a checkpoint. When you die, you leave behind a ghost that contains all the exp you had on you, and it can be retrieved by getting to it and activating it. This exp on your ghost will start to deplete over time so getting to it as fast as possible is essential if you wish to gain the most of your exp back. The ghost will provide you with a slight health regen when you are near it, possibly aiding you in a place where you previously died in a tough battle. This bonus is lost when you pick up the ghost.Your character is able to wield a shield and a weapon, dual wield small weapons such as daggers and shortswords and two-hand bigger weapons like greatswords and greataxes. You will also gain a gauntlet which is your primary source for magical or elemental damage. The gauntlet has three modes: Projectile, which shoots a long distance projectile. Blast, which is a short range blast that knocks most enemies to the ground while dealing minor damage. Explosive, which basically throws a magical grenade.Graphics, Visuals, Art:The graphics are nothing especially amazing, but they are good enough. The art style wasn't to my liking, but I didn't really dislike it either. Come to think of it, I found the monster desing and the overall art style to be somewhat reminiscent of Diablo 3. Anywho, in my eyes, the game looks good enough.Music & SoundsI haven't really got anything to say about the BGM. I think the BGM is nice and quiet by default, since I can't remember hearing it too much. Heh. As normally I have to tone down the music volume so that the BGM doesn't get intrusive. No such problems here. The voice acting is decent. Could be better, yes. But it gets the job done, with a static decent quality.Afterword:It took me around 15 hours to finish my first playtrough, but that's not that bad since the game has the New Game Plus (NG+) option. I haven't tried the NG+ yet, since I decided to make a different type of character to find out my favorite playing style, but I'm hoping that the difficulty will spike up in the NG+. Overall I would recommend this game, but not at full price. Especially fans of the Souls series should wait for a price drop, imo. And those who never touched a Souls game or found them too hard or difficult to grasp, this game might serve as a good introduction to the gameplay mecahincs, as it's less in depth and thus easier to grasp.

												A game inspired in mechanics by the Souls-series, a couple of nice features and a more mainstream approach to story and exposition.LotF mostly plays like Dark Souls.You've got classes of melee weapons that you can either one-hand with a shield or two-hand for more damage. You can parry enemy attacks, block them or dodge out of the way. It also has a couple of features that ended up in DS3, like paired weapons, where you wield one in each hand when two-handing, and charged heavy attacks.You explore dark fantasy locations like castles, tombs and hellish realms, mowing down enemies, looting treasure and killing bosses. Although progression is mostly linear you'll soon find that most environments interconnect and you'll end up reaching blocked out areas of the early game and opening shortcuts.The story is somewhat short, taking around ~20 hours if you go about it at your leisure. Once you beat the game you can start new game plus which offers harder enemies and better loot.There is no multiplayer like in the Souls-series.It has an intersting spin on ""currency"". Like DS you earn XP that you can either use to level up and upgrade weapons or you can keep on yourself to boost your item find, with the risk of losing it upon death.Overall the game is a good attempt at a Souls-like. It wears its inspiration at its sleeve.You may feel it is easier than the Souls-games. Combat-wise it's not, though I personally don't find DS hard either, both games require patience to progress but you never feel lost in LotF, you always have a sense of direction and there are almost no points where you need to wiki it. As I said at the start of the review, it's has a mainstream approach to story telling, exposition and pacing, done through dialogs with NPCs and recovered audio logs, with Souls-like combat and exploring in between.On the other hand said story is cookie-cutter dark phantasy writing, men fighting against demons, sent by a vengeful god and the expected twist near the end. You won't cringe but won't be search Youtube for lore videos either.Surely worth the asking price on a sale. I got it for ~12.5€ and don't regret it. "

												I don't know how far I'm into Lords of the Fallen yet, but I feel like I should write a review because it's still fairly new and there's probably a lot of people thinking about getting it. I'm a big fan of the 'Souls' series by From Software, as many of the reviewers on here are. However, as Lords of the Fallen's story hasn't really caught my interest, I'm just going to review the combat mostly.CombatThe combat, at first, feels slow and clunky. -Armor makes or breaks how combat, for you, will flow. I fell into heavy armor very quickly, finding that the increased defence and poise made it so I could tank many hits while swinging around a big weapon. Once I got the basic understanding of how they wanted someone in heavy armor to approach fights, it stopped feeling slow and clunky and started to just feel meaty. In comparison to any of the Souls games, heavier armor makes a significant amount of difference in whether or not you can take a hit and how much damage you'll take. I like this, personally, as it means that armor is as big a decision for you as your weapon choices.-Weapons are fairly varied, but rather than directly upgrading any weapon with a moveset you like, you have to find better weapons that do the same thing. It's more of a traditional RPG setup, where finding better gear is important. The weapons, however have fairly limited movesets based on type and some weapons are very ineffective against certain bosses. Overall, I'm fairly unhappy with the weapon options, with the faster weapons feeling weak and having very little advantage against the heavy hard hitting great weapons. There is one advantage Lords of the Fallen has, most weapons have a very satisfying weight to them that is missing in other games. Few things are as satisfying as crushing something's head with a big hammer after you've died to it a few times, and the weapons allow this.-Stamina and Power Attacks are very interesting. Stamina recharges quickly, and only when you really invest in attacking or block a lot of attacks that you perhaps should not be do you feel like you are running out of stamina. Speaking of investing in attacks, your Strong Attacks can be charged up in Lords of the Fallen, making them more powerful. I like this a lot, as it adds a big dynamic to how much time you're going to invest in a swing which makes a world of difference in the combat in Lords of the Fallen. Another great system is Perfect Hits, which are performed when you hit the attack button just as your last hit finishes, conserving more stamina on the next swing allowing for longer (or improved, in the case of dual wielding) combos. The changes to how you can use your stamina are really interesting, and add a new layer of depth to a system that I feel like I knew well.-Magic is fairly uninteresting. The spells are mostly buffs or light AoE attacks, and although these buffs have very powerful  effects and can be used in combat I found myself forgetting about them more often than not. The cast time for spells is long, meaning you have to find openings to cast effectively. Even when I did cast, I found myself more often than not focusing on using a single spell before a fight or when a boss was doing an action that allowed me a few moments respite. Magic adds to the meaty combat, making you feel more powerful when you use it, but it lacks in variety. The Gauntlet is very cool, however it is difficult for me to find it's place in the meaty melee combat of Lords of the Fallen.One other thing I would like to note before I wrap this up is that the game itself is very pretty. I'm not a big fan of the design choices for how the enemies and the main character look in armor (shoulderpads bigger than your head and spikes!), but the rest of the game looks beautiful. My computer can normally run games on max settings, but I find Lords of the Fallen on even mid-low settings is fairly clunky in terms of FPS and whatnot. Overall, I would recommend Lords of the Fallen. It's fun, meaty, and so far a great time sink. As a Souls player it took a bit of getting used too, but the ability to take hits from enemies and not worry means a lot after playing the Souls series, where I used to try to dodge everything. I feel like it doesn't have the same challenge as say Demon's Souls or Dark Souls, but it is overall fair and it doesn't need to be that difficult. Both seperate and compared to it's spiritual predecessors, it stands as a overall decent game.			"

Like some users said, It might not have the best dialogue, small amount of enemy types and not much of a story but the gameplay was really enjoyable for me. I love the Dark Souls series and this game is like a small version of what it would be like if Darksiders and Dark Souls collided.			"

												The game is preatty awesome. It has a cool story, good fighting mechanics and the graphics are preatty great too. There are a couple of ways you can play it with a couple of possible outcomes wich is also great. Ive got it in a bundle for like 1,5 euros so its a steall.Even so the game has it's own bugs like enemies being able to hit you through objects wich is really frustating esspecialy if you are in a fight that has been going on for a while and well dying to a bug just isn't the best end to it. Tough anyway its a great chalenging game with a good story,really similiar to Dark souls so if your a fan of those kinds of games you can take it up on and try this one.It really deserves a higher rating.

												The hardest boss in the game is ""Lords of the Fallen.exe has stopped working.""  It can strike at any time in any place.I really feel I would love this game if it didn't crash every 30 mins.In general, this game has the same mechanics as Dark Souls, right down to having to fight back to your corpse to pick up your lost experience, but it is slightly more forgiving since mobs only respawn when you die, not when you rest.  The boss fights are more fun than Dark Souls by having some World of Warcraft flavor that stresses movement, positioning, and add control.  It really is a shame such a fun game has to troll me by crashing all the time.			"

I loved it, unique bosses, unique world. My impression on most negative reviews is that they expect a AAA quality game for something that was never intended to be that. If you can put lower quality aside, this game is wonderful, and very fair for the price it's worth. (Especially on sale)But! Do not get the DLC, it just adds gear that's good for maybe the first hour of the game at best. Don't waste your money on the DLC.			"

I've experienced a much harder gameplay than DS series. ..DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE..And because this game doesn't offer you any long-range weapons(except for three gauntlets),you have no choice but to face the enemies with your body....Now the server is accidentally reachable and I can finally enjoy it. So let me review this game again.The display effect is much much much more beautiful than DS, while the game still needs a lot of optimising work to make sure the work could run smoothly...(Every movement seems to be at a low speed....)As for the gaming experience. I don't have too much to say as I have just played three hours.The only point i have to made is that you need to choose your weapon wisely. Some weapon, like stuff, can make this game easier than other weapons. I think this problem may be the so called unbalance other reviews have mentioned.			"

												Lords of the Fallen is an enjoyable game that made me want to keep hacking away at enemies, searching for secrets and new weapons, and levelling my character's abilities for hours on end. The graphics are impressive and create a dark, immersive atmosphere. The combat is fun most of the time, but can be tedious when battling enemies that wield greatshields. The story is just OK, with pickups throughout the game that expand on the lore. After finishing the game, there is a New Game+ option that allows you to play through the game again with your current level and items, but this time there are a few new items that did not exist in the first playthrough.This game features GPU acceleration of PhysX for nVidia GPUs, including the ability to run PhysX on a dedicated GPU.The Souls games are better than Lords of the Fallen in most respects, but I still really enjoyed this game.

												Not a bad game, but way too short and has way too simple mechanics compared to the Souls games. Also compared to Dark Souls the enemies are much easier and boss tactics are quite simple, never had to make more than 3-4 attempts for any boss. The environments and the armor design looks gorgeous, but still, the enemies and the setting needs more variety. Performancewise even on a high-end gear it has some FPS drops and it is hard to maintain constant 60 FPS in some parts of the game. I would only recommend to buy it on a sale if you are interested.

												I definitely enjoyed Lords of the Fallen.  It took just under 15 hours to complete on my first playthrough, having missed some sidequests.  If you've never played a game like this, it may be difficult and it may frustrate you.  Even if you have played a game like this it may frustrate you. I got lost mulitple times, not sure where to go to progress, but always eventually found the way.  If you're a Dark Souls fan, you might be annoyed at some of the less polished enemy and boss patterns, but the game controls just like Dark Souls...only slower.  At least with a strength build.  Using daggers or staves make you attack very quickly.The weapons feel heavy and satifying, making combat addictive and fun, once you get the hang of it.  Audiologs, weapons, runes, and armor are hidden throughout the world to find.  You can mix and match the armor and most of it is pretty awesome looking.This game is not as fun as Dark Souls.  But it is a fun action RPG with enjoyable combat (most of the time) and high replayability.  There are faults, but I found it easy enough to push past them and have a great time.			"

												I have been playing this game nonstop. At first it was hard to accept and get into. However once you start getting through the first few bosses in the game and explore the magic mechanics in this game. It gets really interesting. I recommend this for those who want a challenge but at the same time do not want to be punished harshly like darksouls. If you always wanted to play darksouls but cannot handle the level of difficulty this game is for you. It is pretty much the same mechanics but it is way easier the more you play. Also for those who say this game was broken, I admit I was one of them who got this game when it first released. I can confirm to you now that I have been playing this game nonstop for the past few days and I have not had a single crash or any framerate drops. It works fine now so you don't have to worry about it crashing or being unplayable.Recommended.- Those who are wondering why I do not write a full detailed review with ratings, the reason is because reviews are just opinions. I do not want what I say to affect someone's decision of buying the game or not. Do not let someone's negative or postive review affect your choice of buying a game. Make your own decision.			"

												I'm  Shocked this game has mixed reviews. It is far better than what the reviews seem to indicate. Lords of the Fallen has possibly the best use of PhysX ever in a pc game. This includes  the  first Cell Factor demo that was released for the Ageia PhysX card years ago. If you know anything about physX, this says A lot. If you have a Nvidia Graphics card you are in for some great  visuals,  It's really  true Next Gen and incredible to behold.  The best way I can  describe  LOTF is it's like dark Souls, but set in a more Fantasy Realm. The Graphics are top notch  and the use of an  almost totally  physical  world  makes it move and feel Amazing. I don't think this game is harder than Dark Souls  but after about 7 hours in its really great game..			"

												From a souls veteran this is a great game. If you have beaten darksouls 2 over 20 times and beat all the dlc and want to try something along the same lines this will fill your fix. I spent 45 minutes dying over and over in one area only to realize i wasnt supposed to be there yet but i could.(sound familiar?) Although it plays much slower and it feels like the heavy weapons take days to swing  i highly recommend it.			"

												Fun, albeit dumbed down version of Dark Souls. There is dialogue with multiple options that minorly effect the game. The game runs a lot better after the two updates. I understand a third is on the way for further bug fixes and optimization. I've killed two bosses without a problem, but the game seems fun so far.			"

												If you're a fan of Dark Souls and enjoy amazing graphics like me this is the game for you! I've got a couple of hours in and at a certain point you meet the fun monster which will kill you instantly if you mess up. Given I play as rouge which means I'm as squishy as they get but still this game will give you that rush when you get threw the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that killed you 20 times :DAs for those with issues. I had them as well it's just a mather of tweaking your settings.			"

												I've only just started this, so this review will probably change, and I could be wrong about points that I make, so I'm going to apologize in advance, sorry. Also, I might spoil some enemy types that aren't integral to the story, but if you would rather figure out your own strategy against them, don't read the last few linesAnyways, so far this game is satisfying, it's truly a souls clone in combat controls and exploration design but the game does not share similar character movement, progression, speed, or difficulty. Let me explain: I feel that the game's designers decided at a very early stage in development that the souls style of studying enemy attack patterns and figuring out where to go through trial and error was what Lords Of The Fallen was going to use. But instead of completely copying the formula, as there was a good chance that it would bring more criticism than it would praise, the game's difficulty is only in learning the enemies patterns. Most enemies do not instantly kill you, and very many don't actually hit you for a third or half of your health bar. Instead they usually deal a lot less damage. Also, the game gives you the freedom of using magic in any character class a lot quicker than the souls games. The tough part, the portion of the game that I feel people will either love or hate, is that the game feels considerably slower than the souls games. Your character doesn't quite roll as fast backwards or forwards and the enemies really need to telegraph their heavy attack for you to be hinted at a safe side roll. Still, I was able to use it effectively on multiple enemies and it felt good to get my character to a green weight and feel how much quicker he was after getting used to the heft of dodging. As far as dual wielding and the long range guantlet, they are severely limited in my opinion. They have such a high risk of not stunning the enemy or taking such a long time to complete the animation that I feel that the easiest course of action is still sword and shield. I was surprised that the shotgun style blast spell of the guantlet took so long to shoot and since it recommends close range to be effective, in it's current state I have never sucessfully used it.I have unlocked 4 spells for the warrior class and while I have benefited from using them in certain situations, since they share from the same mana pool as the guantlet, take a while to cast, and have a considerably longer cooldown, I rarely use them outside 1v1 encounters with tougher enemies. They really haven't helped me with crowd control. I can say that the guantlet's piercing spell has saved me a couple of times, though. As for the crowd control, areas stay clear of enemies that you have killed until either you are away from them a significant amount of time (could possibly also be distance from the area), or when you die. Enemies will then respawn and you can kill them all over again. The trade off with healing and hoarding XP is explained pretty early on. You can heal and refill potions at red rocks scattered through the map. They have floating stones around them that represent the amount of potions they can fill and those have a cooldown, so the game promotes your progression forward and finding the next checkpoint rock. Also, you can choose to fill xp into either spell or ability points, with the trade off being the more xp you carry, the more rare the loot drops are. There is also a smith that will let you enchant items with gems if they have sockets. It will also let you bet xp into the smithing process to coax out more valuable gems. The story itself did sort of a poor job explaining why you are doing what you're doing at the start. It really just throws you into fighting tutorials as Harkyn, and doesn't explain for a few hours why you're just killing a bunch of monsters. When it is explained by Kaslo, a monk you're following, it really is as simple as kill the monsters or we die. There is a lore tab in the menus that explains more in detail what you are doing, and pieces of that lore are picked up as scrolls during the game. I can't say much of the story right now outside of the obvious, you fight lords, you die, they die, it's fun. That's all I can really type for where I'm at in the game but here's a tip for minimizing damage with most of the dudes with shields, the doggies, fatty sniper, and the circle-strafing rogue: The sprinting shield bash has stunned 99% of the humanoid enemies, and it almost always leaves room for a follow up attack. Use it on the dog like creatures, it knocks them like 10ft from where it connects. The fat sniper recovers pretty quick so after the follow up I make some space with the backwards roll and shoot him with the piercing guantlet, with the right timing, that's like a third of his health.

												I can recommend this game. I'm on the last boss, 10h of play. It crashed the first time I booted the game and once 7h in. Only those two crashes, so it's playable. The performance is really bad, poor framerate, but the game is pretty.The second boss really bored me, but the game got better (and easier) as it went on. It's no Dark Souls by any means, maybe not worth the full price, but a good game in the end.			"

												Allegedly a Soulslike, Lords shares more of its pedigree with Darksiders, and not especially in a good way. The narrative is heavy-handed and intrusive, controlling your progress through the game rather than contributing to it. There's very little in the way of discovery and nearly everything looks dark, stoneworked, and samey. There *are* a lot of convenience options, which is nice, but not enough to overcome the fundamental lack of interest I felt while playing this.It's a rare sin when a game bores the player not just during a particular section, but the whole way through.Finishing Lords of the Fallen was like finishing a whitebread and boiled potatoes sandwich; you just sit there and wonder why you kept going.You just sit there and wonder if perhaps you have a problem.

												Don't expect it to be exactly like dark souls, just because it uses similar gameplay ideas. It admirably tries to make a game that isn't a straight up clone, but turns the souls games into a genre that this also sits in. It provides interesting new twists of familiar mechanics. For instance attacks can be timed with perfect intervals for lower stamina usage and performing combos that otherwise don't get triggered. As you kill enemies, you build up a multiplier for xp and loot and using a bonfire-equivalent resets it. That makes for an interesting choice where even for a new area, you might not want to refresh yourself but keep your multiplier instead.The fighting style of this game is slower than souls games and it's not as widely varied in how many different types of playstyles are fully supported. You'll find some options that are offered to be inconvenient and not totally viable, but plenty are, and all the common options like big-sword-guy or shield-guy or daggers-guy are all perfectly doable, with the game being easier or harder by player choice by wearing heavy armor or light gear.For full price I can see how it could have disappointed some people in the obvious comparison against dark souls. But especially at it's current price point, it's worth the time and money investment for sure.			"

												To be totally honest, the best description I can give is ""It's a worse dark souls"". The guys took a challenge to copy a praised series and they fell in the more obvious trap: they didn't innovate enough.There's no boss or mechanic that you go like ""Oh wow, that's really cool"", most things are ""alright"" and some are actually bad. If you have the money and nothing else to play I would say buy it, it's not a bad game.			"

												Fun game that plays a lot like Dark Souls. The graphics are great, but it has a lot of crashing issues unless you turn off certain things. The art design is intricate but not as original as Dark Souls, neither is the plot, which is brief without having the same complexity as a Souls game. It's a good substitute for when you are feeling the itch to play a slow paced action RPG and have already played all the ""Souls"" series.			"

Later on got more hooked and most likely will play it more - different class. The dominating part of this game is the gameplay and graphics. Story was not that great - in my opinion. Looks/feels like a Dark Souls ripoff.Short version: - Story meeeh... - Graphics good - Gameplay best part of the game - Animations okay.  - Can we very difficult - Leveling system - Puzzles okay - Voice acting - Horrible - Varity of choices - which was niceI do recommend the game but only if discounted. Not worth the 20€.xTzharkz [Eric].			"

												I haven't completed the game yet but I really like it. It seems like the perfect middle ground between a normal RPG and Dark Souls.The big problem though, and I mean BIG problem, are the crashes caused by this game which are unlikely to ever get fixed at this stage. You'll know thier sting when you get the Beast down to it's last few hits and then the game freezes. That literally just happened to me about 2 minutes ago.It's not the first time it's crashed, there have been many.. but never at such a pinnicle moment before.I have crashed more times than I have actually been killed in LotF. Unless you're prepared to troubleshoot a list of 30 possible fixes for this game's problems with no guarantee any of them will work, expect it to crash from time to time.TLDR: It's worth playing but get it on consoles if you can to avoid issues.

												I did not like this game at all in the begining, but i kept playing for the gorgeous graphics and slowly i began to like it more and more until i was hooked.The difficulty will seem a bit off and overdone in the first part of the game.The ""trick"" to overcome most difficult situations is to observe carefully and look for patterns, openings in enemy defenses and such.The rest is putting a modicum of effort into carefully reading and understanding the stats and what they do, then experiment a bit.....and die a lot without getting frustrated (arguably the biggest challenge of this game).Im not a big fan of challenging games that are challenging for the sake of it, and this is not such a game.In this game i managed to build my character in a way that suited my playstyle and bring it to my difficulty comfort zone towards mid-game, after that it was almost too easy even for a casual like me.People complain that fights against shielded enemies are long....very wrong, all fights are short, even the boss fights, if they take too long, you need to experiment some more.If you are willing to invest a bit of effort, the rewards are great: superb graphics rich in detail and effects (needs a strong pc), a decent story, exciting boss fights, great variety of weapons and armors, decent amount of secrets to discover and last but not least an impressive variety of fight styles and strategies.I usually dont care much about how the character looks but the weapons and armors in this game are jaw dropping, and the heavy weapons and armors look and feel really heavy. Ive never had such an enjoyable experience playing a heavy fighter, ever.The game crashed about 10 times in 50 hrs of play (much more often after the last patch) but updating to the newly released beta drivers fixed this issue for me.All in all i highly recommend this game, its a real gem both visually and gameplay-wise.

												Deep and rewarding combat system with a lot of things to be mastered (and discovered) with patient dedication. It's NOT a DS clone and offers a different enjoyable and fluid CS requiring practice (many combos with 1-2 hands to learn for every weapon). Highly replayable offers MUCH more than you think at a first glance (hints and secret mechanics).Very nice gfx and sound.Must have for brave old-schoolers.			"

												Just wanted to give a review on this to help people who are unsure about it. Overall the game is very good. The presentation and gameplay are top notch. It all feels hand crafted and it looks as though a lot of love has gone into it all. The difficulty curve is very good. If you're struggling with a particular enemy type early on then change your tactics. This is all you realise as you play through. Some guys have huge shields so using your sword might not be the best approach. Try some long spear pikey thing to piece the shield and all of a sudden your doing damage again. Same with armour. You can totally change the way you fight from moment to moment. So...Dark Souls. Yes it's similar but so are most video games in general. compare Battlefield and COD...compare Silent Hill with Resident Evil....compare Ridge Racer to Mario Kart (maybe not that one... :)) All i can say is that LOTF is it's own game despite the similarities. After an hour or two it's clear this is no copycat. they have taken some of the greatest bits of Dark Souls and used them to craft their own world. You can feel the strong influences from the guy who worked on The Witcher. The enemies, armour/weapons, environment do really have a great look to them. And then there's the lighting...WOW!! Only complaint so far: Random crashes happen every hour or so. Also...could do with a torch in places...If you love Dark Souls that much then stick to that. This isn't Dark Souls, nor does it try to copy it. This is a game for gamers who can appreciatte good games...simple. :)			"

TL;DR: Dont expect Dark Souls, but if you like Dark Souls you might like this game, too. It has a more traditional approarch to storytelling and a different, slower combat system. These things arent better or worse, but some people might be upset about that. In the first part of this review I will list the differences to Dark Souls, after that I will tell you what I think the game does good and bad.Differences to Dark Souls:- combat is slower and less responsive, which isnt a bad thing. In Dark Souls when you press attack, your character immediately attacks, even with heavy weapons. The heavier your weapon the attack costs more energy and also your character needs longer to recover after an attack before you can dodge or attack again. In Lords every attack, even with light weapons, has a wind-up kinda. So when you press attack, your character starts swinging his sword so the attack hits the enemy very late in the animation and after the animation your character has a long recovery time before you can block again, but you can attack very quickly after the first attack. Because of this making combos is much more effective in Lords than in Dark Souls. Another difference is that you can dodge ANY time while you are attacking, which means you can also cancel your attack animation.- dodging is different. In Dark Souls when you dodge your character ""jumps"" away very fast (depending on your gear). While you are dodging you are invulnerable for very short time even if the enemy attack hits you. In my experience with Lords there were 2 situations were dodging behaves different. When you are in a defensive position and the enemy attacks and you dodge, chances are he will hit you 90% of the time unless his attack is really slow, especially because your character rolls much slower than in Dark Souls, even with light armor.But when you roll after an attack or while you are in an attack animation, your character will start rolling immediately and chances are you character will dodge the enemy counter-attack easily.The best way to play (this is just my experience) you should block when you are defending, and dodge when you are attacking. - loot is different. In Dark Souls every weapon is useful, because they are balanced against each other. There are boss weapons and rare weapons, but those are harder to upgrade and can only be upgraded 5 times, whereas the normal weapons can be upgraded 15 times or 10 times. So you could complete the game even with the starting weapons.In Lords however you find weapons which are simply better than your previous weapons. Its like Diablo or Borderlands.This isnt necessarily a bad thing, however it decreases the amount of variety of the game, because every play will use the best gear he finds and fits to his character stats, but in Dark Souls every player uses a different weapon, a weapon he likes because of its moveset or look. The bad thing about this is that despite this there is much less weapons and armor in the game, so there is EVEN LESS variety. This isnt a huge problem though, but its important.- the checkpoint system is different. When you save at a checkpoint, enemys wont respawn and not all of your potions will be replenished. Every checkpoint can only give you a maximum of 4 potions back and you have to wait for the checkpoint to recharge. Enemys only respawn when you die or when you go to a different region (basicly every loading screen). This is worse game design than Dark Souls imo, but that doesnt mean its bad. An advantage of this is that the game is less frustrating (if you are someone who gets frustrated) and also they compensate for this by not replenshing all your potions at checkpoints as I explained.The Good:-  good level design . Dark Souls-esque level design with focus on exploration, shortcuts to previous regions and sometimes alternative ways. However the leves arent that big and mostly you are walking along corridors.-  good art-style . Unique art style which is really nice to look at and even if they dont have THAT much variety in the design of weapons and armor, its never boring to look at this game.-  great graphics . Looks great and has okay system requirements. Last patch fixed most crashes and game runs even better.-  good bosses . Mostly humanoid bosses, but interesting nonetheless with different attack patterns and unqiue ways to kill each boss for unique loot.-  good combat system.  I explained this at the first section of this review.-  good next game + mode  when you start next game plus you can select an additional spell tree, so you still make progress on your second playthrough (unlike Dark Souls where you have almost everything after your first playthrough), however there arent new enemys like in Dark Souls, old enemys just become stronger.The Bad:-  small amount of variety. The art-design of the game is great, but it doesnt change that much. most weapons look similar, most armors look similar and most locations look similar.-  a little bit back tracking might annoy you.  Sometimes you have to go through locations you already visited. I personaly had no problems with this, because it doesnt happen too much and sometimes they change things up a bit. But some people might be annoyed by this.-  too easy.  The game was challenging, which is good, but it wasnt hard. The more you continue through the game, the better you get and the game gets easier and easier. I killed the last 3 bosses on my first try. Normally the fact that the player gets better is a good thing, but the game has to offer NEW challenges and harder challenges so the player is always challenged. Maybe this isnt a big problem, especially if you consider that I am a Dark Souls veteran, so for non-Dark Souls players this might be hard game.-  forgettable and unnecessary story.  Because of the more traditional approach I expected a good story, but the story is so forgettable, the game would benefit if they just cut out the story entirely and only keep audilogs and side quests and dialouges. At least then you would have less interruptions and could decide yourself how much you want to learn about the world. Conclusion: Lords of the Fallen is a GREAT game with minor flaws. This is especially impressive if you consider that this game is made by a small german developer studio and still has great production value. I wouldnt pay 50€ for this game, but I dont pay 50€ for any game anyway. For me its worth 30€, I do not recommend this game to people who have to button mash and need simple controls to enjoy a game. Button mashing will be punished in this game, which is great. Also you have to be patient.			"

												It's basically Dark Souls with much better graphics and toned-down difficulty. Still, Lords Of The Fallen is a great game.It took me about 17h to complete and the game crashed only once, so I guess I was lucky :)+ Stunning graphics.+ Runs smoothly, 60fps@1080p all the time, all maxed.+ The combat is simple, yet stellar, with a feeling of weight. + Decent length.+ Armor design is superb, they look seriously badass!- Too easy. The bosses in particular.- The boss design is boring, practically every boss is a dude with a sword etc...- Clunky animations, especially the characters.- Not much to explore, the game is much more linear than f.ex. Dark Souls.All and all, Lords of the Fallen was a good game and I can recommend it to anyone who likes the whole Dark Souls - style of gameplay and genre.8/10			"

Product received for free
												If you enjoyed Dark Souls, there is some chance that you will enjoy Lords of the Fallen as well, although you might find them too easy and shallow when compared to any part of DS.If you like the concept of Dark Souls but are also a casual scrub and cannot make it past the asylum demon, Lords of the Fallen is the game for you.In short, it is much easier, much less demanding, much less complex version of Dark Souls. These games share similarities such as storyline which makes absolutely no sense, or the combat system, which is actually very good in LotF, although when compared to DS it might seem a bit more clumsy - you will often fight enemies in small rooms or narrow corridors, your character is a bit less mobile than in DS, the animations are usually longer and there are less enemies that you will have to face simultaneously, which in my opinion is the exact thing that makes thsis game easier than Souls. The bosses are also well developed and varied - some of them are just a challenge for your combat skills, while the others require you to use some special mechanics in order to defeat them.So, if you read it all and made it this far, it probably means that you are really interested in getting that game. Just do it. You're not going to regret.			"

												Great game in it's own right. Combat is very well done. Each weapon has weight and works out exactly like you would expect it to. Graphics are really nice but needs a patch to fix the memory leak. Story is decent, voices are well acted. The best is the combat by far though. It really has the ""OOMPH"" that the Dark Souls game severly lacked.I want to add a few things. There are quite a few bugs in this game that are downright game killing. A couple of the weapons have added procs that when they go off will crash the game about 80% of the time. The small ""dogs"" that are on fire and roll towards you will cause the game to crash at times. Enemies can and will disappear through walls, there's no hit detection on anything except enemies. The game is NOT optimized well to run on PC. While running the game with 4gb of Vram my memory will shoot up upwards of about 80-85%. My cpu will skyrocket as well. Anywhere from 20% all the way to about 70% depending on the area. While this game was supposedly made separately from consoles it's hard to tell as you get hints telling you to use triggers or bumper buttons.    While I enjoy the game a lot, there's quite a bit going on in the background that is killing this game outright. At times when fighting enemies you'll even hear an ""error"" sound but nothing happens. Almost like there's a window behind the game alerting to something going wrong.   All in all, a good game that needs a couple of patches to iron out the wrinkles. If you're on the fence about this one I'd give it til at least the Steam Winter Sale to see if it drops in price and has been fixed appropriately.			"

												I'm very much enjoying this game.  Think it's actually more difficult than what's written and i've beat Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, and about 75% through with DS 2.  Having a ton of fun with this game...They need to fix instability issues and I'm running an overpowered top tier Origin rig built for gaming.  I think they can and will fix them.I do recommend this game.			"

												If you enjoyed Dark Souls, there is some chance that you will enjoy Lords of the Fallen as well, although you might find them too easy and shallow when compared to any part of DS.If you like the concept of Dark Souls but are also a casual scrub and cannot make it past the asylum demon, Lords of the Fallen is the game for you.In short, it is much easier, much less demanding, much less complex version of Dark Souls. These games share similarities such as storyline which makes absolutely no sense, or the combat system, which is actually very good in LotF, although when compared to DS it might seem a bit more clumsy - you will often fight enemies in small rooms or narrow corridors, your character is a bit less mobile than in DS, the animations are usually longer and there are less enemies that you will have to face simultaneously, which in my opinion is the exact thing that makes thsis game easier than Souls. The bosses are also well developed and varied - some of them are just a challenge for your combat skills, while the others require you to use some special mechanics in order to defeat them.So, if you read it all and made it this far, it probably means that you are really interested in getting that game. Just do it. You're not going to regret.			"

												I wanted something challenging, but not as frustrating as the Dark Souls series.  This is a great balance of challenge and fun that I think most people would enjoy.  It also seems that most of the issues that people were having problems with at launch have been resolved with patches.  It has a tight, clean interface and the combat is a blast.  You'll die plenty, but the game gives you ways to wager risk/reward.  I'm really enjoying this game as I hoped I would.  It deserves more than mixed reviews imo.  I'd give it a solid 4.5/5 stars.

YouTube™ Video: Lords of the Fallen Review 

			Views: 322		

			Is Lords of the Fallen just a Dark Souls clone or is there more lurking beneath the surface? This is my first attempt at a 1080p/60 fps video. Let me know how it looks in the comments below.		

In the past year I’ve become a big fan of the Dark Souls series. After several unsuccessful attempts starting the first Dark Souls, both on Xbox 360 and PC, I finally dug my heels in and found an entry point into the infamously difficult action RPG. I moved on to Dark Souls 2 after finishing the original and spent many hours exploring the world and leveling my characters. Eventually my interest waned and I moved on to other games. Even though there was new Dark Souls 2 DLC, I’d become burned out and needed a break.Cut to a few months later and I started to see footage of a new Souls-like game called Lords of the Fallen. The game looked beautiful and was an unapologetic Dark Souls clone, an action RPG with tight combat mechanics, high difficulty, and punishing bosses. Lords was positioned as a western version of the Japanese Souls series and looked to move into the specific niche carved out by Demon’s Souls, Dark Souls, and Dark Souls 2. As a fan of these games I was immediately intrigued. How does Lords of the Fallen compare? Is it a true successor to Souls series or is it just a pale pretender?Developers Deck13 Interactive and CI Games have delivered a game built from the ground up to appeal to fans of Dark Souls. If you’ve played any of the Souls games you’ll be able to pick up and play immediately; there’s even a control scheme that matches that found in Dark Souls, save for a few minor differences. Rather than going through all the ways Lords of the Fallen is similar to Dark Souls, I’ll highlight some of the most interesting ways they differ.The first major difference you’ll notice relates to the character you play. In the Souls series, there are no set characters. You’re responsible for choosing the way your character looks and there are no clear backstories. In fact, the story in the Souls series is largely opaque, with a few hints here and there. In Lords of the Fallen you play as Harkyn, a former prisoner with a troubled past. Although you can still customise your playstyle with creation choices, everyone experiences Harkyn’s story. This streamlines the story but also serves to limit your role-playing possibilities.When starting a new game you choose class and magic type. Class determines starting skills, armour, and weapons. Magic type is a little misleading, as your magical powers are closer to special combat abilities rather than specific types of spells. Every magic type enhances combat, whether by weakening your enemies or strengthening your attacks. There’s no option for a pure magic user, for instance, as the game is specifically tuned for melee combat. What magic there is supplements hand to hand combat rather than replacing it.This focus on hand to hand combat means that fights are slower and more deliberate. Even fights with low level enemies can take a minute or two to win. Shield-bearing enemies are everywhere in the world and they take up the most time; unlike Dark Souls, where you’re able to break their guard and attack during the opening, the shielded enemies in Lords of the Fallen recover quickly and don’t offer many attack opportunities. Thankfully you’re given a gauntlet that can fire magic projectiles and this soon became my go-to method for dealing with frustrating shields.Lords of the Fallen streamlines the gameplay formula set in Dark Souls. This makes for a generally easier, friendlier experience. One of the most tedious aspects of Dark Souls relates to running back after dying during a boss fight. Bonfires are normally not right next to the boss. This means you have to struggle your way through groups of enemies in order to have another go. Lords does away with this frustration and typically places checkpoints right next to boss areas. You can also bank experience at checkpoints and then spend it later.In general, Lords of the Fallen is a much more linear game, and that’s both a strength and a weakness. I prefer the open world of Dark Souls and the nebulous character motivations. I like having the option to try a different route or move to a whole new area if I’m stuck. The bosses in Lords of the Fallen, the titular Lords, are also pretty unoriginal. Mostly heavily armoured knights with shields, there are no bosses on the massive scale seen in the first Dark Souls. While there are different patterns and stages to their attacks, most boss fights are grindy and tedious.Some of the game’s mechanics are poorly communicated. I was halfway through the game when I realised some walls could be broken by dashing into them while holding up your shield. The health potion replenishment system could be clearer as well; sometimes I’d have them all refilled when saving at a checkpoint and sometimes not. I later discovered this was regulated by how many enemies you killed between checkpoints; there might’ve been a tip explaining this, but if there was I missed it.The story in Lords of the Fallen is much more transparent than those in the Souls series. There are dialogue trees and clear quest objectives. I had a much better idea of what my character was doing and where the story was going. That said, I didn’t necessarily know where I needed to go. I lost track of how many hours I spent backtracking, looking for that one door I hadn’t opened yet or struggling to find an obscure corridor. There aren’t that many different areas and some of them are ridiculous mazes with similar paths that blur together.On a more positive note, Lords of the Fallen looks beautiful, with great lighting and animations; it’s definitely got Dark Souls 2 beat. However, my biggest gripe with the visuals is the inconsistent camera. Several times I found myself losing my character into first person mode by getting too close to a wall in combat.Ultimately I enjoyed Lords of the Fallen; however, there isn’t as much replayability for me when compared to Dark Souls. You’re limited in character creation choices and there’s not that much difference between a cleric, a warrior, and a rogue. There are extra boss challenges that’ll reward you with a special weapon if you complete them but some of these are exceptionally difficult and don’t interest me that much.I beat the game once in about 20 hours and then again in New Game+ in another 10 hours or so; I had a lot of fun playing through the first time but NG+ wasn’t that different. The combat kept me coming back but at a certain point the enemy scaling outpaced my own and I stopped having as much fun. The interminable backtracking also wore me down; there’s only so much time I want to spend running around a circular room.Playing Lords of Fallen made me appreciate the Souls series even more; it’s been enough to whet my appetite for another Dark Souls 2 playthrough, and an attempt at the new DLC. I’m looking forward to Lords of the Fallen 2; hopefully Deck13 Interactive and CI Games will deliver a game with wider scope and more interesting bosses. Until then, there’s always the endless appeal of Dark Souls.			"

												EDIT2: About 2 hours after I made that edit I walked through a door to a new area and I immediately fell through the floor and died. I then repeatedly respawned at the start of this area constantly dying unable to do anything so basically now my save is completely ♥♥♥♥ed until the fix this.EDIT: Now that I've gave the game some more time I have to say I think it's actually not as bad as I first thought. If I'm playing a character in the heaviest armour using the heaviest weapon then of course my attacks are going to take half an hour to wind up. The game is actually quite satisfying once you get used to the combat and appreciate how it isn't exactly the same as Dark Souls. There appears to be a lot to do and there are many different new mechanics that do build upon the Dark Souls Genre. I don't think the game is perfect but I do think it's a good start in what hopefully is a long line of good Dark Souls like games.OLD REVIEW ( If you like Dark Souls I wouldn't automatically assume that you'll like this game. While the combat is similar it's not exactly the same as Dark Souls. Dark Souls combat is quick. This combat feels like you're playing as a sloth that is covered in treacle who's just woken up from a year long slumber. A sloth that has to wait for the enemy to use that one move that has a long enough recovery time to actually get a good attack in without being staggered.It's okay but I wouldn't really recommend it.)

												Do not be fooled by ""mixed"" reviews, this game is good, and you will most certainly enjoy playing it, if you are even remotely into this genre. There still are some bugs, but nothing game breaking, and story is a little thin, but other than that, very enjoyable fight mechanins, pretty graphics, and reasonable difficulty, are more than enough to recommend this game.

												★★★★☆This was a really cool game, I don't understand all the negative reviews, I have never played a Dark Souls game so I cannot compare it to that but the game as a title by itself was quite fun (after getting the hang of it). There is quite a big difficulty gap with enemies and bosses, but the game becomes real easy when you figure out you can just spam your potions whenever you want to as long as you can get back to a save location before you'd die. I would definitely recommend this game to my friends and anyone who enjoys a difficult 3rd person game :) 4/5!On a side note I heard from a few people that the game crashes alot but the game never crashed on my system.

												Protagonist Harkyn is a badass roided-up mofo who kicks the Rhogar around like the little bee-yotches they are. In addition to being an awesome dude, this guy even has gott daym tattoos of his sins on his face. Good luck getting a job after saving the world, Harkyn.Shtloads of secrets to discover and gets you hooked. It really turns on that ""swiggity swooty I'm comin for dat booty""-mode on in you and man, you just hunt the crap out of the dozens of treasures buried in the game.Combat is slow and feels heavy, bigass weapons bangin against each other and slowass dudes trying to do something resembling dodging.Story could be better presented but who needs one when you can just whack the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of demonic dudes because reasons.On scale of ""good"" to ""awesome"" I give this ""assblasting fun"". Best thing from Poland since Zubrowka and cheap women.			"

												Lords of the FallenFirst off i wanna say that i went into this without any real expectations. The game was gifted too me by my brother who is a huge dark souls fan. After spending a dozen hours with the game i have too say I am quite impressed. I am basing this review on my own experiences and not those of other people. I can recommend this game due too the fact i have had none of the crashes and hardships that everyone else has been having. I will list some pros and cons for the game and then a final verdict. Pros:-Gorgeous graphics, some of the best ive ever seen in an adventure game. -Combat is fluid and takes timing, gives you a sense of accomplishment-Loot and more loot-Replay value, if you love collecting everything and wanna get 100% complete there is lots too do here-Soundtrack is spot onCons-Enemy types become repetitive-Some framerate issues -Camera can get a little in the way sometimes due too linear corridors-Voice acting is mediocre at best and lip synching is terribleSo overall I found the game too be engaging and fun. Not the best action rpg i have ever played but surely not the worst. A great battle system and sense of urgency keeps you on your toes as you traverse this world in search of a new peice of gear and formiddable foes. 7/10			"

												i am big fan of 3rd person action adventures (fantasy or modern), and liked LotF a lot+great viduals+awesome art and level design+solid combat, that requires timing and patience (its not combo-heavy, but button mashing doesnt work either)+crashed 2 times in 50hrs, path 1.4 (1 crash was due to low VRAM when i tried ultra textures)+had no FPS drops on i3 4.5Ghz and GTX760, all maxed except tetures and turbulence+nice bosses, but battles with them are fairly short, and are mostly about dodging the bad stuff and wait for oportunity to strike+NG+ and NG++ with new items, lore and much more challenging (you can free roam after NG++)+you loose all gathered EXP and EXP multiplier when you die (but you can save the game without loosing it)-if you are not ""explorer"" type, fairly short (8-10hrs maybe)-story was there, but wasnt anything memorable or thrilling (all the little twists were kinda obvious)-no quest log of journal (or i missed it?)-some kind of teleporting between locations would be cool, at least the major ones-many ppl are reporting crashes, not sure if this was prior to 1.4 issue, but i did not have problem+- singleplayer only (what i dont really mind, but some ""hardcore"" Dark Souls fans might miss MP (but seems that most of those hate on any other similar game anyway)Dont expect Dark Souls game, this is easier, simplier but on the other hand more immersive and beatiful looking game (that wont make you eat your pad out of frustration)			"

												So, despite the rumors and vids that i heard and saw, i still bought that game. I have to say that i don't regret it. Yes, the game has its flaws, but which game hasn't? The bugs and the major performance issues didn't show up in my playthrough. (could be because of all the patches the developers released). In fact, i never had any FPS drop down below 55 on ultra settings and didn't had any gamebreaking bug or CTD.There are only some problems i have with the game. First, the overall length of the story. It is waaay too short for that kind of game. I didin't rush through the campaign nor did i miss any side quest. I did everything i could and explored every dungeon. For that 16 hrs are too few. The second problem is the Lore. Yes you can read a bit about the Lore in the codex and you find audio notes here and there, but the explanation is way too vague and you are just thrown into a world you have no idea of. You get way too few infos about any character not even your own. A shame actually, because the world seems pretty interesting. Thrid and final problem i had is the lack of quest informations and the vague explanations of quest locations. I guess it is a bit like Dark Souls in that regard, but it wouldn't have hurt to actually have a list of all open quests. I can live with the lack of map or questmarkers, but a chance to reread what the open quests are about would be helpful.As you can see i recommend the game so there has to be something positiv about it right? :) There is. The fact that they shamelessly copied from Dark Souls pays off. The combat is breathtaking and you really have to be strategic to defeat the various types of enemies and bosses. The boss battles are hard, but still fair. The different weapon types all feel completely different. Every weapon has its own story and unique look. Armor as well. The weight and energy system is as good as in Dark Souls. Do you want to be the fast dodging skilled fighter with two blades or more the heavy armored Tank who wields a huge axe and tower shield? It's up to you. You can even be both or a mix in between ;) Oh well and the graphics look badass. So overall, I can say that i quite enjoyed the game and might start a NG+ sooner or later. If you didn't buy the game till yet and you really want a game that is a little easier than Dark Souls then buy it :)			"

												I can only reccomend this game!Sure, it is no Dark Souls 1 in terms of the world, the difficulty, the atmosphere and the sheer amount of complexity and content. BUT, when you look at this game by itself, its very good. Some points that are worth mentioning:- The combat is amazing. All weapon types handle very differently and you have a lot of choices on how to engage and deal with enemies trough combos, leap attacks, rollattacks, parries, counters etc.- The itemsystem and rpg element of the game is very solid. The different types of armor and shields offer a nice variety and whilst the character leveling is rather straight forward, you can still develop a unique playstyle.- The leveldesign is top notch, the world feels like a maze where you always find new paths, secrets and shortcuts.- Although the artstyle feels somewhat generic, I really enjoyed the atmosphere of a rough nordic world mixed a world, that reminds you of diablo1.- The story was decent. The dialouges sometimes felt a bit cheesy, but I liked the plot and the audio logs.In the end I would say the overall quality of this game is a bit worse than dks1, but better than dks2! Regarding technical issues: I had several problems with crashes and freezes that were really annoying, but the game is completely stable with patch 1.2 for me now. "

												It was a really fun game and was my first experience at challenging ARPGs. I must say though for a $60 title it was very short in terms of content. I got 13 hours out of a single playthrough and was left wanting more. One thing I also disliked was the fact that you could tell the game was progressing very quickly because it seemed that in no time at all you were onto the next boss fight with no kind of down time or build up between them. I know what I said is very negative so far but wait. The combat which has to be the highlight of this game is EXTREMELY satisfying. That fact that I started out a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ player and slowly progressed and got better and better really made me feel good and helped me feel like my character was actually getting stronger. The story in this game wasn't too bad but wasn't really fully explained in my opinion. It felt very open ended when I finished the game but the audio logs that are left around the world that help you discover the story are a very nice touch. I absoloutley love the art style in this game but maybe a few less spikes on all the armour would be nice. :p Overall though I'd give this game a 7.5/10 and anyone who is looking for a game similar to dark souls but a bit easier and more of an entry into tough ARPGs, this is the game for you.

												Lords of the Fallen has a somewhat dented learning curve: unless you're a veteran of the Dark Souls franchise—which I'm told LotF emulates—you'll probably find the combat pretty challenging in the beginning, to say nothing of taking down the first boss or two. But once you develop certain magical skills, the difficulty drops almost to the point of tedium (for me, the skill that did it was ""Stab"" on a rogue, and to a certain extent, ""Shift""). Most common opponents suddenly pop like soap bubbles, and as soon as you learn to evade the most damaging boss attacks, the big guys no longer pose nearly as much of a threat as they're probably meant to do. And since the story is dark fantasy boilerplate with ciphers for characters, even the admittedly gorgeous visuals can no longer make up for the fact that your sole incentive for plodding through the game is the prospect of finding shinier toys in the next chest. That ain't much. I'm by no means saying LotF is a bad game, especially if you can get it during a sale, which is why I'm still recommending it. You may well get a few hours worth of fun out of this title. Just not enough fun—or challenge—to last to the very end of it.			"

												A few technical problems with this one. If you are using an AMD graphics card, this game will likely slow down or run at sub optimum. The specs required are higher than suggested. It isn't super stable.That said, this game is a solid experience. Like many people, I will compare it to Dark Souls since they fit in the same niche. This game is an odd blend of Diablo style leveling & loot collection (everything is randomized), and Dark Souls combat.  You can technically pick a class, but very quickly these have little to no difference, beyond the cleric having a heal. Weapon stats, damage, and speed are all random so a pair of shortswords can do more damage than a two hander, and be slower. You have a stamina bar, health, a limited number of health potions that refill at rest points, a block, parry, heavy attack, light attack, and roll. The art personally reminds me of the chunky comic book style from Darksiders, so a big plus. It does repeat the Dark Souls 2 problem of most enemies being some variation of ""guy in armor"", but they all look impressive, and the rarer non-human enemies are quite cool. The story is pretty standard fantasy fluff, and isn't going to under or overwhelm anyone. For 20$ or less, you are getting 10+ hours of solid game to slake that thirst that -for me- only the Souls series really fills.			"

												So, despite the rumors and vids that i heard and saw, i still bought that game. I have to say that i don't regret it. Yes, the game has its flaws, but which game hasn't? The bugs and the major performance issues didn't show up in my playthrough. (could be because of all the patches the developers released). In fact, i never had any FPS drop down below 55 on ultra settings and didn't had any gamebreaking bug or CTD.There are only some problems i have with the game. First, the overall length of the story. It is waaay too short for that kind of game. I didin't rush through the campaign nor did i miss any side quest. I did everything i could and explored every dungeon. For that 16 hrs are too few. The second problem is the Lore. Yes you can read a bit about the Lore in the codex and you find audio notes here and there, but the explanation is way too vague and you are just thrown into a world you have no idea of. You get way too few infos about any character not even your own. A shame actually, because the world seems pretty interesting. Thrid and final problem i had is the lack of quest informations and the vague explanations of quest locations. I guess it is a bit like Dark Souls in that regard, but it wouldn't have hurt to actually have a list of all open quests. I can live with the lack of map or questmarkers, but a chance to reread what the open quests are about would be helpful.As you can see i recommend the game so there has to be something positiv about it right? :) There is. The fact that they shamelessly copied from Dark Souls pays off. The combat is breathtaking and you really have to be strategic to defeat the various types of enemies and bosses. The boss battles are hard, but still fair. The different weapon types all feel completely different. Every weapon has its own story and unique look. Armor as well. The weight and energy system is as good as in Dark Souls. Do you want to be the fast dodging skilled fighter with two blades or more the heavy armored Tank who wields a huge axe and tower shield? It's up to you. You can even be both or a mix in between ;) Oh well and the graphics look badass. So overall, I can say that i quite enjoyed the game and might start a NG+ sooner or later. If you didn't buy the game till yet and you really want a game that is a little easier than Dark Souls then buy it :)			"

												Lords Of The Fallen is obviously inspired by the souls series. Really obvious,but the fact is that it does a very good job in creating a world and using the souls gameplay in a very good way. It is to be expected then, that you will be drawing parallels between the two. First of all is it worth the money? I would say even though there is no pvp as far as my knowledge goes (it might change latter) that it is worth the money and time to play this game. It really has been a long time since I spend 30 hours in a few days not even a week in a game such as this, the combat system is fun and challenging (not as much as the souls series) and there are enemies that will require you to really figth hard to beat them (or use magic but we'll get to that) the leveling system is also nice, one small critisism I have is that faith weapons become really weak later on, but over all it's a really well made game polished with fun staged and bosses. At this point I have to say that it is rather easier that what dark souls, demos souls or bloodborne are to the point that an experienced souls player can beat bosses on a first run without a guide (which is wild fantasy in a souls game) and thats because of what I refered to previously as ""magic"". Magic in this game or spells are really overpowered, to the point that you 3 shot a boss with a fully upgraded quake, now that doesn't hold true for the NG+ but you have to remember that unless you want a specific item for the aestherics of it and a few achivements, there is absolutely no reason to replay the game in NG+, NG++ and so on. Unless you really love the game. But appart from the no PVP problem other than that this game packs a really nice storyline with some plot twists some nice secrets, interesting gameplay especially stealthy gameplay at some points since there are enemies who can not hear you and has a few choices that matter in terms of story and gameplay (not too many and no where near as much as they do in the souls games but your choices matter non the less). So in all honesty if you really like the souls series but you are not an easily buthurt fan boy, in which case you should avoid the game and the review all together, then I can not recomment this game enough, it has really been a long time since a game had such nice aestherics in regards to the enemies the weapons the armours the effects in pretty much everything it incorporates, the gameplay is polished and works very nice the bosses have specific patters which if you don't want to abuse with spells then they make for a really nice challenge, also a thing I really like is the fact that you can use any weapon you happen to come by and by that I mean there are no useless weapons, you still need the appropriate skill to use them (dex stg etc) but I haven't found a single weapon that was legitimately useless. So over all it's an awesome under rated game that has been hated a lot mostly for the lack of PVP and really deserves your time if you are into this kind of games like I am.			"

												Gametime: 15 hoursNumber of playthroughs: 1The Good:- Beautiful, grim, dark art. Gothic in a sense with other inspirations for the more fantasy stuff.- Decent keyboard controls, only remapped 2 keys- Combat is good; forgiving for new players and hard to master for hardcore players. Parrying is difficult and optimizing stats is rewarding (but not really difficult in any way).- Sound design is nice but not awesome- Lots of items to customize with progression and unique art.- UI and interface is decent- FIghting enemies is fun but takes patienceThe Bad:- Crashes, most of which have been fixed for me with patches but some random ones here and there still exist.- World feels small and cramped most of the time. Needs more areas and side quests.- Side quests are hard to track and remember- A lot of items in the game have cryptic effects that you won't know until you read about them or really experiment and pay attention- Last boss fight was lame- New Game+ doesn't have much to offerThe Ugly:- Not much really, this game is a stone's throw away from being amazing.

												So it took me about 22 hours to finish the game on my first playthrough where developers were saying approximately 30 hours, which to me is fair but I am very familiar with this style of game and BECAUSE of my souls experience this game posed very little challenge. Once I was in a comfortable set of armor and found a weapon I liked, the game was a breeze and again little to nothing posed any real threat, I mean I one shot every boss in the game as I went through and the bosses were easily harder than any of the trash that was encountered. Now, I will mention this, this game is HEAVILY inspired by the Souls series, and rightfully so, the Souls game were so unique and so unforgiving that when I had finished them both with about 200 hours invested into each I was craving more of that Souls style combat and I found it here in spades, just not really as punishing as souls. All the people who said that this game was bad because combat was slow a clunky and the developers tried to make it hard by making enemies dodge hit and block faster than you clearly has no patience at all, they were obviously spoiled by games like Darksiders where you can litterally button mash your way to victory. Combat in Lotf is precise and deiliberate. Swinging a heavy weapon means looking for that window, taking advantage of it, and reducing yourself to the fact that you may only get the one swing in unless you use a weapon which a much faster attack speed, it's all up to the player. What I did like was that they allowed magic to be a viable option even when building a melee character without being punished for it. This is a solid game and if you are the type that enjoys weighty realistic combat, visceral environments kick a$$ looking bosses, this game will not let you down. 8/10 for me.			"

												I can recommend the game without a single doubt to anyone who liked Dark Souls series, and to everyone who wanted to like Dark Souls (a format of a game) but just couldn't since it was too much♥♥♥♥♥rape.Lords of the Fallen is a bit easier than DS in fact. Specifically it is a bit more forgiving with more frequent Save Points and more responsive combat. Moreover, you will not rage over a death because of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mechanic. The controls are as tight and responsive as they could be. The ""feel"" of the weapons and armours and that feedback is just so incredible. You can almost feel the pain when you smash someone with that great-two-handed-hammer. I think no one has done it better before.Graphics are great with amazing views and very climatic landscapes, dungeons, monsters, weapons and armour sets.The storyline is OK and interesting, the only problem would be occasional silly/stupid NPC lines.Also, this game has a lot of secrets and finding/figuring them out is very rewarding. Wandering of the main-story route sometimes takes you away for well more than an hour.Sure, it is not an open world by any chance, but it is definitely NOT a single route single corridor gaming as some major reviews claim it to be.I personally do not like the Gauntlet as an substitute to magic and I feel the game is lacking a proper mage class. Playing a cleric/warrior I as felt the cleric spells to be a bit weird looking but that's personal preference.I have not experienced ANY crashes whatsoever, the game is probably fixed by now.Check this game out! It's seriously worth it. 9-/10			"

												Lords Of the Fallen follows a character named Harkyn who is a previous criminal released by his friend kaslo to defend the world from demonic beasts. This game allows you to choose your armor,weapons,class,dialogue etc and has a story there for the people that want one and the gameplay for others that dont. Technical Issues: NONE if you want to run this game properly without crashes look at the game requirements instead of just purchasing the game because you got a new computer this game fully maxes out my new computer which i spent more than 1 grand on (ps they do lie a little bit about recomending 3.5ghz on the processor i have 3.4 and i run it on ultra so if you're planning on buying this game shortly after buying a new pc keep that in mind that you dont have to spend an extra 50 dollars or so) If you found dark souls too difficult but liked the gameplay when it worked this is the game for you.

												This game is fun for every hours you spend on it. almost every boss fight is different. For new players i suggest warrior, because warriors tend to have massive dmg reduction early game, and you wont get 1-hit kill by the shield mob. Cleric is great if you love using magic instead of melee manfight, but sometimes you still need to smash some skulls with your hammer tho. And rogues is for game+, you need to switch between shield and dagger all the time. and dagger is the best weapon for rogues in this game imo. However this game do have several bugs, the most annoying one is the combo death in one of those portals. If you die there, you will die again when you respawn, which makes you lost all the XP. But after 2nd death everything is normal again so no worry for unlimit death.The total gameplay time is about 20 hours. 12 hours if you are a hard core player.And 2 hours if you are a hacker. Ps.Do not be a hacker in games, you will lose all the fun, all of it.			"

Lords of the FallenThis game plays in a castle where demons captured a big part of it.The graphic is quite fantastic, the boss fights are very challenging and the area is free explorable, e.g. after the boss fight on the graveyard I didnt return directly to the dimension gate, I took the way back through the prison dungeon and found a really good armor set for warriors there, before I challenged the boss in the other dimension, this one was really easy in compare to the first 2, may in case of the equipment I found earlier then regular in game.The sound is really good, spoken dialogues, grand ambient sound overall.The old guys or fans will know the Legacy of Kain series for PS 1 and this title is as difficult those are.RatingGraphic: 9/10Sound: 8/10AI: 10/10Content: 9/10A game for the hall of legends.

												Wanted this game for a long time because I always wanted some ""Dark Souls"" game which wouldn't be so surreal in visuals and atmosphere. I like dark atmosphere games but Dark Souls seems too much sucked from a finger for me and has too much unnecessary surrealism.Anyways, bought it (LotF) and, I can say, I am satisfied overall. This game is a strong 8/10: not a masterpiece but once you enter it you can't exit until you've played for at least 2 hours session (was playing it for 8-10 hours sessions couple of times and still there were moments when I needed to go for a sleep/food but I couldn't because the game is actually really good and addictive), and that happens with every session till you complete the game.Story is not 10/10 but has a strong foundation and moral. Boss fights are pretty cheap and easy, even for me, who played Dark Souls for 30-60 minutes overall. Some random situations against common enemies can be 100 times harder than any boss fight in the entire game.Another great, and significant, point of this game is gothic fantasy-scandinavian atmosphere in visuals, music, architecture and battle equipment.Next one is a spoiler so take it on your own risk.The thing I can't get over with is: you (playing as ex-prisoner and highly dangerous man, kill the entire hell of demons and dark lords) are coming back to your realm closer to the end of the game. You literally save the world from hell whilst others couldn't do a♥♥♥♥♥♥and it turns out that the main enemy was by your side all the time, which is ok. But which is not ok is that the main antagonist is guarded by regular human warriors who were suffering demon invasion the entire game and were introducted to us as a bunch of suffering people who can't stand it and all gonna die soon if you do not hurry and save the world. The plot shows us that people can't do much and you are the only hope.So, closer to the end of the game, you are forced to fight them as your enemies (plot twist) and it turns out that they are such a pain in your♥♥♥♥♥as opponents. You suddenly realise that all those lords of hell and demons were NOTHING comparing to these regular human warriors because all of them are just disgusting (talking about their fight styles and fight behaviour overall) and really hard to kill.So, automatically, the question is rising: why the hell they needed some lone ex-prisoner to save their asses whilst they are more powerful than any demon in the game? Seriously, most restarts during the entire game I had at this particular part - fighting regular human warriors.This thing just makes the entire plot look like some bad joke or awful anekdote, at least for me.But, if you close your eyes on this (because, I hope, this thing is just a necessary plot twist which automatically transfered into game balance, but still I can't get why they (developers) couldn't just kill those warriors (in storyline) and replace them with new demon types or just make those people corrupted - would make a complete logic) the game is strong in its perfomance and you will like it.

Anyone else looking for a challenge in a new, dark world you'll find it here.From some of the most STUNNING graphics to visceral swordplay there is a lot to keep you busy here.For me, I like the polished easy to read menus and the armor look and feel. The rogue class is the one I went with and I'm really enjoying the speed and ferocity of the protagonist. To keep it short and sweet, if you're looking for another dark fantasy, RPG hack n' slash you've found one, and a good one at that.

The visuals are amazing, and everything about it just makes you go oo and ahh as you walk around for the first time. The mechanics are pretty polished, and like Dark Souls, you need to learn your weapons.This is just a small review on something that I've come to love.

												Lords of the Fallen is among the first entries of what I hope to be the beginning of the ""souls-like"" dark fantasy action RPG.  Like many early games in a new subgenre, it excels in some areas and falls flat on its face in others.  It ends up being a decent game that falls just short of expectations.The graphics of Lords of the Fallen is gorgeous, with fantastic and consistent art style throughout the game.  Unfortunately, the game is not well optimized, and does not run well for many players.  Some are unable to play the game at all due to constant crashing.  The developer has been hard at work releasing stability patches, so this may not be a problem in the future.  Just keep in mind that you may not get a smooth experience if you don't have powerful setup.The game offers some interesting lore, given to you mostly by audio logs found throughout the world, and a little more through dialogue.  Conversations have an awkward, jilted flow, leaving most characters dull and one-dimensional.The meat and potatoes of games of this type is the gameplay, specifically combat.  Fighting in this game is broken in both senses of the word.  The biggest problem is the fact that you lose stamina at the beginning of your attack animation, instead of the end.  Weapons in this game have great, weighty attack animations that lose all momentum the moment you get hit, regardless of how close you were to completing the attack.  This makes fighting with slow, powerful weapons infuriating.  All too many times I've attacked with a long windup for an attack, only to get hit with a piddly 2 damage from a quick enemy swipe, losing the attack and the stamina invested.    Never spam the attack button, as you will most often get hit every time, losing all stamina leaving you unable to block or dodge, all the while dealing 0 damage to the enemy.  While there is a poise stat, I have never seen Harkyn tank a hit and strike through, even in the heaviest of armors against the lightest of enemy attacks.The game gives you a variety of spells, most of which have very little use.  While a few spells offer utility, the casting animation of spells leaves you vulnerable for too long, making it difficult to justify casting spells in combat apart from a select few.  You are given a magic ""attack"" through the gauntlet item, but it is awkward to switch to mid-combat and  does little damage per point of magic usage unless you have invested heavily into it.  Because of this, combat is nearly always through melee combat.  Of note are ghosts and anything with a shield, which are difficult to manage without magic.On the other hand, combat can be broken in your favor by the inexplicably strong effect stat scaling has.  You have no reason to put anything other than a Luck rune in your weapon, since the increase of damage outclasses anything else.  Because of this, any weapon without a rune slot or without any scaling (as in, most weapons) will be overlooked.One thing the Lords excels in is boss combat.  Bosses are all unique and have segmented health bars.  With each segment you reach, the boss changes tactics or adds new attacks.  This leaves boss encounters fresh and interesting throughout the fight.  In addition, you pick up a weapon from each boss you kill.  By fulfilling certain criteria, such as taking no damage or ending the fight quickly, you will get an upgraded version of the boss weapon.  This is a welcome addition to add extra challenge if you are up to the task.All in all, Lords of the Fallen is a bittersweet game.  It ends up being a mixed experience that may be worth it if you can work past its many flaws.  Expect around 15 to 20 hours of gameplay.  Consider giving it a look if it is on heavy discount, but you won't miss much by passing it by.			"

 Warning: If you do not enjoy games like the Souls series, do not buy this game. Lords Of The Fallen has been compared to the Souls series, containing a slow tactical approach to close-quarters combat gameplay, with difficult enemies and locations to overcome.In this game, you will control a hero called Harkyn. He is a warrior with a mysterious past ready to confront an army of demons. He was release from jail by a mysterious man called Kaslo. Kaslo gives Harkyn an opportunity for him to redeem for his crimes in a mission to save the realm dominated by demons.The gameplay is really good and easy to learn. I strongly recommend to play it with a controller, otherwise, the game can be harder to play. The game uses a ""risk and reward"" system. The amount of experience the player can gain for use can be increased through a multiplier that builds up the longer the player mixes up combo attacks or avoids using checkpoints and spending their experiences.The cons that I have about this game are about the cutscenes and the camera. They could have putted more effort in the cutscenes to be more natural. Sometimes the dialog and the movements of the characters do not match, and the scenes are very robotic.The camera during the gameplay can be tricky sometimes. As an example, in a small room during a fight, the camera goes into an angle that you cannot see your character or the enemy, and this can become deadly sometimes. This event happens in rare times, but when it happens it is very annoying.If you enjoyed the serie of Souls and like new challenges, this game is a good choice for you!9.5/1O "

												How could you not like this game ???? Just finished the Worshiper boss Boss #3 he was hella funtrying to take down spent like two hours or more figuring him out. The last time I had that much fun with a Bosswas the Capra Demon in Dark Souls. WHich is one of my favorite bosses in the Souls series I also think Flame Luker and Tower Knight are fun bosses. If you are not having any fun with the controls and a mouse get a PS4 or X-box one controller and it makes everything better feels more like a Souls game then =)			"

												What a shame.. I for one really do think the game is lovely, but in its current state I can't recommend it. I wouldn't say its unplayable, but it does have some very annoying bugs (very odd fps drops, which seem completely unrelated to what goes on screen, wrong enemy hitboxes, wierd AI glitches, and so on). As I said this truly is a pity as the game is actually quite good in itself. The combat is addictive and it does have a nice, dark tone to it although the voice acting and lip-sync leaves a lot to be desired. So yeah, If it wasn't for so many technical issues I would definitely recommend it, though in its current state there is simply too much microstuttering and various stability issues going on for a game a la dark souls, where stability should be kind of a priority. FYI I didn't see many CTDs (just one in 6 hours), its just the other problems that are very annoying. Ethically I can't recommend a buggy game.. But if they fix it, this could become a hidden gem!

NOT RECOMMENDED - YETThis feels like Dark Souls made right (for PC), game is hard but rewarding.Plus it's prettyHoweverIt runs like crap. So far i only had a chance to test it out on a PC which meets ""recommended"" specifications, however the performance was-sub par.Framerate is not only lower than it should be but also tends to drop to even lower values every now and then.Many blame this occurences on Denuvo which is a DRM system, or rather ""anti tampering system"" as it is described by its creators.Generally Denuvo is a very controversial topic and if you don't know what it is - i strongly recommend getting acquainted with the topic before making the purchase.Personally i don't appreciate developers punishing those who bought their game with an overload of DRMs, however that is my personal feeling.The good-Proper PC version of Dark Souls(Graphics, controls, etc.)-Hard as hell, but rewarding-Has a lot potentialThe bad-Performance issues-Controversial DRM or just the fact that it's double DRM-Within the time i played so far, plot is not explained very well, you don't know who you are, why you are where you are. Basically nothing is explained (i sure hope that changes later on)-Poor voice acting and lip sync.-Some people encounter stability issues(crashing), besides performance problems.That is all.//Followup:Now i had a chance to ""play"" the game on my own PC. The game will crash the entire system with BSOD under a minute after i start the actual game.This only proves that performance/stability of this game is a total hit/miss roulette depending on your setup.

												In short:It's not worth the £30 I paid for it, bear in mind though, that's not to say it's a bad game, because it ain't.Graphics:Beautiful environments (most of the time you get to see dungeons), weather effects (not that many of them, but still a joy to look at them). Absolutely great design of a dark world at the edge of destruction, same goes for the enemies.Story:From what I've noticed there's quite a lot of people complaining that it was dull and uninteresting which I'd like to disagree with. It's not among the best ones though, so don't get your hopes too high either.Gameplay & DifficultyWhile I did not continue playing after finishing the game once, I'm pretty sure I have the right to say that this game is nowhere close to being as hard and unforgiving as Dark Souls. Boss battles... some bosses I actually didn't have to dodge or block at all, I entered enraged mode (Warrior Ability - *Rage*) and bashed the b**** to death.The game got (for me, obviously...) a bit too easy after a few hours of playing, jumping onto my enemies, killing them with one blow.It took me about (don't look at hours on record, I'm always pausing for long periods of time) 10 to 12 hours to finish the game.There's quite a lot of equipment which kind of ruins the nice feeling of finding something real powerful. First you find a set of armor, newer, better, so you put runes into it and then boom... you find something better after (not exaggerating) 10 minutes and you redo the whole armor-runing process.			"

												Okay. In order to truly get a good idea on what Lords of the Fallen is like, we need to look to a game called ""Dark Souls"" to explain it's gameplay. LotF sets out to be difficult from the get go, forcing the player into positions where patience is rewarded over arrogance. This would be decent enough, if not for the severe lack of content, or seeming lack of it. The game seems to suffer from a major pacing issue, and atmosphere issue, that Dark Souls does not. While Lords takes a lot of it's inspiration from the Souls series, from it's combat, to it's attempt (but ultimate failure) at recreating the frustratingly hard difficulty level of Souls, to it's story; it doesn't bring the atmosphere of severe hopelessness, and the feeling of just barely being able to trudge along into the next area of the game. The Warrior is capable of tanking so many blows it's just way too easy, the Cleric does way too much damage right out of the gate, and the Rogue is way too quick for his own good.That being said, the game is fun, it's just not what you've probably heard. It's easier than Dark Souls, way more forgiving, in a world that is attempting to recreate a hopeless environment and ultimately fails, making you feel like a total ♥♥♥♥ing badass instead of a total ♥♥♥♥ing pushover, but it's fun. I'll recommend it to anyone who enjoys their time with RPGs.For a number? How about 7/10. Solid, but could easily improve.			"

												I've played both Dark Souls games, but this was still a fun game. I've heard Strength Character is easiest, so went with agility, but it was still fairly easy compared to Souls. One slight annoyance is that the hitboxes on bosses are often off and even if I hit the boss directly in the middle of his body between animations, it wouldn't register as hits.			"

Posted: October 30, 2014
												In Short:Game is fun for the most part. The combat takes some getting used to because it is far more sluggish/slow than those who are used to the souls series. It's a pretty neat looking ascetic overall in my opinion, but the high fantasy style that seems similar to World of Warcraft, Diablo 3, or Darksiders series is getting a bit over used. The story is nothing special, but not bad either. There's a lot of lore to find, but it's told to you in scrolls and cutscenes and such, not like the Souls series where you find items and piece the lore together yourself. There are some nit picking problems like I don't find the jump mechanic and various areas to get some loot and require a jump any fun, just frustrating, but those small issues don't detract enough from the game's over all joy. The only big problem are the crashes. As of October 30th, the game crashes way too easily and often. For those who don't have an Nvidia to do that ""fix"" (which doesn't work for everyone) you're pretty much screwed until they patch it. The other issue is the frame drops which are fairly frequent (doesn't seem optimized). I'd wholly recommend it immediately if not for the crashes and frame drops. For now, I'd say get it if you're REALLY looking for a mixture of Diablo 3/Darksiders style world and Souls style combat, but I'd hold off until they finally fix these technical problems with the game.Steam seriously needs a third option for ""Do you recommend this game"" imo, basically ""Yes, with warnings"" or something.A Bit More Depth:Bosses (far as I can tell so far after playing as long as I have) aren't anything special. They're about on par with Dark Souls 2 in terms of design (which means it falls short, imo, to Demons's and Dark Souls bosses), but they are fun fights. A bit too many humanoid enemies which is disappointing, but the different humanoid types are vastly different in attack styles and require different ways to deal with which is fun. The settings for most bosses also are pretty Dark Souls 2 from my experience, plenty of room to maneuver (nothing so far that feels like Capra demon in DkS1 where you're cramped for room to move). I'd say the only real gripe here is that some bosses have some one shot killing abilities that you won't know how to deal with immediately and that can be frustrating, but I personally don't mind it too much if there are some good cues (without being blatantly told) of how to deal with it and most do have that, some are just more subtle than others.Another really cool thing about bosses is that they have the ability to get special loot from them when you beat them in a certain way. The only downside here is that there's NOTHING to indicate what that special way would be leaving you to have to look it up online or just stumble upon the solution by dumb luck (which means you might not know exactly what caused you to get the special loot).The level design is pretty straightforward as you go through the game (not much in terms of choice of path), but when you get through the game you open up more and more paths that show how there's some interconnectivity to the overall world design. For those who loved that aspect in Dark Souls, they'll enjoy it here as they get through toward later parts of the game. It's just a bit of a pity there's no real choice in path from the start in which way to go, but it's not bad from a story telling perspective and the levels look nice enough and have a good amount of interconnectivity within themselves for side paths and short cuts and such that it's never a bother (at least to me, you might feel differently).It's a bit sad you can't customize a look for your character, but that's to be expected given how they tell the story, but what is nice is how much you can customize your character in terms of armor and weapons to use. And the fact you always carry them all on you at once makes it easy to switch weapons and gear and find what you really enjoy. While it doesn't get as punishing as a Souls game because there is a pause menu that allows you to change gear, even in combat (to a degree, not at all points, but if you haven't been attacked or not attacking for a bit, you can switch comfortably as the game is paused to let you do so), it does allow such experimentation with the different weapons that you'll appreciate it as every weapon is VERY different from one another in every way and some will adhere to a person's playstyle more than others.For example: I started as a warrior, I used a sword and shield from the start and found I wasn't enjoying it as I did with Dark our Demons's Souls. The attack felt a bit too sluggish to capitalize on brief moments of an enemy's vulnerability and even though the shield claimed 100% defense, some enemies still seemed to attack through it (at a lesser damage than if I wasn't blocking) at points (far as I can gather that's more due to their attacks being able to pierce shields, so it's by design). So I have currently gone to using a larger two handed weapon that can do ridiculous damage and/or stun/stagger the majority of enemies to get through the game. I'll only occasionally use the shield for some attacks or in clutch moments. It's still very enjoyable though.To go on more about weapons, they are also upgradable by various ""runes"" you can find in the world and from enemies and have to unlock at an NPC and place within a weapon at that NPC (who can be summoned at specific parts of the world). The weapons and armor generally have 'sockets' to place these runes. So in that case, it's very WoW/Diablo 3 in the customization of weapons and less the way Dark Souls did it. The only downside is that Runes are ""unlocked' and what you get is random. You can use some Experience points to increase the chance for higher quality runes, but that randomness is still something I don't wholly like, but that's a personal opinion.Speaking of Experience points, they are very similar to Souls in the Souls games. They are your everything. You use it to unlock your magical abilities and they are used to unlock runes and they are used to gain points to be placed into specific attributes. In this way, it's a lot like the Souls games which I like. The more you spend into the points the higher the cost it is to get the point to spend for your attributes. The attributes are Strength, Vitality, Endurance, Faith, Luck, and Agility. For the most part, what each does is straight forward. Strength increases damage for larger weapons (and some small increases to equip burden), Vitality increases your HP s you can take more hits, Endurance is your energy/stamina (as well as equip burden), Faith is your magic/mp, Luck increases drop rates, and Agility is increased damage for smaller weapons and I think also equip burden, but I can't remember (haven't done anything with Agility yet). You can place points freely.You'll also need to spend experience points to get points to put into magic. Magics come in 3 types. Brawling, Deception, and Solace. You choose one at the start of the game and can't use the others at all for your first play through (I've read and heard that in NG+ you unlock a second tree and in NG++ you unlock the final tree). To go into each tree will be a bit too long with the characters I have left, but they are fairly unique from one another, but you'll never have a magic only character like in the Souls games.All in all, the game is fun and has some nice adjustments to the Souls systems (like the timing/combo system or the 'blood pools' that contains your expedience on death being able to heal you if you stay near it, but draining the experience in it, etc), but is not at all like the Souls in its overall presentation. It's a good game that's only really marred by the crippling frame rates at points and the endless crashes.			"

												I honestly have no idea why this game has such a negative image. As you can see from my played time I have experienced this game to the fullest and I loved every seccond. PROS!-The game is beautiful on max settings, I have a very powerful rig and have played a lot of games to their highest capability and I struggle to think of many games that are better looking. This is at 100+ fps at 1440p.-Runs very smooth as well, has the odd crash to desktop but that happens once in maybe 8 hours. When its running it runs great.-The asthetic of the game is great as well, the world is a little small and you repeat a couple areas with enemies just moved around but to be fair it does fit into the story. They do a fantastic job of making a dark and gritty world. Theres bodies strewn around blood all over the place and building burning. The enemies fit in with the asthetic well, they have dark demonic armor with brutal looking weapons witrh hints of fire and brimstone. They look amazing. The first boss really is a testament to this. The charactger you played (Harken) has great character design, theres lots of little touches that make him a very good character (except his voice acting, some of that is terrible) but he dosent do much talking. -The armor and the weapons, I have been gaming for 26 years and have never seen more badass armor designs in a game, I seriously mean that. Just look at this https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SgtiRB8uvsg/maxresdefault.jpg  The capes flow and move perfectly as well. Have a quick google and look through the sets you will be impressed by most of them. Some are generic and look crap though but they are very few and far between. I love the weapon designs, they just fit the world perfectly, they have such tiny details on them that add to them so well. Nice variety as well.-The main issue I have seen from other peoples reviews is the combat system. If you expect to go into this game and roll about like you can in the Dark souls series you are going to be disapointed. If you understand that this game is methodical, you plan your blocks and your rolls. If you manage your tallents and skills along with your inventory well you will be fine. Weapons are very acurate to how you would swing them in real life. A longsword you can swing several times  so you can get away with spamming and a huge Greathammer is a long slow devastating attack. You have to take into account the enemies range, the enemies abilities and if they have a shield etc. If they do use a heavy attack and guard break them, or kick them or use a spell etc. I absolutely adore the combat system. -The leveling system is actually very robust, you gain xp and can choose to put the xp into skill points or spell points. Skill points increase your main atributes such as strength agility endurance faith etc. Spell points are invested into various abilities in the spell tree you picked at the start of the game along with your armor. Which brings me to another point, it may look like you only have 3 skill trees but the armopr you pick at the start changes things as well. For example you can have Warrior with light medium and heavy armor same with Rogue and Guardian. Theres many more pros but I dont want to bore you too much!CONS!-The voice acting, every character sounds like they are speaking the words phonetically and dont actually understand the words, it takes you out of the world a little but theres very little talking which leads me to my next point. -There is very little story, its there just not very well explained. I could probably sum it up in one sentence. So I will SPOILER Man released from prison to kill big nasty demons that threaten the last of humanity, man is good at killing thus he is asked to go to their world and kill big nasty god, he kills him good then good guy is actually bad guy and prison man must kill him. Game ends-There are a few bugs, nothing massive though. For example if you lock onto a certain bosses head during a certain phase the camera clips through the floor and you can see nothing. Theres a couple sound bugs where a sound stays stuck on and audiologs sometimes have no audio but saving and restarting the game solves these issues and if you want a bity of world building you can acess the audio logs through a menu.-New game + and ++ are very limited, in NG+ theres a few new trinkets and 1 set of armor for a light armor user but not medium and heavy. That really iritated me at first but the final armors for medium and heavy look so good I stopped caring. But this is important to a lot of people and I totally understand that so be prepared for enemies to scale, a few more audio logs but no new weapons. All you unlock is a 2nd spell tree by entering NG+ and the 3rd and final one on NG++-The DLC is pretty rubbish, the main one is unlocked later into the game and gives maybe an hour of content your first playthrough but soon as you know the puzzles thats dropped down to 20mins max. The rest are weapon and armor which all look great (especially the armor) but they are starting gear and give you a tiny edge at the begining but thats it since they are soon replaced. The heavy armor is obsolete in about 10mins for example.-This is a tiny issue but I will put it anyway. The jumping is a bit crap. Theres an element of playforming in the game to reach chests with armor or hidden places etc and when you land you always do this long exagerated roll which more often than not causes you to roll off the other side of where you were jumping. But you dont need to do it often.ConclusionThis game really is a diamond in the rough, it was plagued by bugs at the start which ruined its reputation. 99% of those have been fixed. I pre ordered this game and stuck it out for 1 playthrough and loved it. I decided to reinstall it a week ago and havent put it down since. This game is, in my eyes, a masterpiece. This is obviously my opinion but hopefully thats an indication of how good this game really is. There are a lot of people that expected this game to be something different when they picked it up, hack n slash or a standard rpg etc. They were disapointed with that and gave the game a bad review because they didnt do the research or were terrible at the combat system because they were used to a fast paced Dark souls style. This game was marketed as being very similar to Dark souls, which it isnt. The game can be hard but not as hard as higher NG+ cycles in Dark souls games. All in all this game is an incredibly rewarding experience, and for £15 its a bargin. One full playthrough of full exporation will be a solid 40 hours of enjoyment. Thanks for reading guys and I hope you decide to give this gem a try. Any questions leave a comment etc il be happy to answer them.			"

												Ok so lets jus say this, if you like dark souls you will enjoy the mechanics in the game as they feel very much the same. And if you dislike the punishment and difficulty of dark souls then this may be a better fit fot your likes. The good: 1) It is very beutifull, from the landscapes to the design you can tell that a lot of effort was put into this. 2) The way the weapons feel are simply natural, a hammer is slugish yet you feel the power that goes with every strike yet a sword is fast and fluid. 3) There is tons of variety when it comes to the weapons. Now the bad: 1) The map is dissapointing, there is basically two distinct locations you travel to, the monastery and the Rhogar realm. 2) Some bosses are just crazy easy and boring, most are too alike and simply dont give you much satisfaction once they have been defeated (although there are some really cool ones who are rather difficult). 3) I have noticed in my computer that this game needs to ""warm up"" before it's ready to be played, when started the game suffers from low frames for a few minutes. Verdict: I simply loved the story (mind that a few characters are forgetable), all the hidden lore, and how this game uses dark souls mechanics to build its own world; besides a few drawbacks the game is fun and i cannot wait for the confirmed sequel, 8/10!

												I'll just say. For the first title of a new IP that is 100% a derivitive dark souls. it's great. There are some bugs and frustrations but no more than the bugs and frustrations with DS and DS2. My biggest complaint (which really is a matter of perspective) is that if you are thorough in your first playthrough there isnt any point to a second playthrough. But seriously, since when did only having 1 playthrough in a game automatically make it garbage? I honestly loved every minute of it start to finish and enjoyed it on my second playthrough as well (which i havent completed yet) because its just a lot of fun. Everything about the game feels stylish and polished. I'd recommend it and in fact have purchased it for several friends as gifts because i believe in the franchise so much!			"

												Should you try this game? Yes. Is it like Dark Souls? Sort of. (TL;DR at the end)Before I start:Many people had problems with the performance, I started to play after patch 1.4 and everything was fine, no crashes, stable framerate.First of all the grapchics are great and the combat is pretty solid, animations look realistic but sometimes you can just stick close to an enemy and avoid getting hit. Regular enemies can get hard to kill because the window between their lowered guard is little, so if you have a greatsword you may have a hard time dealing with them.Game is also more forgiving in my opinion, if you are afraid of rolling you can go with a heavy armor that can absorb a lot of damage. The third boss got me becaus I was using Dark Souls techniques and tried rolling away but still getting hit, so I equiped the heaviest gear and tanked the boss and it actually worked.There are 10 bosses, some are hard some are easy especially if you figure out their attack pattern. But the world has a lot of hidden treasures that you can try and find.If you manage to beat all the bosses in the first attempt and not get stuck and lost for a long time you can complete the game in 10-12 hours.IN CONCLUSIONIf there is a sale on this game and you like Dark Souls type games, give it a go, I don't think you will regret it.

When its running it runs great.-The asthetic of the game is great as well, the world is a little small and you repeat a couple areas with enemies just moved around but to be fair it does fit into the story. They do a fantastic job of making a dark and gritty world. Theres bodies strewn around blood all over the place and building burning. The enemies fit in with the asthetic well, they have dark demonic armor with brutal looking weapons witrh hints of fire and brimstone. They look amazing. The first boss really is a testament to this. The charactger you played (Harken) has great character design, theres lots of little touches that make him a very good character (except his voice acting, some of that is terrible) but he dosent do much talking. -The armor and the weapons, I have been gaming for 26 years and have never seen more badass armor designs in a game, I seriously mean that. Just look at this https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SgtiRB8uvsg/maxresdefault.jpg  The capes flow and move perfectly as well. Have a quick google and look through the sets you will be impressed by most of them. Some are generic and look crap though but they are very few and far between. I love the weapon designs, they just fit the world perfectly, they have such tiny details on them that add to them so well. Nice variety as well.-The main issue I have seen from other peoples reviews is the combat system. If you expect to go into this game and roll about like you can in the Dark souls series you are going to be disapointed. If you understand that this game is methodical, you plan your blocks and your rolls. If you manage your tallents and skills along with your inventory well you will be fine. Weapons are very acurate to how you would swing them in real life. A longsword you can swing several times  so you can get away with spamming and a huge Greathammer is a long slow devastating attack. You have to take into account the enemies range, the enemies abilities and if they have a shield etc. If they do use a heavy attack and guard break them, or kick them or use a spell etc. I absolutely adore the combat system. -The leveling system is actually very robust, you gain xp and can choose to put the xp into skill points or spell points. Skill points increase your main atributes such as strength agility endurance faith etc. Spell points are invested into various abilities in the spell tree you picked at the start of the game along with your armor. Which brings me to another point, it may look like you only have 3 skill trees but the armopr you pick at the start changes things as well. For example you can have Warrior with light medium and heavy armor same with Rogue and Guardian. Theres many more pros but I dont want to bore you too much!CONS!-The voice acting, every character sounds like they are speaking the words phonetically and dont actually understand the words, it takes you out of the world a little but theres very little talking which leads me to my next point. -There is very little story, its there just not very well explained. I could probably sum it up in one sentence. So I will SPOILER Man released from prison to kill big nasty demons that threaten the last of humanity, man is good at killing thus he is asked to go to their world and kill big nasty god, he kills him good then good guy is actually bad guy and prison man must kill him. Game ends-There are a few bugs, nothing massive though. For example if you lock onto a certain bosses head during a certain phase the camera clips through the floor and you can see nothing. Theres a couple sound bugs where a sound stays stuck on and audiologs sometimes have no audio but saving and restarting the game solves these issues and if you want a bity of world building you can acess the audio logs through a menu.-New game + and ++ are very limited, in NG+ theres a few new trinkets and 1 set of armor for a light armor user but not medium and heavy. That really iritated me at first but the final armors for medium and heavy look so good I stopped caring. But this is important to a lot of people and I totally understand that so be prepared for enemies to scale, a few more audio logs but no new weapons. All you unlock is a 2nd spell tree by entering NG+ and the 3rd and final one on NG++-The DLC is pretty rubbish, the main one is unlocked later into the game and gives maybe an hour of content your first playthrough but soon as you know the puzzles thats dropped down to 20mins max. The rest are weapon and armor which all look great (especially the armor) but they are starting gear and give you a tiny edge at the begining but thats it since they are soon replaced. The heavy armor is obsolete in about 10mins for example.-This is a tiny issue but I will put it anyway. The jumping is a bit crap. Theres an element of playforming in the game to reach chests with armor or hidden places etc and when you land you always do this long exagerated roll which more often than not causes you to roll off the other side of where you were jumping. But you dont need to do it often.ConclusionThis game really is a diamond in the rough, it was plagued by bugs at the start which ruined its reputation. 99% of those have been fixed. I pre ordered this game and stuck it out for 1 playthrough and loved it. I decided to reinstall it a week ago and havent put it down since. This game is, in my eyes, a masterpiece. This is obviously my opinion but hopefully thats an indication of how good this game really is. There are a lot of people that expected this game to be something different when they picked it up, hack n slash or a standard rpg etc. They were disapointed with that and gave the game a bad review because they didnt do the research or were terrible at the combat system because they were used to a fast paced Dark souls style. This game was marketed as being very similar to Dark souls, which it isnt. The game can be hard but not as hard as higher NG+ cycles in Dark souls games. All in all this game is an incredibly rewarding experience, and for £15 its a bargin. One full playthrough of full exporation will be a solid 40 hours of enjoyment. Thanks for reading guys and I hope you decide to give this gem a try. Any questions leave a comment etc il be happy to answer them.			"

												Before I get into the good, I will shortly list the bad points, as there hasn't been too many. Firstly, the game lags unexpectedly in some places and has crashed a couple of times (One resulting in a pc restart, which I thought was odd), and secondly, when replaying the game, the fact that loot isn't randomized can get a little bit boring as you begin to know what is where. However, now that I have that out of the way, I can get onto the good points.This game is a great alternative if you want a game that plays like Dark Souls, but is a more western style Action-RPG. I love the armour and how bulky everything is, it reminded me, in a way, of the first fable games, with the ridiculously large hammers that you could wield! The classes are nicely varied, and the xp system (getting xp to a checkpoint and getting larger xp modifiers for surviving while holding a large amount of xp) was very satisfying, and felt rewarding when you go on a big monster massacre and actually come out of it alive.The bosses are all very varied, and if you bother to pick up some of the extra lore, such as audio-thingies, they can be interesting to learn about too! They are all challenging in their own ways and require a certain amount of tactics to beat them. The story line itself is nice, the lip syncing and voice acting was average, but I liked the fact that you have choices in conversations, some of them actually affecting the outcome of certain situations.Lords of the fallen - 9/10TL;DR - The game has some performance issues at the moment, and I feel spoilt by randomized loot in other games when I play this, but the armour it gives you is very chunky and makes your character look like a boss. Speaking of bosses, they are varied and fun to beat, the story is also pretty good so far!			"

I could totally go on and compare it to the Dark Souls series or Demon Souls but there is no point in doing that, this game has its own style to be honest and its worth giving it a try ^_^PS: The bosses are really fun ^_^!

												I waited for this game ever since it was first announced. It looked great! Stunning visuals and it came at a time when I had just finished Dark Souls 2 and its dlc's so it was a great transition. I waited a couple of days after release before I got the game as I wanted to gauge the general feeling. I noticed that a lot of people were slagging the game off because it was ""trying"" to be dark souls. Being a genre defining game its understandable that any subsequent games in that genre will be compared but that doesnt give people right to slag it off just because it's not a good. Anyway, mini rant over. This game is very good. The graphics are stunning. At first I thought they were a littke blurry but I realised that it was just part of the art style. The combat is great. More aggressive than dark souls. Some of the regular enemies can be as difficult to get past as some bosses. In general, the game is relatively easy. There are a few hard spots that took a while to get that rhythm.  Nearly all the boss fights I finished on the first try with only 4 fights taking a couple more. The story was largely a mystery until halfway through and some if the characters seemed randomly placed. Quests were unmarked and there was even a point where I had managed to face the 5th boss before I had found the 4th. The magic was largely redundant. I only ever used one spell. Granted, I've only used the warrior spell tree so there could be others that would be useful. The magic gauntlet that is in the game seems just like an excuse to have something like a gun. Again, only one of the three modes seems remotely useful. The boss fights were fun, despite being easy. They did have an element of challenge to them to a small degree. They were well designed and imaginative in the play styles and methods of combat. I remember some people mentioning that they had lots of crashing, like every 15 mins. In the 17hrs or so of play at time of writing I've only ever had 3 crashes and all of them happened in the same place for the exact same reason. For some reason, the pc couldnt handle an exploding troll midget in this small area. If I lured them out it was fine. If I fought them in the area, boom, crash. Since then, no problems. Overall, I would give the game a solid 7/10.Pros;- Gorgeous graphics with a awesome setting- Well done combat with good balancing- The armour sets are badass- Bosses are inventive- Plenty of back story in the form of well done audio logsCons;- The story was good but the delivery could have been better. Often spent time wondering what was going on purely because of poor scripting. - Gaps in said story- Some boss battles too easy			"

												Awesome game, try to get it on a sale though, it is a little overpriced. Didn't have any issues with the game, beautiful graphics and nice playability, really like the resemblance to Dark Souls, that gives the game a ""familiar"" feel. Really great atmosphere. The only ""con"" is that the scenery is repetitive, the whole game develops in like 3 or 4 places. "

												At first I was very dissapointed with this game(becouse of lags and crashes, and boring start of game), but after patches, I've managed to overcome first 1-2 hours of game and I've noticed that I really WANT to play this game(feeling that I have not experienced for long time). The graphics are very good, design of armors and weapons is awesome, much better than in any fantasy RPG I ever saw. Gameplay and controls are similar to Dark Souls, but for me it was much easier to play this game (don't know why). Also unlike DS this game has story which is big advantage for me. The game is interesting to play and explore. The disadvantages are: still quite poor optimization (few times I experienced lags and there still were 2 crashes for a single walkthrough) and shortness (the game is very short - about 6-8 hours for me).

												I was waiting for this game for a long time and now that I have played it through 3 times I thought I could throw in a review. Though my computer couldn't handle it with full graphics but even on the lowest settings it surely looks good. I began as cleric brawler and loved the fighting mechanics from the start. First slow swings felt manly as they landed to the chest of an attacking rhogan breaking its will to fight me. As I proceeded from boss to another it felt great to find new weapons and at the beginning most of then were an upgrade. The weapons, shields and armors look unique and in my less humble opinion the designs of them are coolest thing I've seen in a while. Big plus for that! Level design is nice and places you go vary nicely but the need to go back to area visited before to get some items is always kinda frustrating. The boss fights were unique but way too easy. Only thing providing proper challenge was the last boss on my first run.First time it took me around 12 hours to beat the game and I missed most of the locked chest as I was brawling my butt around like an idiot. Second time I was deceptive rogue and it took about the same time as the first run but I found most of the secrets and third time I was again cleric with solace magic tree. It took me about 7 hours and found rest of the secrets. I felt that the game was way too short even though it was satisfying to play and I was left to weep for more.I enjoyed the story but most of the time I forgot to listen the lore items I found. They would have probably given me hints and told me what was going on in the monastery but I was kicking butt and taking names at the same time so I didn't listen.Aside from minor crashing (which seems to be fixed quite well after the patches) and little bugs I found this game to be solid 9/10 and the one missing point is because of the length.P.S. I haven't done Ng+ on any of my characters but I for what I have understood there is more items to be found.P.S.S. I did cleric twice because the achievement for way of the warrior/cleric/rogue seems to come more from the magic class taken and not for the choice of warrior/cleric/rogue. Odd but that's how It went. "

I have had issues with crashes, memory leaks, save curruptions and once the level failed to load and I fell through the map...However I still recommend this game, under the asusmption that these bugs will be fixed shortly.

												Should you try this game? Yes. Is it like Dark Souls? Sort of. (TL;DR at the end)Before I start:Many people had problems with the performance, I started to play after patch 1.4 and everything was fine, no crashes, stable framerate.First of all the grapchics are great and the combat is pretty solid, animations look realistic but sometimes you can just stick close to an enemy and avoid getting hit. Regular enemies can get hard to kill because the window between their lowered guard is little, so if you have a greatsword you may have a hard time dealing with them.Game is also more forgiving in my opinion, if you are afraid of rolling you can go with a heavy armor that can absorb a lot of damage. The third boss got me becaus I was using Dark Souls techniques and tried rolling away but still getting hit, so I equiped the heaviest gear and tanked the boss and it actually worked.There are 10 bosses, some are hard some are easy especially if you figure out their attack pattern. But the world has a lot of hidden treasures that you can try and find.If you manage to beat all the bosses in the first attempt and not get stuck and lost for a long time you can complete the game in 10-12 hours.IN CONCLUSIONIf there is a sale on this game and you like Dark Souls type games, give it a go, I don't think you will regret it.

Didn't have any issues with the game, beautiful graphics and nice playability, really like the resemblance to Dark Souls, that gives the game a ""familiar"" feel. Really great atmosphere. The only ""con"" is that the scenery is repetitive, the whole game develops in like 3 or 4 places. "

												I really like the game. Originally, it kept crashing before I reach a new checkpoint, so progession had been pretty slow. I used the internet, identitified the issue, and now the game runs fine and looks brilliant. Some advice, choose sword and shield when you're starting out. The swing speeds are much more forgiving.

												I haven't played enough Demon/Dark Souls to really compare the two so I won't.  While I've only played it for about 3 or 4 hours, I've really enjoyed it so far. The fights have been fun and the animations are really terrific.  I can't really speak very much about the story (whatever it's supposed to be). It mostly seems to involve the main character meeting a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who he, is in turn, an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to.  I have experienced a couple of CTDs so that's been frustrating... hopefully there'll be less of those after it's been patched.			"

												Great great game. Have completed the first playthrough focusing mainly on the storyline and looking forward to dual classing through NG+. A lot of resemblance to Dark Souls, wich is all good if you ask me. Just shy of 20 hours focusing on the story, there is a lot of exploring left to do in the next playthrough in terms of side quests, and extra loot. Love the class designs and equipment. If youre looking for a hack'n'slash this is probably not it. It requires some tactics but if you have played DS you will know what you are dealing with, although everyting in this games seems ""heavier"".All in all a great an gorgeous experience. 4.5/5			"

												Lords of the Fallen is a gritty, hack n slashy rpg experience. Very polished graphics although I've encountered a few mistakes graphically as well. Make sure your graphics card drivers are updated, because there are some stabillity issues with this game.The fighting mechanics feel a tad clunky at times but the 1 hit kill moves from behind look pretty awesome and the game is quite a challenge in comparison to other games in the genre. Lot of ducking and weaving is needed. The enemies and surroundings are well designed and look overall awesome. Although snowy bush copy paste # 17489776397 also occurs overall it's fun to explore in this game. I like the surroundings a lot. You can see a lot of details went into the painting of the textures for walls and rocks.What can I say, this game has my kind of ""50 shades of grey"" and for the non cutesy gritty loving hack n slash rpg fans out there this is a must.

												A surprisingly great game with some minor issues from the fairly unknown City Interactive. Amazing visuals, great gameplay familiar to anyone who has experienced a Souls game and brings some fair but slightly challanging enemies and bosses. Easily recommended to anyone who has played a souls game or just want a difficult action rpg.			"

												Despite the hate and bad reviews, I come with a positive one. As a computer hard as ♥♥♥♥ gamer, liking stories and gameplay and graphics, I can say that this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. I never played Dark Souls (I know, right, come at me haters), so because it was somethingnew to me, obviously it was hardl; and from my experience after finishing the game with Warrior - Brawler (FML HARD AS ♥♥♥♥ SOMETIMES) I can say that this one is not easy, but not hard. It is moderate. Yes, first time when you play all the fricking bosses are hard to killbut if you try new game+ then it will be piece of cake, if you built your player properly. Graphics are gorgeous with nice ambient effects and high quality textures and NVidia Tulburence makes a difference I'll tell you that. Let me tell you that this game has the most amazing soundtrack I have ever heard in my life -- and believe me, I played♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of games.I recommend this one with all my tyrant heart <3 to everyone. BUY IT. Atm, I'm at the Labyrinth and even with 120 NG+ is hard as heck. I have enjoyed every single second in this game.			"

												I bought this game as a Dark Souls for beginners but I played as a rogue, later to find out this was the hardest class. Got oneshot by pretty much everything during the first half of the game, so I was not disappointed by the lack of challenge. I enjoyed this game a lot, and would recommend it. Pros:- Beautiful game- Great bosses (most of the time)- Lots of different weapons- Decent lifespan- Enjoyable contentCons: - The story is terrible. But who cares?- Level design didn't seem very clear to me, and the fact that every area adjoins each other wasn't helping. At all. - Broken power curve. Basically, I sucked big time during the first half of the game, then I got overpowered in the latter part. But I have to admit I enjoyed it. I might not have finished the game if I'd kept on being oneshot by everything during 30 hours.- Some bosses don't have any interesting movesets and end up being not much of a challenge. I spent more time figuring out a way to deal efficiently with rhogar knights than to beat bosses like Champion and Protector...			"

												The comparison of LOTF vs DS (Darksouls) is a fair one.There are many differences, but game control is similar.LOTF is less time consuming to play through. I made it through the game in less than 6 hours, something I couldn't have come close to doing with out many more hours of practice on DS games.LOTF is not nearly as difficult, nor is it as re-playable as DS.However, I had fun with the game and the story. I just couldn't buy into it as deep as I would have had if I played LOTF before DS. LOTF is a good alternative for people who like the melee/spell caster games with a medium-ish difficulty (at the harder settings). It has a decent story and some reasons to explore, but not a lot of reward to do the exploration.I would still say that if you have some time and the money, it wouldn't be a bad experience. Likely, you would enjoy it.			"

												So... It's a Dark Souls clone. There is no denying that. But... Dark Souls is a great game... and this clone of it is pretty good too! The enemies are less varied than Dark Souls and the bosses are more forgettable, but the amount of fun to be had is on par with Dark Souls.I'm sure some people will say it's a bad game just because FromSoftware didn't make it, but they're wrong. It's a fun experience, unless you don't like dying a lot and have problems timing attacks with precision.There is a lot of narrative in this game. Since there is no character creation, you just play as Harkyn. Harkyn has conversations with people. So the game doesn't feel as bleak as Dark Souls (keep in mind when I call Dark Souls bleak, that's a good thing, but it doesn't mean Lords of the Fallen is bad, it just feels different), and it's obvious what you are supposed to be doing. There's spells in  the game too, but I didn't use them so I can't really speak as to how fun it is to use them.Overall I highly recommend. It's a fun and challenging experience.			"

												Lords of the Fallen is a beautiful game that feels like a mix between the gameplay of Dark Souls, the loot from Darksiders and the aestetics from a Blizzard game. The movement and the combat feels very responsive and the flow is very natural with each of your swings with your weapon. This game does a good job at showing off great animation, especially when you land your blows on the enemies and stagger them. The controls are easy to learn, though you can't re-bind your keys for either keyboard or controller. There are how ever, two control settings from which you can select; if the original controler scheme should not meet your standards. The game does a good job at delivering the story to you and it doesn't forcefully do so either. Every dialogue is skippable, should the story not meet your fancy. Unfortunately, the gameplay isn't very challenging and there are no settings to change the difficulity. The video options are also very lacking and should you not use an Nvidia Video Card (Graphic Card) you won't be very pleased that the game has a running PhysX that you can't toggle on and off; Making the game run awfully bad for those that do not have support for PhysX. The camera can be a bit off from time to time, but the game generally does a good job at making sure you know what's going on around you.I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a third person fantasy-based RPG. If you're into Dark Souls, you might want to have a look at the game for a casual playthrough if anything.As of the time I'm writing this review, I'm 6 hours into the game and have not yet died a single time.

												Being an somewhat of a fan of the Souls franchise, I've heard a lot of things about this game, most of them, as I've found out, untrue. Lords of The Fallen (further only as LoTF) gets a lot and I mean a LOT of flak for, copying dark souls, being way too hard/way too easy/way too clunky. Well I went into it expecting what it is, clunky souls and boy was I surprised. So let's get a few things straight.Combat - It's slow, really slow, even one handed weapons take longer than your average two-hander in dark souls, that's not even mentioning the really big stuff, this game loves its big and metal things, so much so that some weapons are so heavy in fact, you can't even use them one handed, not even with proper stats, now that's a weapon. So for you guys out there who breezed through dark souls via R1 spams, you are not going to have a lot of fun here. Certain enemies demand certain tactics, hell there is an enemy that will smash you into the ground over and over again until you learn how to parry, really loved that one. Speaking of which, yes, your usual suspects of light/heavy attacks are here with your backstabs and parries, giving the combat a nice depth, really forcing you to learn how to fight your enemies and see the openings.Theme - As mentioned above, this game goes in big, hard and metal. You can wear outrageous amounts of armour and you will be moving at the speed of snails and fat roll everywhere, BUT, you can clear the game just as well doing that as if you go for light armor and dodge everything. I've really felt powerful being able to shake off big hits as minor bother. So unlike in any other souls-like game, here, heavy armor is actually a legitimate choice and a welcome one at that, I've had unbelievable amounts of fun crushing through enemies with a 2 handed axe, effectively making some of them into a wet spot on the floor.Story - Honestly, not the strongest point, you can take it or leave it, there is plenty to know about the world and how it came to be if you choose to hunt for audio bits and bops or you can ignore them and skip through most of it, so unfortunately this one might be one of the weaknesses. It doesn't have that ""I wanna know more"" pull to it, but is still enjoyable enough as short as it is.Performance - Oh yeah, this one...yeah... clunky is the best I could put it, frame rate drops on a fairly powerful rig for today's standards, texture pop-in, few enemies joining the space program and rocketing off into space, oddly stiff and stood upright weapons, leading to more than a few morning wood jokes, you get the idea, it's not gamebreaking, but it's not quite what it should be.Overall, I'd say this game is definitely worth 20 bucks, it's difficult, but fun as it is meant to be. I can see myself clearing it a few more times to see all the secrets and find all the armor sets and challenges. So if you enjoy yourself a bit of challenge yourself, but not so much of it to be overwhelming and want to feel like a buldozer let loose in a cardboard box this might just be the game you might enjoy.

												A lot of negative reviews come from frustration of players. This is true in this game. You die a lot, more so than compared to Dark Souls. Yes the comparison is always there, but this game has its unique points to differentiate from Souls and Bloodborn series. First of, Lords of the Fallen has solid and somewhat compact storyline. Second, the map itself is not that big after you finish your first playthrough. Lastly, this is more of a story driven RPG game, you will be appreciated at the end with the choices you made throughout the game.Now on the bad points of the game, the camera system is frustrating. I don't know how many times I've died just because I cannot face to the enemy or my character somehow facing the wall while wildly swing sword. This happens mostly in narrow corridor and dungeon, so most open area fights are no problem. Next on the voice acting. For a story driven game, I would expect some form of good voice acting. But alas, the main character voice is so dry, I don't know if he is speaking just making grunts. Lastly, the game punishes you for choosing speed focus characters. If you are planning to play Rouge and sneak up enemy from behind, just forget about it. The game wants you to be heavy fat guy with shield on and walk slowly like obese person.Overall, this game is not perfect but don't expect to be like Souls series or Bloodborn. Don't expect RPG like Skyrim or Dragon Age either. This game is really for niche audiences. Most will definitely hate it coz you die in the first two fights of the game. Just like Dark Souls series, if you look past all these negative points, at the end the experience is rewarding and I, myself enjoyed it. But this is not the game that I will come back to replay from time to time.			"

												The first boss isnt very good, and by that i dont mean it is a bod boss, cause it is fun, it just doesnt do a good job of explaining how further bosses play out very well, and is by far the hardest boss till after the graveyard. the beginig of the game kinda sucks but that is just as you are learning how the mechanics work, like no iframes hitting a blocking enemy is basically getting hit (wich makes sense as you can do it to enemys) and turtles suck. after that its pretty good looks good and has bad characters who are only there for... reasons. pick it up if you want to frustrate yourself till you get the hang of the controlls and to look at all of the pretty scenery at the two locations of the game: snowy castles. i love snow areas but when i step through a portal to basically the demon realm i would rather not step out of a snowy castle just to end up at another snowy castle. end verdict: Its ok i guess, wait for it to be on sale, and the dlc is better.

												I've had some issues with crashing but fortunately they seem to have been resolved by the developer.The game plays like a heavy Dark Souls with a Warhammer aesthetic.I'm a big fan of the art direction in this game. I really love the massive armor and weapons. Almost everything in the game looks sharp and very angry.The combat is slow and clunky but it feels so good. Combat feedback is on point. Definitely on the same level as Torchlight 2, CoD, and Dishonored. It's very satisfying when you block, dodge, or connect an attack on an enemy and I really love it.Story is meh. Not really feeling the main cast or lore. Also, I feel like I get lost in this game more than I do in any other game.Still pretty good though and I'm looking forward to a more polished sequel.			"

It is pretty much a Dark Souls clone. The beginning felt really easy until the second boss, (He has a bit too much health, smacked him with long sword for 7 minutes (had a clock where I counted it) and got untill 15% health and then I choked it and died. Graphics are nice and performance is decent for my specs (on my profile) I will update this review after playing it a little bit more but so far I am enjoying the game (which rarely happens these days).

												 will start off with several facts: I am running a the followin spec: Core i5-3470 CPU8 GB corsair vengeanceAsus GTX760 2GB Direct ♥♥ II OC The game hasn't crashed at all on High settings at 1080p on my 42"" tv playing with a xbox controller. The game is really fun, I have only Dark Souls II experience in this sort of game and in my opinion DS2 was really clunky and for my taste very vague and didn't enjoy it a lot, finished it and didn't touch it again.I have clocked in 30 hours in Lords and I have enjoyed every minute - the relatively streamlined exploraion is the ONLY fault I have with the game. The combat is fine, it is really methodical and actually punishes roll and hitting from behind that every1 loved in DS. The XP system is top notch - high risk / high rewards and if you don't overjump your skill you WILL find your perfect balance.Boss fights are a bit too straight forward. Let me explain they are far from easy but anyone that applies some patience and methodical movement will beat every boss (for now haven't finished the game so can't talk 100% yet) in 2-4 tries. In my experience DS2 is ""hard"" mostly because of the extreme amount of damage the bosses do, the mechanics GENERALLY bored me. Here you got decent mechanics and the bosses do more damage than normal but not in the extreme. I'm thinking NG+ will be a different animal unless you outlevel it like I did without farming just exploring EVERYTHING on normal! I am exploring everything possible and every bonus stage and most deaths I account to judgement and lack of skill at that moment rather than controls or mechanics(those are SPOT on).Graphics - jaw dropping even on high, next week my GTX980 will arrive and I will add a comment about the very high setting. Sound design is really good and everything is fleshed out very well, the weapon to shield clunk is sooooooo good. All in all I am loving the game and will defo replay it, DS2 was my kind of gameplay my the japanese influence is just not my taste, also the extremely vague story was just blah. My thoughts on the two major criticisms the game is getting:Stability - I guess it is very personal because the game is stable and I am getting constant fps around the 40-60 mark which is great for the graphics, and SOME very rare 35s which disappear and I cannot replicate.Difficulty - for me the game is just as hards as DS DS players are alreay used to the combat style so it will seem easier to them.

												A technically inferior, but shinier Dark Souls.I'll put it simply, the game's fun, and it looks great, but there's a few things that irritate me and not in the way that Dark Souls irritates you because it's difficult.This game is difficult because of the choices made in some game mechanics, as well as small bugs that turn into big problems. One such bug is enemies turning around to instantly face you if you manage to flank them, completely negating the tactic in the first place. I'm talking about the no-animation, teleport-y kind of turning around, allowing them to immediately attack you again without giving you an opening to attack them without being hit yourself.It's also too easy to get stunlocked to death by groups of enemies. Sure, it's more ""realistic"" if one knock to the ground can immediately mean your death due to multiple enemies being able to still attack/hurt you when you're in a helpless position, but it's not at all fun, or indeed fair. If you die in Dark Souls, you know it's your fault, and you know what you can do to prevent it from happening next time. Further to the point, if you get swarmed by a group, your first instinct would be to retreat and take them on in a more tactical sense, right? In LotF it only takes a nudge for you to get stunlocked enough to suddenly get surrounded, and then you're done for, as there are no i-frames when rolling.In LotF, you're forced to play tanky and take hits, as going the light route is simply a massive handicap, due to dodging not being as refined as in Dark Souls. So a lot of the time it's luck as to whether you're going to win a fight or not, or whether the enemy you're fighting is going to poise straight through your well-timed heavy and land you on your♥♥♥♥♥for a grizzly death. So a lot of the time you're relying on your health and defense in order to survive such things, and hopefully dole out more damage to them than they can to you. Despite this, I would recommend LotF, just don't expect to be able to play like you can in Dark Souls, and don't expect the kind of well-crafted mechanics or indeed interesting lore/characters that Dark Souls is known for. Play tanky, get mad when faced with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, have fun when not.			"

												I had never heard of this game, just bought it on impulse because it looked so good.  Best buy I've done all year, so far I've had 40+ hours of pure RPG action madness fun. The game has a very steep learning curve. and is damn hard in the start but once you master your character and understand the xp system & save system & weight system; it's fantastic.  Hope these guys make more.   I see some people complain about bugs, I haven't seen anything in 40+ hours playtime that I don't see in every other game out there.  Be prepared to die a lot the first 5-6 hours, be prepared to figure things out, nothing is explained properly and the manual is total crap so you need to try things or do research, it's just the way it is.  Take it as a challenge, don't whine about it.  Once you get proper control and figure out when to use what weapons, stances, etc you're gonna have a blast.Graphics 12/10Gameplay 9/10Sound ??/10  (spotify, find some manowar)Story -10.000.000/10 (but who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥ really) "

												I never really liked the Dark Souls saga... But Lords of the Fallen impressed me. I have played for 3 hours and I enjoyed it. Works like charm, no crashes or low frame rate / drop at the time. I recommend it for those who want a slow paced adventure with beatiful weapons / armors and ambientation.			"

												Don't let your decision wether to buy this game be influenced by the ""Mixed"" status of the user reviews. Most of the bad reviews are not actually about the game, they are rage reviews by people who experienced crashes and technical issues that have for the most part been solved in recent patches and will be addressed further in patches to come. I and many others can play this game without any problems. It's just that customers who are content with a product are much less likely to write a review about it than discontent ones. I just wanted to bring a little balance to that.The game is often accused of being a Dark Souls ripoff. That's not entirely false, but it doesn't really cover what this game is. Lords of the Fallens approach to combat is basically copied from Dark Souls with a few subtle differences you will only notice after playing for a while ... and why not? Hardly any game did combat as good as Dark Souls did. And that's where the similarities end. The level design, the approach to character progression and a few other things, like UI and so forth, all that is new in Lords of the Fallen. It's still inspired by other games, like Darksiders, but most games we love build on concepts other games have introduced in the past, don't they?Another famous argument against this game: ""It is too slow"". In fact, it's not that much slower than Dark Souls. People just tend to start the game in the heavy tanking warrior kind of starting gear, which is full plate armor, and they think that's the pace of the game. As a rogue you can roll and sprint and jump all over the place in absolutely sufficient speed, believe me.The most important thing to me is that Lords of the Fallen is fun to play! It's modern in all the parts, where being old school doesn't bring any benefit: presentation, controls, interface ... but it's old school wherever it's important: the challenge, telling you only the basics and letting you figure out the rest, lots of secrets! Yes, it has a few design flaws: there's one particular move in the shield + one-handed moveset that allows for exploitation so that most enemies can be beaten effortlessly. That's Something the developers definitely have to nerf in a future patch. Boss fights are not as varied as in Darksiders or Dark Souls, though still fun an challenging they feel somewhat repetitive. Also there are neither the dramatic dialogues Darksiders had nor the intriguing lore of Lordran (Dark Souls), but what people tend to forget to mention in reviews is how much fun they had playing: I had tons of it.Objectively I have to admit that this is inferior to both Dark Souls and Darksiders, but in fact I feel much more like playing Lords of the Fallen most of the time, than I feel like playing Dark Souls. Lords gives the same challenges and emotional rewards for beating them without being as overwhelming. This game is pretty good at tying you to the computer: ""Gotta get back my experience points after dying"", ""gotta beat this boss"", ""gotta hunt loot Diablo-style"", ""gotta find the secret way to this area over there"", ""gotta find the key to this door/chest"", ""gotta grind me a new level up"", ""oh I heard I get a unique armor/weapon when I do this while fighting that enemy"", and so forth. It does this no worse that Dark Souls or Darksiders and I got to say it looks better while doing it.Important info: Although the combat works much better with mouse and keyboard than in any Dark Souls game, you're still much better off with a gamepad. In fact you can add an XBox 360 controller to the requirement list.So TL;DR, this is my thumbs up for a great, challenging Action-RPG that is best described as a blend of Dark Souls and Darksiders, with minor flaws but lots of fun to be had.Goodbye.

												Lords of the Fallen is the first ""Souls game"" I ever finished and I do not regret it one bit.It’s a bit more forgiving than the Souls games and perhaps the balance is not as immaculate at different stages of the game, but it makes up for by the share amount of fun it brings to the table and by the much lighter atmosphere is has.The game world has more colours in it, the story telling is more straight forward and level design I found enjoyable although there were a few moments where I briefly felt lost and missed a map.I enjoyed looking for the secret areas in the game, the crafting of weapons, the reward system for not saving. What I wold have liked to see in the game is a little more enemy variety in terms of tactics. Both for the regular baddies and for bosses as half way through the game I found myself just jump-bashing most enemies which got a little repetitive despite being quite fun. The mages provided a little variety (especially spirits) causing me to actually swap weapons but that was basically it. The bosses played out pretty much  similarly as well, just wait for the boss to pull off an attack with the longest cool down and strike him a few times and then retreat (repeat until dead). So little adjustments there would come a long way.The story as such is pretty straight forward with a few alternative endings. I did like the ending but would have liked to see some more meaningful choices in the game and reflections of those choices in the end. But for an action RPG this is fine.In total, I find the low metascores quite unjust. It’s a very fun title with enjoyable gameplay and solid mechanics. The soundtrack is excellent and the graphics are fabulous.In my book, this game is 80/100			"

												I've had some issues with crashing but fortunately they seem to have been resolved by the developer.The game plays like a heavy Dark Souls with a Warhammer aesthetic.I'm a big fan of the art direction in this game. I really love the massive armor and weapons. Almost everything in the game looks sharp and very angry.The combat is slow and clunky but it feels so good. Combat feedback is on point. Definitely on the same level as Torchlight 2, CoD, and Dishonored. It's very satisfying when you block, dodge, or connect an attack on an enemy and I really love it.Story is meh. Not really feeling the main cast or lore. Also, I feel like I get lost in this game more than I do in any other game.Still pretty good though and I'm looking forward to a more polished sequel.			"

												A technically inferior, but shinier Dark Souls.I'll put it simply, the game's fun, and it looks great, but there's a few things that irritate me and not in the way that Dark Souls irritates you because it's difficult.This game is difficult because of the choices made in some game mechanics, as well as small bugs that turn into big problems. One such bug is enemies turning around to instantly face you if you manage to flank them, completely negating the tactic in the first place. I'm talking about the no-animation, teleport-y kind of turning around, allowing them to immediately attack you again without giving you an opening to attack them without being hit yourself.It's also too easy to get stunlocked to death by groups of enemies. Sure, it's more ""realistic"" if one knock to the ground can immediately mean your death due to multiple enemies being able to still attack/hurt you when you're in a helpless position, but it's not at all fun, or indeed fair. If you die in Dark Souls, you know it's your fault, and you know what you can do to prevent it from happening next time. Further to the point, if you get swarmed by a group, your first instinct would be to retreat and take them on in a more tactical sense, right? In LotF it only takes a nudge for you to get stunlocked enough to suddenly get surrounded, and then you're done for, as there are no i-frames when rolling.In LotF, you're forced to play tanky and take hits, as going the light route is simply a massive handicap, due to dodging not being as refined as in Dark Souls. So a lot of the time it's luck as to whether you're going to win a fight or not, or whether the enemy you're fighting is going to poise straight through your well-timed heavy and land you on your♥♥♥♥♥for a grizzly death. So a lot of the time you're relying on your health and defense in order to survive such things, and hopefully dole out more damage to them than they can to you. Despite this, I would recommend LotF, just don't expect to be able to play like you can in Dark Souls, and don't expect the kind of well-crafted mechanics or indeed interesting lore/characters that Dark Souls is known for. Play tanky, get mad when faced with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, have fun when not.			"

												A lot of negative reviews come from frustration of players. This is true in this game. You die a lot, more so than compared to Dark Souls. Yes the comparison is always there, but this game has its unique points to differentiate from Souls and Bloodborn series. First of, Lords of the Fallen has solid and somewhat compact storyline. Second, the map itself is not that big after you finish your first playthrough. Lastly, this is more of a story driven RPG game, you will be appreciated at the end with the choices you made throughout the game.Now on the bad points of the game, the camera system is frustrating. I don't know how many times I've died just because I cannot face to the enemy or my character somehow facing the wall while wildly swing sword. This happens mostly in narrow corridor and dungeon, so most open area fights are no problem. Next on the voice acting. For a story driven game, I would expect some form of good voice acting. But alas, the main character voice is so dry, I don't know if he is speaking just making grunts. Lastly, the game punishes you for choosing speed focus characters. If you are planning to play Rouge and sneak up enemy from behind, just forget about it. The game wants you to be heavy fat guy with shield on and walk slowly like obese person.Overall, this game is not perfect but don't expect to be like Souls series or Bloodborn. Don't expect RPG like Skyrim or Dragon Age either. This game is really for niche audiences. Most will definitely hate it coz you die in the first two fights of the game. Just like Dark Souls series, if you look past all these negative points, at the end the experience is rewarding and I, myself enjoyed it. But this is not the game that I will come back to replay from time to time.			"

												*In Progress Review*Lords of the Fallen, so far, has provided me with a more accessible version of Dark Soul's famously hard gameplay.  To be fair to each game, I will try to keep comparisons to a minimum, and to judge the game by its own merits and issues.  To be concise I will divide this review into two sections.  Let me begin with things I enjoy about it:- Lords does do one or two things that, personally, I think they did better than Dark Souls.  The enemy AI is more varied and a bit more defensive.  Their move sets tend to control your character's motions and mechanics, as opposed to just hurting you.  - I like the setting of Lords of the Fallen.  Post-apocalyptic fantasy is one of my favorites, as it's a combination of two genres I really enjoy.  - Lords also is a very pretty game, I really like the design and aesthetics of it.  Mostly since I enjoy gothic stylings in my games, and Lords delivers that much in spades.  From Harkyn's armor, to the enemy designs, to the locales; all of it just drips dark fantasy.- Lords is challenging without being too challenging, you won't die as much in Lords as you would in a Dark Souls.  If you keep getting killed generally it means you just should not be wherever you are yet.  The game is gated by ""Meat Walls"" as opposed to obstructions, for instance locked doors.  Though those do occur as well.- Lords has an incredible inertia to the combat.  The weapons feel hefty, the strikes of the enemies feel powerful.  At times Lords is on-point with the combat, and you feel awesome about the results of an encounter.  The timing-based nature of combat is also a welcome adition.Now to things I'm not as fond of:- Lords needs a bit of polish, especially in just fine tuning the combat.  Occasionally you'll have a strike that should have hit, but did not.  This is just a minor sort of thing, and doesn't detract too much from the overall experience.- The lore in Lords is very flimsy.  Its there, and what's there is good, it just doesn't feel like there is enough of it.  The world is more sketched out than fleshed out.  However; the story is serviceable, and is good compared to a wide berth of games.- It seems that the Strength build is the most viable one, or at least the most easily accessible.  I'm about halfway through on a Strength run, and I dipped my toes in as a Dexterity build.  It didn't seem to be as effective.  However; I will not say any absolutes on this point, since I plan on going through the game again with a different build to test it out.Overall I recommend this game if Dark Souls caught your interest, but you can't get past the difficulty.  However; after playing through this, I recommend you give Dark Souls a try as well.			"

												Lords of the Fallen is very similar to Dark Souls.I like all of the differences to Dark Souls and Lords of the Fallen is what I hoped Dark Souls 2 to be.The combat favors blocking more than dodging, though if you're wearing the heaviest armor, fighting with 2 handed weapons and without a shield is quite viable.The character classes and stats are a manageable amount. You can pick between Warrior, Rogue and Cleric twice, once for the spells and once for the starting equipment and the combination of both determines the starting attribute points.The graphics are top notch, but it also sometimes drops down to 30fps (which max for Dark Souls btw).The art style has similarities to Darksiders, though it looks less clunky and more refined. The Warrior's heavy armor sets look bamf. The animations are very fluid.If you kill enemies and don't bank your souls, you get an XP and loot chance multiplier (capped at 2.00x).The levels are well designed so that while you traverse them the first time, you're doing loops and unlocking shortcuts and when you're done, going through a zone is very quick, so that there's no need for quicktravel. Half of the levels are very clear, but the other can be somewhat confusing, especially Catacombs etc.			"

												Honestly I'm really enjoying this game, I'm running on windows 10, with a 970 and I haven't had a crash or even a serious frame drop in the 14 hours I've played thus far.As far as the game play goes, at the start of the game, its rough, like seriously rough, the combat timing is different than what you would think, and not at the same fluidity as other games like it, but ones you get a feel and sense for it, realize that your actions have to be quick, but very calculated. (even in heavy armor, your basically a glass cannon.) I find myself enjoying it, and with the right gear, spells, and attributes, honestly you can get pretty OP pretty quick, which is a bit refreshing.  Over all it feels like a kinder version of dark souls, which leaves me enjoying playing the game instead of wanting to rage quit. I also think the graphics are really solid, If you get it for $6 USD (Halloween Sale), go for it, but I wouldn't be mad paying $20 for it.			"

												Note, that this is not a glowing recommendation. Very far from it. But Lords of the Fallen is a pretty interesting attempt at creating an aRPG that follows on the formula of Dark Souls, but with a more Enclave and Blade of Darkness feel to it. Where it succeeds it does things very well, where it fails it fails pretty hard.A lot of mechanics and even controls work pretty close to how they do in Souls series, but Lords of the Fallen is a lot more restrictive in ways you develop your character and how you play. While the game differentiates three classes, in actuality they seem to work more like variations on a warrior class - one that focuses just on pure brute force, one that focuses more on quick moves and one that focuses on mixing magic and weapons. There's only one ranged weapon you get and it can get elemental damage and the ""spells"" work more like active skills, usual to aRPGs. Those spells are quite similar between classes and if you play the New Game+ and then ++ you will be able to get all the class-specific magic spells, if you want.What feels most off about the entire game is, probably, that the game feels much more script/premade animations heavy, than Souls games and the classic Blade of Darkness. Enemies track you with absolutely perfect precision, even when they run around like crazy, unless they are in the attack animation, they can get into block or attack animations (that hit/block) even sometimes right after standing with their back turned to you (I once got hit by a projectile of an enemy that was looking in the opposite direction and lots of ranged enemies will turn and shoot without missing a beat and always hit) and most projectiles track you insanely well. All of those CAN be avoided in most cases, but they still look and feel like player input reading AI perfect creations, rather than creatures who exist in the game's virtual world. Which is very unlike Souls games, where enemies feel much more ""flawed"" in a natural way - like fighting another player, not a computer. Another huge issue of the enemies in the game is that lots of them sit in full defense mode most of the time, requiring you to wait till you can backstab or parry/riposte them, with enemies 100% controlling the rhythm of the fight. Which, more often than not, actually feels boring, because enemies rarely feel unpredictable.And the predictability even goes with the bosses. You don't learn to counter their different moves that they can mix in various ways. With most bosses, you learn one, yes ONE, pattern they will always follow, slowly but surely chipping at their health and doing the same thing over and over until they finally die. There are exceptions, but usually bosses are more frustrating and boring than any fun.What about the world and the story? The design of the levels (and there are distinct ""levels"" in the game with loading in-between, but you can go back and forth) looks good, as does the art design of most of the game, but they are actually rather boring. Especially when you realise, that even if you do explore them early and completely you will still need to redo that again and again after, because some things will just appear or change, sometimes without rhyme or reason, in them. You found a locked door behind which is just one square room with a chest and can't open the door? You will be able to get the key to it only by the end of the game. Even if you don't even need to go back there, even if the item you get isn't really worth it, there's no story reasons behind it - it's just that. And story itself is, actually, pretty dreadful and told via voice acting that ranges from passable to pretty bad. Which is sad - game actually has some potential to tell some interesting and variable stories and the NG mechanic even seems to hint that maybe something similar to Eternal Darkness replayability. But nothing like this is here and even those variables that can change the ending sometimes glitch out.Lords of the Fallen has some good ideas, it's actually rather fun to play, but it's questionable decisions keep annoying you and by the end part of the game, they can build up so you might want to drop it. Sadly, there might not be a sequel that actually improves on the game's ideas, because this was a pretty good first try.			"

												great game.  tons of fun and adventure.  a bit hard to get used to at first.  probably did around 40x attempts to beat the very first warden.  i was almost giving up tbh.... thankfully i didnt. took the time to learn, then once i got used to the combat mechanics, everything became enjoyable.

												I don't know why this game gets so much hate. This is a pretty decent and challenging game. I know there is not much variation of enemies and the story is weak, but who cares? I mean, the story isn't everithing with these kind of games. This is a Souls kinda game, but those who played the souls series before this, are the most disappointed ones, because the fights and the bosses are a bit slower, and easier, compare to the souls games, but this isn't Dark Souls! This is Lords of the Fallen. If you want to play Dark Souls, then play the Dark Souls (great game too by the way) and quit bi***ing around here.I recommend this to anybody who want some challenge and fun, because i think this is a great game.

												I noticed that there seems many of the bad reviews for this game from people complainig how similar it is to dark souls, but being easier on the dificulty and not as long. Which honestly, I dont get, its a good game on its own.This game is for those that enjoy action sword and shield fights with big bosses, honestly, if you havent played the dark souls series before but you want to try them I would even recommend starting with this game as an introduction since its easier on the difficutly while having similar mechanics and its not as easy to get lost and not finding what to do next in the main story in order to advance.The story is okay-ish and its quite unique on its own way, and the choices you make during the game have a bit of impact and do influence the ending sequence.Definetly a good game.

												Overall a great game.The combat is darksoulish although i like the animations more , they don´t look so cheap.The Story is kind of meh and cliche , you get to take few decisions on your path like kill that or let it live etc.The world is ... pretty small. Finished the game in about 23 h with dlc , compared to DS1/2 around 100h w/o dlc.  You will find yourself circling around the same areas again and again when you literally have to visit several areas multiple times due to story or rewards . Also has NG+On the other hand you can level up on every checkpoint.An interesting feature is that the more you kill without visiting checkpoint ,you will get a experience multiplierOh and the game has a lot of performance issues like HELL LOT of fps drops on a high end rig.Well It´s an enjoyable game if it were longer ,less forcen dialogs and more optimalization.Also those big shielded ♥♥♥♥♥♥s are just pure cancer when you start.

												The game itself isnt bad... not as good as dark souls but still fun and not bad. The reason I am not recomending it is cause its not playable, at least on my system got probably about 40% throught he game and ran into a spot where it just kept crashing and i couldnt get past. Sooo... yeah felt like a complete waste of my time.			"

												Lords of the fallen is a great game if you like harder arpgs where your attacks are a commitment, and timing is important. Lords of the fallen is trying to make an entry into the same genre as Dark Souls, with a lot of similarities, but also some cool differences.I have more than 600 hours in Dark souls 1 and 2. Lords of the Fallen has fun bosses, weapons, armor, and the labyrinth DLC adds a fun puzzle. As a dark souls 1 and 2 onebro, I actually think doing a level 10 LOTF run would be harder, if you are worried it will be too easy of a game, Please support this game when it is on sale, and allow for the rest of the world to enter the HCARPG market without a unwarranted fear of failure. EDIT: I did a lvl 10 run, and it was challenging, but not as much as I thought, but still very fun.Pros+ Great graphics+ Different builds play and feel different, add replayability+ You feel like a badass, but a mortal badass+ Combat is always fair, you should only die to an enemy once if you can learn.+ Bosses have interesting mechanics (not all but most)Cons- lots of people complain of crashes (not me)- World is large, and well made, but only consists of a few kinds of environments- Some combat is forced in small corridors and the camera makes this hard to see what you are doing (only a couple spots)- No multiplayer at all (Dark souls multiplayer is wierd, someone make a co-op game like this please)- Story has a canned ending with a narrator telling very similar stories. (Still better than ME3 ending)- Magic is basically a cannon with only a few good moves you can use to cheese the gameTLDR;  Dark Soulslike. Good game, but not for everyone.  Give it a chance if you like that kind of combat.			"

												I have this game a while and am only getting to play it now. I got it on bundlestars I think pretty cheap. A game having so many negative reviews usually pushes it down the list a bit. I gave it a go and it was okay but not great, but sometimes you have to stick at it and not get frustrated and by the time I got to the first boss I was really getting into it.What I've learnt is that the standard warrior tank class sucks because it's slow and boring to play. For my second game I rolled a rogue and the game was suddenly so much better. It's a much faster and slicker way to play the game. Also you need to get as much xp as possible gathered up early on as it makes things a little easier especially as a rogue. You are going to need play it for a while to settle in then start again when you know what you're doing so you have less chance of dying so you can build xp up.Some say this game is like Dark Souls and some say not. After completing Dark Souls 3 I think they are the same type of game and I would make comparisons between the two. I didnt really play Dark Souls 1 & 2 so much though.I feel a bit for the devs of this game with all negativity surrounding it because it's actually very good and very well done.Anyway, in my opinion this game is definitely worth playing. The graphics are great, the fights are satisfying, the enimies have a great look and design, there is plenty to do and the boss fights are good. To improve things I'd like to see things explained a bit better like a training mode or something that goes a bit deeper than the tutorial at the very start. Also, another couple of classes to choose from would be great as I honestly think the fun drops drastically playing anything other than the rogue.			"

												Good game, like the story; the gameplay in general reminded me a little of Dark Souls but more forgiving given youre able to use an item to reclaim lost souls without physically going back to the spot, do like the multiplier for going on without spending the currency on leveling up or upgrading gear up, bosses are tough at first but are easily figured out after first or second death, no multi-player which was a bummer but the games not so hard as to need help good time killer i got it on sale and started playing it to pass time til dark souls 3 and it was worth it.

												Lords Of The Fallen is good game even though it has it's own problems. Enemies cheat quite a lot and it's very frustrating at times. Yet, everything can be solved with patience and character becomes almost invincible in late game. Also environment repeats itself. Graphics and art style are nice. In the end this is very limited game and it can't be fully compared for example to Dark Souls. Main game took me 18 hours and the game world is very small. In addition, game is not that deep and mysterius as Dark Souls.However, I recommend this game to everyone. I enjoyed it a lot and I'm looking forward to upcoming Lords Of The Fallen sequel.			"

												first and foremost if you want to play the genre but arnt ready for dark souls this is a good starting place. It has all the elements of the dark souls series except ranged weapons, which in my opinion was good as range often made dark souls much easier, so this is kind of forced melee learning if you arnt used to it. this game is as advertised, its an easier dark souls game. This game also simplifies a lot of the dark souls non-combat mechanics such as weapons and armors dont get upgrades, but instead they have runes that can be unsocketed and resocketed as many times as you want. experience is also simplified as  you can dump all your xp at save points so that you dont drop it on death. now for my negatives about it... the game itself crashed on me 5 times, causing me to redo things (such as bosses). almost all of the bosses had some gimmick that you needed to learn in order to beat them making bosses and the occasional ledge the only ways i died. after i finished the game i looked at how other people beat some of those bosses, and apparently i missed 75% of the health potions in the game(and i still beat the game without dying more than twice to the same boss). due to gimmicks there were a few bosses that didnt feel like bosses, but instead just enemies with extra health. this game is short, if i didnt have to redo parts due to crashes my playthrough would have been about 10 hours, however if you are new the the genre this could be much longer. i also have a few issues with the combat, mainly about shields. In the souls series you can attack immediately after a block, and enemies follow the same rules as the player. In this game however there is a lag between blocking and attacking, but the enemies dont follow this rule leading to shield enemies blocking your attacks then immediately attacking you back. In dark souls 2 they addressed this problem by replacing the kick with a shield break attack, however even though this game is mechanically similar to dark souls they didnt add it in. Due to all the sheild enemies and the sheild mechanics not working the same for the player i ended up just 2 handing  weapons with lots of poise. This poise allowed me to take a hit or two while i bashed on their shield a few times causing them to recoil which allowed me to actually hit them. I didnt do any backtracking or farming, nor did i look anything up, and i say this because early on i felt like my weapons were way too weak. finding a good weapon really made a huge difference. i complain about this because you are supposed to have a choice with weapons. In dark souls weapons are a preference based on your attributes, but two weapons of the same type will do similar damage, however in this game i got a sword off the first boss and compared to the sword i ended with it dealt five times less damage. the weapons dont appear to be balanced off stats, but rather where you are in the game which allows enemies to scale poorly. the enemies in one area might die in one hit, while the enemies in another area might die in ten hits. the armors in the game also scaled weirdly as large jumps in poise and armor wernt matched with large jumps in weight. there were some medium armors that after being socketed were just better than heavy armor found in the same area. the game give you a gauntet to cast ranged shots at the cost of mana, but i found that after i got a ranged class spell i pretty much stopped using it as the class spell was just hands down better. lastly there were times that enemies attacked or shot through walls leading to taking extra that i wasnt expecting. i might play through this game again, but im going to wait a while and see if they fix the crashing bugs and some of the attacking through walls bugs. so if you havent bought this game yet, but want to eventually, wait for it to go on sale at a later time, minimally after the crashing bugs have been fixed.

												Adds some interesting things to the Souls type game. Combat is, well, plodding is the best term I can think of, especially early on. It doesn't have the mysterious feel of the world like you get in a Souls game. Lack of multiplayer seems like it will hurt replayability, though the light/medium/heavy combat styles with the three flavors of magic are different enough they may be worth trying out.I do have an issue, as other's have mentioned, with the attack window. The larger enemies are too adept at bringing up their shield and spinning around, and so the opportunity to attack feels really small, and can get frustating at times.A number of people have had crashing issue, but I have yet to see one. Runs fine on high with my R9 270X.Overall, it's a worthy effort and there is fun to be had, but it may be one to wait for a sale.			"

												Highly reminiscent of Souls games, but with a different take on a classic forumla and a different style. The devs had some interesting ideas (like the checkpoint system and boss specials) and overall the game feels like a breath of fresh air while still remaining true to its roots. The world is not quite as diverse as in Souls games, but the locations are far more detailed, with every corner having its hand-crafted feel. Of course, Lords is not without flaws, namely lack of multiplayer and a couple of bugs. It is absolutely worth playing for everyone who enjoyed the Dark Souls series.			"

												I'm torn between recommending this game, or not.  Pros: - Incredibly gorgeous graphics.-Optimized amazingly.  I don't have the BEST graphics card, but I had it maxed out and stayed at 60fps all the time.-The armor and art style in this game are incredible.  Absolutely beautiful backdrops and awesome armor.-Pretty solid gameplay, Definitely provides one hell of a challenge.Cons:-The combat is annoying ONLY because you get animation locked during attacks.  Literally everytime I died or got hit is because once you click attack it literally takes like 3 seconds to swing a big axe.  In that time as you're winding up (unable to cancel and dodge) you will get WRECKED by npcs.- Difficulty.  Yes, this is a baby to Dark Souls and a lot of people REALLY enjoy the challenge, but dang... I got stuck on the fourth boss and just COULD NOT beat it because of the animation locks, inability to dodge etc and it just got to the point where it went from a great challenge, to screw it i don't care anymore.-LAUGHABLE voice acting/mouth animations.  Holy cow.  So cliche and it's like the game was made for the korean language or something because the mouth movements don't really match what's being said.In the end, if you want a really beautiful game and a dark souls type experience, this is a great game, but sometimes the animation locks alone made me rage quit.  Once you get to a certain level however, the game DOES get a bit easier, both due to better gear and finally learning attack patterns etc.  I definitely had fun even if the story and voice acting is a little funky.Bit of advice:  Cast your prayer where they attack your double and just kill things from behind them if you're stuck!

												No, it's not as good as dark souls... But the reason you are here is because you like Dark Souls combat and progression. This implements something similar to Dark Souls 1's combat and progression system, but personally, I think they've actually done a better job with it. Also, I think the bosses I've encountered so far have been brilliantly designed.  They don't look interesting at first glance, but actually fighting each one takes a completely unique stratagy that you have to figure out as you go, which is really quite satisfying. So, if that is all you want, get it. HOWEVER, if you want the rish story and varied vistas of darksouls... well you're not going to get it. IMPORTANT NOTE: While you may be able to run this game at max settings using your current CPU and GPU, I'd take a look at your RAM.  This game eats up a lot of it.  I recommend 16GB for max settings and 8GB for min to avoid thrashing.  At 8GB on max graphics, it was clear my CPU and GPU were fine, but every now and then It would freeze for a bit.  which indicated that something was being transfered to/from the disk.  After checking the the tsk manager, I found that I was using nearly 7GB of the 8 on my computer.  Since then I have upgraded my RAM to 16GB, and it runs at a smooth 60fps now. The level design is pretty good, and IMO is better than Dark Souls 2's level design. However, level design is not the same as the visual design.  Some people don't like the visual design since there isn't a ton of definition, but I think it's fine that way.  It just means you can't play with your eye's closed. Overall, that is pretty much the theme of the game.  Stay alert.  "

												This game is a Dark Souls-alike with a much better PC port.  Keyboard and mouse controls feel nice.  While it may not measure up to the original, it is much more accessable to a PC audience.  If you are anything like me and suck with a controller, this game is a worthy alternative.  At the time of writing this, the game seems very stable and performs well, with some graphical tweaking to run at 60 FPS on my system.Bottom line: a fun and challenging entry into an emerging genre.

												Do you like Dark Souls? Well it really doesn't matter, becasue LOTF is awesome per se.It has gorgeous graphic, heck it has THE best visuals I have ever seen among all ARPGs. Everything is beautifully rendered. Every weapon or armour is easily distinguished. The BGM is also great with tons of epic feels. The combat is ""well-paced"", meaning you cannot just smashing buttons and hope to kill everything in your way. Be patient and strike only when there's a window after enemies finish their attack comboes.Overall I'd say it's one of the most underrated games in recent years. After all previous patches, I encountered no bugs or crashes during my 20 hrs playthrough. City Interactive has a record of publishing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games, but this one really turns the tide for them. I hope devs can keep the good work.8.5/10 ; recommend buy for anyone who likes ARPG.			"

												The game seems pretty fun, but I absolutely can't recommend buying this title in it's current state. I've played for 2 hours now and the game has crashed on me 5 times during that time. I have a pretty decent gaming rig and can run anything on ultra high settings. I tried dropping the graphics of Lords of the Fallen, it didn't help. Haven't seen such a horribly optimized title in a long time. It honestly still feels like a beta. I'm not looking forward to playing the same content over and over only because the game decides to crash whenever it feels like it.			"

												Edit 1/9/16:  Gave this game another shot after a bunch of patches and an entirely new PC with completely different hardware and OS.  Game still crashed after about 15 minutes.  I wouldn't bother with this, or at least try to get it on sale on a console where it's hopefully more stable.I would like to be able to give this game a proper review, but it is bugged and crashes every 20-30 minutes.  Looking around, this seems to be fairly common, with some people not even able to get into the game due to another bug that blocks them at startup, even after the patch.On the second boss, he is bugged for me so that occasionally he stands in place, but still continues his actual attacks, so while he stands there like a statue, I take random ghost damage from an invisible source.  The game crashed for me once immediately after defeating him (no credit for the victory), and once when there was one swing left.So far I've only been able to wade through the crashing to get to two bosses, both of which just have huge tower shields, and it's nothing but circle strafe and poke until you win.I will assume for the sake of the game that is has some variety in its further levels, but I won't be able to see those until the game gets into working order on PC.  This is one of those rare times I wished I had purchased on console rather than steam.			"

												 Lords of the Fallen is a weird one. It’s obvious that devs ware targeting fans of Souls games as their main demographic. While in reality the only people who could possibly fully enjoy this game are those who have played none of the Dark Souls games(yes, even DS2).I think this because, LotF copies almost every single gameplay mechanic from Souls games, which in itself isn’t bad, but unfortunately whenever a new mechanic was introduced all I was able to think about was “Hmmm, Dark Souls did this much better”. The only positive thing I can say about this game is that it made me appreciate how well designed the original Souls games actually are.For the first half of the game combat felt very clunky and slow. Some of it is because every weapon is slower than its equivalent in Dark Souls, probably because devs wanted every attack feel heavier and meatier, but I think that they overshot their goal and made it too slow. It just feels bad. Later on I adapted to LotF speed, but it still wasn’t a great gaming experience. LotF is also a perfect example that graphics aren’t everything. On the technical side this game has top notch visuals. All the effects are there - lighting, physics etc. The only place where it fails is the esthetic. It’s just soooooooooooo generic. Every piece of armor is covered spikes and random fantasy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Same goes for weapons. Devs probably just wanted every piece of gear look crazy and “cool”, but if there is no progression “boring” regular weapons to fantasy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t(and I don’t mean that in a negative way), then the “cool” stuff doesn't feel special. If everything is special nothing is. All enemies are forgettable as ♥♥♥♥, both visually and how they interact with you. So are the bosses. I will forget each and every one of them really quick.There’s no nuance to anything. There is also a story and music. Nothing much to say about those. Both are forgettable and uninteresting.LotF has a much more conventional story telling structure with a lot of dialogue and long cutscenes. But it’s just so generic and boring.If plan on playing this, but haven’t played any of the Dark Souls games, just play those.If you have played all of the Souls games and are desperate for more of the same... I don’t know. Maybe get this if it’s really cheap. "

												 This game is worth it. Some people may say it's bad or they had problems with it but its been fixed a while ago and i had any trouble with it. This game is kinda like Dark Souls, you need to fight mobs with a ''strategy'' if i can say it like that, you can,t just attack them by clickign non-stop on your mouse, you will need to parry or dodge if you wan't to stay alive. Plus, you have boss that requiery a combat strategy like Darks Souls. It ments to be ''hard'' (Depending of how used you are to this type of game). The game has good graphics and i really think it's worth a try if you like that type of game. But, you might want to wait until the game is on sale to buy it since i think it's not a game that you play 10h non-stop (i ragequitted before lol) So if you are looking for a fun RPG to play all day long, i don't think its that type of game, so u might get disapointed if you are looking for that type of game, even tho i really enjoyed it and will definatly finish it! Don't focus on the reviews that don't reccomend it because they raged too much on it or if they had trouble with it, give it a try, it's worth it :)			"

												Take Dark souls 1, slow it down at least 3x times, overdesign the ever living heck out of it, pretty it up and done you get lords of the fallen.Performance personally for me has been fine, however it does suffer from ocesional stutter, no the denuvo drm does not damage your ssd.Now for gameplay, its incredibly slow, heavy and impactful, enemies tend to get annoying as the combat is extreamly slow, this is especially true with bosses, they take ages to kill not because of their health or armor...but because how slow the game actually is, the dialog is flimsy and poorly written but who botheres with that in this type of games. the game lacks creativity as most enemies are just dudes in very detailed shiny armor swinging big sparky weapons, sure it might get old but i personally enjoyed it. however i must mention the game looks fantastic if you can handle it.I wish there was something like neutral, but i am giving it thumbs up, personally i am enjoying it, i can recommend it on sale for people who ran out of dark souls to play and need something to get their void filled in.

												Look, here's the long and short of it. I wanted to like it a lot, and I ended up dissapointed. It runs like bootybuns. It plays like Dark Souls but somehow, even more slow and grindy and tedious, and with none of the caveats or nuances that make games like that tough but fair and overall satisfying experiences. On top of this, in the beginning it's a semilinear sort of game, so if you wanna just grind the everloving crap out of your dude to make him awesome enough to not die as much, you gotta backtrack the same claustrophobic environments over and over for the handful of♥♥♥♥♥♥tier enemies to respawn.Are there fun moments? Yes.Is the game pretty? Sure, if you got the rig to run it.Story's acceptable, voice acting is pretty nice, and the overall quality of the presentation cannot be ignored, but under that thin veil of gold is the very definition of artificial difficulty- your reflexes here mean nothing as your character lethargically winds up- to late, your target swivels and wrecks your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Rinse and repeat. Boss battles are not a matter of skill. They're a matter of gear, strategy, and sheer dumb luck, and if that's your cup of tea by all means drink it- I myself tend to play games more often than not with this silly, antiquated idea of enjoying them while I do it.So if you like playing frustrating, tedious games that waste your time being the opposite of fun or entertaining, have at it. Not my thing, and if it's not your thing either, I can't reccomend this title to you in good faith.			"

												I'm always surprised when a solid game gets really awful reviews on steam, but I think in this case, it's mostly souls fans who aren't too pleased with this game taking elements from souls wholeheartedly without shame. Is it as good as Souls? No, but that doesn't mean I didn't have fun with it.+Great visuals+Good music+Combat is a watered down souls experience. Diluted souls is still excellent. If you're going to steal, steal from the best.+I actually liked the story, but I have a thing for janky euro stuff. The detailed ending was really cool, either way.-Game doesn't explain stats well at all. Took me a while to realize items I don't meet the requirements for? Yeah, it shows them as being trash. Then suddenly they're better. Bad system. It doesn't explain poise, it's hard to compare items, the rune system is awful, etc... A lot of the stat scaling is off, too.-Magic isn't explained well either. Prayer is actually ""decoy"". I'm still not sure what the point of stab is.-Enemies aren't explained well - By this I mean, enemies can be higher or lower level, or have totally different skills, but all use the same model. Wut? Seriously, you can think 'oh this combo will take this guy down' and it takes off 25% of his health instead. Because it's actually an elite.-Game world is very small and poorly laid out.Basically: It's a decent game direly missing a better translation and more polish.As an aside, the first boss is so poorly done in this game. He has a long combat string that you don't have enough stamina to handle if you're at all off balance, and you're supposed to wait for an opening - an opening that can be 30 seconds apart, and one shots you if you're too close to it. Derp. It's pretty miserable, but all the other bosses feel way more fair and less tedious. Also, if you do buy it, don't get the DLC unless it's in a good bundle.			"

												Alright, granted, there are some issues with the game at the moment. Mine also presented itself with a nice ""has stopped working"" intro, but... After I had managed to fix that and actually start up the game, I fell in love with it. The dark fantasy setting, armor and weapon designs, everything fits in nicely, and the combat is something I hadn't even dared to hope for. You see, I tried to play Dark Souls and would have probably loved the game, if only the developers weren't so damn lazy and Dark Souls' PC port wasn't one of the worst I've had the ""pleasure"" of attempting to play.For all of you who would be scared that Lords of the Fallen is unplayable without a controller, take heart. It's working just great with a mouse and a keyboard, something Dark Souls hasn't come close to even with the ""mouse and keyboard fix/mod"" whatever. I can certainly see some inspiration and there's a strong similarity here, sure, but Lords of the Fallen wins it all for me. I won't budge when a developer forces me to use a method of control that isn't readily available nor preferable for most PC gamers.Alright, enough comparing the two games, let's get to what you can expect when you pick up Lords of the Fallen. Well, I'm not that far in myself yet, so I can't really divulge too much. But I can tell you I was fighting the first boss for an hour last night (refused to use potions) and I was having a great fun. There's just one attack that seemed to be dodgeable more based on luck that anything else, which kinda infuriated me, but other than that, the game seems fair when it comes to difficulty.The melee combat is what I personally enjoy most about the game, and it's one of the main reasons for which I bought it. Another being its grittiness and somewhat beautiful art design and dark fantasy setting. Every strike you make with your weapon carries weight. It doesn't reach further than the length of your weapon, if you swing a huge two-handed axe with one hand, it puts you off balance and leaves you open for a counter attack for a while, it's really all amazing. Especially it's a hell of a change for veterans of games like Darksiders, like myself. Controls get in your blood very quickly, plus they're all rebindable and there are even many possible presets.Complaints about the game? Well... the initial ""has stopped working"" aside, I haven't had a single crash so far in over 3 hours playtime (I do tend to get quite frequent crashes on Dragon Age: Inquisition and still I think it's a great game!). I agree it is a serious problem and the developers should work their butts off to fix it asap, but it doesn't diminish qualities of the game objectively. I didn't experience performance problems either, I'm running the game in 1920x1080 resolution (my wide screen's native), with pretty much everything set on high, anisotropic filtering at 8x I think, with V-Sync on, on my gaming rig with Intel i5-4430 CPU, 8 GB RAM, and nVidia GTX 760. The game might not be the best looking game ever, but I personally enjoy the graphics and animations very much. I really miss a map though, that's a bit of a nuisance.So the conclusion, knowing what I do now, I wouldn't have minded paying full price for the game to support the developer, because they've done some excellent work on this title, finally making this type of games available to die hard mouse/keyboard users to enjoy. If you have doubts, pick it up during a sale and give it a go.Rating:Graphics - 8Sounds - 9Music - 7Gameplay - 10Overall appeal - 10Final score - 8.8			"

You take the role of 3 classes, and then 3 subclasses fighting challenging enemies either up close, or from afar with various spells. This is mostly a melee game though with very limited ranged fighting abilities. The bosses are not much harder than the regular mobs, meaning the regular mobs are challenging in their own right.

												Not worth the time. The game, 2 months after launch still crashes and has obnoxious camera angles and sway. The performance is still all over the place. The game additionally is flawed, since you can charge and charge ANY enemy over and over and never take hits while doing almost significant damage. Ever. (Shield)*EVER*This is a dumbed down, buggy unpolished sloppy attempt at recreating a souls esque game. It is not a challenge for a souls player (beat ALL bosses first try, if it didn't crash getting there, and like Souls 2 the bosses were pretty repetitive.) The crashing wouldn't be such an issue if it saved in near realtime like souls, but NO. It is checkpoint based. You killed all those enemies and your game crashes? Oh, well do it. Again. And again. And..I had 1 crash per hour and PhysX was off. The performance, HOLY♥♥♥♥♥the performance. This game is running on 30-70fps ON A GTX 970 OCd at 1080p. Do you see a problem there? Top tier card, bottom tier performance. Hmmm. Combat is satisfying when the camera isn't jerking all around the place artificially. There is additionally a lot of routes you can take when deciding what weapons you will use.If the issues were gone, I would say the game is enjoyable if you are looking for a short (10 hour short) RPG with very little mechanics and decisions (completely linear besides exploring) easier souls like game. MEH quality game, AAA hype.			"

												Not a bad game, anyone who has played dark souls or demon souls will get a bit of fun from it, but may find it below what you would expect in terms of difficulty. For example I found myself killing a boss I was supposivbly meant to leave till later on.The gameplay is solid, giving you an idea of some of the things dark souls could have done, the perfect timing system with swings to reward not button mashing, the magic isnt intrusive on combat and isnt a automatic win and enemies are both fun and can be unpredicatble.The problems being no enemies are really memorable including bosses, a lot just involve either jus the dodge-hit strategy with little deviation from their 2-3 moves, or out cheaping them, for example on boss who will spam a fire attack you wont be able to dodge really all that well, so you have to spam fire resistance items to really win just in case you get hit once.The Rune system is interesting, but could use more work, its really hardly worth your time exept for the gauntlet.The characters are really needing work, I came out of dark souls and really felt terrible for some chars, even my enemies fates. In this I really couldnt care less about any of the supporting cast or the main character, there is really nothing worth noting about them, you have: ""obvious villain"", ""The girl"" and ""The exposition spewer"" Thats abut it from a few side quests and one knight who hates you for... some reason?Altogether, I like the gameplay, the fighting works and how armour and stats really do play into your game, if just for that its worth trying it out.However the lack of good characters, enemies and overall story is a little offputting, I would reccomend you get it on deal if anything as it is still fun, albeit not worth its full price if you are looking for a challenge or a story to lose yourself in.

												Great game if you like smashing your head against a wall as you wait for your hand cannon to fire. This game is a prime example of videogame developing gone wrong. Heres why, devived into pros and cons (warning: contains mature language, because ♥♥♥♥ you). Pros:-Great graphics (thou terrible optimisation).-Weapons and armor for every class looks amazing, and feels right.-You become an absoulute badass, litterally no way to avoid it.-Loot is based on how much XP your carrying, but if you die you loose all of it (unless you go pick it back up - dont worry this game is for ""I´m an adult! - 12 year olds"".) Cons:-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly boring enemies.

												""Dark Souls"" by a smaller studio. A condensed, sprawling world full of nightmare creatures to tackle in a variety of styles, which doubles up on combat versatility. Both solid and rewarding encounters with enemies and bosses alike. It has some ridiculous visuals, due to low budgets, but it tries to hide it well, at least.Oh, you can pause the game and go to the bathroom. That's also a big winner.Steam could probably use real screenshots on the store page instead though. Just saying.

												Now, let me start off with the good. This game is fairly fun to play (which is a HUGE plus and the only thing that kept this game worthwhile to me)  and has solid combat (albeit some weird hitboxed in some places). The levels are rather well designed, with everything being interconntected by cool shortcuts.Now onto the bad, which there is a LOT of. FIrst of all, this game runs like absolute crap. On NVIDIA GTX 760, I was barely about to keep it at 40ish fps on all lowest settings. Second, this game crashes. A LOT. And this is especially frustrating because unlike the Souls games, this game only saves at checkpoints (bonfires). So, it is quite easily possible to lose 20+ minutes of gameplay after a crash. Some enemies (I am looking at you, exploding fire beasts) seem to almost always crash the game without question if you get hit by the explosion.Besides running badly, this game has some poor design decisions. Certain attacks feel faaar too fast and unpredictable to dodge with any sort of human reflexes, so you are basically forced to eat them on the chin.The difficulty feels really inconsistent. Unlike the Souls series, it really suffers from overleveling if you explore everything similar to many other RPGs. So, while the game starts off fun and challenging, if you are like me and explore everything, starting about half way through the game you will get so tanky you can just wear heavy armor and take almost everything on the chin without dodging or blocking.Addidionally, the inventory system is HORRENDOUS in this game. It uses the same inventory as dark souls, where all items are put into one huge list based on the slot they go in. And while this wasn't horrible for dark souls, it is really bad for this game as it is based on the Western style of RPGs where you are constantly getting new armor/weapons which are straight up better than the ones you had before. As far as I could find, there is absolutely no way to trash, sell, or drop old items. And while you can favorite ones you want to use, you cannot automatically favorite new ones. So whenever you get a new weapon, you have to often scroll through 30+ other ones before you can find it.The last downside of this game, is how insanely short it is. While my skill from a LOT of experience with the souls series probably made me beat this game a lot faster than the average person, the shortness still cannot be overlooked. Trying to explore and find EVERYTHING, this game took me 17 hours to beat. If I was just doing the main story, I probably would have done it in 10 or less. And with this game being relatively linear and lack of multiplayer, the replay value certainly feels lacking. CONCLUSION/ TD:DRDespite these huge issues, I have to say that I still enjoyed this. But the only reason for it is my absolutely ADORATION of the Souls style of combat (Dark Souls 1 is easily my favorite game ever made, with me putting 500+ hours into it). So if you are like me and absolutely adore this style of combat, you might find this a fun distraction despite the plethora of issues. For most people though, this game is not worth the $50, at least not until the bugs/crashes get fixed.			"

												I really wish I could recommend Lords of the Fallen, the game carries a great deal of potential and by somewhat replicating the souls series combat mechanics they have assured that at least some of the combat is satisfying and enjoyable but the truth is that for all my hopes that souls style gameplay can become a genre in and of itself Lords of the fallen is sadly not the game to do it.The most glaring issue for this game is it's shoddy release state. For a start the game is very poorly optimised, on release PhysX and Vsync options did not even appear on the settings menu and even now that these have been patched in the game still performs very poorly with either turned on and worse will run your GPU and CPU dangerously hot, Over-clockers beware this game can cause damage to your components, though its more likely your GPU will fail and crash the game before serious issues occur. Even if one simply turns off vsync and PhysX the game has a plethora of bugs including but no limited to: Weapon special attacks that crash the game Exploding enemies that crash the gameInconsistent auto-saving that can cause loss of progress or leaving the player in a position from which they cannot progress.All of these bugs will hopefully be fixed in subsequent patches but in its initial state the game verges on unplayable for a significant number of players.Unfortunately the bugs are not the game's only issue. The game's main problem stems from the developer's misconception about challenge, namely, that prolonging a fight makes that fight more challenging. Of the various enemies in the game around 50% have health regenerating abilities of one kind or another, these enemies are supposed to be challenging when they regenerate from nothing to near full health but all this really does is force the player to fight the same fight they already won over again, this saps the satisfaction from combat leaving it boring instead of challenging. This problem is exacerbated during boss battles and while I have only encountered one boss with health regen abilities many of the bosses I have faced have had some mechanic which prolongs the fight unnecessarily usually forcing the player to stop attacking the boss to dealing with smaller, low level enemies. Rather than feeling satisfaction at your mastery after defeating a boss you will instead just be glad you don't have to go through the tiresome mechanics another time.However eventually the game does become a bit more fun. Somewhere around the mid-point you will begin to find weapons that can take off a decent chunk of the more tiresome opponents health. You will be thrilled when you kill an enemy before it can heal. You will begin to realise that Lords of the Fallen is more about gear than skill and the most fun is to be had once you've gathered a decent set of tools to work with. There is certainly a satisfaction to be had as you dominate an enemy that previously caused numerous deaths but at the same time much of the sense of challenge has evaporated. Unfortunately many of the game's bugs begin to rear their heads not long after this point and your gameplay becomes a frustrating battle with CTD's.The game's art style is very much going to depend on personal preference but whether you like it or not it doesn't feel like it has much individuality. Armour, weapons, enemies and scenery could all have been plucked from Diablo 3 though with considerable improved graphical fidelity. Similarly the story will make you long for the quiet cryptic narrative of a Souls game as generic fantasy is drawled with all the emotion of a wooden plank. The character's never give you a reason to feel any kind of connection to them and you carry out the tasks demanded of you simply to progress with no care as to their fates. The game's decision to use a lead character rather than allow the player to create their own seems pointless as the character is never developed. He is generic, gruff, male anti-hero number 5677 lacking even an endearing one-liner that would promote him to generic bad♥♥♥♥♥status.All in all the game feels like squandered potential. There is a good combat system here including a few refinements to the souls formula such as the perfect hit system that From Software should take a look at. But that system is dragged down by bugs, crashes and badly designed enemies. The good news is that these can be fixed. Bug fixing and optimization and rebalancing enemies and bosses could make this game an enjoyable experience. But until then this game is impossible for me to recommend.			"

												Short, and not so sweet:This product is still in alpha phase in my opinion. Here's why:1. Game crashes anywhere from 5-20 minutes. This is a critical and inexcusable issue, and a product of this cost should not be crashing on most players' PCs. This is something would find in Alpha phase with even a halfway compentent QA or development staff.2. Product feels half finished. For what contect there is, it feels like half a game. The story is vague and generic. The characters are not even close to flushed out. The world is particularly small. What the player can do is limited. The camera angle and use in third person (the only viewpoint) is terrible at times. Your character's purpose in the world is a little too simple.I don't like to be completely negative, and there are some good aspects of the game:1. Even though the game can be difficult, it can be fun at times. The combat, although clumsy, is more or less solid and satisfying. Additionally, although simplistic, character development enhances the ""RPG"" aspect of the game, but it seems to cater to the warrior class and playstyle and punishes any other choice.2. Graphics are up to par for current gen - the gritty art style compliments the use of the various graphic effects employed. Sound effects are well done.Overall, I would only recommend the game if the developers patch the game properly and sell it for about half the price. It's not a half bad game, but not worth the current cost.			"

												Potentially purchasing a broken game. I want to say it's good, but it really isn't. A poor effort for a full release. Lots of very disappointing, annoying glitches and faults that render the game unenjoyable and potentially unplayable in some cases. Weapons disappear for no reason, the game crashes and freezes on top of very demanding specifications and disk space (powerful PC's  in order to run the game), No navigational indication other than memory and the will to explore; not even labels for the areas you are in or are about to enter (noting a majority of the quests make you travel to areas you are expected to know the location of, which is on the downright silly list). I can go on. I am very disappointed and don't recommend this game unless it is fixed and people start getting what they paid for.			"

												After having beat the game, I believe I can offer my two centsLords of the Fallen is a game similar to the Dark Souls franchise in mechanics, but lacking the charm of the Dark Souls- I never got the feeling any of my choices had an impact- None of the character's are all too memorable- The story is very confusing- The environments all get very boring, very quick- There's no real exploration, you'll eventually reach your desination by killing enemies- The enemies and bosses are all very generic (Fight humanoid enemy with a sword #5) So, why do I still recommend this game? Because, there are little things here and there that make me love it.+ The armor sets all look gorgeous+ It's insanely fun to play as a tank and smash your enemies to pieces with a warhammer+ There are little snippets of dialogue here and there that furthered my interest in the world+ While I never fully understood why Harkyn was so important, I definitely liked him and wanted him to succeed.+ I got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at certain characters and wanted to kick their♥♥♥♥♥♥in, something most games haven't acomplished.All in all, I'd give Lords of the fallen a 7.5/10. It's worth picking up if you want something to play similar to Dark Souls, or just want a good RPG to play.			"

I would recommend this game if you can grab it on sale for around 20 to 25 bucks but the full release price of 50€ is too expencive in my eyes.			"

												Pretty medicore game. I really like the aethetics of the armor and weapons in the game, but most people will probably call it over designed. The environments and effects are pretty well done. The game is a Dark Souls clone through and through, but to me didn't really feel all that challenging throughout the game. The enemy variety feels lacking with most if not all the bosses being some large armored guy. Too many enemies in the game also carry around a huge shield which turns most fights into circle strafe fests. The game felt extremely short and the difficulty wasn't paced very well at all. The last section of the game (the final time you revist the citadel) is 100x more difficult than anything else.  Rogue magic was extremely overpowered from what I saw. Some of the spells were battles themselves to use as they completely impead your vision during their duration. The experience pooling mechanic didn't really add anything to the game. Wasn't a fan of how the sidequests worked with me collecting trivial items throughout the game, but not actually finding the quests in time for who needed them. The story is an afterthought and even after completing the game I'm not exactly sure what happened.The game isn't very good, but is an okay title to run through once if you are bored on a weekend and can get this on sale for $10 or under. It doesn't really excel at anything, it just kind of moves along content at completely being average. It is good to note that I didn't experience any technical issue at all with the title aside from some some bugs in the graveyard area where my character sounds completely disappeared for some reason.

												""Lords of the Fallen.exe has stopped working""10/10 would spend 27 dollars to crash again.I've never even seen the game.  Obviously, I'll come back to it with a real review if and when I can ever play the game.  But that may be never, as I cant even fill out thier support form because as soon as I try to attach my dxdiag that they ask for, the whole form ♥♥♥♥ing erases itself whenever you try to move to the next field/box on the form!  WTF is that♥♥♥♥♥♥  I tried going to the official game forums, and oh every time you click on it, it simply takes to a blank white screen!  Wow......I literally at this point feel like I just had my money stolen from me by a con artist.I am extremely♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about this and I ♥♥♥♥ing hate that Valve can't/won't do anything about it either cause hey, ""we're just the middle-man"".  FIX YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING GAME!  Or how about introducing a little quality control somehow?  I have literally never experienced something like this in almost 20 years of gaming and certainly none of my other steam products are like this either, even the most alpha of alpha stage greenlit early access dreck.I'm pretty sure its mostly people that use AMD/ATI hardware that have the problems.EDIT:  Further rage has been induced because after 2 months of waiting for a patch, we finally get one that DOESN'T contain optimization or crash fixes for the game.  Wow.  Will be asking for a refund now.			"

												I could say a lot about this game, but I'll try to keep it short. Souls fans will definitely enjoy this game. While borrowing a good deal from the success of Souls games, Lords of the Fallen has enough to define it as an entirely seperate game.Combat feels heavier, and much more similar to Dark Souls than Dark Souls 2. What it does different from DaS combat is implement magic as a part of every build. The only character customization is essentially choosing a heavy armor tank build, a medium armor cleric build, and a light armor stealth build. The estus flask idea carries on with health potions, which replenish at checkpoints. Players can increase their potion count by finding empty bottles, hidden in hard to reach locations.The graphics are beautiful, even better than Dark Souls 2. The lighting provides a dark and intense atmosphere without critically hindering visibility, though players will probably find it difficult to spot traps in the dark indoor chambers.While I won't compare the story to those in the Souls games, the story in Lords of the Fallen is much more direct and is quite good so far. There's a whole tab for discovered lore, for fans who love to delve deeper into a world's history.And finally, the death system has a few tweaks compared to those of the Souls games. Upon death all carried xp is dropped and players are sent back to the last activated checkpoint. Beyond that, no stats or equipment are affected, although players only have a few minutes to reach their death spot to reclaim their xp, and death before retrieval will result in the loss of any dropped points. I suppose that wasn't really a short review, oops. All in all, while Lords of the Fallen originates and borrows strongly from the Souls franchise, the game successfully sets itsself apart as more than a clone. Though some elements of combat may be more forgiving, Lords of the Fallen is still every bit as challenging and demanding as any of the Souls games.			"

												Liked:- some new combat mechanics (in regard to Dark Souls) such as shield sprint bash and blocking with shield on back- level design (highly interconnected, well detailed), especially at the begining (Keystone)- weapon design (in terms of graphics)- Worshipper - best designed boss in the game, capable of punishing constant distance playstyle, could inspire DS developers how to make bosses not so easily exploitable through ranged attacks- lore presentation (audio logs scattered through the world)Disliked:- bugs - tons of them, repeatable, often save-breaking- performance - requirements don't match visuals or game mechanics, I can't find any reason for this game to require so much horsepower other that lack of developers' talent or nvidia influence to push for physx and their crap- save system - especially painful with crap code quality in mind, continuous auto save system from DS would help here greatly- unskippable cutscenes / dialogs- combat - frustrating with heavy weapons, long windup and even slower weapon movement (who would swing so slowly with heavy weapon IRL?) makes for great imbalance vs most of enemies who can attack without almost any notice- crafting - there is no crafting system, there is socketing system with about 4 types of runes (fire/magic/poison/scaling),some weapons don't have any socket, don't have a clue why- progression system - especially regarding weapons, this is not DS, where virtually any weapon can bring you through whole game, here you have to put points in stat of your choice (str/fth/agi), preferably only one per playthrough, to pass stat requirement for better weapons- enemies - some bosses lack cooldown windows and require (to my knowledge, didn't use any help) cheap tactis such as ranged attacks and poison- 1st playthrough length - about 17 hours, too little for me considering some farming was done and backtracking (no travel system)- replayability - low, I could not force myself to play it again with this amount of bugs,I could recommend it only if it was patched and for a tenner or so.

I paid for it 80zł (1 euro = aprox. 4,22 zł), so it cost me about 18.94 euro. LESS THAN HALF STEAM PRICE. Sorry for my bad eng. this review will be updated.EDIT.: GAME IS BUGGED AS ♥♥♥♥. WAIT FOR PATCH.			"

												Updated for Patch 1.2:Game still crashes regularly, although the nature of the crash has changed.Would not currently recommend the game due to the crashing issues.  Sometimes I can play for a couple of hours with no problems, other times I can't go 5 minutes.Gameplay-wise, feels like a slower paced and slightly clunky Dark Souls.			"

												""Three crashes in 5 minutes.""That was my initial review, which was my first one and written in pure frustration due to all the bugs plaguing that game.I will do my best to explain in more details why I would still not recommend this game yet.First of all, I played only the first Dark Souls and I enjoyed it as much as I hated it at the same time. Some of my main issues with Souls was the lack of convenient checkpoint before boss fights - because I am not that hardcore and would like all the help I could get, I would try to summon NPC to help me fight the bosses. Well, I can not remember how much time I got invaded in front of the Dragon Knights duo chamber. The checkpoints are much mroe convenient in Lords - and I can not really think of something done better in that game.The combat feels heavy and clunky - especially when using greatswords/axes. You need so much time to wind up the attack that unless you time it perfectly, you will get staggered by the lightning-fast enemy attack. And you can barely time it properly because of that - the lightning fast enemy attacks. They might be all in heavy armor and with greatshields, but they are attacking so freaking fast and breaking your guard so easy in the begining it is not even funny - nor fair. And you can not break their guard untill late game - it is just not possible. This makes the fight vs some of the shield weilders true nightmare, especially in early game. Even when you learn how to do it, it is still a chore and too time-consuming to be fun. Now I understand they are super-strong demons from other dimension, but for the sake of freaking gameplay - at least make it so we are able to freaking break their guard.Also on the fighting - how can you possibly dual-weild one handed weapon SLOWER and when using it with one hand and shield? Check The Avenger (I think that was the name of the sword), this is ridiculous. Two-hand weilding does not give you speed most of the time, just leaves you more open to attacks. Also - all greatswords have exact the same identical moves - all the greataxes and hammers as well. Actually, most of the weapons are just a reskin with identical move sets. The game suffers heavily from lack of diversity in that department - they should learn from the Souls.Agility weapons, and daggers in particular, feel very bad. They have nice very high damaging combos, but the last part of the combo is usually (with the case of daggers) charging move... which very often miss due ot enemies just slightly moving aside; or you just move past them by your own. Enemies however dont have that problem - if you dodge to the side, they auto-correct their aim and positioning mid-swing and will still hit you. That feels too unfair and cheap, considering they are as already mentioned with unbreakable guard and lightning-fast attacks.The magical system is there just for the sake of having some magic in the game - I played Paladin on my first playthrough and most of the time when I tried to cast anything I would get staggered by the creeps or bosses - because of the abyssmal long casting time, in which your hero stays in one place and makes fancy moves. I would appreaciate if some kind of mobility was invilved like in Souls, where you can still move while casting, but slower. It is ridiculous and not fun at all.The main thing that put me aside from the game and I will not most probably play it anymore is the loot system. Where is the replayability if in your first playthrough you open all the chests and get all the gear?! What if I got some crappy normal version of a very cool sword, and I want to socket it? Forget it - if you want another better vesrion of the sword, you need to know the exact chest and you need to start a new game and to make sure you have good multiplier for higher rarity chance. It would be much more helpful to be able to upgrade the common variation to higher rarity by crafting - or at least have everything drop again on New Game+ and ++ but with higher chance for better rarity.On a side note, I wanted to play agi char. Well, almost midgame and still the best agi-weapon was the one I foung in the very first 30 mins after start. I just gave up at that point.At this point I do not see any reason to play that game again. I was fooled by the pre-release streaming and the nice setting, but I would have never payed £30 for that garbage. The game is too small, too repetitive, too buggy and definetely not worth the price tag.Also keep in mind I have not played after the last patches and although some system issues might have been resolved, I will still not play it because of the all things mentioned above. All of the above is my personal opinion base don my personal experience with this trash, I mean the game, and might differ from yours. I would actually recommend the game after few patches and on a sale for at least 60% off, but not for full price. Do NOT get it for full price, do not make the same mistake as me.If you really bothered to read that - thanks and game on.			"

												Dont buy this game ever. Unless you like a game that chrashes all 2 hours or so and is riddled with bugs. The basic concept of the game is quite cool, but the execution is more then terrible.A little list of what is wrong with this game:FPS issues most of the time.Input lag like you wouldnt believe. (Sometimes commands get swallowed up completely)The camera has seizures in narrow areas.Hitboxdetection feels more like the lottery. (Not for the enemies though)All in all I regret spending money on this game. While I still hope they fix most of these issues, I would have liked not to have to bother. "

												Just got it today from the Steam Sale for $19.99. ""$19.99"". How on earth do you get away from a deal that good??!?! It's a golden, delicious, beautiful, mouth-watering, heartstopping sensation, jaw-dropping, and door stopping steal for me. But unto the game itself, so far I really love it. I know, the gameplay and the system upgrades do feel a lot like Dark Souls, but it's the fun version of Dark Souls. And suprisingly, I haven't raged ONE bit like I do with all games. I like the mechanics in the gameplay too, because it feels like the developers had put some realism into the game, along with the in-game physics. And plus, the UI in this game? BEAUTIFUL, I could just lick it. I can't write this review without saying how much I like and love about it, so I would definitely recommend this game to almost everyone who hadn't gotten the chance to get their hands on this game. 10/10 in my book.

												This short ""review"" is writen after ONE playthrough and I can happily tell that it was quite enjoyable.Lords of the Fallen is a good gateway into the ruthless world of punishing action-RPG's like Dark Souls. It is a lot beginner friendly and easier, but it isn't too easy and shares the many traits of instakills if you just run like a fool into battle.The fighting feels solid and each swing and block feels heavy and strong. Even the moving is up to par with other games of the genre, it is solid and responding. The more heavier armours and weapons you wear, the slower you get and become a walking statue - whiles the lighter gear makes you swift and quick to strike your demon foes.While the story is something generic in european fashion, along with the voice acting - it is still enough unique and interesting to stand out with it's multiple endings and choices along the way to enrichen the world. Lores are scattered through the worlds as ""audio scroll"" for not wasting your time and this is quite a positive thing for me - the game is telling the lore to you, not making you speculate everything you find and see.But, with all games, there are some flaws. Many of the game breaking bugs has been fixed by now, but there are some minor bugs still that are just mostly amusing than anything braking. Sometimes the bodies of your fallen enemies flies up to the sky, only to be juggled ontop of your head. Sometimes the player spings rapidly around after doing a killing blow while locked on the enemy. Some minor sound bugs(hard to pin point out) and shadow glitches.In the end, I heartly would recommend this game to any one who enjoyes action-rpg games, especially the more ruthless ones.			"

												So far it's a great game. Combat feels extremely heavy, from the effects of sparks coming off your shield when you block to the way your character plants himself to take a swing. Everything has this great weight to it yet the games combat can feel pretty fast. The lore feels like it's presented well in audio logs from other peoples perspectives. So far I'm still trying out which class I really enjoy made a warrior to start and loved it. I've since created a video trying the Cleric and I plan to try rogue before pushing further. Gameplay and my thoughts on the game while playing Cleric can be found at

												Graphics are beautiful. That said i think the rest of the game is one big dissapointment after another. There is absolutly no balance in the game. I mean, the only thing this game hold in is trying to survive to the next bosfight. A bossfight is dying until you find a pattern and beat him (what becomes incredibly boring after a few). Also, rewards are based on luck!The idea of the game reminded me of a classic: severance blade of darkness (probably got my hopes up). It's sad to say that a game that's 13 years old did a better job than lords of the fallen.			"

												Now, Lord of the fallen is a game i was initially wary about. I'd heard from youtuber Totalbiscuit that this game was horrendously optimized for PC. As it turned out he was right, i vastly exceed the recommended specs for the game (nvidia geforce 770 and 16 gigs of ram to give you an idea) But the game still had horrendous framerate, to the point that it almost froze. I ran a test with fraps to see the numbers, and it was consistently at 30 or dropped below that.Now, the game itself is very Dark Soul reminiscent, (Both of them being bad PC ports) And handles very much alike it. You control Harkyn, the main protagonist of the game) From a 3rd person perspective. You've got several different playstyles much alike that of the Soul games. But what i found in this game was that there was no way you were ever going to enjoy the game playing your own way. I started out as a Rogue, because ive always enjoyed sneakily shanking enemies when their backs are turned, and quickly found my♥♥♥♥♥♥on a plate because there had been no proper explanation of a stealth system, or if one such system even existed.And then, right after the tutorial fight with the first Rhogar, i had my first crash.I was ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I looked at the forum to see if this was a common issue, and indeed this was something that has happened to a lot of people. I then also saw that the forums were infected with the very worst part of both the PC gaming community and the Dark Souls community. So entitled ♥♥♥♥♥♥s saying that anyone who does not own a pc powered by the souls of dead children should have no business playing PC games, and also♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who ramble about you being a noob if you can't find this one single item burried away in a cave somewhere near a cove behind two secret walls, a fire, and a monster the size of the moon.So i returned, my problem unsolved, when as soon as the Nvidia logo had vanished the game crashed again.So after i'd gotten myself something to drink, and beat my head against the wall for a few minutes, I booted up the game again and it actually launched. To then find that my save file was gone.Grumbling and determined not to let this ♥♥♥♥ing game beat me, i started a new file and created myself a Cleric Brawler, cause i decided that if the game was gonna be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ then so was i. And suddenly the game was an absolute ♥♥♥♥ing cakewalk, i died two times at the first boss and then he was trashed aswell, Despite this i did find myself cursing at ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t momentum cancelling attacks from enemies. This continued until i reached the third boss.This was where i officially clicked quit game and deleted the damn thing from my PC. ♥♥♥♥ you Lords of the Fallen. Being hard is one thing, but be hard and fair at the same time. A boss that spawns minions that stun lock you and then proceeds to beat you senseless isnt fair, its trying to beat a wall down with your forehead.So in short, can't recommend, maybe try Dark Souls 2 in stead.

												Honestly, it's nowhere near Dark Souls franchise, not even close. And it's not a good game on its own at all, but it doesn't mean it's a bad game. There are several flaws which make could make the game difficult to enjoy, but there are also things that make the dealing with all the issues worth it. Overall, I would say picking it up for cheap on a sale wouldn't be a bad deal.Pros:   Amazing soundtrack, the main menu theme is just great Great looking visuals, graphics are truly beautiful Multi-phase boss battles are somewhat interesting Good level design with fair checkpoint placement Enemy variety and design is satifying Cons:  Poor performance and very unstable, crashes left and right Bad voice-acting, uninteresting story and weak character design Unresponsive controls and extremely sluggish main character Very difficult in a bad way, cheap deaths and overpowered enemies Terrible menu design, menus are a pain to navigate Lack of meaningful spell variety for mage builds Gameplay = 6/10 ; Visuals = 9/10 ; Audio = 8/10 ; Music 9/10 ; Story = 7/10Verdict: 6/10 - MediocreLords of the Fallen is more of a mixed bag, but one that I can't bring myself to recommend to anyone except the hardcore Dark Souls fans. There are some really strong such as the amazing soundtrack and beautiful visuals, but there are many critical issues and problems such as instability and constant crashes, unresponsive controls, poor voice-acting and terrible menu design. If you're a Dark Souls fan, I'd say you should definitely grab it on a sale just to try it. Otherwise, there are much better games to play than this.			"

												Lords of the Fallen, oh how I really wanted to like you. A new 'Souls-esque' game to enter the struggle. I had an open mind, wasn't one of these naysayers that were judging the gameplay prior to launch. A fresh take on the souls series was a welcome thing in my eyes. The competition and innovation in gameplay and structure could help shape future souls games.I love the enemies and the bosses I encountered.The 'soul patch' system was fresh and unique.The weapons and armor all had real weight to them. Batting an enemy, or being batted by one across the map was awesome.Lighting and particle effects were cool.Oh and almost forgot, the environments are truly great.I truly was excited to play this game. And after 7hrs put into this, and only reaching the 4th boss due to crashing to desktop, wall bugs, glitches, terrain bugs, sound bugging out and hitbox issues....I'm going to have to put this game down until the devs can fix this technical disaster.1 week after launch and I'm thumbing this game down. I'm hoping it'll work as intended in the future so I can revisit it.edit:1 day after I write this review, the game got patched. Fingers crossed it fixes my issues.edit2:nope			"

												Played between 3 and 4 hours as of writing, spent about an hour in the rhogar realm.Seems to me to be a relatively poor b-movie equivalent of dark souls. If I'm not fighting hordes of enemies that never lower their shields, I'm fighting the poor, corridor-based level design, the abysmal inventory system, the confusing item switching system, the laughable dialogue or the non-existant story.It's quite a clunky game. Often you'll fight enemies with shields. Shield bash them, or kick their shield, and they'll lower their shield. For about a second. There is no time, even with some of the faster weapons, to follow up with an attack. It's as if Lords took the Dark Souls combat system but forgot to tune it based on their enemies.As for story, there are quite a few side characters about, that all seem to care greatly what's going on. Even the playable character, Harkyn, seems to care what is going on. But I can't for the life of me give a single solitary damn, becuase I have no idea where, who, what I am, why I'm doing it, who I'm doing it with... You're just not given any of that information, so it's rather hard to empathise with any of the 2-dimensional characters.The animations are stiff, in dialogue especially. Dialogue sounds like it was recorded somewhere that wasn't a recording studio, and that the VAs weren't really fully immersed.And after my good 3-4 hour excursion, I've met cumutavely a total of between 5 and 7 different enemy types. There's undead hollow thing, smaller undead thing with sword and shield, bigger undead thing with sword and shield, bigger undead thing 2handing, fat undead thing with a crossbow... It's not the most creative game. Sure, the skyboxes can be pretty if you can make it out behind all that lens flare, but I'm a bit tired of snowy castles and towers.It can be quite entertaining. quite. I've found myself thinking it's like dark souls but with the darksiders aesthetic and lack of fun.In no way could I recommend this for it's RRP. I grabbed this on sale for roughly £12, and to be perfectly honest, at the moment that's about the maximum I'd tell someone to buy it for. "

												so yeah, the game just have been relised and it's pretty much a dark souls clone, except it's a decent one, compared to dark souls 2.+ it does support my custom resolution, no need for crutches like dsfix or gedosato+ textures aren't blurry low-res broken-contrast piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥dark souls 2 have+ parry is decent+ wombo-combos with weapons+ yes it have classic backstabs and you can execute them any time if you stand right, not what you can read on reviews as ""stealth attacks"" + reasonably challenging+ combat is VERY fluid+ equipment looks unique+ nice loot mechanics+ the more souls points you have on you unspent, the more good loot multiplier you have, think of it as gold serpent ring made a baby with ?lord? greatsword+ i've seen word ""materials"" so there are possibly upgrades or even craft- does not support custom controllers except xbox360, even x360ce (emulator) didn't help me, so i had to use xpadder with distance zones to imitate it. i will try again to get x360ce working, but it is fine already as it is with xpadder.- some enemies are hard to telegraph for parry, may be i'm not used to yet, just half a hour of gameplay so far.- combat may be TOO fluid at times, but still better than dark souls 2 clunkiness- can't parry without shield, so i feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥ having to equip it.- no character creation, but i wasn't really bothered with it, still could be a nice thing to have.+/- (neutral) actual story telling instead of lore. some people may like it, some ds tryhards might say that it's bad, for me - indifferent.+/- (neutral) artstyle is pretty general modern fantasy rpg game (witcher, dragon age), but it's consistent, so no opinion on this. again, more about tastes, but clearly better than dark souls 2 broken contrast imo.currently playing as thief with daggers and hand shield, parrying everything and having a blast, what else can i say?must-buy game, way better than dark souls 2 imo in terms of fluid controls, graphics and general consistency.it is obviously pale comparing to dark souls 1, but still a great fun.my rating 9/10 so far, will update for story and gameplay mechanics differences later as i will see them			"

												I only recommend this game if you are willing to die. Possibly a lot. You have to be adaptable if you want to play a rogue. You have to use a shield sometimes whether you want to or not. Overall this game delivers an experience a kin to Dark Souls. The first Dark Souls is far more entertaining than this title but I mostly played a tank like character and this could explain my fond memories of the title. I have not completed this game yet. But so far I have had fun, been frustrated, and surprised that some non boss shield users are gods because they always....ALWAYS.... block. So far the story seems to lack my attention. But hopefully that will pick up soon. I was hoping for a variety of character but you are the same person no matter what class you choose.Although the game appears to have some high requirements to play it. I haven't had many issues with in game lag. The game ran on high setting with no visable issues. I have found 3 different glitches so far in the game. Feel free to look at my videos on my profile to check them out. One of them is a Boss fight glitch. Overall the game is above average.

												For a game that certainly tries to be Dark Souls, Lords of the Fallen is a good example of why a game like Dark Souls is to hard to pull off. There are so many small things that this game does worse than the former, and it makes the entire thing feel much worse for it. First, the camera is like being followed by a helicopter with Parkinson's disease. It goes from uncomfortably shaky in large, open areas, to almost laughably ridiculous in smaller, tighter spaces. Second, the combat. While a game like Dark Souls is more punishing than trying to fist a bear, it was always...ALWAYS fair. I can count on one hand the amount of times I died in Dark Souls and felt it wasn't completely my fault. In Lords of the Fallen, however, I died a dozen times in just the first area, and while I initially chalked it up to my learning the mechanics of the game, it soon became clear that this game is much, much harsher and even less fair when it comes to combat.While the idea of a bulkier, heavier Dark Souls sounds like an awesome game, this is not that game. It all looks very pretty, but it fails to live up to the standards of the game it so obviously is trying to be. This game is trying to stand on the shoulders of a giant like the Souls series, only to realize that it has no legs. This can all be summed up in an experience I had while trying to fight the second boss of the game. After dying maybe ten, fifteen times to the thing, I finally endured the nearly half-hour boss fight, had finally withered it down to the last fractions of it's health...and the game crashed on me. 2/10Would not buy again(also, it bears mentioning that game difficulty itself is not an issue for me [please refer to the 200 hours I've spent on Dark Souls], it is when a game is difficult without also being fair that I take issue)			"

												If you think Dark Souls is hard, stay away. But if you aren't a little wuss this game is awesome. I mean, it has everything, amazing combat, gorgeus art and top notch music scores. Give it a go! It might take some time to get invested in it but it is totally WORTH every SINGLE minute. Level and monster design is flawless but the enemies might feel lame sometimes. Good lore and story with little guidance which increases your curiousity. The game does experience some FPS issues that will get fixed in the coming future but the FPS drop only happens in certain enviroments such as fire/light heavy areas.Satisfying, brutal and beautiful 9/10			"

												Lords of the Pauldron.In all seriousness, it's alright I guess.Absolutely terrible worldbuilding/story/characters. Combat mechanics are promising but have flaws with a lot of cheap and unpredictable enemy AI that prevent total enjoyment.Commendable attempt at non-linear level design, which is unfortunately derailed by environments that look too similar to one another and preventing players from learning a level's layout.The overall pacing of the game is absolute dogshit, and easily it's worst flaw. This gets more evident later on in the game.One example - a hard boss fight is placed immediately after another hard boss fight. You are physically locked away from the rest of the world and the player has no chance to mentally rest and recuperate by down-tempo exploration gameplay before being flung against another wall.I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy my time with the game, but the flaws eventually added up and left me with a very sour taste in my mouth.It might be worth looking at, but not at full price.

												One of the most frustrating games I have played in years. Annoying camera movements. Slow restrictive character moves. Some nice combo moves but largely just leave you open to attack.Near impossible to avoid boss attacks and the need to repeat it all again if you die just to get your lost xp back.It looks stylish on the preview videos but you soon find it's very repetative attacks and dodges.In over 30 years of gaming experiance this is one of the few that will push you to the point of wanting to put your keyboard through the monitor.Looks good, had real potential. Sadly didn't deliver. Not recommended.			"

												Im a big fan of Demon Souls/Dark Souls franchise and obviously Bloodborne, however this game is very different in combat, instead of fast paced combat its slow but very good. Now if you're going to purchase this game, bear in mind it felt like I was playing Dark Souls for the very first time again, having to learn the controls was a great feeling to have once again.This game can be challenging and frustrating but its rewarding you with good looking armor and weapons and a good leveling up system.I would and will recommend this game to ANYONE that likes a similiar experience as dark souls gives you. I had a great banter with this. 10/10 "

												A dark third-person action game that most gamers will find easier to get into than Dark Souls series, however, it doesn't quite have the depth of Dark Souls either.  There is less exploration, less variety int terms of builds and combat styles and no customization at all.That said, it does deliver a good combat style focused on slow, armored melee combat with various large and intimidating bosses.+Nice graphics+Good melee centric combat+Nice atmosphere and overall style+Interesting bosses-No customization-Limited variety of play styles-Some bugs, including crash bugs at launch that would stop play (mostly patched now)			"

												Pretty fun game. If you liked Dark Souls 1 & 2, you'll probably like this one. Doesn't contain as many features as DS2, but has a similar difficulty level (although DS2 bosses are harder). No character creation, which is a minus, but has a reasonable skill/magic level progression. Only 3 classes, so limited replayability. Especially as (apart from the magic) you can essentially play the rogue and the warrior in one play through simply by changing your armour and weapon, if you put some points into agility. This can actually be helpful as versus some bosses you benefit from increased ability to dodge (champion anyone?). The game is hard at first and can be frustrating but once you get used to each type of enemy it's relatively straight forward until you reach a boss, which you then need to figure out. Like DS2, you drop all your experience when you die, but you can retrieve it. However, unlike DS2 the longer it takes you to reach your XP pick-up, the less XP there is when you get there. So the game can be pretty unforgiving, but if you like that then it's good.Visual style is okay I guess, maybe 2 or 3 years out of date but thats alright. The music and sounds are high quality. I've encountered a couple of bugs where if you die by falling sometimes your XP can't be reached. However, there are special items you can use that allow you to get your XP without actually running and getting it (type of potion). I advise never using these unless your XP is bugged as above, as when that happens these potions are the only way to get it back.Other than that, pretty polished game. Recommended.			"

												Lords of the fallen is a really cool game, it have some bug but you don't care cause the game is amazing. It have some FPS issue quiet ofen but they are not really going to bother you (it won't drop down than 30 FPS).I have a Core i7 and a GTX 660 the game turn really well in mediem settings, but when I go to high settings or something like that it's ofen craching when I quit the inventory. So, I think, to have the best settings you need to have a beast computer. I really recomand playing this game, it's maybe a bit to short but i've missed a LOT of thing. I really love this type of game, they Dark souls mechaniques (not everything), Diablo 3 history and sometimes (I just play the demo and it look quiet the same), and in fact the level desing is really good, I really like all part of the monastey, it's in snow and high up in the mountains, I really like this sensation. This game is just GOOD, the armor are nice and the weapon too, maybe the level up is prety shity. Try it out if you want.			"

												Epicure said that death is an absence of sensation that can't be feared, because when your dead, you're not here anymore to feel it. I suppose Lords of the Fallen defies that paradox, because I felt boredom at a level of near-death experience. I play for so many years at video game, it never happened to me before that I felt such a boredom fighting that first boss. Sure graphics are supernice. Alright. Pilotwings's on SNES were wonderful too in their time. It is very tough and punitive. I have never played Dark souls or games alike before. But this is clearly overrated and ten thousand leagues under Skyrim and Fable. There's no concrete plot, and ambiance fades as you try to reach your decreasing XP at each death. That fight seems like keep on repeating the fable of the lion and the gnat, and I suppose the whole game is of that stuff. There is more thrill at beginning a 1000 pages book, for you'll not be to reread a thousand times the same pages. That clearly ain't worth the price, pows. Unless you're fan of the Darksouls-like genre.			"

												This game is not dark souls, it takes some of the dark souls ideas and game play, makes it easier, simpler and more friendly for casual gamers. if you are a hard core gamer or one that spent a lot of time on dark souls. this game will not last long as you soon realise what works best and will beat the game in a short period of time.Mobs do not hit that hard and when you realise how each one moves you will soon take all of them down. Even though the game offers a few different weapon and armour types, you will find that you go for a mid range weight encoumberment and a mid speed weapon. This is because high speed weapons do next to no damage to mobs/bosses, you will never be able to use a big weapon as they are far to slow also being to heavy ( fatman rolling ) doesnt work. and it wont take long to realise that rolling is pritty much pointless bar a few mobs and side stepping is faster, you stay on your feet for that back stab kill.The any mob will kill you aproach to dark souls is not needed to be taken on this game. But the big downside to this game is there is no real replay worth,      As you can only get items that you havent picked up on your first run so if you explored really well you have already done most things.      Mobs are a little harder to kill as they have more hit points, you know how to kill them and it is so easy you will find that you will go as far as possible without spending exp just for a little bit of risk. so far im just past the 5th boss on the second run through and i havent banked once. I have put recomended on this game as i have enjoyed playing it, all be that its a little to easy, some times hit reg is a bit dodgy, and there was a few crashes near the end of the game. But......if you are not a hardcore gamer, and you havent spent time on either dark souls game. This game is fun it will entertain and will pose a slight challenge to you, looks reasonably good, and after you have done this you might be tempted to really challenge yourself and buy the dark souls games. 10X longer but 10X the challange.

												First of all - recommended requirements are a joke.i7-4770K, 16GB RAM, GeForce GTX 670 and I can run game on high only in closed, not too big rooms. Playing on very high is not possible. Even on high, I wasn't able to deal with some bosses/monsters. Oh and sometimes game crashes to desktop killing my graphic driver, what requires restart of PC (happened maybe 3 or 4 times but still).Besides these problems, game is quite good. If anyone played Dark Souls, he should also like this one. There are some buggy moments (spiders floating over edges) or fighting problems (when you die and don't know why), but besides that I liked the whole game. Oh and there are appareantly some translation problems, but maybe only in Polish version (""press KEY to increase better rune chance"" WHAT KEY?!) I hope for some fixes from the creators and some BIG and decent DLC campaing.			"

												I just completed my first run through of the game and enjoyed it.It's like Dark Souls, but way simpler and much easier. It has lots of weapons and armor, but the move sets of the different weapons is very small. Hammers all swing alike, Swords all swing alike, axes and so on.The story was muddled, but a somewhat interesting god vs man theme. I never got a clear sense of why I was there doing what I was doing, except that I was a criminal/sinner being used by the people who imprisoned me.  The scenery was quite good, graphics wise, but a good amount of the game is very similar to being inside an oblivion gate from Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. If you showed someone the levels and said it was an ""updated oblivion"" you'd except that idea without thought; they're so similar.The graphics are pretty good in my estimation. I found myself thinking that Dark Souls should look like Lords of the Fallen and that Lords of the Fallen should play more like Dark Souls. At the end of the day, this is a fun game and I enjoyed it. I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price, but on sale ($20 or less) it's a pretty good game. "

												7/10 from me, really enjoyed the gameplay! Well worth it during sale.The first playthrough was fun, did a rogue one as well up till third boss but then continued on my cleric. Was an epic game, I lvled all the way up to 84 in the first run, found almost everything there is to find except 1 sword(core, didn't need it) and 2 armor pieces(the statue things, using Tor). Recently started NG+ and was thinking at least I'll get attribute points from chests where I already found the sword/armor from. But nope, got the same swords/armor as i did last run through from most of the chests. SOME armor chests gave energy or magic resist rune insted which I have too many of already and don't need. So after the second boss on NG+ I have to call it a gg. Lvling up after this point 86 is just mindnumbing and pointless, still wont make you that much stronger. Oh and the weapon aquireing progression through out the game is stupidly done. Any normal game you expect to find better weps as you progress, But I found 1 endgame axe very very early, then almost at the end of the game after finding loads of crap weapons i found an even better one(Last Will) that made anything after that useless again, from the second to last normal enemy before the last boss in the game I found a slightly better one(peacemaker) But at this point I didn't feel like running back and slotting it to just finish the last boss. All in all the game was very fun, but the weapons were so extreamly uneven in dmg they really just look cool but offer close to nothing.			"

												Good:If you play it not expecting Dark Souls, you will have a good time.This game is better than most games out there but sadly in my opinion it had a rough launch and got a somewhat bad reputation from the get go.I bought this game expecting a buggy mess with pretty graphics but with a few hours of playtime. I can honestly say, even after spending many, many hours with the Souls games that, this game is different, rich in weapons and content and fun to play. It is so satisfying to hit things in this game. The multiplier (not multiplayer, this game is strictly singleplayer)- system is a great addition where you can go back to previous areas ang kill weaker enemies to increase your multiplier, and then go and earn some major exp.Sure, the enemies and the locations can get a LITTLE repetetive but no where close to what people are saying, I mean the detailed enviornments are incredible and well layed out. It FEELS like you are making progress and it is FUN.It is not Dark Souls, it does not even come close to that complexity, but it does not fall flat on it's face.The enemy A.I is good and it manages to surprise you. The same goes for the Bosses. Some bosses are harder than those in Dark Souls... I do not know if this game intended this or if it is a result of poor balancing but you can get DESTROYED in a few areas, which is good.There are so many weapons and Armours, and granted you will not use them all, they are there to play around with.The rune system to imbue your gear is good and simple and gives you a reason to grind some enemies, if you like grinding that is.Bad:The lore is forgettable and not really interesting at all, but luckily you can totally bypass it. It would have been better to not have ANY lore, then there might have been a mystery to solve but for some reason they went with a lackluster story.There are a few bugs I have noticed, with closed doors looking like they are open and one crash when switching weapons. I have also heard that there might be a game breaking bug after fighting the second boss but I have not noticed it.The new game system is kind of a gray zone for me. You can not play with the same character past NG++. It is not unlimited like Dark Souls.TLDR:The combat is satisfying and you can choose to play in whatever way you want. There are not many spells but you can use them all. Level up, get stronger, progress. Forget the story and just kill stuff in a very, very pretty world. It is hard enough and the bosses are rewarding. Everything is so BUFF AND COOL AND AWESOME LOOKING OMG. Really good artists. This is one of those hidden gems, plagued with a few issues and a bad reputation, but if you can see past it, you might just love it. "

EPIC GAME!!!! The combat system is amazing, every piece of gear looks awesome right from the start, the score has a very Diablo II sound to it, graphics are top notch and the boss fights are intense!Since the graphics and effects are so stunning, I had hoped for some more interesting looking armour later on but I finished it without finding anything jaw-dropping. Playing it through a second time now, might loot something more interesting this time round, I hope!I only have a few complaints:Bad story telling. A lot of decissions in the game I wasn't aware I made because they weren't explained clearly and there were times I wasn't sure what was going on, for instance (warning, spoilers in this blocked out text): The opening scene which I still don't fully understand even after finishing the game. Is it meant to be a flash back? Whats up with the hammer? Is it Harkyn or someone else? The giant demon who I thought was a fallen lord that vanishes with Yetka, what was that all about!?? And after the talk with Adyr you return to the citadel only to be attacked by the human soldiers, calling you a traitor for no reason. This is later explained a bit by picking up a scroll, but only after hacking through a small army of good guys you don't want to kill. And the mountain in the opening and at the end, what is it supposed to be and why did it break/fall apart?Extremely light crafting system. It would have been awesome if the crafting sytem let you craft gear instead of just unlocking runes and socketing gear, the smith looks more than capable. You can't combine lower quality runes to make better ones, but maybe this was intentional to keep the flawless runes a rare thing.Luck stat/drop modifier doesn't seem to work. It just increases the frequency of rubbish dropping, doesn't increase the quality of drops. Having said that though, I still highly recommend this game! :)			"

												First off, most of the reviews complaining about the optimization problems are no longer valid. That being said, there is no excuse for games these days especially non-indie titles, to be released as beta feeling as this game was. Unforunately that seems to be just par for the course these days in the industry and I won't let my personal feelings on that matter apply here.This game is a third person action RPG that uses a similar control set-up to the dark souls games and leveling system, but that is where the similarities really end. You do gain and lose your experience by killing/dying and must go to where you died to retrieve your exp. This exp does start to disappear overtime though, and you're not likely to retrieve most of your exp if you're very far from a checkpoint.The game's difficulty is not high, and most of the struggles you'll face are at the beginning, and very end of the game. The mid-game seems unbalanced and you will be mowing through most enemies.The combat is much faster paced than the Souls games and I'd say it's about a mid-ground between that and Darksiders 2's combat. They did an excellent job of making each weapon type feel differently and I feel the physics here surpass the Souls series by far. The staff weapons were incredibly overpowered during the time I played the game due to it's fast attack speed and good scaling damage. This could always be fixed in balance patches or mods however.The bosses were fairly underwhelming, but there are a good variety of enemy types which take different tactics in order to combat as opposed to the souls series (lock on and circle) method of killing just about everything which detracts from my enjoyment of that particular franchise. There were multiple ways to defeat a few of the bosses, and this allowed you to receieve special equipment upon killing them which I thought was a rather neat addition. Some of the weaker and early bosses become elite enemies that you will fight throughout the game as well, forcing you to adapt your combat style when fighting them as well as a group of lesser enemies at the same time.There are many collectibles in the game, and while the lore is pretty generic, it's still interesting enough to warrant collecting all the scrolls and finding the secret equipment (which there is a good number of).The games length was decent, and it could probably be played through 2-3 times in order to play different styles, and colelct the new game + gear, however, new game+ difficulty does not scale nearly fast enough in order for it to be a challenge.As a final note, I do recommend the game, and while it's not anywhere near perfect, there are some innovative ideas here, and I'd like to see a sequel one day improve on what worked, and change what didn't. This is definitely the best game this particular studio has made to date, and I think they should be supported for adding some creativity to this genre which is pretty much dominated by a single franchise at this point.

Posted: November 4, 2014
 Background At first i have to say, i own Dark souls I and II, and played boath games for more than 100+ hours. After I heared about this game, i was quit hyped and decided to give this game a go. I am german, but i try to write this review in english. If you find mistakes you are free to keep them ;) Graphic This games lookes really good. The armor and weapons look really cool. The enemys and enviroments are designed well and this game sets you up for its dark and grim world. But this game has a huge downside. This game runs really bad on most of the systems. I had to set all settings to medium, but can run Battlefield 4 on Ultra without problems. Sound The ingame sound suits the game well. The enemys you hear when you go through dungeons, the swing of heavy weapons, its really executed well. BUT the voicacting in this game is really bad. Most of the characters sound like they do not care about their situation at all. They fail to sell you the dark and grim situation they are in. Your maincharacter should not be part of this game, and also does not really care about the things happening around him Story and Playtime The Story really falls flat. Its the basic: The world is getting invaded and you are the only one to save it story. I stopped to care about the story quit early. You can read iteam descritions and listen to the NPCs you meet along the way. But there is not much lore behind the game, you really care about (there is a lot to read, but most of it falls short to games like Dark souls).The playtime of the game is really short! When you are send out to kill the final bosses you have played for like 8-10 hours. I also did a lot of sidemissions and explored a lot. But thits game just feels short. You have dungeons you can explore that are more interesting than the main story, but eventually you will end up doing the main mission. Gameplay The good:+ Weapons are balanced around their size. Daggers can be used to place fast hits in between your enemys attacks, and heavy swords need a setup time.+ Easy to learn, hard to master. If you are new to games like this, you will go for the tank approch using heavy armor and a shild. You can also use light gear and try to parry enemy attacks and use your mobility to fight them+ Risk reward mechanic. You can save your XP, or push on through the game trying to increase your multiplier. This gives you the chance to get more XP and better loot. Or to loose it allThe bad:-The bosses. Most of the bosses(not all!) are really boring. The difficulty is mostly increased when they summon additions minions, which is really cheap. Attack patterns mostly focus in one direction, so after you doge the first hit, the boss continues to attack in the wrong direction. I killed most bosses on the first try without any problem.- The lock on system. Its a JOKE! Most of the time the game will randomly lock on to an enmy infront of you no matter if another enemy (e.g. boss!) is directly infront of you In review This game is not perfect. The bosses are mostly push-overs and only some stand out. The gameplay itself is solid. You can challange yourself to play in a certain styl, that will increase the difficulty. I can not denie the fact, liking the game while playing it. If you are unsure, you can wait for the sale to pick it up.This game gets a 7,5/10 for me. Solid but can be improved :)			"

												Gameplay grew on me and I really started to enjoy playing. The game became a lot more interesting and fun when I realized that side quests were way off the beaten track and you had to explore quite a bit to find them and complete them. The game is graphically amazing and art direction is equally as good. Has a very satisfying look and feel to it.Why I'm not recommending this game is for two reasons:1. I'm 23 hours in and the game has only just started crashing. To make it worse I was fighting a boss(s) that takes a loooong time to kill, and half way through beating them the game just crashes. I want to complete the game and go into NG+ but I can't. 2. You might be under the impression that bosses in this game have varying ways in which they fight depending on what stage their health bar is at - and that's true for a couple of the bosses I've fought - but the majority have been very lackluster and one dimensional. Some of the boss fights are flat out boring, uninspired and generic. I've fought quite a few bosses now and have died maybe a total of 4 times because they're so predictable.			"

												Have nothing really bad to say about the game.I played it at Game 24 (Nvidia event) and enjoyed it a lot. It's like this dark comic style with oversized weapons and you have to wait untill the weapon swings. (weapon swings annoying)Yes there are some NOT good thing*Lip sync and voice isn't good that is the first thing you notice* every now and then some weapon or corpse is stuck to your boots.*It's kinda light on lore still have some unanswered questions *I personally die a lot in this game but somehow it's good you want to go back and kill the one who killed youGood*It's this grim and dark feeling of the game (not in bad way)*Really nice locations (talking about outside) **most of the game is in rooms and corridors*** XP multiplier if you don't save at checkpoints you get more XP* if you die you will run to get your ghost and all the monsters are back * steady 60fps never was bellow 50 except loading screens for some unknown reason.Yes people are complaining about crashes and other problems. Had one crash in first hour and that was it. yes people compare it to dark souls but i have never played them :( so i don't know what is better. "

												I initially started this game expecting it to play like Darksiders however it was quite different.In essence the combat is more like Monster Hunter. Especially when wearing heavy armor your character is quite slow which takes some time to get used to.My first attempts failed miserably due to the fact that I wasn't accustomed to the game mechanics. Even the very first enemy took me considerable effort to defeat.However, after you get past that 'hill' and start getting familiar with the controls and how the character behaves the game becomes incredibly fun!The atmosphere of the game is awesome: a dark and gritty monastery in which you uncover one horror after the other. Throughout the game you'll find pieces of lore which help you put the puzzle of the story together. My only gripe here is that in the beginning you get dumped into the game without any hook into the story i.e. you have no clue what's going on.You can find a huge amount of different weapons and armor, each with different stats and abilities and all of them look incredibly cool! The game is also loaded with many secrets which can be uncovered like special equipment, hidden treasure chests, special Portals after defeating bosses etc.The boss fights (i.e. the Lords) are a mix: some of them are quite easy while others are extremely hard. It takes time to learn their attack patterns and to equip yourself appropriately. Especially the final boss was a tough nut to crack. However, I have to add it never felt impossible i.e. even for the difficult fights you will manage to do a substantial amount of damage so that gives hope that it can be pulled off on a next attempt.Saving is done by means of checkpoints. So when you die you start back at a previous point and all enemies are back. Initially I didn't like this until I understood this is the core of the game: you have to redo parts in order to get more XP so you become more powerfull for the later game.When the game is completed you can start a new game +. This allows you to carry over all equipment of your previous playthrough. In addition it allows you to select a new school of Magic. So in this way you can eventually level up in all three schools which is quite nice.To conclude a couple of minor points which I found:- There is no Quest log, so it's hard to keep track of some side Quests. Taking notes is required.- There is no map, so you have to have a good memory where everything is located.- Most of the secrets in the game are not hinted at by the in-game lore. So some you will find by chance while the rest you can only find by looking at forum posts or youtube vids. It would have been much nicer if this info could be gathered from the game itself.- Even after finishing the game I'm still strugging sometimes with the controls (using Controller). In most cases this is caused by the fact that sprinting, rolling and jumping is one and the same button. So more often that not when I want to sprint to perform a heavy leap attack ... my character just rolls and bounces against the enemy only to get pounded. When wanting to jump over a gap ... my character just rolls and fall in the depths. These nuisances could have been avoided by a better control sheme.My final verdict is that it's a great game. It takes some time getting into it, but when you remain persistent (and patient) it becomes an awesome game!Note: After upgrading to Windows 10 I always got a crash when starting a new game. Disabling the NVidia Turbulence fixed this issue.			"

												Lords of the Fallen is a very fun game that has a lot to offer. It was a big underrated imo. Having said that though, it does suffer from a lot of problems. LotF is basically a Dark Souls clone, but that's not necessary a bad thing. It does bring its own flair to the series with additions like being healed by your fallen souls instead of just quickly retrieving them. It also focuses on a more controlled class design than Dark Souls. In DS, your character can be all over the place with stats and gear, which isn't a bad thing, as it allows you to have complete control over your toon. But LotF has specific class abilities, which do play somewhat different from one another. All the armor and weapons can be used by all three classes, as long as you have the necessary stat requirements. It's much more simplified than DS, so it opens it up to more casual people. One of the biggest changes from the DS series though is that bosses have stages. Each boss has three stages they go through depending on how much health they have left. For example, the first boss you fight will be wielding a greatsword and a shield. The more you fight him, he'll begin losing armor and eventually his shield. Then his tactics change and he just goes berserk with only the sword. It makes boss battle more challenging imo. Once you beat a boss, a rift gate opens up that offers an additional challenge. Sometimes it's just a loot rift, other times its a mob of enemies that you have to fight. Pro:Fun gameplay. Dark Souls like with good powers.Difficult enemies: Bosses and regulars offer a decent challenge. Great Visuals: Game looks really good.Amazing Armor and Weapons: Both weapons and armor look really cool. Cons:Bad Optimization: The game has suffered from FPS drops since day one. Even with a powerful rig, you're still gonna get drops no matter what.Bug: Lots of bugs in this game. It's nowhere near as bad as it was, but it needed more time for polish. Pointless Story/Characters: The story and characters are pretty pointless. Not once did I care what happened to anyone in the game, and the story is very predictable. Overall, I really enjoyed this game. I wouldn't tell anyone to pick it up at full price, but if you see it on a sale for $20 or less, its completely worth your time. The game was directed to be a more casual friendly DS-like game, but it still offers a good challenge. 7.5/10			"

												I'm glad I saw this game on sale. I know people like to hate on it for trying to be like dark souls. While it does have some systems similar to dark souls, most of them other than the combat itself are more interesetng. It also looks better than any dark souls.I am only 6.3 hours into this, and I can tell this is a pretty good game. The story doesn't have the depth of the souls series, but at least you get dialoge choices when dealing with other characters. The XP multiplier sustem is awesome, it really makes you be cautious about taking damage and wasting your heal consumables.  The crafting system is way deeper than the current iteration of the souls game for sure. I haven't seen enough of it to determine if it's better than the previous souls titles yet. The combat is also slow like it was in the first dark souls. All in all, they are different games with different mechanics and systems. The inspiration is undeniable though.I would recommend this game.			"

												My personal rating 8/10. I hope you guys enjoy it as much as i did.Lords of the fallen is a great game. Just like any other on release date it had some issues , few crashes and few frame drops there and there, but overall it is a very good game. I personaly expierenced only 3 crashes in over 19 hours of gameplay, posibly because i played it all maxed out @1920-1080 with a single gtx 970 not even overclocked. I had a stable 60 fps most of the time. Pros:Beautiful graphics. not to bash the Dark Souls 2 but man, this game just blows it out of the water, it's really something to look at.Very responsive controls, combat feels fluent. it's always a challange even if you facelower lvl monsters from earlier areas, so you gotta keep your guard up.Cons:As i have mention above, i have had a few crashes and few frame drops there and there. Other than that game worked solid.Possible improvements? i would very much like to have a map in this game, for that matter in any rpg game. It's surprising how in 2014 we still get games which haven't got maps, in my opinion it's just absurd.			"

												I have been playing this game for about 8 hours. I will still play it for many hours because...well this game is awesome. From the outstanding and gritty voice acting, too the UI style and the graphics. I think it looks really well on my high end PC with everything set to max. Real eyecandy. The story so far is very immersive, the charachters are realistic and everything has a grim touch too it. Yes it looks like Dark Souls, yes its hard and you'll die a lot....like Dark Souls. But it still stands on its own legs because the battles, the bosses and the controls as well as charachter development are all really better then Dark Souls..in my opinion. This game makes the perfect combination of magic use, weapons and shields. Everything can be used instantly without going thought countless of menus and then selecting and equiping it. Aside from that, there are a few sidequests, not too much but a few. The game offers a wide variety of weapons and...ARMOR. LOTS AND LOTS OF ARMOR. All the armors looks different and it really looks cool. Heavy armor makes you walk in a different and sluggish style, while light and medium armor makes you more flexible.If you are a Dark Souls fan and you're looking for a game in a similair fashion..look no further. Just buy the game and enjoy it. Im really looking forward too a sequel.			"

												I haven't played Darks Souls or Bloodborne yet, but I have to say that Lords of the Fallen is amazing title. And what matter here, I am not a big fan of action RPG games. I've found a lot of fun in here. Especially because of challenging boss fights. Even though you must repeat these skirmishes quite often and sometimes it's little frustrating, finally you will appreciate youself as a player!Sure, this is not a game for everyone. But if you aren't a totally casual gamer, you have to check this game. [8/10]			"

												Epicure said that death is an absence of sensation that can't be feared, because when your dead, you're not here anymore to feel it. I suppose Lords of the Fallen defies that paradox, because I felt boredom at a level of near-death experience. I play for so many years at video game, it never happened to me before that I felt such a boredom fighting that first boss. Sure graphics are supernice. Alright. Pilotwings's on SNES were wonderful too in their time. It is very tough and punitive. I have never played Dark souls or games alike before. But this is clearly overrated and ten thousand leagues under Skyrim and Fable. There's no concrete plot, and ambiance fades as you try to reach your decreasing XP at each death. That fight seems like keep on repeating the fable of the lion and the gnat, and I suppose the whole game is of that stuff. There is more thrill at beginning a 1000 pages book, for you'll not be to reread a thousand times the same pages. That clearly ain't worth the price, pows. Unless you're fan of the Darksouls-like genre.			"

												I decided not to review this game until after I beat it. And after beating it, I can say that I really enjoyed this game. It is ""soulsy"" but it has enough differences in design and gameplay that its not a simple copy. The magic in particular feels a lot different. Since it acts mainly as a secondary combat choice, it never forces you to go full caster. The level design is also different, it feels really full and there are a lot more open spaces than in dark souls, but it is definitely smaller, and you can tell. There is no real late game areas, the mobs just get replaced with harder versions. The boss fights were all pretty fun and have cool sub challenges within them. The boss variety does leave something to be desired. Almost all the fights are in some sort of arena. The combat is actually really fun. A lot of people call it clunky but I just think its heavier. Everything just seems to hit harder, you included. For me though its the weapons and armor that really shine. There are a lot of sets and weapons for this size of game and every weapon you get usually is useful at the time you get it. All in all if you like the souls series or just like combat oriented rpgs you should check this out. 75/100ps. a lot of the performance issues and crashes have gotten better, not perfect...better.

												Third person action game with mechanics similar to Dark Souls 2.Graphics:High end graphics with a lot of indoor areas, however the cut scenes and NPCs are not that great. Also, if you get to close to a wall during a fight you will probably disappear from the screen and take damage from your enemy. Grade: 8/10Sound:SImple ambient music and sounds. Lots of sound reuse and similar sounds that trick you. You think there are more enemies, yet you just killed the last one. You open a chest and the sound tricks you into thinking a enemy is behind you.Grade: 6/10Controls:Copied directly from Dark Souls 2, which is not a bad thing. Right button to lock camera on enemy, L1 to defend, R1 to attack, B for magic, X for items...Grade: 9/10Game Story:Simple story and very straightforward, get ready to do a lot of backtracking and get lost forever indoors at areas that look all alike. Did I mention that I hate games like these not providing us a map? I do hate it.Grade: 7/10 (yes you lost points for not having a fu... map)Difficulty:There are enemies that are harder to beat than bosses, as some require you to find his heart before being able to kill it, others defend like hell and some explode after dying, killing you instantly if you do not retreat. The first boss fights are harder as you are a low level player. After you get to higher levels, the boss fights become a pacience game taking a longer time but easier in the end.Grade: 8/10General Grade: 7,5 - 8/10.			"

												""Lords of the Fallen"" takes a handful of mechanics from games such as Demon Souls and Dark Souls, which means the game's unforgiving until you get used to the basics, you will die often, and you play as a sword-and-board dude who runs circles (lol).Apart from running around the place (there's quite some backtracking), what you will be doing most of the time is combat, and - depending on your class - fighting can and will feel slow. I picked a warrior and found that many of the attacks were painfully sluggish. Eventually, I finished the game with a light 100% block shield and a one-hander, which feels... pretty standard for a fantasy game like this.If you don't want to play a warrior, you can also pick a dual-wielding rogue, or a cleric who can use staves. On top of this, all classes get a gauntlet weapon you can use to cast spells.The game feels very much eclectic. Core mechanics come from Dark Souls. The visuals are very much inspired by Diablo and World of Warcraft (weapon and armour design), but also by Darksiders (armour, puzzles, treasure chests, spell animations). The setting is very generic and I think it's LotF biggest problem - it just doesn't feel unique in any way. Even the story is bland and merely serves as a means of getting you from point A to point B in a pretty linear fashion.The game also has some technical problems and the devs are not too eager to fix them.""Lords of the Fallen.exe"" is a quite common issue that might annoy you more than dying over and over again (when you crash, you lose your progress).Mobs, and sometimes even bosses, can glitch out making them easier or harder to kill.To sum it up:If you liked Dark Souls give this game a shot when it's on sale.If you hated DS or this type of games is just not your thing, play something else. You won't like this one either. "

I have rage quited several times but I still come back to it. You move very slowly when attacking no matter what. There is allot of dodging as well.

												I have to say this games has its pros and cons just like any other game but I'll just say what I've noticed and you can decide for yourself if you want to try it or not. As a whole, I recommend it if you can get passed the things that drag it down a bit, I personally am satisfied with my purchase but I'm not jumping for joy over the game because I expected a bit more out of it. Some things I do like very much is that it has a good solid gameplay to it. The blocking in the game feels like actual blocking where you take no damage (if your energy is high enough to block the incoming attack). The weapon attacks are on the realistic side of the line as well; the heavier the weapon, the slower it swings. Even the dodging feels more realistic which could be good for some gamers and bad for others because you may end up dodging and still getting hit (e.g. the enemy swings at waist height and you dodge, the weapon might still hit you because it was low enough).The targeting can go both ways in this game, in can be a plus in some cases and a detriment in others, you'll have to decide what you like or dislike about it. The targetting locks on to your enemy of choice and you can swap enemies with a quick tap of your camera controls (Right analog if you use a gamepad) in either direction. The problems I have found with it though is there is no quick way to switch targets if one runs behind you (Which they do as a combat technique). Another issue I have found with it is that you can't target unless you have near full view of the enemy which makes it harder on you when coming through a narrow corridor and, unfortunately, there are invisible objects that can get in your way as well (e.g. I found one enemy standing beside a fire brazier and I couldn't target him even though I could clearly see him).""Energy"" is basically stamina. It is consumed by attacks (Both regular and power attacks though power attacks take more, obviously), blocking, dodging, as well as sprinting. Your energy recharges on its own at a decent rate, just back up out of range of the bad guy's attacks for a few seconds and your energy will fill up quickly. Your energy will still feel up if you are blocking but it will fill up much slower which means you can't just tank all the hits easily, you actually have to employ tactics to get your energy up while still taking as little damage as possible. I've noticed that bosses will have attacks to completely drain your energy (The first two will slap you with their shields to drain your energy to 0).The magic of the game can obviously play a good part in the game, I can't say I have gotten very far into the game (About 2 hours of gameplay) but I haven't found a need or even desire to use the magic in the game. The magic really isn't anything fantastic. You can heal yourself somewhat, raise your defence, increase attack, do a magic power attack, make a clone of yourself to distract the enemy, but nothing really all that great. You have three ""classes"" of magic, each has their own benefits.Visually it is fairly good. I can't say it has the best graphics in the world but it definitely has high quality. I'm a bit of a graphics snob and this game is good enough for me visually. I do have to say, the character models are lacking in their mesh morphs because the lip sync with the words is extremely off; laughably so. The characters move their mouths in much the same way as a ventriloquist's puppets do, basically just a jaw flapping down and back up, and they don't move in a way that really goes with the words, they just seem to move at random and half of the spoken words in the game don't have lip movements at all.The lack of character appearance customization may not appeal to everyone or even might make people completely refuse to play the game. I believe that the lack of character customization is simply because you are playing an existing character in this alternate reality instead of creating one. Unfortunately, there are no appearance choices at all. You don't choose hairstyles, genders, etc. You simply play the guy you see in the trailer with markings all over his face. If that doesn't bother you, then pay no heed to this paragraph (I am not bashing lack of character appearance customization, I don't mind either way depending on the game).The movement in the game is rather slow. You run slow, you sprint slow, you dodge slow, you attack slow. Even if you choose the light armor with dual daggers, you still dodge slow. The character is hulking and reminiscent of a golem with his movements. I can honestly say that I went with the daggers first but with the poor movement speed and little to no blocking that you would expect from a lightly armored and quick on their feet character, it was much harder than medium or heavy builds. I honestly didn't see any speed increase with the light build over the heavy build.You carry your exp around with you on your character and the more you carry the more you get from killing things. You don't get this reward with no risk, of course. You can't level anything up without spending the experience you have and if you die then all of the experience you have with you drops and you have to run back to where you were to get it. Over time, the experience amount will disipate until there is nothing left to recover. In essence, you gamble the experience you have so that you can earn more; the more you risk, the more you earn.All in all, I'm pleased with the game though the cons of the game do bother me a bit. I will consider this an overall positive yet neutral review and I hope it was informative rather than biased.Here is the biased part:Pros:-Good blocking-Good weapon weight/speed ratio-Good graphics-Simple tutorial-Great energy recharge rateCons:-Poor lip sync with dialog-Invisible walls preventing targeting-Targetting can prevent you from quickly turning to block an attack from behind-Magic system doesn't seem to be worth the effort-No character customization-Slow movement even when lightly armored			"

												This game borrows heavily from Demon Souls and Dark Souls, but compared to those games this one is far less frustrating but also not nearly as challenging. To me it was the perfect balence between challenge and fun gameplay and without a lot of the frustrating grind that is in Dark Souls.The Good:The Graphics and visual design - This is a truly gorgous game, great textures and enviroments comes to life with some awesome Nvidia effects and some great physics. Armor design is really good and they look really nice with the amazing clothing physics. You mostly travel through dark corridors and smaller open areas in this game, but they are very detailed and I never found the game lacked variety when it came to the world. Character lipsyncing and such is not that good though, but on the whole the graphics is outstanding. There are also some really cool looking monsters in the game.The Combat - I played as a Paladin type character focusing on Heavy Armor and Weapons and with some magic mixed in, such as healing. The game focuses on melee combat compared to most RPGs like this game and the game does it really well. Though the combat is very similar to the combat from Dark Souls.The Exploration and Loot - Throughout the game I loved exploring all corners finding new loot, especially since every new armor or weapon had a distinct look and very nice visuals. They are very stylized but very fitting to the setting the game takes place in.The AverageThe Boss Battles - There are some very cool and fun bosses in this game and I had fun taking most of them down. But some are a bit on the easy side though and they can seem a bit samey at times. Don't really have to change your tactics much. The bosses are not even close to as hard as in Dark Souls as I managed to take down most of the bosses on either my first or second try. But they are still fun to fight. It may be a much harder game on New Game+ but I have not tried that yet.The BadThe Story - The story is average to bad, the main character is your typical anti-hero gruff sounding bald guy who has very little interesting to say. You meet a few characters in the game but they don't really have much depth. There are some interesting aspects to the game but nothing that truly stood out. And some bad lipsyncing and presentation when it comes to dialog does not help. That being said it at least has a story and gives you a purpose for doing what you are doing.Lack of Information - This game has no quest log, so when you pick up a quest you pretty much have to remember where they say you should go. And most of the time you get no info at all so you pretty much have to find out by yourself. This is really tedious and very annoying. Hate having to resort to checking out a walkthrough just to find out where I have to actually go. And there are many items and such that lacks any info on what they actually do. Well that is that, it is a good game with some flaws. But I do recommend it for anyone who likes the combat in Demon Souls or Dark Souls but find those games to frustrating. Or to annyone who just want a pretty new world to explore and fight some cool looking bosses, and of course find that sweet sweet loot.			"

Posted: December 29, 2014
												I was interested in this game since release and finally picked it up during christmas sale of 2014. Dark Souls is one of my all time favorites, so I was ready to ignore negative steam reviews and form my own opinion. The game is highly recommended to every Souls games fan. It is also a nice introduction to these types of games, so if you really wanted to try Souls but wasn't sure it's for you, I'd recommend this game. It's somewhat easier and more friendly, so beginners will have good time playing it.First of all, it is a sure clon of Souls series games and I can't escape comparing it to them. Combat mechanics is absolutely the same, leveling up and saving is almost the same, the spirit of the Souls is here. But with a nice twists here and there. It is surely more a western game, then japanese for starters. The art and graphics are absolutely gorgeous, UI is fantastic and easy to use (which cannot be said about Souls), every mechanic is nicely explained and you don't need to read dozens of guides just to be able to do basic things. But it doesn't mean the game has no secrets, no. Like every Souls game you will miss a lot on your first playthrough, but that's okay.The things I would've liked to be improved in Lords Of The Fallen: - Content and length of the game. I finished it in 16 hours and that's counting some grinding. Locations lack variety, there are disappointing number of bosses and there's no ""wow"" effect like it was in Dark Souls. I hope next installment brings more epic fights in a bizzare locations - More class variety and leveling up options - More interesting and engaging NPCs. There were some, but nothing to write home about. The only interesting one I think was some dude you had to bring human skulls to - No multiplayer options. May be it was too difficult to achieve, but it would've been nice to at least place some clues for other people.And that's basicly it. Technical side wise the game run nice for me. It crashed only one time and there were couple wierd sound glitches, but nothing too bad or gamebreaking. Developers did nice job patching and I didn't encounter too much problems. Of course they should've shiped more polished game, but they didn't abandoned it, so it's all good.What I did like about Lords Of The Fallen: - Magic is more of an addition to the main combat then focus of it. I liked how easy it was to use and how uncomplicated the system was. It's more of a support style magic and I thought it worked great with this type of game - Design of the world, design of the weapons and armors. Absolutely fantastic. Every time I've put new set on myself, I couldn't believe it can look more bad♥♥♥♥♥ but then I've picked another one and once again was amazed. Just stellar job for designers. Great weapons, ugly enemies, great UI and overall vision. A+++ - Sound design. Music is awesome and right on the money, great ambient sound. Enemies make terrifying sounds. Great! - Although it's a secret, but you can completely respec into a differenet class during a game. Liked that a lot - Story is good. Not super great, but decent. And little pieces of it in form of audio logs were interesting - Different endings depending on what you did during a game, nice little addition - New game + of course - Challenges during boss fights were super nice addition - Level design with shortcuts that wraps around itselfIn the end, I would say that I enjoyed this game very much. In current state it has no technical problems any more and it's very fun. It's not as hard as Souls game, so a lot more people can enjoy it. I would purchase any future projects from this studio.

												I'm glad I saw this game on sale. I know people like to hate on it for trying to be like dark souls. While it does have some systems similar to dark souls, most of them other than the combat itself are more interesetng. It also looks better than any dark souls.I am only 6.3 hours into this, and I can tell this is a pretty good game. The story doesn't have the depth of the souls series, but at least you get dialoge choices when dealing with other characters. The XP multiplier sustem is awesome, it really makes you be cautious about taking damage and wasting your heal consumables.  The crafting system is way deeper than the current iteration of the souls game for sure. I haven't seen enough of it to determine if it's better than the previous souls titles yet. The combat is also slow like it was in the first dark souls. All in all, they are different games with different mechanics and systems. The inspiration is undeniable though.I would recommend this game.			"

												I have finished this game on a debatably medium PC. It has not crashed once on me. The 1.4 patch did wonders, I guess. Otherwise, I found the game to be quite entertaining. It has a small world, yes, but it's filled to the tip, and you'll be backtracking a lot, since some areas open only later in the game. The design is kind of power fantasy, you look like a spiky tank most of the time, and the enemies are grotesque. The combat is clunky, albeit realistic. It focuses on tactical blocking, evading and timing of your hits, and the heavy weapons WILL feel heavy (some of them need two hands to be used, regardless of your strength). It kinda forces you to use all the tools at your disposal, which is a good thing, since it varies the gameplay and forces you to think up strategies on the go. The main story is meh, but you are a criminal and you can totally mess up humanity if you chose one of the three possible endings, so in the end it's fine by my standards.			"

												A dark third-person action game that most gamers will find easier to get into than Dark Souls series, however, it doesn't quite have the depth of Dark Souls either.  There is less exploration, less variety int terms of builds and combat styles and no customization at all.That said, it does deliver a good combat style focused on slow, armored melee combat with various large and intimidating bosses.+Nice graphics+Good melee centric combat+Nice atmosphere and overall style+Interesting bosses-No customization-Limited variety of play styles-Some bugs, including crash bugs at launch that would stop play (mostly patched now)			"

												If you have the hardware to run this maxed out you are in for a treat. This is one of the best looking multiplatform games out right now. If not, no worries! The gameplay alone is worth playing Lords of the Fallen™. At its core, the game is all about preparation, strategy, and timing one powerful blow or a perfect succession of fast strikes against a vulnerable enemy. It gets tricky when there's multiple foes and little room to work with. That's where this game shines; when your heart races and you're praying you'll make it out alive. If not, that sucks. Just go find your ghost and regain all that precious lost experience points. Die on that one way trip? All is lost! There's a decent story full of lore and interesting characters, monsters, and set-pieces. There's also tons of armor, weapons, and other gear to keep you happy, and the best catch is what loot drops is tied to how much you are willing to wager you won't die. Cash in your experience and the loot multiplier is reset.I love it, and this is from someone who could never really get into the Souls series.P.S. I haven't had one crash or any other issues.			"

After lowering texture detail to low crash occurrences had reduced a lot, like once at 6 hours.  If it was bug free I would recommend easily, but if you want risk free gaming maybe you should pass this.Update :  I can confirm this. Finished the game without a crash  after changing TEXTURE DETAIL to LOW:(. If you have a nvidia card and your game is crashing TRY IT!!!.			"

												Is Lords of the Fallen a good game or is it a bad game? Well, it depends. It's most certainly not a terrible game. It's not that great either. It's like if you took Dark Souls and played it on 1/3rd of the speed, and the game (including the uninspired and monotonous bossfights that hardly ever present a challenge) is mostly pretty easy and boring/tedious. The visuals are pretty nice, though, even if the artistic direction is kinda generic (as is the disjointed and bland narrative and lore), but rather demanding from a performance point of view.My bottom line would be – if you try to make a clone of Dark Souls games (which is what this game clearly and undeniably is, even if some people get really mad when you mention this), changing things here and there just for the sake of not being a direct DS clone without really understanding what really makes Dark Souls such a great series might not be the best idea. I would very much like to see a Dark Souls game with the visuals of LotF. I'd rather not see LotF game with the visuals of Dark Souls, if you get what I mean. Nice graphics really isn't the most important thing to look for in a game.In the end, I give LotF recommended, but an unforgettable instant classic like Dark Souls it ain't. Take it as a 6/10, if you will.(You can read my full review at http://english.edgeoftheworld.cz/2015/08/23/lords-of-the-fallen-review/ if you wish.)			"

												Stupid crashes. Patch fixed. I played this game a lot, don't know why. Maybe because fighting isn't clunky and frustrating as ♥♥♥♥ compared to Souls. Your choices just change the ending cinematic and gives you achievements (yay achievements!), and some of your choices can actually ♥♥♥♥ you (not cutting the dude's arm and helping him with potion will not let you get super potions near the end of the game). New Game + Is like Souls except we don't get new monsters, but we do get new lore (the lore is infinitely better than the game's main story). Also, not ALL monsters will get strong with the NG+ so you will get very confused most of the time, and will get one-shot without realzing. Warrior is easy as ♥♥♥♥, if you play this game as warrior you will have the worst experience, unless you don't upgrade your Faith for the absurd spells. Rogue gives the best experience, even though the i-frames are a joke. Cleric is fun as heck. You will have the worst time ever at the final battle, if you went full faith without using the gauntlet. Overall 7.5/10.I enjoyed the game a lot, more than Souls, honestly, but Souls is much better polished (except for the ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating combat mechanics).			"

												This is a review from someone who loved Darksiders (I had graphical issues with 2, so that was a bummer), loved Kingdoms of Amalur, liked Skyrim but hated the way the third-person was done, and played Dark Souls 2 (on PC) for one hour before getting a refund (my first refund request on Steam in seven years).I bought this game as a filler between Borderlands Pre-Sequel and Dragon Age: Inquisition, but I was horribly wrong in thinking that this game would be just a mediocre filler..Lords of the Fallen is downright amazing.  As most people have said, it plays extremely similar to Dark Souls; however where Dark Souls utterly failed, Lords of the Fallen succeeds in leaps and bounds.Here are my pros and cons:Pros The controls!  Nothing kills a game for me more than bad controls (which extends to graphical UI as well).  Lords of the Fallen, as I compare it to Dark Souls, has amazing control and ,once you get used to all of the mechanics, gives the player a feeling of personal extension. The challenge!  Okay, I know a lot of people are rolling their eyes.  ""Pfft!  This game is totes easy, noob!""  At times it can be, and then at other times it is pretty brutal.  This is not the typical forgiving game that rewards players just for showing up.  But the real great part is that you, the player, grow with your character.  First you struggle to get a hit in while also blocking and every enemy seems to take 3/4 of your life and your health potions are dwindling.  But a few hours later, that same enemy is swinging at air while you are crushing his head in with ease and losing even 1/10th of your life seems like you just lost focus for a moment.  There is definitely a very rewarding feeling when you grow better as a player instead of just gathering more stat points to win the RNG fight. The variety!  Between strength, agility, and faith weapons, gauntlets, shields, and class spells there is quite a long list of different ways to bash your enemies face in.. and this is without taking into account Runes or Legendary weapon special abilities!  Everything has an optimal use, so there is very little ""useless junk"" lying around. The replayability!  Ever get frustrated that you run out of enemies to kill, or there is no point in starting a new character?  Lords of the Fallen doesn't have that problem.  Enemies respawn everytime you change instances (which actually slows everything down quite a bit), and the classes are varied enough to warrant at least a few playthroughs. The sound effects are good, but for me that is just icing and not really anything that would keep me or stop me from playing.Cons Graphics Optimization.  Now bare with me here.  The graphics are amazing.. truly, and the art style of the armor, weapons, and character models is inspiring.  But I am used to my quaint gtx660 being able to handle most games at either High, Very High, or Ultra depending on the demands.  Lords of the Fallen has me sitting at Medium, and even then I feel the UI lag at times (especially when using spells that have persistent graphical effects).  I can only assume that there has to be some optimization issues there, but it is certainly not written in stone. Once you find your fav weapon, spell, or armor the game can get a little repetitive.  However this is something that happens in all games, and admittedly this game suffers from this problem far less than others.  Definitely a minor issue.That is about all I can think of.  I look forward to a sequel in the future.  For those who are on the fence about buying this one, as long as your money isn't making you choose between this or Dragon Age: Inquisition, then I would definitely place this one very, very high on the list.  Best action RPG I have played since Darksiders 1. "

												The biggest problem with this game isnt that its a dark souls rip-off. The problem is that its a terrible one. Combat is slow and sluggish. Enemies have little variety to their attacks which means you'll learn everything there is to know about every creature encounter the first time you fight them. Generic story. Framerate issues. linear gameplay. Only 3 classes that feel extremly similar. Don't buy this game. just don't.			"

The game is very fun the story not much though, but what i care about this game was the gameplay since it looks similer to dark souls (one of my favorite game of all time) it's not an easy game like everyone is saying and at some places you will rage more than dark souls :P.Overall i haven't finished the game yet but i loved it just like dark souls so if you are a fun of dark souls you must play this one !

You can't swing greataxe with one hand like it was broom.+Great graphics. CONS:-Short. ~ 15 hours on first run.-Unbalanced. I played with warrior and it felt super easy. I killed almost all bosses on first try. But playing with rogue is much much harder.-Unbalanced weapons. After you kill first boss you get two handed sword which is better than half of other two handed weapons that you will get later in game.-No replay value. In ng+ first montsters (blind ones) doing 4 dmg to my warrior when I have few hundreds hp :|-No real story. There is like 8 npc that you can interact with.

												First of all - recommended requirements are a joke.i7-4770K, 16GB RAM, GeForce GTX 670 and I can run game on high only in closed, not too big rooms. Playing on very high is not possible. Even on high, I wasn't able to deal with some bosses/monsters. Oh and sometimes game crashes to desktop killing my graphic driver, what requires restart of PC (happened maybe 3 or 4 times but still).Besides these problems, game is quite good. If anyone played Dark Souls, he should also like this one. There are some buggy moments (spiders floating over edges) or fighting problems (when you die and don't know why), but besides that I liked the whole game. Oh and there are appareantly some translation problems, but maybe only in Polish version (""press KEY to increase better rune chance"" WHAT KEY?!) I hope for some fixes from the creators and some BIG and decent DLC campaing.			"

												This game is not dark souls, it takes some of the dark souls ideas and game play, makes it easier, simpler and more friendly for casual gamers. if you are a hard core gamer or one that spent a lot of time on dark souls. this game will not last long as you soon realise what works best and will beat the game in a short period of time.Mobs do not hit that hard and when you realise how each one moves you will soon take all of them down. Even though the game offers a few different weapon and armour types, you will find that you go for a mid range weight encoumberment and a mid speed weapon. This is because high speed weapons do next to no damage to mobs/bosses, you will never be able to use a big weapon as they are far to slow also being to heavy ( fatman rolling ) doesnt work. and it wont take long to realise that rolling is pritty much pointless bar a few mobs and side stepping is faster, you stay on your feet for that back stab kill.The any mob will kill you aproach to dark souls is not needed to be taken on this game. But the big downside to this game is there is no real replay worth,      As you can only get items that you havent picked up on your first run so if you explored really well you have already done most things.      Mobs are a little harder to kill as they have more hit points, you know how to kill them and it is so easy you will find that you will go as far as possible without spending exp just for a little bit of risk. so far im just past the 5th boss on the second run through and i havent banked once. I have put recomended on this game as i have enjoyed playing it, all be that its a little to easy, some times hit reg is a bit dodgy, and there was a few crashes near the end of the game. But......if you are not a hardcore gamer, and you havent spent time on either dark souls game. This game is fun it will entertain and will pose a slight challenge to you, looks reasonably good, and after you have done this you might be tempted to really challenge yourself and buy the dark souls games. 10X longer but 10X the challange.

Also, if you get to close to a wall during a fight you will probably disappear from the screen and take damage from your enemy. Grade: 8/10Sound:SImple ambient music and sounds. Lots of sound reuse and similar sounds that trick you. You think there are more enemies, yet you just killed the last one. You open a chest and the sound tricks you into thinking a enemy is behind you.Grade: 6/10Controls:Copied directly from Dark Souls 2, which is not a bad thing. Right button to lock camera on enemy, L1 to defend, R1 to attack, B for magic, X for items...Grade: 9/10Game Story:Simple story and very straightforward, get ready to do a lot of backtracking and get lost forever indoors at areas that look all alike. Did I mention that I hate games like these not providing us a map? I do hate it.Grade: 7/10 (yes you lost points for not having a fu... map)Difficulty:There are enemies that are harder to beat than bosses, as some require you to find his heart before being able to kill it, others defend like hell and some explode after dying, killing you instantly if you do not retreat. The first boss fights are harder as you are a low level player. After you get to higher levels, the boss fights become a pacience game taking a longer time but easier in the end.Grade: 8/10General Grade: 7,5 - 8/10.			"

												Epicure said that death is an absence of sensation that can't be feared, because when your dead, you're not here anymore to feel it. I suppose Lords of the Fallen defies that paradox, because I felt boredom at a level of near-death experience. I play for so many years at video game, it never happened to me before that I felt such a boredom fighting that first boss. Sure graphics are supernice. Alright. Pilotwings's on SNES were wonderful too in their time. It is very tough and punitive. I have never played Dark souls or games alike before. But this is clearly overrated and ten thousand leagues under Skyrim and Fable. There's no concrete plot, and ambiance fades as you try to reach your decreasing XP at each death. That fight seems like keep on repeating the fable of the lion and the gnat, and I suppose the whole game is of that stuff. There is more thrill at beginning a 1000 pages book, for you'll not be to reread a thousand times the same pages. That clearly ain't worth the price, pows. Unless you're fan of the Darksouls-like genre.			"

												This is a great budget version of Dark Souls. One thing I'll say is that this game is a whole lot easier than Dark Souls. Most bosses I beat my first time. It's not because I'm super amazing. Actually, I was really lazy and just tanked my way through the bosses.Unlike Dark Souls, armor actually makes a huge deal. If you're wearing heavy armor, you don't need to dodge because attacks will barely do any damage and you can just heal it off if you need to. That's seriously how I did most bosses.It's still a really fun game though even if it's a tad easy. I recomend it for everyone, especially for the price. I had low expectations after playing it on Playstation where I got it free, but the terrible framerate made it unplayable. Much better experience at 60+ FPS			"

												Good:If you play it not expecting Dark Souls, you will have a good time.This game is better than most games out there but sadly in my opinion it had a rough launch and got a somewhat bad reputation from the get go.I bought this game expecting a buggy mess with pretty graphics but with a few hours of playtime. I can honestly say, even after spending many, many hours with the Souls games that, this game is different, rich in weapons and content and fun to play. It is so satisfying to hit things in this game. The multiplier (not multiplayer, this game is strictly singleplayer)- system is a great addition where you can go back to previous areas ang kill weaker enemies to increase your multiplier, and then go and earn some major exp.Sure, the enemies and the locations can get a LITTLE repetetive but no where close to what people are saying, I mean the detailed enviornments are incredible and well layed out. It FEELS like you are making progress and it is FUN.It is not Dark Souls, it does not even come close to that complexity, but it does not fall flat on it's face.The enemy A.I is good and it manages to surprise you. The same goes for the Bosses. Some bosses are harder than those in Dark Souls... I do not know if this game intended this or if it is a result of poor balancing but you can get DESTROYED in a few areas, which is good.There are so many weapons and Armours, and granted you will not use them all, they are there to play around with.The rune system to imbue your gear is good and simple and gives you a reason to grind some enemies, if you like grinding that is.Bad:The lore is forgettable and not really interesting at all, but luckily you can totally bypass it. It would have been better to not have ANY lore, then there might have been a mystery to solve but for some reason they went with a lackluster story.There are a few bugs I have noticed, with closed doors looking like they are open and one crash when switching weapons. I have also heard that there might be a game breaking bug after fighting the second boss but I have not noticed it.The new game system is kind of a gray zone for me. You can not play with the same character past NG++. It is not unlimited like Dark Souls.TLDR:The combat is satisfying and you can choose to play in whatever way you want. There are not many spells but you can use them all. Level up, get stronger, progress. Forget the story and just kill stuff in a very, very pretty world. It is hard enough and the bosses are rewarding. Everything is so BUFF AND COOL AND AWESOME LOOKING OMG. Really good artists. This is one of those hidden gems, plagued with a few issues and a bad reputation, but if you can see past it, you might just love it. "

												game is ok, not good but ok.Technical issues havent been fixed in almost two years of patching, which is a let down.The gameplay itself borrows alot from Dark Souls, which sounds great, but its not the best from DS, they took the worst and multiplied it.Every second enemy hides behind a shield, turning the game into a long drawn out series of circle strafing and dodging trying to get behind them, the other option for dealing with them is shooting them with the gauntlet for minimal damage OR charging into them with your own shield and using a very small window to whittle down thier HP with one or maybe two hits, rinse/repeat till dead.Some of the level design is nothing more than a series of corridors, which with the enemy mentioned above becomes one of the most frustrating things i have ever come across in a game, if you cant get around it or go through it, well ♥♥♥♥ good luck getting that over with quickly.About the only praise i do have for the game itself is the EXP system which rewards you more for enemies killed without using checkpoints, the multiplier on how much an enemy is worth goes up the more you kill without using a Crystal (bonfire) which would be awesome if the fear of random crashes, freezes and driver destruction didnt put the fear of losing all your progress in you, which makes this system useless unless you exploit it, which is way too easily done.I picked the game up for five bucks on a sale and cant really say its worth the money, if they ever get it working in a stable manner then maybe.

												I was waiting until I finish this game to make a review about it. I was hoping that if I finished the Story it would surprise me but I decided to make the review even before that. And why? Because this game is not good. Period. I didn't play a lot of Dark Souls to compare it to, but I can recognize a broken game.  I had huge expectations about this game, but now I really regret that I pre-purchased it. It's not worth the price. And I'll probably won't purchase other CI titles.Some reasons that I don't recommend this game (Warning: Spoiler Alert)- I lost the count of how many time I was holding the defense button with the shield selected, facing my opponent and with full action bar and, even with all these things right, I ended up receiving damage from my enemies and dying. - When you're using the gauntlet you can shoot at an enemy holding a huge shield that covers all his body and he'll take damage anyway.  - At the same time, you'll face some archers that will shoot fire arrows at you and, even holding a shield the whole time, you'll take fire damage. - The enemies (archers specially) can see you from far away and they'll hit you for sure. No matter how far you are. What else do I have noticed? The game crashes sometimes.* Do I have anything good about this game?Only that the graphics are impressive. But, what good is having great graphics if the game does not work right?If you have any interest in this game, wait for a huge promotion. That's my advice. "

												Why i cannot recommend this game, is not because i have to deal with several technical issues like others, it´s the combat system. It is true, that it is slower than Dark Souls, but only for the Player character. The attack speed is too slow, no matter what weapon (greatswords f.e. are so slow, they are already useless), while the enemy strikes with fast attacks.Same goes for staggering, till you raise your weapon, the enemy has his shield already up.

												First off, most of the reviews complaining about the optimization problems are no longer valid. That being said, there is no excuse for games these days especially non-indie titles, to be released as beta feeling as this game was. Unforunately that seems to be just par for the course these days in the industry and I won't let my personal feelings on that matter apply here.This game is a third person action rpg that uses a similar control set-up to the dark souls games and leveling system, but that is where the similarities really end. You do gain and lose your experience by killing/dying and must go to where you died to retrieve your exp. This exp does start to disappear overtime though, and you're not likely to retrieve most of your exp if you're very far from a checkpoint.The game's difficulty is not high, and most of the struggles you'll face are at the beginning, and very end of the game. The mid-game seems unbalanced and you will be mowing through most enemies.The combat is much faster paced than the Souls games and I'd say it's about a mid-ground between that and Darksiders 2's combat. They did an excellent job of making each weapon type feel differently and I feel the physics here surpass the Souls series by far. The staff weapons were incredibly overpowered during the time I played the game due to it's fast attack speed and good scaling damage. This could always be fixed in balance patches or mods however. The bosses were fairly underwhelming, but there are a good variety of enemy types which take different tactics in order to combat as opposed to the souls series (lock on and circle) method of killing just about everything which detracts from my enjoyment of that particular franchise. There were multiple ways to defeat a few of the bosses, and this allowed you to receieve special equipment upon killing them which I thought was a rather neat addition. Some of the weaker and early bosses become elite enemies that you will fight throughout the game as well, forcing you to adapt your combat style when fighting them as well as a group of lesser enemies at the same time.There are many collectibles in the game, and while the lore is pretty generic, it's still interesting enough to warrant collecting all the scrolls and finding the secret equipment (which there is a good number of).The games length was decent, and it could probably be played through 2-3 times in order to play different styles, and colelct the new game + gear, however, new game+ difficulty does not scale nearly fast enough in order for it to be a challenge.As a final note, I do recommend the game, and while it's not anywhere near perfect, there are some innovative ideas here, and I'd like to see a sequel one day improve on what worked, and change what didn't. This is definitely the best game this particular studio has made to date, and I think they should be supported for adding some creativity to this genre which is pretty much dominated by a single franchise at this point.

												Love the graphic design and gameplay of game.  It is easier, and IMO better than DS and DSII, especially because of graphic design and no forced multiplayer, I liked Demon Souls more though.  Really enjoy game even though it is kicking my butt.  It's easier than the Souls series but in no way easy.  This game will not hold your hand so if you only like casual games this game isn't for you.Have no problems with game crashing or framerate issues, etc on my system after 13+ hours of play on my i5 2500 HD 5850 8 GB RAM and Windows 7.  I however don't run any background utilities, don't use steam cloud or steam overlay and scan system every few days for viruses.			"

												While not leaving as strong an impact as Dark Souls did years ago, Lords of the Fallen has the same great Dark Souls combat, a brooding atmosphere, and truly spectacularly challenging boss fights. The only downside is the forgettable story and characters, but those are of little importance when the combat is weighty, precise, and rewarding. And being a single player game, you can't rely on that online co-operative crutch that can make Dark Souls boss fights incredibly trivial.Maybe a little too expensive to recommend at full price, but before you just pass it off as a Dark Souls rip-off, I implore you to give it a proper look.

Not just stand back and cheap them with projectile magic.It's georgous. You'll need a high end PC to run it but it's worth it. You pick a class, which only really effects the available magic spells and maybe initial stats. But after that, you pick and choose both your stats and play style, which is mostly generated by your weapon and armor choices.Definitely a unique experience.			"

												Being a Dark Souls 1 & 2 player, this game definitely feels easier yet still somewhat challenging. The game is different compared to Dark Souls yet similar. Combat is slower and it really feels like your character is wielding a massive weapon. It really makes the hits you deal feel satisfying. I played as a pure wreckingball wearing the heaviest of armours and a masssive 2h greatsword/axe and I always enjoyed the fights. I didn't experience any clunkiness in contrary to other reviewers. I cannot really comment on the spells since I only used the projectile of the gauntlet to pull enemies.I think the game felt a bit short, I spent 12.5 hours on my first playthrough although I didn't visited previously explored places to retrieve all treasure. I did enjoy every minute of it besides getting lost a couple of times. I also liked the music a lot in this game.I would definitely pick this up when it's on discount if you're a fan of the genre!

												game is ok, not good but ok.Technical issues havent been fixed in almost two years of patching, which is a let down.The gameplay itself borrows alot from Dark Souls, which sounds great, but its not the best from DS, they took the worst and multiplied it.Every second enemy hides behind a shield, turning the game into a long drawn out series of circle strafing and dodging trying to get behind them, the other option for dealing with them is shooting them with the gauntlet for minimal damage OR charging into them with your own shield and using a very small window to whittle down thier HP with one or maybe two hits, rinse/repeat till dead.Some of the level design is nothing more than a series of corridors, which with the enemy mentioned above becomes one of the most frustrating things i have ever come across in a game, if you cant get around it or go through it, well ♥♥♥♥ good luck getting that over with quickly.About the only praise i do have for the game itself is the EXP system which rewards you more for enemies killed without using checkpoints, the multiplier on how much an enemy is worth goes up the more you kill without using a Crystal (bonfire) which would be awesome if the fear of random crashes, freezes and driver destruction didnt put the fear of losing all your progress in you, which makes this system useless unless you exploit it, which is way too easily done.I picked the game up for five bucks on a sale and cant really say its worth the money, if they ever get it working in a stable manner then maybe.

												This game cannot avoid being compared to the Souls series. So I'll split this review into two parts, first I'll describe it for those, who's not familiar with Souls games, the second part will be a comparison between LOTF and DS1+21. If you've never ever played Souls series, this part is for you.LOTF is a strictly single player game where you most of the time you fight with enemies and spend the rest on rare cinematics, dialogs and playing around with your stats and equipment. Imagine a Diablo game with direct control over a character and you'll get the feeling of what this game consists of. Right, this is a melee-oriented action game, not an RPG. A good news here is that the action part is great. It's not a Devil May Cry or Castlevania madness of endless combos and dashes, the fight here is much slower, but also more realistic. It requires (mostly) less reaction, but more thinking. The strategy depends greatly on a build you create (which can be changed relatively easy mid-game), but mostly relies on managing stamina and timings. Controls are good and the battles are satisfying. If not, just try another battle style, you can switch whenever you want.Some claim this game to be hardcore. What this means in this game, is that generally your build and gear do not limit you much, though having higher stats and better equipment definitely helps. You can beat any situation you meet with anything you have. That's great. But the thing is that each time you meet something new it'll try to make you invent a new tactics to overcome it. Bosses have different mechanics. Regular enemies get new weapons with different movesets and defense tools, locations change from corridors to labyrinths, etc. If you can't beat something, you just need to make a stop and ask yourself a question ""How should I adapt to this using my resources?"" The game is quite balanced in this aspect, even though it's not obvious from the first glance.This lead to the next aspect - punishment. The game is planned in a way to kill you. Each time you meet a new type of enemy you could die due to your old tactics not working. Each new boss requires some new strategy to take on him, sometimes you'll not be able to adopt from the first attempt, etc. You'll die, and you'll loose some of the experience that you've gathered lately, and the mobs will respawn. Other than that you don't loose anything at all, so that small piece of experience doesn't matter, you'll get it again from the same mobs.  The point is if something killed you, learn how to avoid it next time and then go kill it yourself. This is a point of the game.Story wise, it's average. It's enough to explain nicely why you go somewhere killing something, but is not good enough to keep you intrigued like other games do. Not a problem, this game is not played for it's story anyway.2. How is this similar to or different from Souls?I haven't played Demon Souls, so I'm comparing it only to Dark Souls 1 + 2 + DLC for both of them. I don't want to spend you time here as you know the basics, so I'll just provide the list of pros/cons+ Pros:Skill still means much more than stats and equipmentAlmost identical to DS  battle mechanicsAlmost identical to DS controlsArmor really protects you from physical attacks, not just slows you downGreat variety of weapons and armorsArmor comes in setsLight and heavy builds differ more than in SoulsSome regular enemies really make you change tacticsBosses have unique mechanicsCan get unique versions of already unique boss weaponsSide quests seem as side quests, not like hidden achievements you randomly accomplishBackstabs and parries still rockYou can go to areas where you are not planned to be yet early in the game. Harder enemies for better loot and exp.No cheap deaths and dirty tricks (woo, what a nice narrow roof, and what are that new types of enemies on the other side? New archers of some sort? Gonna come closer to see what they can do :D )- Cons:The story is much palerNo multiplayerPoise is not explained in game well enough (attack power vs poise)Battle seems slower (in reality it's not that slow, but it seems, dunno why)Less variety of enemiesBosses seem to be much easierVery little punishment for deathLess supply itemsThe world is not seamless+/- Different:""Bonefires"" here work differently. No DS-style buffs on weaponsMelee oriented. Ranged and magic were planned for support mainly.Warhammer-like visual style instead of medieval-phantasy styleNG, NG+, NG++ only, each new plus opens extra options for development of your characterAction takes place on a much smaller area, but it's planned/detailed much better than in DSNo fast travel, but a lot of shortcuts, more like DS1Crafting is much simpler, but allows experiments as all materials can be extracted back againMy personla rant:No guesture to praise the sun? Seriously? C'mon devs, it should be added to all games!My personal opinion:This is not DS and not a clone. Don't expect it to give you more DS content. However it's still a singleplayer good game with very similar battle mechanic and a different risk/rewad system. If you liked playing DS without much coo/pvp, you'll probably like this. If you liked playing mi/maxed characted on higher NG+ playthoughs pushing over the edge or played mostly for CooP, I think you could skip this.			"

												im going to first say that if you want to buy this game as a bloodbourne warm up (if you have a ps4) then id hold your purchase. when this game works properly it plays well. the problem here is that is crashes far too often and with the check point system this can mean losing all progress made after departing the last crystal. To put it in other words; its like the game crashing is the same as dying in game. if this incredibly frustrating issue ever gets fixed then I can safely say that this is a good somewhat souls style action RPG.gameplay: if you played the souls franchise this game will feel fimiliar if slower. the biggest emphisase in combat is timing, dont get greedy. there is magic in the game but dont expect it to be as varied as dark souls as there are only two types: your starting class spells and a magic gaunlet found later. there are 3 classes each with four spells to level. the class system however only appiles to magic, all other aspects such as equipment and weapons are talored to stats. so i you played a souls game you know what to expect there. most of the enemies in the game are well designed with a few frustrating exeptions depending on what play style your going for. the best fights in the game are the bosses not counting the final (which is a bit of a letdown), which demand cunning and strategy. you feel an emense sense of satifaction when you finally bring one down gaining a special reward after a victory. the only downside is that there are a limited number in the game. as for the common enemies, there are 2 that will quite possibly make you rage quit a few times. one has the ability sap health from you at a range as well as put defence thorns on himself (if you hit him you also hit yourself) and one you need to fing a jar containing an item to pick up or he will constantly regenerate at critical health. if the game balanced these out more it would be a better product but for now they are a head ache. and if your looking for an online aspect, there is none. story: not much to talk about here. the story is presented in a more traditional manor than dark souls but even so it realy only amounst to ""dark god sends demons, kill them and save the world."" the charater you play, that is Harkyn is your typical brooding tough guy with no personality what so ever they might as well had a silent protaginast. there are npc to interact with but they are just as booring. the only reason to progress in the game is to see all the cool armour sets and weapons in the game. there are instaces of player choice but you will often not realy care about the out come of these nor do they realy matter in the end. all in all the story feels phoned in. level design & art: symply amazing, the level design is brilliant in how sprailing and interwoven the world is. as for the art, this is one of the best examples of high gothic dark fantasy I have ever seen. weapons and armour all have this gloriously powerful and embolding look to them like somthing out of warhammer fantasy. the bosses have the look of giants clad in imposing dark armour brandishing fearsome weapons. if the developers put in as much effort into the bug testing of the game i would give this a recomendation. technical: this is where the game has problems. there area far to many minor bugs in regards to the sound and ui to count. there are far to many instances of enemies shooting trough walls or walking out of backstab animations or extreame hit box problems to say this is a must buy. but the one thing that keeps this game so low is the constant crashing. the biggist fear i had while playing this game was not from the towering demons but from the ""lords of the fallen has stoped working"" screen. when this happens, you lose all progress gained from the last check point including looted items. this is unacceptable for a game that wants to be this punishing. Summary: Lords of the fallen is a game that has the potential to but much greater if some key glaring problems are fixed but for now, wait for this game to be patched.  "

												I was waiting until I finish this game to make a review about it. I was hoping that if I finished the Story it would surprise me but I decided to make the review even before that. And why? Because this game is not good. Period. I didn't play a lot of Dark Souls to compare it to, but I can recognize a broken game.  I had huge expectations about this game, but now I really regret that I pre-purchased it. It's not worth the price. And I'll probably won't purchase other CI titles.Some reasons that I don't recommend this game (Warning: Spoiler Alert)- I lost the count of how many time I was holding the defense button with the shield selected, facing my opponent and with full action bar and, even with all these things right, I ended up receiving damage from my enemies and dying. - When you're using the gauntlet you can shoot at an enemy holding a huge shield that covers all his body and he'll take damage anyway.  - At the same time, you'll face some archers that will shoot fire arrows at you and, even holding a shield the whole time, you'll take fire damage. - The enemies (archers specially) can see you from far away and they'll hit you for sure. No matter how far you are. What else do I have noticed? The game crashes sometimes.* Do I have anything good about this game?Only that the graphics are impressive. But, what good is having great graphics if the game does not work right?If you have any interest in this game, wait for a huge promotion. That's my advice. "

												This game was inspired by Dark Souls, with emphasis on the combat execution, sharp controls and tough enemies. I liked that this game is fair, so whenever you got killed, you were aware why that happened. Also the game does reward the more curious and determined players by having plenty of secrets, or several tougher side-quests. Your choice of magic and weaponry does affect the gameplay significantly, I found myself testing out different weapons against different enemies, because the different weapons have different moves. Your agility is also affected by how much you are burdened, so playing as a dual-knife-wielding rogue in cloth armor feels very different from a steel-clad knight waving a giant polesword. Graphics and enemy design are very satisfying, sometimes stepping into the grotesque, but nothing that breaks the atmosphere. Detailed textures, particle effects, good animations - all present. As you play along, you get to know each enemy type and how to beat them. But sometimes the bad guys synergize in a killer combinations and then you have to pull them from the pack and dispatch them one by one.Level design is also inspired by Dark Souls, using a hub-like system with interconnected locations, where you unlock shortcuts as you progress, eliminating the need for fast travel system, as everything is relatively nearby. This can lead to confusion at times, because the in-game objectives are quite vague, so once or twice I needed to take a look at a guide to see what to do next.Overall, I cannot avoid comparing Lords to the Souls. This feels like a love letter to Dark Souls, but is a good game on its own. The missing piece, why I won't be playing it over and over again, is the absence of multiplayer, which added so much to Dark Souls - observing, how others beat the boss, checking out different builds and movesets. Here you are all alone.Yes, I would buy it again.			"

												i truly  regret buying this game, i saw people on let's plays over and over and being that i'm a dark souls 2 player and love THAT game btw, this game has failed worse than a retard taking trigonometry.  First of all, the price.. if you're gonna make a game that is going for that high price of 60 bux then you should at least release it when most of the HUGE bugs our fixed, i mean did they even consider testing this half baked half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥made game?  Started it up and noticed the frame-rate simply on the intro screen (btw my system stats are very close to the recommended setting GTX 750 ti) also i have a lot of games on my comp and they (mostly unless broken, thanks greedy corporations)  all run fine on ultra at highest render distance (skyrim, dark souls 2 etc.) i know this is a new gen game but with my comp i should at LEAST be able to play this game on the lowest setting at 30 fps EASY, but that's not going on, the alt-controls are broke as the run/evade button doesn't run in alt-controls just rolls.... saw on many forums im not the only one that is having this problem, i have heard (and also partook) in the many crashes this game is having as of lately, they already patched the thing and its still screwing up, i have played the start of diabo 2 and 3 and WoW and i understand you will have MULTIPLAYER probs because you are trying to get many players connected at the same time, but this has no multiplayer function, its just a single player game, its simple programming errors that shouldn't be happening, ESPECIALLY for a 50 dollar game, it should be at least close to functioning, and im not the only one, as i have said before there are many others having this problem, this game is completely unplayable for me and others, DON'T BUY THIS GAME UNTIL ITS COMPLETELY FIXED OR FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO ENJOY BECAUSE THIS GAME WILL LEAVE YOU FRUSTRATED!!!!

												Do you ever think to yourself ""Gosh, I do like Dark Souls, but I wish it had uninspired, half-heartedly voiced characters and debilitating stability problems""? Then Lords of the Fallen is for you!To be fair, I had about 90 minutes of fun with this game before the constant crashes made it impossible for me to get past the second boss fight. This game is probably worth the effort on consoles but spare yourself the frustration of the PC version.			"

												Very good graphic and atmostphere. However, it contain a few questionable problem. 1.Player's attack motionPlayer's chatacter attack is rather too short or too slow. For example, short sword attack speed is alright BUT the range is super short EVEN you use the stab attack.  2 hand weapon such as great sword or great axe, doing better damage but the attack motion is unreasonablely slow. 2.Shield systemmostly the shield work like darksoul style. However, this system might not work properly sometimes. for example, in some area, you will encounter some enemy with fire arrow, you can't block it like the normal arrow EVEN with a tower shield. on top of that, when you blocking the melee attack, only the weak enemy will got stagger some special enemy like the thief or the archer, they can break your tower shield guard with a little knife. Not only that, when you try to attack the shield enemy, it will cause a great problem to you beacuse the enemy's recovery are too fast.  for example, when you tried to fight a shield thief, sometimes he will just hold his small shield and run in circle and waiting for you to attack, you cannot break his guard easily even with a heavy weapon. all you can do is wait for his move. of cause you can use  kick attack to break his guard and attack BUT it is ONLY for fast weapon, heavy weapon is way tooooooo slow to catch up the guard break. however, the enemy can easily break your guard and finish you off.3. special enemyIn this game, it contain quite a lots special enemy(e.g: fatty archer. fatty Knight)like darksoul style, they are cheaty and hard to kill. Some of them you only need to fight it once and it won't respawn. BUT lots of them WILL respawn everytime you died or re-enter the area.			"

												Disclaimer: In 30 hours of inflated gametime, I have experienced two crashes. My sympathy goes out to all who were not as lucky as I was. At the time of writing, I have completed the game as a cleric and I'm wrapping up my NG+1 mode as a Warrior. I had to cut a lot of content for this review because of the word limitation Steam puts on it's user reviews.++Let's start with the good stuff first. While graphics aren't important anymore in this day and age, because every single game looks gorgeous these days, it must be noted that Lords looks absolutely stellar. Even though my system can barely run it, you can clearly see that there is a lot of hard work that went in almost every single area of the game. The game doesn't look as magnificent like in the screenshots though, but don't let that dissuade you: this game looks superb.++I liked the compactness of the game world. While every single RPG of the last 8 years is trying to be the next World of WarCraft or Skyrim, Lords keeps it neat and tidy. Lords doesn't have many locations, and, logically, every location in the game looks gorgeous and lavish with detail. They all look like real, believable places. There is no silly padding, no unnecessary: ""Harkyn! Please kill ten demon hounds and then return here!"" questing. There is one main quest, about ten side quests and a neatly compacted game world consisting of a handful of locations for you to do them in. If you're great at the game, you'll just blast past all the content in a matter of a dozen hours and have seen all the locations. But I really like this style of RPG and it's a system I definitely I want to see more of. ++Honorable mentions: Awesome looking armor and weapons. They're a real treat to behold and there's a huge amount of armor and weapons lying around if you look hard enough. The XP system is also a real treat. It allows the unskilled player to grind himself XP, plainly making him more powerful versus other enemies, but since it costs so much to gain a level, I think it maintains a very nice balance, not allowing the player to become overpowered. Above-average soundtrack, very appropriate tunes that don't get boring or samey.--And now for the bad stuff. My problems with Lords (and the Souls games for that matter) are actually very simple and yet difficult to explain in few sentences. Souls, but especially Lords feel difficult for no good reason. For me, the very core of a game, the single most important aspect, the goal of any video game developer should be the endless quest of making sure your players are having a good time with the it: that they are having FUN. I would truly like to discuss both these games with a mature Dark Souls player and ask him or her to explain to me why he or she loves these kinds of games. I think I'm the only one who doesn't enjoy these games because everybody who hasn't slept under a rock seems to be enjoying this huge 'Souls'-fix. The argument I always hear is that in game worlds this depressing and bleak 'fun' is not something you should be experiencing and I find that to be such bullsh*t. You CAN have bleak virtual worlds and the concept of fun mashed together, guys. Ever played Deus Ex before? Or Bioshock? Or Wolfenstein: The New Order? Or hundreds of other games I'm sure exist with this combination. I do not find dying in a game fun. There are only very few and very specific games that get away with 'dying a lot' for me. Super Meat Boy comes to mind, and that game was magnificently designed. When said game is not created perfectly, dying over and over and over again should never, EVER be the goal of a developer. And yet, both these games have had developers behind them wanted, WISHING you to die over and over again.  --The reason why I claim that Lords and Souls feel difficult for no good reason is because when you look at these games they just seem like regular third-person hack 'n slashers where your character feels like he weighs a billion tons and moves ridiculously slow. Your adversaries can move much faster than you do and when they hit you it eats 75% (figuratively of course) of your lifebar away. The enemies themselves, however, take many, MANY hits to go down. Most have a shield that can block any attack coming from you, and the weaknesses they show go away in an instant, only giving you time to get in one attack if you're lucky. Surviving some encounters often feel like strokes of luck rather than skill. Both games often feel like the developers made these games and just tweaked the sliders for health bars and damage outputs. I've had enemies in the early hours of both games stunlock me to death over and over again, resulting in screaming frustration, something I haven't experienced in over a decade in a video game and yet, it's only games like these that bring so much depressing anger for a product that should be designed as fun. --Even when you get used to the combat, there are moments where you feel the game itself is actually taunting you. There are fat demons who are hunters in Lords who usually have a wild dog with them. When you try to hit the dog, it understandably usually dodges your very slow attacks. The hunter demon simply jumps backwards like a nimble ballerina and attacks you again. It defies all logic that so many enemies in Lords can dodge attacks that should not be dodged, predictably leaving you with more loss of health and an even bigger loss of stamina, until you finally push him in a corner and finally kill him.--When I say that the combat is slow, so is the magic. It would be quicker to educate me in magic in real-life than Harkyn doing his spell in the game, I'm not kidding. Magic, which usually plays a supportive role in Lords, is often essential for certain situations, providing you with a protective shield for especially hard-hitting enemies or a spell that stuns lighter, simpler enemies when they attack you. And when you are in dire need of a spell in the game, then you can kiss you sweet experience goodbye because you are going to LOSE. Not because of the mana requirement, not because of the decades of game time it needs to be cast, but because it's the kind of magic that cannot be interrupted. One hit, and it's canceled out, often leading to your demise, as usual. You almost have to know the placement of the enemies in advance BEFORE you cast your spell. --The 'bankable XP system' that people seem to be praising so much isn't that amazing or exceptional. Considering the amount of crashing this game does for most people, and how ridiculously easy it is to die in this game, I actually see no point to hold on to the XP you are carrying. The interests of the multiplier aren't that huge, and when you are early in the game you desperately need all the XP you can get. When the time comes you can hold your own in this game to let that multiplier go up, you already have all the tools you need to win the game anyway so the bankable XP system is rendered completely null and void in the end. --Extremely long loading times and frequent FPS drops.Closing thoughts on Lords of the Fallen: Lords of the Fallen is a game that is too hard for its own good, and would've been a million times better if it focused more on story aspects rather than trying the be Dark Souls: Viking Edition. I have completed it almost twice, but I know after uninstalling it, I'll probably never play it again. The reason I completed it twice was because for what little good the game did, it does it exceptionally well: I was nuts about the aesthetics of the game, the very idea of a Space Marineish character battling hordes of demonic creatures sent by God to annihilate the world in a snow-buried castle, and you are all that's standing in their way. I will be interested in seeing a sequel for the game that fixes my issues with it. Only buy it when it'is very cheap in a sale.   My specs:Windows 7 64-bitIntel Core i7 920 2.67GHz6GB RAMMSI 660Ti OC Power Edition			"

 DO NOT BUY THIS GAME It wouldn't even let get to the ♥♥♥♥ing menu - it crashes after its stupid ad intro. In addition, according to its forums this is an old issue dating back to early 2014, yet they haven't fixed it.No idea whether this game is fun to play or not, because it's literally unplayable. Waste of money. Will try and see if I can get a refund and buy something else instead.			"

												In my opinioun Lords of the fallen is the answer of what would happened if dark souls and darksiders married.It looks like mixture of them.I think game is pretty easy than dark souls.Has good graphics and atmosphere and deserves to be played.But it also has serious problems like crashing constantly.It really really irritates when happens in boss fight.For example I almost killed a boss and game crashed and I had to try it several times.Although this serious issue is still continuing developers havent released any patch to solves this yet.EDIT:Crash problem fixed it is better now.Recommended.

												I recommend buying this, but only at a sale. It's basically Dark Souls, but worse. Way worse. CombatThe combat is unresponsive and slow. Some attacks will hit you when they shouldn't. Rolling is unreliable. The developers clearly built the game with a Strength build in mind, disregarding the Agility build. Enemies with a shield will be a pain for you if you're an Agility character, unless you use Magic. You will get hit and it's gonna hurt, because you can't use heavy armor because of the roll speed. The fact that most enemies don't stagger at all if you use an Agility weapon will not help you. Despite all that, the game is pretty easy, but you'll use magic a lot. And using magic is even more boring than Melee combat. You get used to the enemy attacks quite quickly because there are not many enemy types.BossesThe bosses are uncreative. They all feel the same. None of them felt threatening at all. They're all slow and they choreograph their attacks like they're in slow motion. They repeat their 3 or 4 attack types over and over again until you kill them.Map DesignOne thing they got right, I believe, is the map design. It's all interconnected, and you open up shortcuts as you progress; just like Dark Souls. I give them props for that. We need more of these map designs.OST and StoryThe soundtrack and the story are terrible. Skip every cinematic whenever possible. Nothing else to say about it.Technical IssuesNow, my biggest gripe about the game. This game has crashed my PC at least 6 times. It consumes my CPU and GPU completely, at 100% capacity. When I first started the game, it ran like CRAP. Stuttering, low FPS, and inconsistent FPS at random points of the game. I had to spend hours trying to solve it. Testing out different graphic configurations, playing around with the driver settings, modifying .ini files. And to this day, I'm still not sure if I solved the crashes. I had to run the game at the lowest possible settings, except for Texture quality; when it shouldn't be that way, because I can even run Battlefield 1 at medium settings at over 60 FPS. Note that I'm writing this on 09/02/16, so they had PLENTY of time to solve these issues. Make sure to save everything in your computer before you start playing, and be mindful of your CPU and GPU temperatures, because this game might melt them.Final ThoughtsI am aware that this review was very negative, but the game did manage to entertain me enough to beat it and play it for 18 hours. I can't take that away from them. If you like Dark Souls, there's a good chance that spending $15 or so in this is worth it.Specs: i7 2600k, GTX 660 Ti, 8 GB RAM			"

												it´s quite amazing how bad this game is.i am actually not even kidding, when i say: Before you buy this game, think about purchasing a club penguin premium account.here are the worst issues this game has:-bad optimization-bad controlls-bad ai-bad fighting system-waaay to ♥♥♥♥ing slow, for me as a DS-player its really hard to adapt to the tempo, as not only you move like a ♥♥♥♥ing 5000pound fatman but everyone else around you too. you can practically go ♥♥♥♥ing naked and you will still move like a barrel filled with ♥♥♥♥ing pickles-bad bossfights, believe me. you wont have fun during those. just imagine a game where you play as a barrel against a ♥♥♥♥ing wall which swings at you and summons mobs.-litteraly no counterattacks-slow and hardly working hit animations. boss fights take a long ♥♥♥♥ing time i can tell you that. not as if they were entertaining but in a ""i-hold-my-shield-up-all-the-♥♥♥♥ing-time-and-am-immune-to-shield-breaks-you-will-probably-just-have-to-wait-for-my-phantom-reach-attacks""-kind of wayok so since i can imagine how many screeching ♥♥♥♥ing kids my review spawned into this realm, here a quick explanation to soulslike players:if you search for a game which is set in a fantasy world with 150% gravity and disgustingly useless magic than you came to the right place. you can look like a fat bald dude rapped in tinfoil though so thats a plus. -NO character customization besides a hilariously small ""skilltree""(which, with its small choicepool, seems more like a ""skillroot"" to me) and a pretty good attributesheet, so yeah thats that-no choice in equipment usage: oh so you want to carry a sword in one hand and an axe in the other? hahaha ♥♥♥♥ NO boi-no mageclass! nothing more to add, but i think thats not a big problem considering the fact that there are ""9"" ""spells"" that can be ""used"" by you after you have ""decided"" which ""skilltree"" to pick for ""your"" ""character"". here are your startchoices: -pick a ""skilltree"": -skillroot 1: perk 1 stationary clone                                                     -skillroot 2: perk 1 stationary clone                                                     -skillroot 3: perk 1 stationary clon                     -pick a ""startingclass"": 1heavy armour                                                           2medium armour                                                           3light armour                     -best part: character summary :D (come on now, i know you dont expect the people to be very smart which bought your game but i think i can remember the choices i made in your extensive character creation)=this game is like d&da for Alzheimer-patientsthis game is so good. words can´t even describe how good it is, but numbers can. 3/10			"

												as many before me said, just buy dark souls. this game has the fluidity of a turn based rpg game... movements are awful, dodge is almost useless and every weapon attacks like it weighs over 1000 kg... not recomended, just an annoying game. graphics is the only good thing in this one, and that's sad.

												Empty game with really good visuals and amazingly bad gamedesign. After couple of hours there will be thousands of enemies with shields, and you just need to wait for their openings (ocarina of time was, like, 20 years ago, how you can still make such ♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies?), and leg push, like in dark souls, is not going to help you. You don't feel any progression, because all armor and locations look exactly the same.			"

												Well after 6+ hours into the game and Ive also played Dark Souls. ( still need to get round to finishing it.. ) This is alot like Dark Souls but it isnt at the same time so to speak.To start with this a hell of alot of funthe combat is nice and fluid and the creeps you face can be a bit of a pain at times but with a bit of pulling a single one here and there they are not so hard but there is still the hard side of dark souls in there in that if you mess up you will be punished for it but not as harsh as Dark Souls but less of the compairing it to Dark Souls because this game is just amazing end of. TLDR : Its a dungeon crawler that is tough and alot of fun.			"

These flaws being slightly dodgy and shaky camera, a few game-crashing bugs and (possibly) unfinishable side quests. But overall a worthy buy, and it is also hard as balls!

												READ: I havent suffered a crash yet however many others have, I do experience some frame drops that are annoying . This game DOES have technical issues that will hopefully be fixed SOON!!!!!!!The Game : In progress PRONE TO CHANGE: TLDR : Enjoyable , I have some frustrations regarding design decisions but overall im enjoying it so far.Story: You are Harkin a prisoner released to fight the ""LOOOOORDS OF THE FALLENNN"" I havent peered into the story that much and i am not that far into the game yet to give an in depth verdict . There are lore entries in the form of audio logs that appear as scrolls and playback the voice of a character in the world of lords - its a nice touch . The narrative is given to you straight and there is some loose information in the description of weapons that can give you some lore and background to the game but its nothing that has me really intrigued as of yet - TLDR Its nice that its there but its not mind blowing.Graphics - The game looks bootyfull and has a very WoW/Diablo aesthetic style which compliments badass demon enemies and bad♥♥♥♥♥armour and weapon designs. Its a pretty game if you like that sort of thing and there are some cool effects take the first boss for example as he unleashes flurries of greatsword swings and as he dances towards you with his vicious blade embers and particles cover him like a cloak of fireflies. TLDR : Damn bootyfullGAMEPLAY: You have a Health bar, An Energy bar (stamina) and a mana bar, the gameplay is very souls infact some people are calling LotF a SoulsLike experience for ""casuals"" ,  The game is basically a Role playing 3rd person Hack N Slash with a heavy empasis on tense fights and methadolical encouners to put it shortly ( Sound familiar?)  Overall positive , Im a MASSIVE Dark Souls fan and i cant help but compare the gameplay in souls to LoTF. Now lets get the bad out of the way first : The camera - Its almost as bad as MGR: Revengeances camera in the way that it will climb up walls and spaz out if you are against a wall, Its a gripe I have but it hasnt ruined the experience for me : YET.Bad No.2 : Bosses while not bad are SO FAR kinda generic and dont have much going for them: This is where i compare it to DkS1 . Bosses in DkS1 seen a lot of variation and had intriguing design to them which varied each fight take the four kings for example - You HAD to end the fight as fast as you could or else you would be murdered, this adds a layer of tension to the boss. ANOTHER few examples : the gargoyles - they introduced the player to a 2v1 fight and made you panic, Orns and Smough - same deal only after you killed one the other got buffed (also had amazing sound design and music to it) and my favourite (although DLC) Artorias - intensely fast and strong but the fight fitted the movement of the player perfectly and the boss had you constantly moving and dogding flurries of attacks building up to your counter attack. In Lords i have yet to see a boss that changes the formula of Dodge, Attack, roll away repeat (infact i tell a lie the Commander boss had a layer of multiple enemy fights to him in the form of some enemies that were easy to kill but he was incapicated for that duration.) Obviously DkS1 had more to the boss fights than the Dodge attack and roll away as i have given examples for (believe me its only a few i could have given loads more) and in LoTF i have yet to face a boss that gave me the same ""Whoaaa"" factor Sif or Gwyn did. - TLDR: Bosses are average but enjoyable however so far they fail to live up to the standard of a souls title.Bad No, 3 : So far the environment looks the same as it did in the first hour of play - a minor gripe .This is really prone to change however.Bad No. 4 Challenge: Now this is less of a bad and more of a personal taste for me- The game varies from hard to very easy and I found that the warrior archtype was easy mode while Rogue was hard mode .  - Now this can be seen as a pro since this is organic difficulty (Ill get to that later) Now my main gripes are out of the way lets get to what i LIKE.1. The core gameplay is fun! (and challenging when conditions are met) - The fighting as i said is similar to a souls game but is different enough to feel like LoTF , The biggest difference is that its VERY heavy and as a result it can lead to some very tense moments. You move slower than you would in a souls title and your heavy weapons REALLY, REALLY, REAAALLY feel like you are swinging a truck at someone - Personally i love this feeling on my greatswords and axes . 2. The enemies can really mess you up if you underestimate them although they arent going to pull a dark souls on you all the time.  Ive noticed that the overall feel of LoTF is a lot more 1 on 1 focused than a souls game which makes sense given the weight of Harkin.3. the timing mechanic - This is the thing that made the combat feel more rythmic than souls but in a very good way . basically : You time the swings of your attacks and as a result you lose less energy (Stamina) as a result i really like this touch - it rewards timing and makes combat feel smoother as a result.4.Organic difficulty is there but less than a souls title : For example you can forgo a shield to lose your block and ability to parry, Another : The three playstyles/ Classes Warrior (Heavy)  , Cleric (Medium)  and Rogue ( Light) all have different difficulty to playing them , Warriors are basically easy mode ( remember when i said armour matters?) You are tanky - VERY tanky you can take a boot to the balls and still tank through a hit although you move and roll like you are suffering from intese artheritis ,Clerics are slightly harder to play due to their armour being slightly weaker but they have a better roll and they have swag points for their armour looking cool as ♥♥♥♥ and finally Rogues - Weakest armour best roll, Now you probably want to know why they could possibly be harder to play- welp the rolling in this game has less I - Frames than Souls rolling and while the rogue roll does have I - Frames and is faster than the other 2 roll types you still take a massive amount of damage from a hit and you might get stunlocked to death - You have less margin for error and are punished more as a result.  Ultimately i cant say its exactly done amazingly but its done to an acceptable extent although some playstyles are less viable than others which is something that was handled well in Dark souls 1. 4. Oh man my hands - rewarded for risky playing : What I mean by this is that you are rewarded for not using checkpoints . You are given a multiplier for each kill you get which increases EXP by 1.25 for example and increases the more kills you get without dying - this rewards balls but since you skipped checkpoints if you die have fun getting back to your ""Ghost"" . Your ""Ghost"" is pretty much a bloodstain containing your exp - an interesting twist is that your exp depletes over a certain threshold of time and so you are pressured to retrieve your Ghost before you lose a good percentage of EXP- You are also given a passive regen when you are near a ghost which adds another layer of organic difficulty (Having a hard time with this boss? Just leave your ghost to sustain the regen buff AT THE COST OF EXP HAHAAH) .I have failed to mention other minor gripes and minor likes about the game but jesus my hands are killing me so give me a break.Sound : Mostly positive - Great OST really sets the mood , weapons sound amazing when you strike metal or rend flesh but I noticed that some instances just felt like a sound was missing or that during a cutscene certain sound effects were missing.Remember this is in progress so some things are prone to change for better or worse.

												You will find many people are comparing this to the beautiful and near perfect Souls series. This isn't a fair expectation or comparison, FROM has had 3 games now to perfect their formula and Demon Souls pales in comparison to 1 and 2 while still being great.This is the case with Lords of the Fallen, a highly enjoyable ARPG to fill the void between DSII's DLC release and Bloodborne in February. Lords manages to have a few unique mechanics that sets it apart from other ARPGs. One mechanic I really enjoyed was the kill streak mechanic, meaning the more enemies you killed without ""healing"" at a checkpoint you got more exp up to a 2x multiplier. This rewards patient and careful play and can really rack up exp quickly.There are some technical issues currently but they are working on it and have already released one patch to address this and in the future I doubt there will be issues. The combat is enjoyable and while some say much slower than souls, I would say it's about equal if you have light armor and possibly medium with a fast weapon such as a staff. I would say in a nutshell, it's worth the $50 and I am having a blast.			"

												(Money well wasted)! They basically took Dark Souls 2, tweaked it, but everything they changed was for the worse. I say Dark Souls 2 (which is in fact the worst one in the series) because of the slow ""fluid"" combat, slow rolling etc. The story is messy and unoriginal. You can only play as the same boring character, and there is no multiplayer what-so-ever. Only thing they did well in this game was the graphics. The design was... meh. Another thing that made this game really boring was the increativity. About every boss is just a big muscular guy in armor, as well as most of the enemies... After playing this game for about 24 hours, I can safely say: I would rather play through Dark Souls 2 for the 40th time, than this game once...			"

												I would've like to recommend this game. But as a game developer I value gameplay and especialy experience over graphics, this sadly wasn't up for it.A few plus points about the game: graphics, animations, music, sound effects, awesome looking armor (eye-candy) and I liked the storyline although It lacked a bit depth (not getting dragged into it enough).The bad part: the combat was bad. Enemies do not follow the same rules as the player, making everything tacticly impossible, resulting in ditching tactis and starting to run and button bash until the other was dead. Even physics rules don't always apply to enemies; a full charging shielded guy can rotate 180 degrees instantly and knock me back, fire arrows hitting my tower shield sets me on fire, enemies thrusting their polearm into my shield gives me damage (100% physical damage reduction and still got enough stamina), I could go on with these flaws but I won't; simply honor rules of physics or how we look at magic.If you played the Dark Souls series and loved their combat, don't think this will be like it. Well you can just ditch all your knowledge and the observating mindset. The thing I missed most was the feeling that I (myself) did it wrong when I died, falling into pits because of auto-targeting (not the lock-target) and dying because of physics flaws and animation/attack timing issues (for good and for bad) didn't really motivated me to hone my skills further (player leveling).Hopefuly the developers will keep this stuff in mind for their next game and if they do I would love to buy it.

Dodging is key.- Very pretty graphics.- Fun boss battles.- Replayable; not only is there a good use of the New Game +, but there are also three classes to play as, which have unique playstyles.Cons:- The fight in the trailer never happens.- Variety of enemies could be better.- Save points are a little too rare in some places, and too prevalent in others.All in all, a solid action game that a skilled player can appreciate.

												A western take on Dark Souls with two advantages: Responsive combat with slower more realistic movements and much better graphics. Optimization is fine.It does fall short in dificulty (it gets easier as you progress) and story is pretty bad. But games are to have fun not suffer through it. If you like suffering, try real life.

												I got the game in January 2015, after the initial disastrous launch with everyone having crashes at game launch etc.The game actually played  nice for the first 30 mins , until after the first boss:- I was running everything maxed out with Nvidia turbulence at 1080p, getting around 55-60 fps.- my system specs are i7 4770k , 16 GB ram, 2x GTX770 evga  oc edition 2GB in SLiAfter the bossfight and when the game transitions to the exterior, I started having huge random frame drops, going from 60 fps to 7-10 fps and the game became unplayable. This is unacceptable.I had to disable nvidia turbulence, disable cromatic aberration (ugly and terrible decision to include this in the game) and disable most post processing options to get back to 50-80 fps.Now my problem is that I get totally random crashes while playing (most of the time during boss fights, which is infuriating).The game itself has decent story and good graphics but suffers from a problem: It wants to be a ""Dark Souls Clone"". And it fails. If the devs would give the player the ability to save at any point, the game would probably last 3-4 hours max with all sidequests done, so this means the game is artificially lengthned by this gimmick saving point system.Also the camera issues while fighting are real and most often than not responsible for ridiculous deaths of your char and more wasted time.Fighting responsiveness is also close to none which on a fighting game really says it all. There will be plenty of times when your char will not respond accurately to the controls.I would recommend this game ONLY if you get it on a sale around $10 (or lower) , it's not a AAA title in any way with this kind of technical issues.At the current price point, in January 2015, please find something else to play as this game is somehow still in ""beta testing"".Peace,Sycharth			"

												If this game goes on sale for 20-30$ i would say pick it up but as a full price package this game is frustrating (for the wrong reasons). Yes, it is pretty short but problem is the replay value really isn't worth while for couple extra items. I could go on and on but ill just make a quick pro/con list to speed it up.I only ran as a Heavy armored/Sword and shield spec with cleric spells. I tried other styles and didnt care for em.Pros-Very pretty graphics through out.Kinda a pro and con fact that a shield spec heavy armored run only seemed helpful for bosses which is nice but really crappy against some of the later enemies in the game forcing me to switch to a 2 hander for them which i didn't care for 2 handed weapons in game at all.Cons-Most of the shield enemies are very annoying due to fact its a good 70% shield enemies that like to turtle slows down the game alot.Spells...... for love of god they take so long to cast it almost renders them useless when really really need them most.The bosses are incredibly lame and simple even the last boss i killed on a 2nd attempt due to lame OP power he spams on you when sitting there thinking wtf is he doing.Story is very standard. None of the extra characters are fleshed that you help and main character is pretty cookie cutter kick♥♥♥♥♥take names later affair.More of a personal issue to me but Weapon variety seemed very low. Either greatsword this greataxe that couple swords and daggers with some hammers thrown in. Took while to find a 1 handed str sword which was the style i liked rather then slower heavy weapons.Overall if they get a sequel i would like to see what they bring to it but wait for this to be on sale.

												What I thought I got: A more action-oriented edition of Dark souls, with somewhat thinner story, but with better graphics and more fast-paced, immersive combat. Easier, and more linear story-progression.What I actually got: No story at all, uninteresting characters and flat voice-acting, run-of-the-mill ""dark fantasy"" world, with evil demonic tossers, invading a gothic world. Combat i more slow-paced than Dark Souls, at least to me, as there is barely ever an opening in your enemies guard, and it takes three years to raise your shield after finishing an attack. Also, half the time, you take damage or get stunned, even though you're rolling.No enemy variety either, bosses: Tall guys with swords.Normal minions: Guy with axe, guy with shield, guy with crossbow, idiotic  and blind abominations and then spiders.It feels clunky and unpolished, even though you figured out the attack pattern of an enemy, you will rarely get a proper chance to attack without taking damage yourself, because after an attack, your character goes to an idle animation before being able to raise the shield or gtfo of the way.Also, it took me 40 minutes to get the game running. And it still ran pretty bad, with severe FPS drops.It does show a lot of potential, but perhaps this is just the extent of the developers capabilitites. Taken into account their other releases, that is very likely the reason.			"

												Aight.Pros+Gameplay is fun and engaging for the first hour or so.+It looks very nice and the physics everywhere adds to the immersion, that is until bodies start flying but that happens in every physics engine once in a while.+Music is alright, nothing memorable but adds nice ambiance. +Level design is decent. A lot of areas loop around without you even thinking about it.Cons-The game is way too easy. And I mean WAYYYY too easy. I only died on one boss due to a instakill spell but as soon as you find out how to avoid it he goes down as easily as the rest. Even the final boss is a cakewalk, he went down in a couple of attacks and did hardly any damage to me.-Some weapons are just blatently better than others.-Not a fan of the armor design personally. Armor is 90% shoulderpads.-Too short. I think I finished the game in about 10 hours or so. For a first run that is just way too short.The game is too short and easy to justify the 50 dollar price tag. Wait for a sale or something and if you haven't already played it, I recommend picking up Dark Souls instead of this game. It's cheaper, more challenging and longer than Lords of the Fallen.TL;DRToo short and easy.Buy on sale.Buy Dark Souls instead.			"

												Played a bit, uninstalled. Nothing special, nothing new, just more (and yet somehow less) of the same formula we've been spoonfed by From Software. Except for the fact that From Software knows how to make games.After a month or so of game-breaking bugs, crashes, lost saves, horrible performance, useless DRM, and overexaggerated hype, I'm still waiting for a decently playable game. Between slideshow framerates, crashing alone it's near impossible for me to get past the Worshiper. I wanted to play more of this game, but it seems either the devs or the game itself don't want me to. If only Steam wasn't crappy about refunds.			"

												You know i wanna recommend this game to friends but the bugs is what breaks it for me, and the performance issues. So first i would like to say the game itself is pretty fun plays pretty much like dark souls and im OK with that im on New Game+ atm, the games diffaculty is ok its not as hard as dark souls but boss fights can be well ok maybe one fight i had a hard time with. But here is where the issues i have with it, first of all, all i had was framerate issues and im pretty sure its due to poor optimization the FPS in this is everywhere but then i started to experance these crashes everyone has been talking about. And the last one pulled the trigger i lost a TON of progess in my New Game+ and that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off thats time i dont get back this game is buggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥ and i wanna tell people to buy it but unfoturntly i cannot as its not fit to sell to the public this would actually be a pretty cool game but i dont see any sign of them fixing it.

												The game is not horrible, however it is very frustrating (more so than usual) for any who have played Dark Souls. While the DS series has combat involving lots of dodging, timely attacks and timely blocks, the combat system in this game feels like trying to play DS with a tablet. The moves your character does are all just too slow and require too much time before you actually make them, making the execution of combat horribly slow. Combine that with a dodge function that doesn't help at all because most important enemies are faster than you, and can turn faster than you can roll out of reach and it gives you a game that thoroughly annoys the player by making you able to see all enemy attacks coming but not being able to do anything about it.4/10 (5/10 for anyone who hasn't played Dark Souls)			"

												An enthralling world to experience the fantastic combat in. This is by far the best single player experience I’ve had in years. It was so good that I started a second play through Immediately after the first as it left me craving for more.The Developers seem to have borrowed all the best bits form the Souls franchise and mixed them with their own ideas while throwing away all the stuff I hated about dark souls i.e. Lords of the Fallen DOES have a well thought out learning curve and still manges to present fair yet challenging combat. Lords of the Fallen DOES offer motivation for the player to keep playing in the early stage of the game and presents the plot and lore surrounding you and the world in a way that significantly draws you into the world and the character you play without breaking the flow of gameplay. Lords of the Fallen absolutly DOES look fantastic graphicaly and works seamlessly (at least for me) straight off the bat without any patches or mods. "

												An excellent character action game that is no doubt the obvious comparison as a derivative of the Souls games. While it's overall length and difficulty seem to fall short of the challenge Dark Souls brings, I found it's changes to the formula refreshing. As a person who enjoys character creation, I would rather not be playing as Harkyn although he is far from the worst protagonist ever. That being said, the story doesn't seem solid enough to warrant his sole inclusion as the main character. I see no reason they couldn't have made the story fit to just about any created character with some generic alteration to dialogue. This is a personal opinion however and doesn't really mean the game is not thoroughly enjoyable. At the time of this review (10/31/2014) there are some techinical problems with the game, primarily a massive memory leak that pretty much causes it to max out memory usage on any machine. I personally have not had any crashes, glitches, or major roadblocks, but just some slightly poor performance overall. I hope that they see it through and find fixes for everyone. Aside from those issues, the game is marvelously gorgeous. I believe the texturing, color choices, and overall aesthetic to be more compelling than that of a game like Dark Souls, which is not devoid of color but uses it more sparingly. The spell particle effects, lighting, and tone variance are nothing short of breathtaking. Due to current technical issues I'd have to recommend this with caution, but when those are fixed it is a must buy for those waiting for Bloodborne or the next Souls game introduced by From Software.

												Dark Souls had a baby with a WRPG and it came out a little premature. I enjoy some of its design decisions but it's incredibly short (with DLC it took me under 9 hours), and I can only ascribe so much of that to my experience with similar titles. However, it has actual useful kb/m controls, and is a solidly programmed title on this platform, so that's a huge plus over the aforementioned's PC edition.I'm incredibly fond of its risk/reward mechanic: the longer you go without laying down a save/dying, the higher your XP multiplier becomes. XP functions as currency and level-fodder, but can be gained also via exploration, sidequests (yes! those exist in this!), and a ""checkpoint"" system which lets you choose a new respawn point/effectively quicksave, without resetting the multiplier. The multiplier only applies to combat-given XP, but that makes perfect sense, and it's not like that doesn't make boss encounters more tense as you try to take them out in one so you can turn them from one level up into four.Other positives: bosses all have a specific kill condition to upgrade their drops (which is hinted at in some of the lore or notes) for further risk/reward and playstyle changes, you get a shotgun (or just projectile weapon, but I liked using it as a shotgun) which can be used offensively or defensively if you want to make that your build, and the various spell schools allow for some drastically different play, if you want straight offense, healing, or a more subterfuge-based style. I'm all over this and I hope some of its systems get lifted for future titles, because apparently lately I only play evolutionary dead-end titles.			"

Thank God it was on sale or I would have been pretty upset.The graphics are amazing!+weapon and armor design+Scenery is just really well done+Monsters are well detailed+rewarded for doing something extra like an achievement for each boss fightThen the rest of the game must have gone to another studio that literally never played a game before and ruined the foundation.-Head bobbing, it's not a little bobble, but literally if you were on a sea ship in a violent storm head bob. You will get sick after a while and thier is no option to remove it.-Story line just like Dragon age 2-Character interaction is just wanky, like your characters eyes are looking up when talking to someone-Combat is a slower version of Dark souls 2 - but the game doesn't reward skill, Monsters (especially bosses) have 350 degree attacks that even when you dodge, the back hand swing will somehow hit you, stun you, and you get your face wrecked. I can't tell you how frusturating it is to use a two hand melee weapon in this game, insane damage if you don't get interupted by every little attack or when you swing at a boss and they move their 30 foot long limb and some how you keep missing it.I'm to the point that I don't even care if I beat the game which is very rare for me not to do. I' m just punishing myself with the horrible combat system, predictable story, and nausiated by the head bob.If you are a die hard adventure fan and have literally nothing else to do, wait till it goes on sale.

												A good Dark Souls-inspired action RPG... worth around 20$. Too tired to write a full review, so here goes tl;dr :Pros:+ Looks great+ plays pretty well + very nicely designed world - better than Dark Souls 2, even if much smaller+ side quests+ very realistic take on equipment weight - you can really feel it+ soundtrack+ freedom in exploration of the world+ brutal+ pretty difficult, not like Dark Souls, but pretty difficult+ while heavly inspired by Dark Souls, it's not a rip-off+ nice dark fantasy setting+ superb visual design of pretty much everything+ while there are ""classes"", they mostly mean spell sets - you can play the way you prefer regardless of what you chose at the start, because it's almost all based on your equipment+ varied equipment, a lot of choices+ an interesting take on experience - all enemies have a set of experience they give you. However, with every enemy you kill, your experience multiplier grows. It resets when you activate checkpoints and refill your health and potions. That means the riskier you play, the more experience and better loot you get. High risk high reward kind of situation. Cons:- hit detection is lacking, but I've seen worse- run of the mill story- even as Rogue you're like the tanky guy from DS, no FAST classes- only three classes- very few spells- almost all enemies are CQC-focused- conversation animationsPlayed for 12 hours, one playthrough, had a lot of fun.

												Aight.Pros+Gameplay is fun and engaging for the first hour or so.+It looks very nice and the physics everywhere adds to the immersion, that is until bodies start flying but that happens in every physics engine once in a while.+Music is alright, nothing memorable but adds nice ambiance. +Level design is decent. A lot of areas loop around without you even thinking about it.Cons-The game is way too easy. And I mean WAYYYY too easy. I only died on one boss due to a instakill spell but as soon as you find out how to avoid it he goes down as easily as the rest. Even the final boss is a cakewalk, he went down in a couple of attacks and did hardly any damage to me.-Some weapons are just blatently better than others.-Not a fan of the armor design personally. Armor is 90% shoulderpads.-Too short. I think I finished the game in about 10 hours or so. For a first run that is just way too short.The game is too short and easy to justify the 50 dollar price tag. Wait for a sale or something and if you haven't already played it, I recommend picking up Dark Souls instead of this game. It's cheaper, more challenging and longer than Lords of the Fallen.TL;DRToo short and easy.Buy on sale.Buy Dark Souls instead.			"

												Played a bit, uninstalled. Nothing special, nothing new, just more (and yet somehow less) of the same formula we've been spoonfed by From Software. Except for the fact that From Software knows how to make games.After a month or so of game-breaking bugs, crashes, lost saves, horrible performance, useless DRM, and overexaggerated hype, I'm still waiting for a decently playable game. Between slideshow framerates, crashing alone it's near impossible for me to get past the Worshiper. I wanted to play more of this game, but it seems either the devs or the game itself don't want me to. If only Steam wasn't crappy about refunds.			"

												You know i wanna recommend this game to friends but the bugs is what breaks it for me, and the performance issues. So first i would like to say the game itself is pretty fun plays pretty much like dark souls and im OK with that im on New Game+ atm, the games diffaculty is ok its not as hard as dark souls but boss fights can be well ok maybe one fight i had a hard time with. But here is where the issues i have with it, first of all, all i had was framerate issues and im pretty sure its due to poor optimization the FPS in this is everywhere but then i started to experance these crashes everyone has been talking about. And the last one pulled the trigger i lost a TON of progess in my New Game+ and that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off thats time i dont get back this game is buggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥ and i wanna tell people to buy it but unfoturntly i cannot as its not fit to sell to the public this would actually be a pretty cool game but i dont see any sign of them fixing it.

												There is no connection between the player and the story of the game as well as the protagonist of the game.

												Lords of the Fallen is a Dark Souls copycat, and that's good.  Emulation is the highest form of flattery, and Dark Souls is awesome.However.It falls short entirely in the combat department, which lacks the finesse that Dark Souls boasted.  Rather than ducking and dodging, for the majority of the game all you seem to have to do is lock on, lift your shield up, and run in circles.  It makes me ♥♥♥♥ing dizzy.  The bossesi n particular produce very few obvious openings and seem to have the same strategy as you - Hide behind their shield.  It becomes very drawn out.I thought Dark Souls 2 had repetetive and boring combat (in PvE that is), but this takes the cake.Couple that with the fact that your main character is a boring, generic space-marine circa 1200AD, and there you have it.  Decent visuals, but ♥♥♥♥ing boring to play.I am happy for what the game REPRESENTS, and that's perhaps more Dark Souls-esque games in the future.  But I'd hope further attempts to emulate Dark Souls will also capture the game's unique combat technicalities.			"

												From the authors of The Chickenator comes Lords of the Fallen, a game which is supposed to be a Dark Souls clone. Unfortunately the game fails to live up to the one it was based upon in every way, but most of all, the combat. The combat feels clunky, slow (even by Souls standards) and repetitive, with no rewarding and satysfying victories which feel rather hollow. The bosses have nothing to offer, all being virtually the same. The story is quite uninspiring and the main character is as generic as can be, with no option to create your own character at all.It really isn't enough to take some elements from the Souls games to mae equally good game, the devs seem to have failed to understand what makes the Souls series so great...Another disappointing release of 2014, which seems to be the trend. Maybe worth picking up for €15-20 to give it a try, but no more than that.			"

												At the moment, this game is a buggy mess. The first boss noclipped through the floor, forcing me to restart. Then, when i got to the second boss, he froze half of the times i tried to fight him. Instead of getting that crystal wall thing around him, he stood still. I did not want to cheese him, so i restarted. Similar♥♥♥♥♥♥has happened a lot during the few hours i have played the gameThe voice acting is sub-par at bestThe game is forgiving where it needs to be hard, and hard where it needs to be forgiving. Introducing the player to fighting 2-3 otherwise difficult enemies AT ONCE early in the game, with a high possibility of the boss bugging out and joining in, is a bit harsh. The boss fights are a bit tedious, due to the limited movesets, and success just about relies on how heavy your armor is and if you have the decoy spell thing - this needs a nerf, also. Just spam that and you automatically win.			"

												The combat:The combat feels rather slow-ish but very impactful. The movement is very weird. Rolling feels kinda wrong. Even fast rolling  seems slow. Walking away seems more effective but rolling generates alot of invincibility frames. It's overall really strange. And in addition to that, there are no running attacks making boss fights a bit more difficult and anoying.Overall, not to shabby, not great either. Map design:The map design is a bloody mess. Alot of corridors look exactly the same and alot of objects blend into the enviroment.I overlooked NPCs aswell as the paths where i was supposed to go. Also, there is no teleport system. While you can acess the blacksmith from alot of different stations, you can't do that with the monk who enhances your potions. Alot of backtracking is involved in this open world game. Shortcuts open up rather often so its not to terrible but it's still no good. Also, you never really know where to go. Since all the paths look the same you run around in circles alot and if you get lost. That's beyond anoying. Its especially terrible in the later sections of the game.Item distribution: The beginning seems solid. They give you alot of variations that all look nice. However, at the later stages of the game they just throw at you plenty of epic weapons and armor that are twice as good as the ones you used before. That felt awefully off.Difficulty:It's solid. I managed to do a couple of bosses on my first attempt. Some not. Overall, still challenging.Graphics and Performance:The game performs finely. 60fps @ highest settings with a gtx 970 is nice to have. Overall it looks impressive. Only the hair of characters look aweful. Also, the game crashed twice within 10 hours and the voice acting is all over the place. Conclusion:I'm in love with this genre. And because of the lack of games that adopt this genre i am willing to overlook all of its flaws and play more of it. If you are like me, thirsting for more games like Dark souls then you can pick it up. If not, stay away from this game.			"

												I am rather enjoying this game. I have attempted to play Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 in the past, and ultimately got to a point where I was more frustrated than enjoying my time with them. I haven't reached that point with Lords. Sure, it can be challening at times, but at least I feel I am moving forward, opposed to spending a gaming session with nothing to show for it, like I did with the DS games.I would recommend giving this a shot if you 'kinda liked Dark Souls', but got too frustrated with it to finish. Lords feels very similar, but yet not quite as a driver for premature balding from pulling your hair out.			"

Posted: January 28, 2016
												This review is from someone who has not played any of the Dark Souls games. To start I think this is a good game and worth your time. The first 3 hours or so of the game I found frustrating. The combat seemed clunky, the game was confusing and lacked direction, the areas were confusing and there is no in-game map. After those initial 3 hours, I started to get the hang of the combat. I still feel it isn't super tight, but you start to learn what will hit you and what won't. You learn the attack windows and get the hang of the various weapons. The structure eventually becomes familiar and you understand how progression will take place. Give it 3 or so hours, you'll know if you like it by that point. I put about 15 hours into the game, and I think that was good for the price. I didn't really have a desire to go back and do New Game + but its there too. Pros: - Looks nice. I really liked the armor and weapon designs. - Lots of options for character creation and leveling. - Cool bosses. - Worked great on a controller. - Lots of secrets for those willing to explore carefully. Cons: - Combat feels clunky. It gets better, but still don't feel it is super tight. - Difficulty ramp was sort of reversed. Harder at the beginning than torward the end. Somewhat due to leveling, but also due to being better at the game. - NO MAP!			"

												So I played this game before I played Dark Souls. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:- Reasonable difficulty level. Each enemy has its own strategy to defeat it, but mistakes are punished hard.- amazing graphics- non linear world/map layout. lots of things to explore- no minimap or map in general. you have to look twice to find everything ( i have missed several treasure chests because of rushing through an area)- easy to learn, hard to master combat system- few class options but significant changes in playstyle ( equipping another weapon could feel like a whole new class )- advanced equipment system needs you to care for things like weight or poise- lots of non randomized gear- rewarding experience system ( the more enemies you kill without dying/saving the more exp you'll get from a kill)- the game runs very stable. i had no crashes or something in over 30 hours playingCons:- heavy backtracking. this whole game basically takes place in one giant keep and most of the doors are locked until later in the game- story is very standard. dialog choices are mostly irrelevant- magic is very buggy. it misses often - descriptions of trinkets are often unclear. look them up to see what they are doing- no new weapons in ""new game plus"" or aboveI had a lot of fun with this game and i recommend it to everyone who likes action-rpgs and overcoming challenges. And I also recommend to finish this game at least twice to find all items.edit after playing Dark Souls 2 SotfS: Lords of the Fallen is way better than Dark Souls 2. Much better graphics, better controls, better item customization, better overall fairness/difficulty.Only the length of this game is shorter, but i guess Dark Souls is only longer because you will die so often to bugs or unfair things like mobs hitting you through walls or somebody invading you as you try to catch your lost souls. buy this game - have fun			"

												TLDR:  Buy if you are desperate for a quick game that is heavily inspired by the souls series but BE prepared to be dissapointed because it is waaay shorter. AND NEVER BUY THIS GAME WITHOUT A DECENT STEAM DISCOUNT!    PROS : -good graphics. waay better than the souls games ( other than bloodborne ofc),- Great melee combat, more realistic version of souls melee. with actual weight behind attacks -  great character design -well designed levels -Great armor and weapon design   CONS : -WORTHLESS NEW game +!!!! AND THIS IS THE WORST OFFENCE. ONLY 1 new armor set in new game + Just ONE! ( if you guys find more equipment pls tell me. I for one cant find any )-no gameplay outside of the main story.  No exploration.-Flavour text makes no sense, I got a legendary sword that gets stronger with each kill and a weapon from another world.... both of them deals half as much damage as the weapon you get from frkn palace guards in the late game that in the lore , couldnt even kill 1 rhogar lord! but they wield weapons 3 times stronger!!! WTF-SPOILER !!! ......A certain point in the game sets it up so that you get to choose sides, but you actualy dont!  Near the end of the game you find out that your true enemy is someone else from the ""god"" you are supposed to kill. and instead of being given the choice whether to belive him or not harken belives him just like that! and procedes to fight against the entire human army! How does he know that the ghostly figure of his dead friend is not an illusion? -Plot is barely explained. as detailed by my rant below -World map size is small not even half of dark souls 1- game length is short. I only got to 20 hours because I forced myself to get the secret weapons of the bosses. which by the way are all useless as they rarely deal more damage than the weapons you get before facing them.- skills are there but barely needed for actual combat. I went warior but never and I mean NEVER needed to use my skills other than for solving an ocational puzzle. I got them just for the sake of being able to enjoy the warior class but I could and normaly dont use them anyway. they could have given skills more importance or impact in the game.-weapons and armor are recolored and reused. at first you Apreciate the good looks of equipment. then you realize that the late game version is a recolored version of that same armor. hell even the kinks and scratches are in the same place! WTF Long Rant version :-Bought the game on sale and went in knowing that it is a  subpar dark souls. and despite that I enjoyed the game, that is untill I got to new game + Frgn new game plus barely has anything + about it. only I found only 1 new armor set! WTF Kind of new game + is that? Oh and the story is even more vague than Dark Souls. Why is Harken a prissoner? What the hell was the opening scene about?  What was the hammer that he got in the opening cutscene? Why did the final boss turn into that? And the world map is barely as big as half of the Dark souls original map. Probablt only as big as Anor Londo + sens fortress + Seaths  castle. And though the armors in the game do look cool the problem with them is that the late game armor is nothing more than a recolored version of earlier armor pieces. And the item descriptions are fckn dissapointing. You get a legendary weapon of some sort that has half the damage of the weapons you get from the palace soldiers late in the game? wtf . "

												I really enjoyed this game. I actually played it back to back (two different play throughs) with using two different builds (Cleric then Rogue). If you are new to this type of game, i would recommend starting with a cleric build. These builds can take a beating and Protect spell will allow for ample healing later on the game. It plays like a Souls game (concept wise) but I don't think it is a fair comparison. I'm a huge Souls fan and appreciate the mechanics of the game genre. Many reviews state the game play is slow for combat. This is somewhat true. Most of the weapons are heavy and require good timing to swing, but this adds the reality to the fighting. Two handed weapons would be this slow in true combat. I think if you approach this game with the mindset of having a Souls experience, you may be disappointed, but if you keep in mind that this is more of a mechanics type of souls experience then you will enjoy the game. in my opinion the game starts off as hard as a Souls game but you eventually build your charactor high enough were you start dominating the game, unlike souls, no matter how high you level up you are still always vulnerable. in any case. Great graphics, cool environment (levels do connect like the original Dark Souls 1 levels), fun fighting. Story is OK. But this is a fun play (while you are waiting for Souls III :) ).  My only complaint on the game would be the camera angle. At time during battle the camera will move to an angle where some part of the environment would block your view. This was annoying at times but only happened a handful of times throughout the game.Enjoy			"

Lords of the Fallen was quite hypnotizing experience.Another game by Polish developers that came out in recent years that is of great quality and gameplay. Story isn’t too strong as this game focuses on fighting aspects and gameplay mechanics which were quite solid. I always wanted to go into Dark Souls series and knew that the gameplay there is brutal so I decided to try this game instead and was quite happy about it. It took a while to learn most of the fights especially with bosses and character build plays important role here. Initially I had tons of trouble with trash enemies until I started using magic together with the sword. The world is small but very beautiful and dark in its appearance. The save system is designed around checkpoints and game has great experience system.Pros+ Great boss fights that give achievements to drops if fought correctly+ Great fighting mechanics where you feel you feel the weight of your weapon and armor+ Great experience gaining system in which the more you kill without save the more rewarding it is + A ton of weapons and armor and run customization+ Great soundtrack and sound effects+ World is very beautifulCons- Forgettable characters who really do not add too much to the weak story- Some builds are very weak and you tend to spec character to one build only- World has very narrow passages and progression through it is very linearEven with some faults this game was difficult to put down even when I was playing titles like Fallout 4 at the same time.

												I Like Lords of the Fallen. It's got most of the ingredients for a fun game. It looks rather great, the sound design is passable and it runs pretty well. It lifts gameplay mechanics from one of the better RPGs in a long while, though it doesn't implement these mechanics quite as well. The combat is tight and tactical, but can get repetitive.

												Very fun game, plenty of replay potential, max lvl 4th spells are very cool and if going faith build you can use them all.The combat is enjoyable, love the slow motion kills, the mechanics for boss fights are fun (phase changes) the scenary is lovely and the detail on the weapons and armor (mainly armor) is INCREDIBLE!few things are a little pointless/random like the luck system is bogus..dont put more than 1 pt into it and the crafting (if u could call it that) is a simple *break this rune, and put it in/take out of item you want.*WARNING: dont hold onto too much xp (souls for the dark souls people) i've lost 200k and 300k xp before.But i would still highly recommend this game.

												Great game. Very well done implementation of secret locations, obtainable items, and achievements. Ninja Gaiden fans should like this. I was impressed from the moment the game started. There was nothing special about the story but I did not dislike it. Game suffers from the inclusion of certain moves such as the shield charge and also magic spells that remove the challenge of the base combat. I would suggest that the magic system be reworked or removed in favor of being replaced by the magical abilities of the weapons being augmented with the faith stat. The most difficult battle may be the first boss which may also be the most balanced, fun and challenging; this is how the whole game should remain. This problem arises in part due to stat leveling and equipment balancing. Having the player characters stats and equipment determine the scale of the challenge might solve this.			"

												Recommend whe it is on sale. (purchased for $10)I am new to the whole hardcore genre and thought this game was a great place to start and it was. It's fun and forgiving for people who may be new to the genre or want a break from the unforgiving dark souls. The game certainly takes from dark souls but it doesn't try to be it. There is plenty of secrets and ways to build your charcter and thus how you play is up to you. I had only 2 crash situations that occured half way through the game, but over all the game runs well and it looks fantastic. Have to give it 8.5/10 becasue there isn't really a story even though it tries its' hardest to tell one.			"

												I don't write a lot of reviews, but it seems criminal to me that Lords of the Fallen's current Steam average is ""Mixed,"" so I'm doing my small part to tip the scales. This game isn't perfect, but it's a lot of fun and I highly recommend it if you can catch it on sale (I bought it for $9.99). GraphicsMy PC isn't top-of-the-line by today's standards, but I was able to keep visual settings pretty high and maintain a solid framerate. The environments are beautiful, your character looks like a total badass no matter what weapon or armor combination you equip, the common enemies are well-designed and intimidating enough, the Lords are terrifying, and the animations are smooth. There was never a moment in-game where I was disappointed in the visuals, but I guess if I'm digging for a ""con"" here, I'd say that there wasn't a huge variety in the environments. SoundSometimes, music and sound effects can make or break a game experience for me, but this wasn't one of those times. The theme song is great and there were a couple of times when the music crescendoed while I was fighting a Lord (which was cool and added to the ""badass"" factor), but for the most part, I didn't notice the music at all in this game. That's okay, I guess. The sound effects were impressive, especially the growls and roars of enemies and the impacts of weapons against shields and walls. The one thing I really wished as I was playing through the game was that enemy footsteps were more audible. There are times when you find yourself navigating corridors where enemies are patrolling, and you should be able to hear that big dude with the axe stomping around just down the hall...but you can't. The voice acting was well-performed throughout the game. Some were better than others, but for the most part, these people did a good job (the most cringeworthy line in the whole game is probably Harkyn's ""My vow of defiance!"" in the opening sequence). StoryOkay, to be fair, the story isn't what will draw you into this particular game, but it is well-crafted, and so many minor details are revealed through picking up scrolls, which activate voiceovers that describe enemies, experiences, or locations. Even if you don't find yourself caring about the lore, you learn more and more through the words of characters that you haven't even met...and this is often a rewarding experience. You learn more about this world and its history if you care to, but it feels more alive, regardless. There were people here before you, and you get to hear their stories and connect the pieces for yourself. GameplayThis is it. This is why you start the game, and this is why you continue it...even after you've been killed 30+ times by the same enemy and you curse so loudly that you wake up your wife and fear for your marriage. The gameplay is just. So. GOOD. Okay, okay, with the boss fights, it sometimes feels less like you're exploiting weaknesses and more like you're just memorizing patterns, but for some inexplicable reason, it's still fun. Blocking, dodging, rolling, slashing, thrusting--it all feels so...right. Now, granted, it takes a while to get there, and it takes even longer if you're experimenting with different weapon types, but once you get the hang of it, this combat experience is beautiful. My first piece of advice: don't just spam your attack buttons. This took me a while to figure out, but each weapon type has a narrow interval after each swing (slash, thrust, etc.) when you should activate your next attack for a quicker follow-up, with less of an impact on your energy. You can even practice this without enemies around--just try out different combinations and watch your energy bar. It will flash with each perfectly-timed attack.Also keep an eye on your equipment and Endurance. If your Weight score is green, you'll move and execute combinations more quickly (this may be less important for warriors wearing heavy armors and shields, but I played primarily with short swords and daggers, so speed was extremely important). You have quite a few customization options as far as character development and equipment, but you need to keep a few things in mind. This is a combat RPG with a strong emphasis on melee combat. Your ranged attacks are limited to spells and your gauntlet, which also uses up your magic. In general, you won't be fighting or killing enemies from a distance. You also won't be collecting tons of loot and trading/selling items. It's just not that type of game. Personally, I was okay with that...lately, when I've played some other RPGs, I've hoped that the enemy I just killed didn't drop anything, because it felt more like work than play to be constantly managing my inventory.  There are runes that you can equip to weapons and armor, and there are attributes that you can improve as you progress, but this is not nearly as involved as, say, Skyrim or Diablo or even Borderlands.SummaryTo sum things up: Lords of the Fallen is an excellent combat RPG. Just know what you're getting before you get it. You'll die (probably a lot), but the combat is amazing, and you'll feel a sense of accomplishment with each enemy that you defeat.			"

												This is my first review but I just felt obligated to do a review on a game I passed up for so long.So i'm sure you've read in just about EVERY review/comment/description of LotF that it draws heavy similarities to the Dark Souls series. And it definitely does. But a key point I've only seen one other reviewer make is that it also feels just as similair to Darksiders with a bit of Shadows of Mordor. If you enjoyed any 3 of those games you should pick this game up (preferably on sale!). The Good, Neutral, and Bad + The difficulty curve is very well done, boss fights are about half as hard as Soulsborne bosses I'd say, but some of the regular enemies can be just as difficult and annoying.  Just make sure you're upgrading your weapons, armor, and stats as you go!+ Really liked the XP multiplier mechanic, sometimes it's worth it to go big and not use a checkpoint since the XP can go all the way up to being doubled what you'd normally get.+ I don't normally like using Magic all that much in 3rd Person Action RPGs, with the exception of Shadows of Mordor, but I really liked it here. You have regular spells which can buff/heal/distract and you also have what's called a Gauntlet, which is a cannon-like thing on your hand that shoots 3 different styles (Shotgun blast-like, Projectile, and Explosive/Grenade). More importantly you can imbue the different shot styles with elements (Poison, Fire, Magic, etc) which more likely than not will provide a great DoT. The fact that some of the Gauntlet shots go through shields of enemies sometimes proved INVALUABLE, as some of the Tower Shielded foes can be very hard to hit and provide a very small window to attack them after they do. Just imbue some fire to a projectile and watch those suckers burn behind their wall of wood. = Generic fantasy medieval setting, but the graphics are above average= Combat will be very familiar to any Souls vet, albeit a little clunkier, and without the fantastic multiple combos the series is known for.- My biggest complaint is the fact that there is no multiplayer at all. At the very least I feel like the game could of excelled from having a designated phased area where players could PVP, there's a good enough diversity in builds and playstyles to support it staying relatively fresh. Co-Op could of worked well too.- My second biggest complaint is just a personal one and it's more a QoL issue. There's no Fast Travel. You'll have to do a bit of backtracking in the game at some points (the game does provide numerous shortcuts though thankfully), and you might want to return to earlier levels to farm/hunt for items so the fact that there is no Fast Travel at any point in the game can be quite the bummer at times. I'm not asking for a Fast Travel for every checkpoint crystal, as there are numerous, but an option to port to the beginning of each major area would of been nice.Overall I'd give it a solid 8/10. No more, no less.If you've played the Soulsborne series to death and are itching for a fix before the GOTY 2016 holy grail masterpiece god-sent Dark Souls 3 comes out, pick this up.			"

												The combat:The combat feels rather slow-ish but very impactful. The movement is very weird. Rolling feels kinda wrong. Even fast rolling  seems slow. Walking away seems more effective but rolling generates alot of invincibility frames. It's overall really strange. And in addition to that, there are no running attacks making boss fights a bit more difficult and anoying.Overall, not to shabby, not great either. Map design:The map design is a bloody mess. Alot of corridors look exactly the same and alot of objects blend into the enviroment.I overlooked NPCs aswell as the paths where i was supposed to go. Also, there is no teleport system. While you can acess the blacksmith from alot of different stations, you can't do that with the monk who enhances your potions. Alot of backtracking is involved in this open world game. Shortcuts open up rather often so its not to terrible but it's still no good. Also, you never really know where to go. Since all the paths look the same you run around in circles alot and if you get lost. That's beyond anoying. Its especially terrible in the later sections of the game.Item distribution: The beginning seems solid. They give you alot of variations that all look nice. However, at the later stages of the game they just throw at you plenty of epic weapons and armor that are twice as good as the ones you used before. That felt awefully off.Difficulty:It's solid. I managed to do a couple of bosses on my first attempt. Some not. Overall, still challenging.Graphics and Performance:The game performs finely. 60fps @ highest settings with a gtx 970 is nice to have. Overall it looks impressive. Only the hair of characters look aweful. Also, the game crashed twice within 10 hours and the voice acting is all over the place. Conclusion:I'm in love with this genre. And because of the lack of games that adopt this genre i am willing to overlook all of its flaws and play more of it. If you are like me, thirsting for more games like Dark souls then you can pick it up. If not, stay away from this game.			"

I am in no way a hardcore Dark Souls player but playing LotF def made me wanna play Dark Souls again with my newfound knowledge of this type of game.

												Lords of the Fallen is a Dark Souls copycat, and that's good.  Emulation is the highest form of flattery, and Dark Souls is awesome.However.It falls short entirely in the combat department, which lacks the finesse that Dark Souls boasted.  Rather than ducking and dodging, for the majority of the game all you seem to have to do is lock on, lift your shield up, and run in circles.  It makes me ♥♥♥♥ing dizzy.  The bossesi n particular produce very few obvious openings and seem to have the same strategy as you - Hide behind their shield.  It becomes very drawn out.I thought Dark Souls 2 had repetetive and boring combat (in PvE that is), but this takes the cake.Couple that with the fact that your main character is a boring, generic space-marine circa 1200AD, and there you have it.  Decent visuals, but ♥♥♥♥ing boring to play.I am happy for what the game REPRESENTS, and that's perhaps more Dark Souls-esque games in the future.  But I'd hope further attempts to emulate Dark Souls will also capture the game's unique combat technicalities.			"

Now, granted, it takes a while to get there, and it takes even longer if you're experimenting with different weapon types, but once you get the hang of it, this combat experience is beautiful. My first piece of advice: don't just spam your attack buttons. This took me a while to figure out, but each weapon type has a narrow interval after each swing (slash, thrust, etc.) when you should activate your next attack for a quicker follow-up, with less of an impact on your energy. You can even practice this without enemies around--just try out different combinations and watch your energy bar. It will flash with each perfectly-timed attack.Also keep an eye on your equipment and Endurance. If your Weight score is green, you'll move and execute combinations more quickly (this may be less important for warriors wearing heavy armors and shields, but I played primarily with short swords and daggers, so speed was extremely important). You have quite a few customization options as far as character development and equipment, but you need to keep a few things in mind. This is a combat RPG with a strong emphasis on melee combat. Your ranged attacks are limited to spells and your gauntlet, which also uses up your magic. In general, you won't be fighting or killing enemies from a distance. You also won't be collecting tons of loot and trading/selling items. It's just not that type of game. Personally, I was okay with that...lately, when I've played some other RPGs, I've hoped that the enemy I just killed didn't drop anything, because it felt more like work than play to be constantly managing my inventory.  There are runes that you can equip to weapons and armor, and there are attributes that you can improve as you progress, but this is not nearly as involved as, say, Skyrim or Diablo or even Borderlands.SummaryTo sum things up: Lords of the Fallen is an excellent combat RPG. Just know what you're getting before you get it. You'll die (probably a lot), but the combat is amazing, and you'll feel a sense of accomplishment with each enemy that you defeat.			"

												The combat:The combat feels rather slow-ish but very impactful. The movement is very weird. Rolling feels kinda wrong. Even fast rolling  seems slow. Walking away seems more effective but rolling generates alot of invincibility frames. It's overall really strange. And in addition to that, there are no running attacks making boss fights a bit more difficult and anoying.Overall, not to shabby, not great either. Map design:The map design is a bloody mess. Alot of corridors look exactly the same and alot of objects blend into the enviroment.I overlooked NPCs aswell as the paths where i was supposed to go. Also, there is no teleport system. While you can acess the blacksmith from alot of different stations, you can't do that with the monk who enhances your potions. Alot of backtracking is involved in this open world game. Shortcuts open up rather often so its not to terrible but it's still no good. Also, you never really know where to go. Since all the paths look the same you run around in circles alot and if you get lost. That's beyond anoying. Its especially terrible in the later sections of the game.Item distribution: The beginning seems solid. They give you alot of variations that all look nice. However, at the later stages of the game they just throw at you plenty of epic weapons and armor that are twice as good as the ones you used before. That felt awefully off.Difficulty:It's solid. I managed to do a couple of bosses on my first attempt. Some not. Overall, still challenging.Graphics and Performance:The game performs finely. 60fps @ highest settings with a gtx 970 is nice to have. Overall it looks impressive. Only the hair of characters look aweful. Also, the game crashed twice within 10 hours and the voice acting is all over the place. Conclusion:I'm in love with this genre. And because of the lack of games that adopt this genre i am willing to overlook all of its flaws and play more of it. If you are like me, thirsting for more games like Dark souls then you can pick it up. If not, stay away from this game.			"

												Great game. Very well done implementation of secret locations, obtainable items, and achievements. Ninja Gaiden fans should like this. I was impressed from the moment the game started. There was nothing special about the story but I did not dislike it. Game suffers from the inclusion of certain moves such as the shield charge and also magic spells that remove the challenge of the base combat. I would suggest that the magic system be reworked or removed in favor of being replaced by the magical abilities of the weapons being augmented with the faith stat. The most difficult battle may be the first boss which may also be the most balanced, fun and challenging; this is how the whole game should remain. This problem arises in part due to stat leveling and equipment balancing. Having the player characters stats and equipment determine the scale of the challenge might solve this.			"

												Recommend whe it is on sale. (purchased for $10)I am new to the whole hardcore genre and thought this game was a great place to start and it was. It's fun and forgiving for people who may be new to the genre or want a break from the unforgiving dark souls. The game certainly takes from dark souls but it doesn't try to be it. There is plenty of secrets and ways to build your charcter and thus how you play is up to you. I had only 2 crash situations that occured half way through the game, but over all the game runs well and it looks fantastic. Have to give it 8.5/10 becasue there isn't really a story even though it tries its' hardest to tell one.			"

												I think this game is great. Every one relates it to dark souls games but it is a game on its own, just because it isn't as hard as the Doyle series doesn't mean it's not good. And it's pretty hard as swell. It's got fun hack in slash and a great hard hitting Fighting style and really immerssive graphics even though it's mainly snowy peaks and crumbling castles. There are 10 bosses in the game who are easy when you figure out a tactic Witch is relatively quick which is kinda dissapointing although the last one is pretty tough. I rate 7.8 / 10			"

I am in no way a hardcore Dark Souls player but playing LotF def made me wanna play Dark Souls again with my newfound knowledge of this type of game. Anyways, I recommend it to anyone finding Dark Souls too hard or complicated. This will help you get familiar with the type of gameplay and learn to appreciate it.			"

												At the moment, this game is a buggy mess. The first boss noclipped through the floor, forcing me to restart. Then, when i got to the second boss, he froze half of the times i tried to fight him. Instead of getting that crystal wall thing around him, he stood still. I did not want to cheese him, so i restarted. Similar♥♥♥♥♥♥has happened a lot during the few hours i have played the gameThe voice acting is sub-par at bestThe game is forgiving where it needs to be hard, and hard where it needs to be forgiving. Introducing the player to fighting 2-3 otherwise difficult enemies AT ONCE early in the game, with a high possibility of the boss bugging out and joining in, is a bit harsh. The boss fights are a bit tedious, due to the limited movesets, and success just about relies on how heavy your armor is and if you have the decoy spell thing - this needs a nerf, also. Just spam that and you automatically win.			"

												oK... I'm not gonna lie... this game is very difficult... especially for people like me who have never played any of the Dark Souls games... However it CAN be done... It takes patience... lots and lots of patience! The combat system is quite elegant in its own right, a very well thought out and complex system where weight of armour slows you down, weight of the weapon and whether or not you are yet strong enough to be able to swing it with one hand while holding a shield in the other... Stamina every swing,  block, parry and riposte costs you stamina... As well as agility, faith and whatnot. You cannot simply just run in to a group of Rhogar (the bad guys) and expect to win... Not even on easy difficulty setting. All the Lords and their warriors (although can eventually be slain with pure brute force), require different techniques into bringing them down... some techniques may take you a minute to learn, some may even take you 2 hours to learn... There has been times I have wanted to fist my monitor and throw my keyboard through the study window.The graphics on Ultra setting are quite beautiful, the artwork is fantastic, Dark and Gothic environments with enemies that look like they have come straight from the lower depths of hell... The art team should be pleased with their work... although the cut scenes were a little on the crappy side. The soundtrack is awesome... dark music that helps you immerse into your environment and sets the mood. The story line is a little lacking not plot wise but it's just missing something.The inventory and upgrading systems are very easy to deal with... you don't need to be some sort of mathematician to work it out...Overall... I give this game an 8/10... it loses two points because: 1 - The easy difficulty setting should be way more easier than what it is... for new comers it should be much more forgiving because some people (like me) enjoy playing games at a consistent pace first and then increase the difficulty when we play again... But hey No big deal... just practice practice practice!!2 - The story and cutscenes were a little lacking, but it wasn't too bad...3 - Would like to be able to jump without rolling when landing... A few little spots to navigate which proved more difficult then they should have...4 - A map in the menu screen would have been sensational... just coz sometimes I like to know where I'm going (especially the catacombs :/ )			"

												GOOD:- The combat feels Dark Souls style, and it's pretty challenging, so if you wanted more Dark Souls, you should try this game.- The story is interesting, though it's not as detailed as the devs promised it to be.- Lots of different weapons and armor, and overall good loot will keep you interested in the game.- It's good for you if you like Darksiders. You'll find lots of similar moods and design decisions in this game.- Graphics are great. It's not Crysis 3, but lights and particle effects look stunning. Character models are also good.BAD:- PC version's optimization is AWFUL. Frequent crashes (especially last few hours of the game), FPS drops on the high-end PCs, and so on.- Camera's behavior is really odd sometimes.- Although Dark Souls style, combat is very slow. You may find yourself annoyed by how slow Harkyn's moves are. Especially his rolls.- Locations often feel repetitive.- Bosses aren't impressive, they're mostly humanoid, and bossfights are not as satisfying as they should be.- Rogue style of playthrough is much more difficult than Warrior.- The game's too short, I've completed it in 13 hours.- Characters' lip-syncing looks incredibly stupid, lips' moves and voices don't match at all.VERDICTI liked the game, and I think it has lots of potential. However, first of all, the devs need to fix the PC version's issues (as I've heard, PS4 version has lots of bugs too) for the game to be playable and enjoyable. I'll be clearly doing a second run as a rogue or warrior after the game is fixed! I'm looking forward to that. As for now, the game is good, but it's not as good as I wanted it to be. And it's definitely not better than Dark Souls or Darksiders.RATING: 68/100. The game is good. Just good, that's it.If you want to read the thoroughly detailed version of this review, please visit:http://alessusreviews.blogspot.com/2014/10/review-1-long-awaited-piece-of-art.html#more "

												Anticipating at least a modicum of a poor man's Dark Souls, this f|ngerlicking $crotum stain was a great disappointment.Your character is a Gears of War-broadshouldered, slow-as-syrup-moving 60 year old guy with emphysema. While he's rolling you can make yourself a cup of coffee and watch the news and weather before he's back up. Striking a few times with a weapon leaves our hero gasping for air like a 400 pound chain-smoking runner. It's super off-putting and becomes annoying within a few minutes. Attacking takes forever and makes the combat dull as yeast-infected dishwater with the sparkle of a rotten cancer-mole.Inventory is unnecessary confusing, greeting you with all the warmth of a Calculus 3 exam, menus splattered on the screen with no order to it whatsoever. You're also stuck with a camera that is all over the place, even failing to adjust correctly as your character moves up and down simple stairs, or effectively zooming out when enemies press you into a wall and you can't see sh|t.Hit-detection is reminiscent of a drunken, back alley-circus knife throwing act; results vary from horrifying to laughable. Will this swing hit you/the enemy? Place your bets, gentlemen.There's no poise or stagger like you're used to from the Soul's games it tries to copy, not even a plunge attack is present, and it's obvious that a poor man's Dark Souls isn't even fitting this title; it's just a stinking turd dressed up in pretty colors.Many times you can't cue for example a roll action when you are getting massacred, even when you still have enough stamina to do a roll - which would often save you and make the fighting and dodging so fun in Soul's games. Nope, game doesn't register the button press until your character comes to a complete £vcking standstill. Which means you'll see over and over again that ""I am going to be hit now, I have stamina left to do a roll, but the game won't let me and....I died again"". Bvllsh|t like that would leave anyone p|ssed because it hampers your actions instead of actually letting you act upon your skill and observations during the fight. Instead you can't but stare helplessly at your character dying, while the stamina bar shows that you should be able to continue the fighting and then some.I ended up beating the first boss and I felt...irritated and aggravated. Like I'd had a gruesome day at work, been stuck in traffic for an hour, only to come home to someone b|tching at me for not having taken out the trash and having dinner ready. There was absolutely no sense of joy, accomplishment, or challenge. Just spite and resentment.And that's when I quit.Like the bimbo you met last night at the bar; the lights are on, but no one is home. So you leave an honest review on the toilet wall for others to see, and keep looking for personal entertainment actually worth a damn.			"

			Views: 459		

			Lords of the Fallen is the first western Souls-like game that I'm aware of. How does it play? WATCH LIVE ► http://www.twitch.tv/Aazzdos FULL PLAYLIST ►...		

I'll preface this by saying that I'm a huge Dark Souls fan.  However, I'm extremely critical of all games that I play, including those dear to my heart like the Souls series.  All of my experiences playing this game are as a lightly armoured Rogue.  Apparently, the game is much different (easier) for heavily armoured Warriors, but I lack the experience to comment on that.  Scroll to the very bottom for the TLDR-style conclusion.REVIEWThis game is the only one in several years to crash on me.  My PC should be able to handle it without a hitch on High, maybe even Ultra settings, yet I was forced to turn off all the extra effects and go Medium just to make it playable.I don't remember anything about the soundtrack.  Voice acting is stiff, but sometimes to comical effect.The story is dull, the characters are forgettable and the writing is flat out bad.  I for one can actually appreciate the comedic potential of bad writing, but most people won't be so forgiving.  The majority of the story is told through collecting Audio Logs.  This is a nice touch, as it lets you understand the setting while you continue exploring.Combat is... all over the place.  Sometimes combat is fluid and makes sense.  Other times enemies will immediately counterattack and stun you without an animation, making you sit through free damage.  Many enemies have giant shields, and just like in a Souls game, they're extremely monotonous to fight.The pacing of combat is very slow compared to either Souls game, where your fast roll feels like something between a medium and fat roll from DS1.  I wouldn't say the change in pace is a good or bad thing, just different, and Souls vets will definitely take time to adjust.  Boss fights drag on with huge health bars and little variance in attacks, making them a chore after the first few moments.  They do, however, use a 'phase' system similar to bosses in MMOs, which can make the fights more interesting.  The game uses a combo system that encourages you to chain attacks together for increased damage and poise breaking.  This sounds great on paper, but in practice, you'll rarely be given an opportunity to use them because......poise is an absolute mess in this game.  When staggered, enemies will often break out of the stun to continue attacking you, which defies any sense of game logic.I didn't use magic to comment, but the gauntlet - a ranged magic weapon - feels extremely forced into the game, as if it was something for the devs to tick off their checklist.  Same thing with destructable items.While the graphics are very good and well detailed, the game world is tiny and forces you to backtrack so much that one can only assume there were budget restraints.  The game tries to emulate the joy of Souls shortcuts, but for every one that makes sense, there are ten that don't... or ask you to come back much later in the game.  On foot.There's really not much selection in weapon types, especially considering you'll be locked to your stat of choice.  Agility, for example, has daggers, shortswords and staves, along with one axe that feels slow and heavy like a Strength weapon.  You can socket items similar to Diablo games, but in similar fashion you'll be using the exact same gems every time to min/max.Finally, let's talk about bugs.  Crashes.  Animations being skipped.  Enemies standing still and attacking you from bizarre angles.  Invisible enemies.  Frequently absurd hitboxes.  And yes... this game has almost been out for a year.CONCLUSIONLords of the Fallen is a shorter, buggier and often nonsensical version of Dark Souls 2 but with superior graphics and an art style reminiscent of Warhammer.  While I wouldn't call it a terrible game and did enjoy my playthrough at least somewhat, there's a lot of barriers blocking the way for 'fun'.  Impatient players and Souls players in particular will be rubbed the wrong way by this game.  I cannot recommend this game in good faith simply because you can buy Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin for the same price, a game that is superior in almost every way.  Only consider this game if you can get it at a very reduced price and are prepared to muscle through bugs and poor optimization.  What I will say, however, is that it's very important that this game exists, because it shows that companies other than From are willing to take a shot at Souls-likes.  Let's hope the next attempt is a better one.			"

												This is my unbiased review with the game as a lot of people seem to be comparing to darks souls for whatever reason; I've never played dark souls. This game is a garbled mess.For some reason some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a developer thought that placing flavour text riddle style for all armor and weapon stat descriptions. This is insufferably annoying because here in 2017 i am unable to find a resource that tells me the set bonuses for specific armor sets. How is a player suppose to create a build when information is missingThe combat is clunky. Several required skill movements and combos aren't even shown to the player. For example, fighting enemies using shields is frustrating unless you use shield bashing.The recommended hardware on the store page is also lying. You would probably need at least 12 GB of ram because I had to set my paging file from 8 Gb to 12 GB to stop crashing every ♥♥♥♥ing 15 minutes; this is running only high textures and not ultra. The worst part is that the first day i played the game it was running flawlessly for 4 hours so no refund was possible for me.Price tag of $50 CAD honestly this game is a turd; this was the release price from what i can remeber. If you manage to get this game on sale for 15$ - 20$ CAD its okay if you really want to play this game inclsuive of all dlc and what not. But honestly this game does everything in its power to just annoy the player. Hidden stats, clunky combat, risk/reward that makes no sense (because you actually have to 'store' your earned exp to gain a higher loot drop rate and exp rewards) as it stops you from progressively leveling.Story so far is just cliche and main character is unlikable so its not even a good single player experience.I honestly wouldn't buy anything from this developer again due to the quality of this game being so poor.

												I'm sorry but the frustrations outweigh the fun in this game. Too many enemies hide behind a shield and are only vulnerable when they attack or are shield bashed by you. You shield bash the enemy, hit them, have them recover from the shield bash, shield bash them again, hit them again, rinse and repeat. It gets so boring so quickly, especially since the game reuses so many enemies. The game's combat is too slow that it feels wrong. It's not fun when everything feels like it's in slow mo. Some weapons almost feel useless because they take so long to swing that the enemy will I have have hit and stunned you before you finish your attack.  And not one of the bosses is fun to fight. They're slow, repetitive and cheap. The only thing that makes the bosses hard is the fact that they do a ton of damage and stun lock. Being hard does not equal good. The camera's also a pain to deal with and the lock on is annoying since it doesn't move from enemy to enemy very well. Other than that, the armor sets are pretty cool and the areas look decent. If this game had faster, better combat, it'd be so much better.			"

												45FPS on a GTX 1071, wow. Combat is incredibly clunky, sorry but I'm considering my first refund.Edit: After playing for a bit I see now that I came with the mindset of a Souls game player, and that might have been my mistake, the gameplay is rather fun once you get the hang of it and get over the clunky combat. I would change my recommendation but a product in which you are over the recommended requirements and still performs poorly is a bad product IMO.			"

												I want to reccomend this game to people, because the combat system is great, the art is great, the story is entertaining, and it really has potential to be a staple game. However,t he company just did not finish their product. The game itself has performance issues. No matter how low I turned the graphics down, the game had long loading times and would slide show occasionally. Putting it in borderless window mode helped this, but not completely. The also randomly crashes. Not frequent enough to be a huge issue, but enough to be annoying.Furthermroe, the game not only refuses to hold your hand but flat out doesn't give any direction what so ever. I loved the souls series for their lack of hand holding, but i always coudl tell whether Iw as goign the right way or not and generally understood the direction I was heading. LotF felt like I was constantly stumbling around. So many times I'm just trying to find the right way and no sure if I'm even int he right area then bam boss fight out of no where. I can't count the amount of times I just sat there a moment wondering where I was.Then there's the stat system which didn't make any sense no matter how you cut it. Most weapons had damage scaling. I put 3% on one weapon got a huge boost in damage, another weapon had a natural 9% and did half the damage. I don't even know what the percentages mean. percetnage of what? 3% of 29 strength isn't 40, so it can't be that. I have no idea.TL;DR I'm about to fight the last boss and: I don't know where I am, I hav eno idea how the stat systems work, despite having a solid gaming PC I'm playing on pretty low graphic settings, and I jsut saw a blue screen of death for the first time in ten years.

												God damn broken a*s Hit detector also dont try to aim your hits in the gameCause thats broke tooI can live with lesser graphics...i can live with a crap storyI cannot live with me aiming at an enemy and the swing miss when im about 3 feet away...that I will not stand for.I like the game in alot of waysdecent graphics and not as hard as darksouls. It could be fun, The issues are many in some areas-boss battles is where they really show though.You swing VERY slowly in this game-if you could move and swing faster, than missing a few hits wouldn't be a big deal.... sadly with how long 1 or 2 hits can take EVERY hit counts.And than it gets even betterEver aimed 1 way and your guy swing in a differenct direction...yea...Thats the real killer of the game for me.you are hitting left a few striks, you think (time to move to the right) and so you move and left click, Your guy swing not right but left... again...And you die with your back turned toward your enemy.

												If I could describe this game in one word, that word would be slow. My goodness, this is slow. The combat - which was clearly trying to imitate that of the Souls series - is painfully slow and difficult, and I don't mean that in a good way. The combat is passable when fighting one normal enemy at a time, but extremely tedious and frustrating when fighting more than one at once, and don't even think about fighting a boss. In the two I fought - one only just barely defeating, and this was the tutorial one - it was an agonizingly slow, tedious and frustrating experience. Every single swing is very, very slow, and don't even think about rolling, it takes several seconds, and you'll just end up getting hit. Everything feels like it's so weighed down and heavy it's almost impossible to move fluently or quickly. Anyway, away from the combat. The graphics are alright, with the environments looking quite pretty at times, and some good lighting effects. The more stylistic approach to presentation means it isn't as murky and ugly as the graphics of the Souls series. The characters look acceptable, though lip movement is below average, and not really acceptable in this day and age of gaming. Faces are a bit bland and lifeless, too. Story and characters, urgh... there isn't much. I'm aware I've only played a very limited amount of this game, but I feel no desire to continue. The story is very generic and takes itself way too seriously, with not a glimmer of humour in it. The characters spout generic and cliche fantasy dialogue that would not be considered above a B-grade fantasy novel. The Witcher, this is not. In my 1 hour of play, I barely did anything, yet was bombared with heaps of weapons, armour and equipment, so much so that I didn't know what to do with it, what was good and what wasn't, and what I should keep, so I never changed from the generic start-off equipment I had. Balancing things out over time would have been appreciated. I'm glad I didn't buy this game for myself - even on sale - as I just played it from my friend's shared library. The combat and gameplay range from passable Souls clone to downright bad in boss fights, the graphics are fine but nothing special, and the story and characters and bland, forgettable and generic. I'm being generous in giving this a 6/10.			"

												1. MASSIVE framerate issues. R9 290x and frames still drop to below 20.2. Boring and tedious enemy encounters. Blind guy, guy with big axe, guy with sword and shield, headcrab thing...GO!3. Immutable enemy physics. Is he swinging at you? You'd better not be also swinging unless it's a killing blow! Enemies are wholly unlikely to stagger against even strong attacks, even when they're NOT attacking you!4. Breakables breakables breakables aka roll over ALL the things. Not a fan of this at all. You'll spend minutes at a time just rolling around the room trying to break every object possible because it MIGHT have an item. Stop it, this is not fun. Even Zelda narrowed their list of rewarding breakables.5. Incoherent enemy physics. Back to this again. This is EXTREMELY apparent with the First Warden (5 minutes in), enemies often exhibit motion that belies their skeletal structure. Try rolling behind an axe guy as he swings at you. Watch as he spins around on a dime mid-step and mid-swing to stay on target. The player cannot benefit from this level of precision homing.6. Forgettable story and characters. Right from the start, I can't seem to care about even the hero, let alone the people he encounters. Maybe part of that is the terribly awful dialogue animations. Maybe they're just poorly written. Maybe both.This game tries very hard to be Dark Souls with a Darksiders feel. It fails at both of these things significantly. I wouldn't recommend paying more than $15 for this game, if you're into that sort of thing.			"

												A decent ""Dark Souls copy"", pretty short story (first/blind run ~15 hours) which involves getting lost a few times. Dying isn't a problem either since there are checkpoints behind almost every corner. The storyline is alright, but not good enough to read as a bed-time story. Enemy types vary a lot: tower shield sword dudes (oh man I love these guys), tall guys with battle axes, crossbowmen, blind zombie things who freak the ♥♥♥♥ out when you make noise, and midgets who charge at you before you get the chance to see them. These enemies are literally everywhere. But the bosses you encounter are unique and have their own special combat style which is cool. The graphics are great, but there aren't very many options to choose the game's appearance from. At times my FPS dropped roughly but returned to normal after a few seconds, this was bearable and had little effect on the gameplay itself. The weapons and armor have amazing details and looks to them, and there are a lot to choose from because, you know...Fashion Souls.  I personally spent a lot of time to admire all these fine pieces of art along with the scenery I came across. Miracles are alright too, I guess. Unfortunately there's only 3 per class (+prayer which acts the same for all classes).The areas look great and bring a certain atmosphere to them, and thus it is sad that there are just 3 main areas you spend most of your time in. I also spent a few hours being lost in these areas, which became somewhat unpleasant after a while.I think that's all there is to say. If this game gets a sequel, I'd most likely play it. Even though it doesn't beat Dark Souls in the gameplay or difficulty, but rather in frustration and unforgiveness, it still offers a very enjoyable gaming experience.EDIT (26.11.2016):Played this game again, this time on a desktop PC. The game is still a bit choppy in certain places, but that's because of the poorly made PC port. This time around I started the game as a warrior, and didn't really get lost since I still remembered where to go for the most part. The areas, enemies and most of the bosses still made me die plenty of times, but still not as much as during my first playthrough. Not because of the previous experience, but because of the choice of class and ""build"". It's still a pretty and challenging game.			"

												This is just a Dark Souls wannabe. How in the hell can I run MGS5 perfectly fine on high everything and it's perfectly smooth. But this game is just too 'graphic intensive' for me to get 60 FPS at low settings? I'll tell you why, because it's one of those 'Preforms best on ALIENWARE TECH' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t type deals. The game play is 4/10 at best. Boss fights have unknown mechanics and that's fine I always enjoy a good fight. But a 100% to always hit stun followed by a two hit insta kill combo isn't 'a challenge' it's just bad development. Would not recommend. Go buy Dark Souls and play something that's not a rip off piece of garbage.			"

												Played this game for roughly one hour and ordered a refund. To make it short: The game looks beautiful, the sound design is good, BUT the combat is clunky as hell and the impact of your attacks feels like you're fighting with a towel instead of a man sized hammer (funny thing: you're facing some barrels and a box and your swing misses all of them even though your hammer clearly passes through the objects). Moreover, this game has some bugs & glitches right in the tutorial (voiceover of some lines did not start, etc). Yet alone the frustrating responsiveness to your input made me rage quit! The combat is not very difficult either, but forces you to dodge roll around till the special attack of your enemy starts and then you can make 1 or 2 attacks. Rinse and repeat until your enemy is down or you are, because the delay denied you that crucial dodge.			"

												*I will edit it once I finish the game*Well I really wan't sure if I should buy this game or not... On one hand, from what I saw and read, it should be fun because it's sort of like DS, but on the other hand many people have lots of problems with it.Played for now a little bit more than an hour, and I must say I do enjoy the game right now. It's a little bit harder than DS because it has a heavier movement.When I launched it for the first time it crashed, but afterwards I didn't have any problem launching it.Everything seems nice so far and I was wandering why people complained about it crashing and having optimization problems, now I see why.A little bit deeper into the game and I found that I have a very low FPS in open areas for some reson. I thought that it was just a random FPS drom at first but it continued every time I was in an open area... It was pretty annoying and made the game unplayable. It also made no sense since I can run Wild Hunt on Ultra with 50-60 FPS. Almost wanted to get a refund but then decided to try and solve the problem. didn't take me very long and i found a video that solved the FPS issue for me. If you have a nVidia GPU then check this video, it should solve the FPS problem. It worked for me!Skip to 2:25:

												The game's good, it plays well and it's a lot of fun: it is has a souls like gameplay but with more emphasys and realism on the physics and weight of your equipment and also great graphic. Unfortunately it's not perfect and it has some flaws, i.e. the map is not very large and there's a lot of backtracking. Also, it lacks on variety of enemies, but at least there are a lot of weapons and armors, which all look cool. The main story and side quests are not that great, standard fantasy stuff.The campaign lasts about 15 hours...provided that you can finish it because the game is affected by constant crashes which can make the experience sometimes very frustrating.imho it's not worth a full price,  if the crashes persist you even may not be able to finish the game so i suggest to wait for patches and for a price drop, because for 25€ it's almost a must buy for whom likes Souls games of action game in general.

												LOTF is the first of a new genre called Souls-like, and it's doing an okay job at it. There are some stupid mechanics that shouldn't be in a game that follows in the foodsteps of a legend like Dark Souls. There seems to be only one solution to whatever problem you might encounter, and it gets quite boring after a while. The best example I have is (spoilers!) the champion boss which does a charging attack where you have to either have a tower shield to cower behind or do a shield bash with a medium shield. This will result in you stunning the boss and you'll get a few hits in, then it's back to baiting out the charge attack. It gets old real quick.All in all, LOTF has plenty of good things going and if future games learn from this game, they'll do great. LOTF, however, did not do that great and I don't recommend it.			"

												Take a second and easily research just how many people have problems with this game crashing and you probably won't want to bother with it. Or at least you shouldn't, anyway, and are just foolishly wasting your money if you still do. Extreme slowdown during effects up close to the screen really sucks because a lot of times you are fighting in tight quarters. But the real killer is constant crashes while fighting bosses that completely buries a otherwise good game deep in the dirt. I looked up how to fix crashing after a crash during the first boss fight and thought I had fixed it. Around 16 hours in, it crashed during another boss fight. At 23 hours in it crashed again during the tough side boss Keeper fight so I am done with this♥♥♥♥♥♥ It takes too long to have to get to a boss again going through respawned enemies even if I am really powerful, and boss fights are way too long to have to sit and do over again and just pray it doesn't crash again. Boss fights are extremely long so that's why crashing during them is such a game killer. Crashing is the biggest no-no that games can commit.A 7.5 out of 10 game beaten flatter than a sheet of paper by crashes0/10 should be refundable to anyone who owns it regardless of time played.			"

												As someone who liked the idea of the Souls games, but not the execution, I've been enjoying this game. It has the weighty, punishing combat but manages to not feel cheap. You're punished for making mistakes, but rarely killed outright, giving you some time to learn enemies' patterns. There are usually checkpoints a short distance before boss fights, so you don't have to spend hours upon hours just fighting your way back to them only to be killed again in 3 seconds. Speaking of bosses, I was able to explore and find a boss that seemed way too hard for my current level - I could barely scratch him. Satisfyingly, with some persistence and a total change of strategy, I wore him down in an epic, edge of seat, half-hour long battle and won the day.My (fairly minor) gripes so far are a slight lack of enemy variety and that the spells seem a bit limited and shoehorned in.

												How do I describe this game?  It is a horribly made game.  I know several people have called it a ""hidden gem"" or ""dark souls lite"" but I would suggest you play dark souls instead.  Lets start off with a break down of pros and cons.Pros1.  Graphically better for the most part2.  Sound is better3.  It has voice acting and tries to flesh out its story more directly than a souls game.4.  Linear for the most part, save for a few areas it is hard to get lost.  You just keep going forward and you will eventually find your way through most roadblocks.Cons1.  Uninspired enviornments.  You will spend most of your time trudging through dark areas or fiery areas.  Do not expect vibrant areas with variety.  You are either in castles, caves, or some mixture of the two.2.  Very glitchy.  I have seen enemies scale invisible ladders and get stuck in the sky box only to be unattackable save for magic.  This might not have been a problem if I went full magic, but using the warrior archtype I had to use one or two spells then wait for magic to regenerate.3.  The magic feels underwhelming.  I did go melee but I had a decent amount of faith, my magic however depleted far faster than I feel it should have to be effective.  This may be due to an armor penalty but I noticed no difference in magic consumption between heavy and medium armors.4.  Magic/Skills feel uninspired in this game, like they were tacked on as an afterthought.  Some skills felt outright useless and others felt like they were completely overpowered.  As a warrior I could pop rage and just power through most boss fights in one or two uses.5.  Enemy AI is terrible.  Souls games aren't known for great AI, but they are HAL 9000 whem compared to LotF AI.  Boss attacks are far to easy to bait out with encounters and offer very little in the way of challenge.6.  When you get lost, you get lost hard.  While many areas you can just head forward, there are some places where you can find yourself walking around for hours trying to find out where to go simply because the game has a very poor progression funnel in certain areas (I am looking at you Annihilator).7.  Combat feels sluggish and can swing from boring to frustrating very quickly.  Once again I am viewing this from the warrior archtype, but two handed weapons have such a long wind up and awkward attack angles they feel like Harken is more of a flailing idiot than any skilled warrior.  Some enemies would stand there and take it while others would dance around or attack endlessly giving you little to no chance to recover or plan a counter attack.8.  The kick is useless.  It requires a huge amount of stamina and I have yet to see it be more efficient at breaking a turtling enemy than just spamming attack combos and smashing through them.9.  Exploding enemies.  Har har you have a booby trapped enemy that explodes on death.  Real cute and I could let that one slide, except these enemies are usually very powerful and there are far too many of them in the latter half of the game.  There is a specific mage type enemy that can deal horrendous ranged damage, put up a damage shield around him, drain your life, and has an annoyingly fast melee attack that will knock you down.  The blast radius of the explosion will result in you taking damage more often than not.10.  Main quests have a tracker and sub quests do not.  This is just annoying.  If you don't want a quest tracker fine, but don't go half way.  Either let us choose the quest to track or make us use a log.11.  Quest NPC's can just up sticks and leave.  This may be a glitch, but when I tried to turn in human skulls for a quest the quest giver just decided he had better things to do and went fishing or something, because he wasn't there when I arrived to turn in.12.  Rune upgrade system feels tacked on.  You can use runes to upgrade your equipment, but don't expect any major changes to your playstyle.  Some runes will provide enough of a benefit to give you notice, but most are borderline useless.13.  The game is just a slog.  Nearing the latter half of the game I just wanted it to be over.  Playing it felt more like a chore and less like entertainment.  The fighting was uninspired, there is very little enemy variety (plenty of reskins though).14.  The story is about a generic as you can get.  You can smell the plot twist coming from a mile away.  Some side elements have no effect on the story.  The ending is a carbon copy rip off of Fallout 3 where specific choices are recapped.15.  Damage scaling makes little to no sense.  I had a harder time fighting the lightly armored twin swordsman rogues than I did fighting mages or heavy knights.  My armor offered no defense against their all melee damage and they could begin an attack after my starting frame and stun me with a single hit before I was able to connect.  In the latter half of the game poise becomes a useless stat as any human enemy can stagger you with one strike.The game is exactly what it is trying to be, a cheaply made knock off of souls trying to cash in on its success.  They took out a lot of the components that made the Souls games fun and shoveled in AAA game concepts that just hobbled our outright broke the experience.  Stats and builds become more important than skill the further you get into the game.  With appropriate skill and planning I can do a SL1 4 kings run and become a darkwraith, but in this game I just don't see that being especially viable.  Doable?  Yes, but I doubt you would get any enjoyment out of it.  The armor looks nice but at the same time it appears ripped clean out of Warhammer without any editing (the trinket flags look suspiciously like the mark of Chaos).  If you want to experience this game just get a Souls game, you will save money and derive more enjoyment from it.  Souls is a better designed game, hands down, and while it may appear ""more difficult"" the difficulty feels less hamhanded.  LotF's difficulty doesn't feel rewarding, its just one slogfest after another.I haven't had buyer's remorse this bad since Brink			"

												Well, what I can say about this game, probably a relationship that begun with hate, and than after lots of struggle turns up into love.LOTF is a beautiful game, even in middle of sort of bugs and lacking of refinement, even so in the end, its a awesome game, specifically made for souls series fans.I really hope that CI games bring back with a 2nd one, improved with better refinement, better controls and more variety of play-style.Its definitely not a perfect game and stands far away from dark souls but surely it has its charm , and deserves a chance when steam sales prices come.Most of performance problems are solved, but still have framerate inconsistency at some parts and I didn't noticed none of  ""famous"" crashes and such, its perfect playable.I played all maxed in my machine i5/ HD7850 1gb / 8gb ram/win 7 So that its, I hope you enjoy this game as I did.

The bad Dark Souls copyGame is still buggy 2 years after release. Few times during boss fights the game would simply crash and the whole fight would reset. Number of different enemies is really low and the game is really short. After you discover new region you will find out that it is connected to the previous region with a door that was locked earlier. This can be confusing at times when you don't know where you need to go next. Basically the game has 2 regions. Interesting thing is that some minions deal more damage than the boss and can easily one shot you.Controls are cluncky and the character reacts slowly to them. Often I would use normal attack and then dodge, but character would just attack once and then stand in front of an enemy like a moron and then get hit in the face by a heavy attack. Archer arrows are also funny, they fire it at you and you dodge or roll. And the arrow follows you like a heat seeking missile.After you get used to the fact that it is much slower than the souls game, you can have some fun with it, but those moments are few and far inbetween.

												I'm a big souls fan so I thought i'd give this a go. The game was enjoyable for a playthrough but there really isn't much to do (secrets wise / off the beaten path etc) and it's reeeeally slow which i'm not a fan of. Feels like absoloutely no need to do new game plus (since literally nothing changes), so there's almost no replayability to the game. Also, all of the DLC's are complete trash money makers, even the labyrinth that they describe as 'vast' is about the size of a football pitch...(that's also the only content dlc available, the rest are stat boosters and items.....

												The game is perfectly fine. It's a Dark Souls clone, with a shoddy plot stuck on top and a much better graphics engine. However, it's currently unplayable for me, and has been that way since launch despite several patches; the game crashes to desktop frequently, which added to the game's difficulty resulted in me just leaving it aside until this is fixed. A quick look at customer and even some site reviews shows that I'm not even remotely alone in this. Stay away until this is confirmed fixed.			"

												I'm a big fan of the Souls series and I must say that this game does not disappoint in any way. The combat is very tight and rewarding where you feel that you getting better at playing is more important than your character getting better. I also like that there is no quasi-online mode. This game can be paused, and you don't have to be afraid that someone will invade you while you're afk and taking care of something. 6/6			"

												This is boring and stupid, or was i, boring and stupid when i decided to buy this?-I thought that this game wouldn't be so much like dark souls, i hate those japanized slowish movements (like when you      swing any weapon bigger than your forearm and stay like a moron in an ""anime stance"" waiting to get hit)-Leveling up and upgrade your gear appears to be useless.Items doesn't have descriptions of what they do and there is no radar or a simple map, prepare yourself to guess where the ♥♥♥♥ is that place named in the objectives, get lost and re-enter in a ""completed"" area, where you will encounter the same enemies again and again, and you'll have to lose your time to fight with them again. -Dull story and characters, there is no point in try to finish this, even though i tried.

												The game has so much potential and so much it could've done right, but did wrong. Not going to be a long review that way people looking to buy can skim through the mixed reviews. First off this game is fun, don't get me wrong, the main mechanics behind the game are good. The optimization is meh, the art style is good, and the gameplay is decent.Where the game really fails is it's enemy design and how to counter these enemies. The game doesn't give you a choice on how to do something. For example early on in the game there's a shield enemy that can one or two shot you easily, break through your shield, and is IMPOSSIBLE to get around, the only way to kill him is to blast him with magic, there's no other way. The game itself is good but the bosses and enemies are too generic, the game needs artifical difficulty, not diffuculty that's going to ram you in the♥♥♥♥♥ There's a difference between a game with good challange and a game with bad challange, this game tries to give you a challange, which it does, but goes about doing it incorrectly.

												The path for your redemption is drenched in the blood of your enemies. Lords of the fallen delivers smooth combat, diverse arsenal and supports many different playstyles. Visually, it is an eye candy (and a very tasty looking one, too). With different enviroments, enemies and side missions, it keeps things enteresting and immersive. The problem is that it constantly kept crashing on me in multiple locations and on vastly different settings (ranging from ulra high to low), which is strange considering I have a GTX 780, i7 processor @3.6Hz and 16gb of RAM. In the end, I do recommend this game but would advise to wait a bit for some patches and slight AI fixes.			"

I so wanted to get into Dark souls 2, but I just couldn't. This game takes a lot from Dark Souls and, imo, does it better. It's beautiful and can be brutally challenging at times. Unlike Dark Souls, the controls for mouse and keyboard work well. I tried both a controller and M+k and I personally prefer M+K better. The sounds are well done and help to create an immersive experience. All in all I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging and rewarding experience.			"

												I cant make on honest review of gmaeplay or story, however what I can review is the fact that I have not been able to play the game since release as it crashes imdetiately after launch. I have tried to be patient but it seems developers dropped the ball on this one and even if the game started to work or they released an update that fixed the issue I doubt it would improve my opinion on the game.

												Graphics are pretty good, but the combat.The combat is god awful.Harkyn, or whatever is that poor man name, is soooo slow.And the only attack which seems worth using at all, is the Heavy Sprint Jump Attack thingymajig,because it deals reasonable damage, but there's no fun in doing that all the time.Oh, and the hitboxes are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.So, the game is pretty meh, just a worse Dark Souls™ clone.

												The Souls series has nothing on this game. Took me about 5 hours to complete the first boss (although, I must say that the developers could have made it more visually pleasing than completely blue with a sad face). The next level is completely black, and without audio. I spent a few hours trying to run around in the Dark but eventually had to alt+f4 out. Hopefully there will be a big nerf coming soon, so us casuals can enjoy the game too.			"

												Very artifical difficulty.Majority of enemies have shields which block 99% of your damage, who constant have their shield up and won't give even a second of opening after an attack, requiring cheap tactics such as backstab fishing and constantly using the decoy.Some enemies will even instantly turn around and hit you for 80% of your hp while you attack them from behind. Seriously, there's no animation for them turning around, they just suddenly face you, instantly block your attack so you do 3 damage, and then stab you for 80% of your health.And by the way, this review is coming from someone who has played A LOT of the souls games, and other games known for difficulty.But this game, it takes the cake for most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and lame gameplay in my opinion.

												TL;DR - too many shields/10If you're like me, you played and enjoyed the souls games and are looking for something similar but with a new take. Keep looking this game is not for you.This game is not for anyone. It's not that it's too easy,  or nothing but a souls clone because it does add to the souls formula in good ways (I like the faith/magic system for example). The biggest, most glaring problem is the enemy design and boss design. The first boss is okay - not much too him but he's the first boss so w/e. The second boss is where you see the problem: f****ing shields. The entire fight is walking around him until he decides to do something because blocking negates 99.9% of all your damage. Who the hell thought this was a good boss design!? You wait. And then you deal about 1/15th his health, then wait some more. Then kill some adds, and repeat. It's embarrassingly bad. I killed him twice because the first time the damn game crashed on me during the cutscene and there's no autosave. I figured if this was the worst there was that's okay, I'll keep playing. OH BUT THEN. MORE. F***KING. SHIELDS. I do not feel like spending 5 minutes circling shield enemies waiting for a small opening to deal a small amount of damage to. This is BAD DESIGN.Don't buy it. Don't consider it. Move along.			"

												Whoever at Deck13 or CI Games thought that was an adequate difficulty for a first boss, after a pitiful tutorial and mere 5 minutes of proper gameplay, surely has some sort of a psychological disorder, autism or something else preventing them from experiencing the world from another human being's perspective.I see no evidence that they even playtested this with anyone who wasn't a game dev or a dark souls pro. There's challenging a player and there's punishing a new player who barely had time to get a grip on basic mechanics. In many games you wouldn't see such a boss until after at least an hour or two of gameplay, when the player had time to digest the basics and was able to concentrate on finer points of gameplay.This is a decent fighting game for masochists and/or experienced DS players (who AFAIK consider this not challenging). Everyone else should steer clear if you value your nerves or seek entertainment and not frustration in the games you play. This is just a cheap and artificial way of prolonging games.Too bad, could have been a decent experience. "

												Summary: ""And here I thought Dark Souls 2 was slow, but here we have the aptly nicknamed: Clunky Souls.""Definitely would recommend a controller; the lack of camera centering button could easily have been incorporated like with Dark Souls' lock-on style: press to lock-on if enemy is present or centre camera if there aren't. Moreover, movement would be easier as the enemies seem to have a huge attack hit-box that can swing at almost 360 degrees.I was drawn into this game due to the combat style where, like Dark Souls, it was a little more than mere button mashing to knock out your opponent (see Skyrim).  And coming from Vaatividya's video I saw it could be an enjoyable game. However, I found this game to be quite unplayable.One major flaw when I first played this game was that it eats up so much memory and froze often. Annoyance is an understatement as I had cleared the first boss and a bit of the area thereafter, but had to restart the game only to find all my progress had been lost. Subsequent attempts at beating the boss again reinforces the name: ""Clunky Souls"" where I found fighting the game mechanics more so than the actual enemies.But speaking of enemies, the ones with the greatshield are the worst, including the bosses. Their numerous attacks leave you with little stamina after dodging to get behind them and get even a single hit in. They hit hard, have ridiculous defence and are difficult to punish. Of course, baiting the right attack to land the backstab is possible, but it's very tedious just going round in circles.My lack of gameplay time has been due to frustration with the game's performance and unresponsive combat. While it's flattering for it to be compared to Dark Souls, in my opinion, it's just more of a comparison of how Dark Souls does it much better. I really wanted to like this game because I wanted the sophisticated combat, but unfortunately it fails to give me another Dark Souls experience.EDIT no. 3: my opinion on this game keeps changing. While it can be enjoyable to an extent of exploration and combat, the enemy designs are terrible. For one thing, once they hit you, it's nigh on impossible to avoid their follow-up combo, draining both health and stamina if you were blocking, already making counter-attacks unlikely. And the second is that so far there are only a few enemy types in the game. They are introduced gradually but from what I've seen there are only about six basic types whose health and damage spike without warning.			"

												Do NOT buy this game. I spent nearly 3 hours trying to fix this game just to get it to work.First, the game freezes at the numerous adverts before the title screen even appears. Something involving non-windowed mode and smaller resolutions can help with this.Second, if you can get around that, then the game goes to permanent black screen at the title screen and just plays music indefinitely. This is because there's no saved game available, so it won't continue.Third, if you did not alt+tab out of the game during the load up, the game will crash on loading the save file. In some cases, the opposite is true and that alt+tab will cause it to crash at title screen. It's pot luck.Fourth, if you've managed to get passed all of that (which I did not), the game will then crash at any opportunity it can. Boss fight? Crash. Cut scene? Crash. Turned around too fast? Crash. Did nothing but stood still waiting for a crash? Crash. All of this from countless horror stories online I stumbled across during my search for a fix.The real problem is that these bugs have apparently existed since at least 2014. The fact the developer has not fixed this at all is a major concern.Since it took so long to try to fix this game (and to no avail) I'm now outside of the refund time. I'm hoping that the support team will at least factor in the broken nature of the game, but I can't say yet. Don't make the same mistake I did.Edit: The support team refunded the game for me, so I at least have my money back now. Looks like it will go on Dark Souls II instead.			"

Or as a matter of fact, if you're a Dark Souls veteran, get 'Salt and Sanctuary' if you want a fresh and interesting approach to the Soulsian formula.			"

												If you've played Dark Souls you'll find the setting and some of the combat mechanics familiar and kind of enjoyable.

The easiest way I can describe  the issue is that the combat is not ""tight"". It's basically many little failures in the combat system that make it a huge pile of trash when combined. TERRIBLE enemy AI, with enemies who have absolutely random recovery times when they perform an attack, turtling enemies whose shields don't drop with one kick but need many, and their attacks are as quick as a dagger, unreliable dodge/sprint, and the tracking, MY GOD the tracking. Enemies don't pivot with the movement, but they spin on an axis. Combined with their ridiculous recovery times they're just not fun.Maybe a sword & shield works better, but the Rogue I played with daggers/fists was just frustrating.

												I really want to recommend this game, since I like the Dark Souls formula. But the more I play this particular game, the more I'm convinced nobody else can get it right. This game is difficult, but in all the wrong ways. The controls are awkward no matter what configuration you use, enemies will almost always break your attacks even if you wear the heaviest armor, and sometimes areas become impossible due to the sheer volume of damage you can experience from even one enemy by itself.Like I said, I wish more games would adopt the Dark Souls method of fighting, but that game punishes you based on whether or not you become skilled and able to utilize your abilities and equipment. This game is simply a grindfest where it's all about luck whether or not an enemy will go down in two hits or overhwelm you with an unlimited hit combo. I do not recommend this game.			"

												do not buy this game.At least if you dont want to rage because the game is everything but finished.Crashes in the middle of the game and the devs even dont know how to fix it.they react on the steam forum with have♥♥♥♥♥♥♥asnweres and most of the time they answer with ""o we dont know""the game crashes in middle of combat and it sends you back to the beginning of the lvl you have to fight all the enemies you have defeated again and you only have 2 potions wich u use before you get to the point where you died.then when the boss fight starts you either use your potions very fast and arent even able to get past the 1/10 of its health bar or you character decide that where ever you dodge/block or run its in the direction of the blow. o and dont forget when you almost defeat the boss the game decides to point a big old middle finger your way by crashing.this is a very expensive beta and the tech support is done by a bunch of amateurs who arent probly even part of the developers team.so dont buy itremember when games brought you joy and happiness ?well this games brings you rage and anger  for a nice price of  40 euro's			"

												It's hard to recommend this game in its current state.  It's an incredibly buggy and unoptimized game.  Until the developers make serious strides in fixing these issues, I'd say hold onto your money.  This is mainly a consequence of the game's qualities just barely overcoming its shortcomings.  When the technical difficulties are thrown into the mix, those qualities have just that much more to contend with.  First, this game is very much in the line of Souls games.  The similarities between the two are numerous: no map, tough enemies, nebulous story, a weight-based movement system, and a leveling/checkpoint system very similar to Dark Soul’s bonfire-based system.  The similarities don’t end there but this game’s status as a “Souls clone” has been well-established.With that said, the game does many things well.  The art direction, while it has proven to be somewhat divisive, is quite good.  While some armor has been recycled, the sets look good and fit the world they inhabit.  The animations are fluid.  Hitboxes are generally well done.  Enemies are far more likely to hit you on the back end of their swings than in any of the Souls game.  Whereas in Dark Souls, many encounters could be beaten by simply rolling into enemies, the same cannot be said for Lords of the Fallen.  One must think about his rolls and the direction they will take.  The weight system is practically a copy-pasted system from Dark Souls—a system I’m much more partial to than the system in Dark Souls 2.  On the whole, the game is generally enjoyable to play.  Unfortunately, there are various issues that make it difficult to appreciate the game’s qualities.  Technically, the game is prone to crashes, the framerate is atrocious, and bugs run rampant.  I won’t spend time much time on the technical issues, though.  As for the game, frankly it’s too easy.  Most bosses are easily beaten on the first attempt.  Enemies aren’t too varied which affords the player enough experience within the first handful of hours to breeze through the rest of the game.  The developers try to curb this ease by throwing in, seemingly random, enemies that, while looking like typical enemies, have more health and do a great deal of damage.  Entire sections of the game, especially toward the end, feature enemies that do more damage than any boss in the game does while having a substantial amount of health.  This is fairly frustrating and inconsistent with the world the game is building.  Other issues include the targeting system, which is barely functional.  The magic system is poorly implemented.  Some spells are either poorly designed (Mimic which obscures your character and the enemy), only function a handful of times (Stab, which misses seemingly a third of the time), or are simply not useful (Prayer).  All of these spells also cost a great deal of mana.  My faith build (essentially a magic build) could get off maybe 2-3 spells before going OOM.  Add in the ridiculous cooldown that all spells have and one can hardly be faulted in wondering why magic exists at all.  I’m going to stop here.  The bottom line: the cons outweigh the pros in this offering.  Perhaps a few patches from now and a Steam sale later this game might be worth picking up.   "

												Bloody thieves and criminals I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!! This game is an abomination! The fact that that this game was released in this state should be a criminal offense! No matter what I do, the game crashes randomly, no matter what settings I use and no matter what drivers I use. I can't even play for 5 minutes without a crash. And what is worse is that the gameplay is actually very good and it makes you wanna play it. But you can't because this game was created for the sole purpose to steal your money and make you feel miserable. It is a fight you cannot win. This fight is not against the monsters of this game, it is against the game itself... Can't believe I paid full price for a pre-alpha!STAY AWAY FROM THIS UNLESS YOU ENJOY THE FEELING OF GETTING MUGGED AND BEING RIPPED OFF!!			"

												I've throughly enjoyed the game thus far. Controls on Xbox One controller are smooth and responsive and when configured to the ""Alternative"" controle scheme it matches similarily with Dark Souls II. Graphics are nice, but lighting can be overbearing sometimes namely ""glare"" from the sun. Bosses are fun and a challenge. The biggest downside to this game is the crashing that returns you to your desktop. The developers have already released a patch 1.1 and 1.2 to address these issues. The patches have helped but the crashes occasionaly still occur. I would 100% reccommend this game once all the crashes have been fixed.			"

												What a horrible experience. The game crashes on startup for many people, while others experience sound and a black screen. The lucky ones with a lot of RAM get to go 15 minutes before it crashes, or perhaps just as it's loading new resources for a boss fight. It's been 4 months of these reports with no ETA from the developer.Since steam requires 5 minutes of play before writing a review, I had to load the game and let it crash on startup over and over. Consider the vehemence required to bring you this downvote.			"

It will crash on you. It will crash on you so often you will wonder how the hell this got through quality control. The only answer is that instead of letting the bugs get fixed it was rushed out the door.Shame really, you can see where there was a lot of love and skill put into the game but until its stability is addressed I say stay away.

												I waited for this game's releases, anxiouly seeking out any related material which would give us a sense of what it is or if it was good, etc. After release, I was frustrated. The game cannot even start, running on an up-to-date PC. The atrocious patch work from the developers is disgusting, with less than ten over a span of almost a year, with many players still unable to play or even progress past certain points and no future for it is in sight. The developers do not care however, and have stated that a sequal is in the works, even producing DLC for this disgusting cash grab.			"

												Now that my perfomance issue have been patched oput i can finally recommend this game.It's a nice twist on the popular Souls sub-genre that's all the craze right now and is it punishing but fair.Unlike Dark Souls 2, LoTF features a much more responsive combat that expand on the Dark Souls foundation and combined with an impressive moveset of hand-crafted weapon (which there are a lot) and a variety of weapons creates lots of tension and fun to the swordplay.The game is beautiful and detailed, you can see that it's mainly a PC release, loading times are short and particle effects are damn impressive.It is not awfully long, but if you want to do sidequests and clear out the treasures it can easily stretch a lot, not to mention all the fun challenges and New Game+ modes.There's also seems to be a number of endings and the amount of secret sutff is refreshing. Weapons are damn sweet, and i must point out my favourite ""Stain"", you'll see why it's called like that after you equip it!All and all it's a fun and beautiful game, i recommend it, maybe even buy it off-sale if you think it's up your alley.The perfomance patches and new drivers fixed most of the problems people experienced, so it should be safe to play.

Posted: February 11, 2016
												I am not quite sure what this game is trying to be. It is kind of like Dark Souls, but not really, which is not exactly a bad thing. It is not like Dragon Age at all which is a bit of a dissapointment. And it is not like Kingdoms of Amalur either, even though I have heard it compariered to all three. However, this is one of the most boring, monotonus, and overrated games I have seen in years. And here are three reasons as to why.1 The Basics: gameplay, graphics, mechanics ect.For starters, it is a hack and slash job, meaning that the gameplay is going to be a johnny one note eventually once you hit a stride. This is not always that bad, Dragon Age could be argued as a hack and slash but it is so good that it over comes that querk. What lets this down for me on that end is the way you fight. Once you figure it out, combat is down to this formula, block, stab, dodge, counter attack, rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat, rinse and Zzzz, Zzzz. There is not other truely effective tactic regardless of class used, not that the classes are all that different mind you. It will not matter which you choose, I will get into this later but it is quite bland. To make things worse, you cannot choose what your character will look like so you are stuck with one ugly SOB with a shaved head, bad beard, and stupid tattoos all over his face. Give up any asperations of running for government office. Not that you ever see it that much, the camera control is pretty much locked up to you rear end both in and out of combat, the only time you can ever see what you look like is in conversation, which is only marginaly better than the one found in Kingdoms of Amalur. Not that this matters either because the graphics are a big let down for a title of this price and rating, and this only came out a little over a year back.2 There is no F***ing castor class!!!!!!!!In Dragon Age, I prefer mage, Mass Effect, Sheperd is a Sentinel, and I go full Battlemage in Kingdoms. Three guesses which class I like, hint it sure as little green apples ain't here. The class system here is a little confusing, you begin by choosing three ""magics"" that have nothing to do with magic in any respect with the exaption of prayer, maybe. Next you choose which of three weapon and armor types that leave you in the same place, heavy armor, big weapons, and no finesse. In total, there are nine classes that can be chosen, first time I went out I came up with Ranger,the second, Paladin, third, Brawler. All three felt exactly the same, no kidding, the exact same gameplay, I gave up on each just a few minutes in due to sheer bordom. If you are like me, avoid at all costs.3 This kind of thing has been done to death, ressurcted, and done to death again.Big picture, massive evil army of death dealing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s out to kill everything in sight. Dark Spawn, Reapers, Uruk, Dreadic, Thalmor, whatever, they are the smae thing now they are called the Rhogar. Top points for sounding like the noise I make when I have bronchitis. Long story short, the market for this kind of this is saturated to a point where it is raining bits of archdemon in my house. You would think something like this would work to seperate itself from the pack with something, but if you look at it closely, Lords is a Frankenstine's Monster. Bits of gameplay and stories have just been cherrypicked around from other games. It is official, the guys here have less imagination than the guys who draw the bodywork for Porsche.Final words: I am dissaponted, this game received alot of praise when it first came out and I was hopping for a hit I could rack up a couple of hindred hours on and stand around with baited breath for the sequel. Nope, I will not be playing this to 200 hours and I am not waiting for the sequel, if there ever will be one. This game had somuch potential and failed to deliver on every level. Thank you Steam Refund.			"

												At the time of this review, I've logged 29 hours into this game, so I clearly find something redeeming about it, but it's hard to recommend.  I've reached near the end of the game with 2 different builds, and am stuck because the game is too hard and throws too many enemies at you at once.  Also, in case you're thinking ""mad cuz bad"", I've logged 1700 hours in Dark Souls and ~500 hours in Dark Souls 2, and never thought that about those games.The game is poorly designed in so many respects.  Voice acting, storytelling, story-arcs, level design, enemy design and variety, all sub-par, lots of bugs.  Some of those things are laughably bad.I have a weird relationship with this game, and may continue playing it, but is it something I could easily recommend to someone?  NOT AT ALL.

												Ok let's get out of our system that this game is HARD.Hard much like his inspirer, Dark Souls and Demon Souls, but a bit less that those at the same time.But the graphics are something so amazing that many of your deaths will come from distraction from looking at the details of scenery, enemies and items in the game world.This game is also heavy on resources that it requires to run, i've seen many threads of people unable to play it due to crashes and errors, luckily this never happened to me (yet) and im having a blast during my sessions.I feel a bit ""meh"" about the weapons and armors, either i was very lucky in the beginning finding a very good weapon or there's something wrong with equipment progression, nonetheless all the weapons feel great to use and have pros and cons based on the type, even tho i feel the enemies are always a bit OP even when changing equipment.Combat is very strategic, every hit and every miss counts, expecially the one you take from enemies, you have to be very careful in avoiding hits and striking your own as to not end up dead and with no potions.Overall the game is fun and good enough to keep you busy for a few hours (i've heard it's about 15h long, which for this kind of games is a bit short but it is still fun) if you like a challenge then it's a decent game with awesome atmosphere, it's like Dark Souls invaded Darksiders.

												Hard to rate this game in a world in which Dark Souls exists. I'd say it's not a bad game, but if you've played DS and loved it, this will simply not do. At all. If you just wanna have some fun or get an easy initiation into ""souls"" games, you can get this one instead and see if it's anything you like at all. Maybe wait for a discount. So, my review will be heavily flavored by Dark Souls references. Bear that in mind. This game wants to emulate this certain type of game play, so it must also be judged against it. Why a ""no recommend"" then? Too many bugs. Quest NPCs stopped working suddenly for example. Or simply disappeared completely...or never showed up. So annoying.Step by stepStory:Meh. Forgettable. Uninspiring. Despite having voice acting and cutscenes and audio logs, it's just not gripping. The characters are extremely shallow, the dialogue boring. In DS you don't have any of the polish here, no one really tells you about the lore, you have to find out most of it for yourself. And yet, the world is way more interesting somehow.Graphics:Pretty decent, especially nice lighting effects. Armore looks badass. YOU look and move like a badass. Animation quality is good. This is probably the biggest plus vs. DS. It doesn't look dated.Sound:Same thing. Sound is heavy and good. Voice acting is ok.Combat:You can choose between 3 classes to start with (Warrior, Cleric or Rogue) and choose 1 school of ""magic"" in your first playthrough. Magic is rather bland. Each school has 4 spells, which you gradually unlock via leveling up (i.e. killing stuff...over and over). Casting them, however, takes quite a while. For example, my Warrior was a ""Brawler"". He has 1 spell that amplifies his damage. This sounds particularly interesting in boss fights. The problem is that it's very risky to even cast the spell, unless the boss is currently incapacitated or whatever. And then you may miss your opening to actually DO damage, and when the next opportunity arises your ""buff"" has already worn off again. Meh.Regular combat is ""fine, it's weighty, it's heavy or it's stabby stabby. There are you usual weapon types in the game, from swords, axes, maces and daggers to staves, great swords, great axes, great hammers and poleswords. Unlike in DS you will rarely find any non-special weapons, most are named. You will require either strength, faith or agility to wield them. Starting out as a rogue when you're a newbie is also perhaps not recommended. Warriors rely on strength and big weapons and shields. However, I found that most ""big"" weapons either need to be wielded in 2 hands (the game even tells you so) or are way too slow to begin with. In DS you didn't wield Ultra Greatswords until late in the game, here it is actually possibly, but just not feasible. The first of these weapons I got and actually liked was almost at the end of the game. Unlike in DS these big weapons often don't stagger an enemy as easily. Especially since SO many enemies wield shields and can pretty much block all your attacks. Most slower 1 handed weapons also have the nasty habit of taking too long to recover after a swing. I often found myself hitting a boss or enemy once after an opening, but not being able to block or roll away from the return strike.I've never tested staves, but daggers are really fun. You can dual wield them and then alternatively attack with left and right for massive damage and staggering effects even (which is funny that my cheap daggers go through an enemy's poise with ease while a greataxe has almost no effect. The real issue are shields though. The game differentiates between 3 classes of shields: Tower, Kite and Buckler. Tower Shields are massive and heavy and you can hide behind them to avoid damage...niche feature. However, they seem to be the only shields that can't easily be staggered. Kite Shields are smaller, but can also block 100% of the damage in theory. You also have a shield bash to try and stagger enemies. Meh. Best use I found is just run at an enemy, raise your shield and then knock him on the ground...Usually works on most enemies. Bucklers on the other hand are the only shield that can be used to actually ""parry"" enemies. Parrying seems to work pretty well on some enemies and not at all on others. After a parry you can counter strike for massive damage...You can also backstab enemies.Combat roll is also the same as in DS...fast, mid or heavy roll depending on your equipment burden. You never wanna be ""fat rolling"" though. Rolling is the best way to avoid damage, since it makes you temporarily invincible if you time it right.World:The world in this game is really small. It took me about 15 hours to get through, but I did lots of research as well, guess you can easily get through in half of the time, if you never back track and don't care about side quests or what have you. I'd say the ""citadel"" you play in is perhaps as big as the entire Undead Burg (without the catacombs) of Dark Souls, just a lot more rooms, since almost everything takes place inside. Very disappointing.Enemies:Not all that many, to be honest. You have some kind of wildly slashing tombie, a standard shield bearer, a big 2 handed guy and a sort of rogue with a buckler. Then these get upgraded later on. Later on there are a few more enemies like a mage, a ghost, and a few beasts. Maybe a dozen really different enemies. None of them are particularly flashy though. In Dark Souls every enemy had ""soul"", character. These here are just meh. They also have the annoying habit of continually trying to shield bash you, which leaves you open to a ton of damage.Consumables:Healing potions that get more and better later on, resistance potions and energy regen potions. That's pretty much it.Crafting:Non-existant. You get access to a crafter about halfway through the game, but all you can do is slot runes into armor and weapons...Stats:Only 3 main stats (strength, faith and agility) of which you only ever need to raise your main weapon stat and perhaps faith if you want to cast a bit, but it's definitely not necessary. Other than that only Vitality, Energy (for attacks etc) and luck, a stat you won't be levelling at all in your first playthrough (if you can stomach playing NG+ or NG++ after you beat the game).Bosses:Perhaps the most disappinting aspect of the game. The bosses just lack soul. They have great names such as ""Warrior"", ""Commander"", ""Worshipper"", ""Annihilator"", ""Champion"", etc. Almost all of the bosses are larger than life humanoids, but they are just interchangeable and boring and usually not challenging either. Some have small gimmicks you need to pay attention to, but most are just lackluster.Other stuff, the good and the bad:- Side quests are terribly, since they apparently bug out somethimes, and you have no way of keeping track of them- Some areas get cleared out due to story reasons, which is neat. Adds some persistence to the game world- Boss fights do NOT require you to run through the level again for 1 minute, the save portals are usually right in front of them.- Inventory is a bit of a mess, however, you can equip a whole set with 1 button press if you own all pieces of the gear.- Gear is uninspiring. Some have resistances, however, you can't really tell, how much better ""1"" resistance vs. ""0"" resistance is...- You can ""bank"" experience to level up later, meaning it's not all lost if you die, but if you do die, you only have a certain amoount of time until your lost xp starts to decay and eventually vanishes. On the other hand there are items that will let you immediately recover them.- No special items that in any way change the game- A weapon simply disappeared and was never seen again after a relog...- Only ranged weapon requires mana1 story DLC, but it's bad, just has you running around in circles and the boss is a total ♥♥♥♥♥.

												I tried this game hoping for a Dark souls style gameplay and a challenge. I would say just like dark souls, it has its challenge and fast paced gameplay, that with knowledge can become easy. I personally liked this game, until i started to notice the ground shake and the constant camera shake. This is where i ended up quiting. I at first didn't think the camera shake could ruin the game for me, but it really hurt my eyes to play for more than an hour at a time. I looked for fixes, patches, and in game settings, but failed to find a fix. As a result i have to give the game a do not play, until it has been fixed.			"

												Its a boring version of dark souls just get dark souls and save your money. It takes an hour to swing the weopons in the game. The mobs are buggy as hell you can behind them when they swing and they will still hit you and block your attacks. Its not hard at all just just bad game mechanics. Dark souls is hard this is not a bug fest. Everything has a shield in it. The combat is slow and sluggish its just unbearable to play. Picking rogue will fix that issue but you will die in one hit and do about 2-3 damage so it will take 3 weeks to take out a boss. As i mentioned just stick with Dark Souls series they are harder and much better to play. This is basiclly tesco value dark souls.			"

												At the time of this review, I've logged 29 hours into this game, so I clearly find something redeeming about it, but it's hard to recommend.  I've reached near the end of the game with 2 different builds, and am stuck because the game is too hard and throws too many enemies at you at once.  Also, in case you're thinking ""mad cuz bad"", I've logged 1700 hours in Dark Souls and ~500 hours in Dark Souls 2, and never thought that about those games.The game is poorly designed in so many respects.  Voice acting, storytelling, story-arcs, level design, enemy design and variety, all sub-par, lots of bugs.  Some of those things are laughably bad.I have a weird relationship with this game, and may continue playing it, but is it something I could easily recommend to someone?  NOT AT ALL.  I would have to explain so much to that person about what they were about to subject themselves to first.			"

Posted: November 20, 2016
												Hard to rate this game in a world in which Dark Souls exists. I'd say it's not a bad game, but if you've played DS and loved it, this will simply not do. At all. If you just wanna have some fun or get an easy initiation into ""souls"" games, you can get this one instead and see if it's anything you like at all. Maybe wait for a discount. So, my review will be heavily flavored by Dark Souls references. Bear that in mind. This game wants to emulate this certain type of game play, so it must also be judged against it. Why a ""no recommend"" then? Too many bugs. Quest NPCs stopped working suddenly for example. Or simply disappeared completely...or never showed up. So annoying.Step by stepStory:Meh. Forgettable. Uninspiring. Despite having voice acting and cutscenes and audio logs, it's just not gripping. The characters are extremely shallow, the dialogue boring. In DS you don't have any of the polish here, no one really tells you about the lore, you have to find out most of it for yourself. And yet, the world is way more interesting somehow.Graphics:Pretty decent, especially nice lighting effects. Armore looks badass. YOU look and move like a badass. Animation quality is good. This is probably the biggest plus vs. DS. It doesn't look dated.Sound:Same thing. Sound is heavy and good. Voice acting is ok.Combat:You can choose between 3 classes to start with (Warrior, Cleric or Rogue) and choose 1 school of ""magic"" in your first playthrough. Magic is rather bland. Each school has 4 spells, which you gradually unlock via leveling up (i.e. killing stuff...over and over). Casting them, however, takes quite a while. For example, my Warrior was a ""Brawler"". He has 1 spell that amplifies his damage. This sounds particularly interesting in boss fights. The problem is that it's very risky to even cast the spell, unless the boss is currently incapacitated or whatever. And then you may miss your opening to actually DO damage, and when the next opportunity arises your ""buff"" has already worn off again. Meh.Regular combat is ""fine, it's weighty, it's heavy or it's stabby stabby. There are you usual weapon types in the game, from swords, axes, maces and daggers to staves, great swords, great axes, great hammers and poleswords. Unlike in DS you will rarely find any non-special weapons, most are named. You will require either strength, faith or agility to wield them. Starting out as a rogue when you're a newbie is also perhaps not recommended. Warriors rely on strength and big weapons and shields.

												Ok let's get out of our system that this game is HARD.Hard much like his inspirer, Dark Souls and Demon Souls, but a bit less that those at the same time.But the graphics are something so amazing that many of your deaths will come from distraction from looking at the details of scenery, enemies and items in the game world.This game is also heavy on resources that it requires to run, i've seen many threads of people unable to play it due to crashes and errors, luckily this never happened to me (yet) and im having a blast during my sessions.I feel a bit ""meh"" about the weapons and armors, either i was very lucky in the beginning finding a very good weapon or there's something wrong with equipment progression, nonetheless all the weapons feel great to use and have pros and cons based on the type, even tho i feel the enemies are always a bit OP even when changing equipment.Combat is very strategic, every hit and every miss counts, expecially the one you take from enemies, you have to be very careful in avoiding hits and striking your own as to not end up dead and with no potions.Overall the game is fun and good enough to keep you busy for a few hours (i've heard it's about 15h long, which for this kind of games is a bit short but it is still fun) if you like a challenge then it's a decent game with awesome atmosphere, it's like Dark Souls invaded Darksiders.

There are still performance issues; I doubt they will ever be fixed given the nature of the dev response to on the community hub.There is also the pervasive issue of the presence of Denuvo. While no solid evidence have been presented regarding the assertion it had negative effect on hardware (damaging SSDs) and/or reducing the games performance, it is still a unecessary bloatware and affects only legitimate paying costumers.I bought this on release and was only able to actually play it now; thus the release price was not justified.Best buy it on sale.

												I bought this game thinking it was like the soul series. And in a way it is. But at the same time this game is so poorly balanced that its become impossible to enjoy. Im only several hours into the game and standard enemies can take up to 5-10 minutes to kill, and thats only if im hiding behind a shield and spamming spells while waiting for my magic meter to slowly refill. The enemies are INCREDIBLY powerful. I get that this is supposed to be difficuilt. I played through every soul game with no problem and really enjoyed it. I cant even play this game because of how strong the enemies are. One example is fairly early on, after the second boss there is one enemy RIGHT next to a checkpoint/health crystal thing. You cant kill him. He does over a third of your hp with one attack, which he spams in a 3 hit combo. One attack from him completely drains your energy if your behind a shield. He has an attack where he knocks your shield away and then immedietly attacks for over 3/4 of your hp. No way to dodge it its incredibly fast. And dont even think about hurting him.  Literally whenever hes not doing insane amounts of damage, hes hiding behind his shield. If you attack him here you do ONE point of damage and your weapon bounces off. Doesnt matter if its a light attack, heavy attack, one handed or two handed. Always one point. Always bounce off. And you cant get around him because the ♥♥♥♥er spins like hes in a roller disco. I thought this game was going to be good. And it would be with some more balance. But holy ♥♥♥♥ the enemies do way too much damage and take hardly any damage in return. Your also slow as ♥♥♥♥ing hell. Any weapon that isnt the monk staff has the slowest ♥♥♥♥ing attack animation in the history of video games.			"

												Not bad for a Soul's-like. Of course people will compare to it as it is its main inspiration, Though i think the title is a little weaker in many points, starting with the level design and the sense of freedom and exploration. In fact, most of the game (at least what i've seen so far) resolve around corridors that leads to enemies that open doors to another corridors bound together by cutscenes and so it can feels slightly brainless.Also, the lore and story aren't a big suprise even if quite decent, but it might sounds dull if you grew bored of that sort of, like, regular heroic fantasy with muscles and big boobs. Characters are a bit cliché when not completly blank...Yet it's not a bad game. Combats are fun and the game does a pretty good job at giving you reason to just go through the corridors. At least if you're a bit curious.So yeah, i'd recommand it. Not at full price though. I think the game would be better at around 35$ or something.			"

												The game is really fun, what little I can play of it.  The combat is crisp and the customization is a blast.The one, and MAJOR problem is that it absolutely crushes a system.  I had a pretty decent rig that can play most anything and I'm willing to turn down some features here and there to make the game go....but this is almost unplayable.  I will have good 5 to 7 second hang ups every time I have more than one or two items moving on screen.  This means that in an action game where timing and mobility is key, I end up dying or missing animations because the screen locks up.Good game, but can't recommend it unless you have an absolute MONSTER of a machine, and even then, it may not work properly. This game needs optimized for the PC and I hope the developers are taking this into consideration.			"

												To expensive for what you get at full price. A ""maybe"" if you like this type of game and get it on a sale. Feels worn and a bit (well, a lot)  like ""been there, done that"". Pretty simplistic, gameplay, focused on combat options mostly.Overall, combat feel is sluggish, and as with many games of this genre it becomes clear that none of the designers ever wore ""real"" armour or used a ""real"" sword. Combat is just a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of what some 90s game designer imagined medieval/fantasy combat to be like.Most (not all) mobs are to easy, most bosses take to long to take down. Games like that were crap 10 years ago, and they still are.Lost interest some way in.			"

												One of the most awful rpg in the history. Very poor mechanichs and bad gameplay.I love rpgs and advenure games and have play ALOT of them and the two elements which make the genre good is 1.Combat 2. Story. Lord of  the fallen fails at both and the combat is the one which is the most dreadful.			"

												Keep in mind i've only played 1.6 hours of gameplay, and while I can run it, I can barely(like 60-30fps on medium) . I'm not going to comment much on graphics because of that^This game... I'm really not sure what to think about it. It's ALOT like dark souls... a bit too much like dark souls. This game feels like they took the souls games, made them 50 percent easier added stylish combos and pretty graphics(yes they are very well done and look great even on lower settings), and called it Lords Of The Fallen. This game is buggy as hell atm aswell. I rate this 4/10. I'd reccomend you just buy the souls games honestly, 50$ for a near dark souls clone is ridiclous honestly.			"

												To expensive for what you get at full price. A ""maybe"" if you like this type of game and get it on a sale. Feels worn and a bit (well, a lot)  like ""been there, done that"". Pretty simplistic, gameplay, focused on combat options mostly.Overall, combat feel is sluggish, and as with many games of this genre it becomes clear that none of the designers ever wore ""real"" armour or used a ""real"" sword. Combat is just a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of what some 90s game designer imagined medieval/fantasy combat to be like.Most (not all) mobs are to easy, most bosses take to long to take down. Games like that were crap 10 years ago, and they still are.Lost interest some way in.			"

												ConsWill crash at random which is my main reason for not recomending to buyThis game performs very uneven you can run around an area experiencing 60 fps and when you turn the camera it can suddely drop to 20-30 fps and this happens often.Though this can and probably have been argued this game can be unfair I think. Monsters will be placed on certain spots making it impossible to avoid the first time you walk around that corner or something like that. and some of the monsters and even bosses hitboxes are too big so you get hit when ""you clearely see that´s impossible"" but as I said this can be argued.Gear and loot is not explained very well or clearely so you might end up having to go online looking for info. I  can see this as a  pro and a con depending on what type of gamer you are. Some of Dark Souls alure was that you where left to understand and take it on and learn through trail and error. It feels like Lord of the fallen tries to mimic that a bit with mixxed results.Sound glitchesDark Souls / Demon Souls must have been an inspiration for the developers I can see many aspects of wich it mimics but with less punishing gameplay. At the same time this games difficulty is somewhat random. Most of the mobs in the starting area don´t do too much damage but later in the earlier levels you come across some spitting spider thingies that will do an insane amount of damage only to leave a taste that this balance is looked over and unbalanced. Maybe the developers thought of it as a way of making the game feel difficult and to offset you, this can be argued.Lord Of The Fallen as a whole feels like a powertrip with a big stick swinging at you some times. The games balance seem overlooked or is passed on as a way of making it feel more random and as such more difficult, I would argue that this is a hit or miss, good game design or bad game design.Even though Lord of the fallen have many great strong points those are outweighed by the cons, the constant crashing and the random performance cuppled with what I think is really uneven balance.ProsBrilliantSort of my dream gameSomeone made the game I want to playAwesome character looks and feelLootLots of secret ways to unlock sections and more lootCan look amazingly awesomeBreakablesBoss battles but they are hit or miss fun wiseExtra layer of gameplay if you kill the boss in a certain way you get an upgraded version of the weapon it drops.

Lords of the Fallen(patch 1.6) ReviewCTRL+FSpoiler filter, being informative&giving constructive critisismI am going to use spoiler filter to filter out both Story elements&gameplay mechanics but not all Gameplay mechanics - just advanced-mechanics.My review is ment to be informative about LOTF, give constructive criticism to to the devs. and not to ruin the experience, gameplay&story to the player.StartLords of the Fallen is an Action-RPG very similiar to Demon Souls - with more focus on story.StoryThe Story starts of with a battle between an unknown man with tattoos on his face & a giant monster. After the battle - the unknown man, with the tattoos, guides an elderly priest to Keystone('not sure if this is a flashback or...)Story - some actions One of my biggest complaints I have with LOTF is that it's not clear whether you are doing something good or bad with some actions. For example: I saw what looked like a bonfire - I lit it, got some XP, fought some monsters and I thought to myself ''Cool, I got XP. I did well :)''. Later on, soldiers in the Castle says ''Curse the moment we saw that beacon'' I'm like ''What? what are you guys talking about? oh well, it's probabley some random dialogue-nonsense''After I beat the game, I decided to look up info. for a different outcome. A piece of info. that took me by suprise was something that read ''don't light the beacon'' after reading that and seeing a picture of it - everything clicked & I was all like ''What? How was I suppose to know that?GameplayGameplay is very much like Dark Souls but a bit improved, especially a better roll-mechanic.Blocking attacks with your shield in LOTF is at times pointless. As a Melee-class - I found myself relying on wearing light armour, using a buckler that repels attacks and rolling.Some enemies(Tyrant) can penetrate through your shield which makes blocking sometimes pointless... Why can't rolling & blocking be equally as good?Speaking of Blocking in order to break down cracked walls, you have to shield charge at them. Why not just attack the cracked wall with your melee weapon?Gameplay - Dual-wield; no projectile-weapons? When it comes to Dual-wielding, You can only dual-wield weapons that are crossed on their portrait.The games' in-game tutorial tells me anything I can do the enemies can do too. If that's so,  why can't I use projectile-weapons as well?Gameplay - magic-system The magic-system in LOTF is good, with some flaws. No matter what magic-tree you choose - they feel the same. Any class can use the ''gauntlet''. You can choose one more magic-tree, but only after you beat the game... Why can't you choose another magic-tree while you play?Gameplay - XP-systemEverytime you kill an enemy, you will recieve an XP-multiplier&you can bank your XP. Why didn't the soul-games think of this?Gameplay - upgrades By the way, about upgrades, there is only one smith. You can upgrade your weapons, gauntlet&armour. I was kind of hoping that the smith could craft legendaries. Why can't you make legendary weapons out of the boss's... er... XP...? Instead, if you want ''something special'', out of the boss's weapon drops, you have to defeat the boss in a ''special manner''(there is a list online)GraphicsI love the games' art-style - it's a real eye-candy. For me, LOTF art-style is more apealing to me than the Soul-series.MusicThe games' music is ok. The music blends itself with the background. I barely noticed the music was there about 75% of the time, except when it came to bosses. Personally, the music isn't that memerable for Me.Pros and ConsPros:a very appealing art-style. I love the ''Dark-Fantasy'' atmosphere.simple combat; improved rolling-mechanic and XP multiplier.good story.Cons:there is no indication of how to get your desired ending. There is no indication if your actions, are good or bad. Just like the beacon part  you shield charge at a cracked wall to get to hidden areas. Why not attack the cracked wall? Blocking&rolling isn't equally as goodConclusion Before I get to the ''Conclusions'', let me make one thing clear: all the complaints, that I've pointed out through out the review, does not reflex how much fun I've had with the game. I had fun playing LOTF and I like the story of LOTF.Though I will admit, I too encountered annoying bugs/crashes. I think LOTF should've been released during Xmas 2014 or summer 2015.In conclusion, Lords of the Fallen feels like a prologue, a great warm-up start of an upcoming sequel. Can I recommend Lords of the Fallen? Yes. I can recommend LOTF to both parties: those that have or haven't played Dark souls.Deck13 & CI Games, thank you for develping Lords of the Fallen. Complaints aside, I enjoyed playing through the game. I can't wait for the sequel.What I'd like to see in the sequelprojectile weapons.dual-wield any weapon you want - even 2h-weapons.skill-tree -system.more NG+bigger story.blocking&rolling should equally as good.Normal-attacks  will unveil hidden areas.better magic-tree.memorable soundtrack.a better smith. I'd like to see a smith that can craft legendaries.			"

												I'm going to be comparing this game to Dark Souls since it is VERY similar to Dark Souls except not as good.  It's so similar that the controls are virtually identical when using the ""alternate"" control scheme.  Even the special moves have the same controls, ie parry/riposte, jump attack, backstab, rolling attack.The world is a decent size but pretty small compared to Dark Souls, and it all kinda looks the same.  Maybe equivalent to about 3 areas in Dark Souls.  The game does encourage you to go back to old areas to find new items and open doors that were previously locked, but when you go back most of the enemies are trivially easy to defeat so it's not that great.  The combat is pretty similar to Dark Souls too.  You can use shield+weapon, or dual hand weapons for more powerful/faster attacks.  I found the strength based weapons painfully slow to use, but the agility based weapons behaved a lot more like Dark Souls.  It also has the Dark Souls system of fatroll vs fastroll depending on what % of your carrying weight you are using.  The enemies have a decent variety although nowhere near what you'll find in Dark Souls simply because it's a much smaller world.  The animations and hitboxes are a bit off sometimes though.  You get used to it but it's nowhere near as ""crisp"" as Dark Souls.The game also has a system of weapon/armor upgrades where you place runes into slots, but a lot of weapons don't even have any slots for runes, and even the ones that do usualy only have one slot.  Because of this most of the runes don't actually make a huge difference.  Sort of like upgrading a weapon to +5 or something in Dark Souls, instead of being able to go to +10 or +15.  You can also add things like poison/fire/magic to your weapon but because most weapons only have one slot you are sacrificing physical damage to use those runes.The story in the game is pretty generic and boring.  That's not the reason I bought this game, but even so this is one of the areas where if differs from Dark Souls the most.  Dark Souls has a very subtle/mysterious story and lore that you could totally miss if you weren't paying attention, whereas LOTF hits you over the head with it.  Luckily there isn't a ton of dialogue/cutscenes but still a lot more than Dark Souls.This game also has no multiplayer at all.  No PVP or co-op which really limits the replayability of the game.  I would also say it's easier than Dark Souls as long as you have the right weapon for your playstyle.  Maybe that's just because I've played a lot of Dark Souls though.Whatever performance issues the game had when it was first released, they seem to be sorted out now.  The game ran perfectly for me.  I think it's worth getting on sale for someone itching for some more Dark Souls-like gameplay.  Just realize before buying it that you probably won't like it as much as Dark Souls.  I hope more devs in the future try to create games like this though, hopefully with some more original ideas in them too.			"

Ive tried this game on a clean install of windows and it crashes the exact same way. Ive also tried on completely different hardware (switched to my secondary GPU and swaped the mobo, processor, and RAM) only to have it continue to crash in the exact same way. Its at the point where I cant even progress anymore.TLDR: Great game, but very poor hardware compatibility.			"

												I so very much want to love the PC version of this game, however on my system (and so many other people's systems) the game constantly and randomly crashes.  After numerous patches the game still crashes.  And crashes.  And crashes.  Hopefully one day the devs will fix it but I fear the PC version will never work correctly so I cannot recommend it.  Sorry Deck 13/CI.  If it's true that it is the anti piracy software embedded in the game that causes the crash then the only people you are hurting by incorporating it are paying customers such as myself *sigh*.			"

												I have really really tried to like this game.  The graphics are amazing however the combat system needs completely reworked.  In an attempt to make it more difficult they made it damn near silly.  Your weapons are slow and cumbersome to use even using rogue daggers your weapon speed is slower than many of the enemies.  The bosses are not hard in the sense they are fun they are hard in the sense it makes no damn sense.  You are standing in front, the boss starts a down slash to the ground, you roll.  He turns half way down to ground and drops the blade on you.  Pretty sure you CANT stop a full force down slice with a heavy weapon mid way and turn 90 degrees to the side.  Just sayin.  Make it fun, make it realistic, make it harder ONLY if it makes sense.			"

												I'd be lying if I said I don't find some enjoyment in this game, but every time I start to really get into it, something comes along and ruins it.It starts out quite promising, but soon you realise that all 10 bosses are nothing but an exercise in your ability to strafe around the arena and be patient as you whittle down their unnecessarily hefty HP bars. There are only about 15-20 enemy types(not including bosses) in the 15 hour campaign, which start to get very stale. The game is also filled with technical problems ranging from minor annoyances to infuriating crashes and random alt+tabs in the middle of combat.I would say pick this game up on sale, but it is definitely not worth full price. Dark Souls 1 and 2 have more content, and are better designed in general.			"

												The combat mechanics are wonky at best. Shield bash breaks the entire game (you can do damage as fast as you can click the bash button which trivializes everything). Playing without a shield, on the other hand, is unplayably annoying because the game loves enemies that block 95% of the time and you can't get past blocks without a shield (or at least I haven't figured out how, the kick is pathetic) - you have to wait until they charge, hit once, wait again, repeat. Boring.FPS is terrible on my pretty high-ish-end system (your mileage might wary) until I turned most of the graphical fanciness off, and it still dips at times. Plot is awful and utterly nonsensical, feels like they cut most of it out and forgot to fill the blanks because the dialogue makes absolutely zero sense at some points.It's not irredeemably bad - the combat has a great feeling of weight to it and is pretty fun-ish when you're not fighting shield enemies or bashing everything. Maybe they can build on the good parts on a later title. If it goes on sale for 5-10€ and you lust for a Dark Souls-clone and don't mind wonky mechanics, maybe.			"

												It's a shame that what could have been a great game is a broken program full of bugs.It's locked at 30fps by default. This is by design. If you unlock the fps you can expect even more bugs, broken combat and unexpected character behaviour.It randomly crashes, this is a known issue since release (9 months ago,,). Tried most fixes out there, still crashes. If you spend hours trying to kill a boss the last thing you expect is for a game like this to crash just when you're about to deal the final blow.It's shame cus the graphics are great and was enjoying the story line but with such a challenging and ruthless kind of game you can't have the mechanics/software against you, it ruins the whole concept. tl dr: don't buy console scraps			"

												I'll start with the pros : beautiful scenery and music, gorgeous equipment so far, and... that's it.Lots of cons on this one : Dull gameplay, unfair combat system, no storyNo dynamism on combats, you have to repeat the exact same combos all over again, for every single fight.Enemies with shields are a nightmare, you simply can't attack them, and there is a ton of them at the beginning of the game. Roll past them, they instantly face you before you even have the time to attack. Even with low encumberance.The other enemies are a joke though, one or two hits with any weapon and they are gone.Only way to progress so far is to grind the beginning of the game, on the 3 or 4 enemies variant (bestiary is really poor) and spend your xp to raise attributes, hoping to stand a chance against shield users.I enjoyed it the first hour, but the longer I play, the more of a hassle it becomes.I recommend it on sale, for those who like mindless action and repetitive, boring gameplay (the only viable strategy is bashing and spell spamming)Not worth paying full price			"

A lot of places, it's too cramped to even be able to move around, so you're forced to take on a 10 ft tall demon with a shield his size.

												Made in the ""Souls"" formula, this game have a good presentation, great graphics and a action-focused story, good enough to guide you to the 10-12 hours needed to complete the game. The main fault of this game is the lenght (too short) and the variation of characters and places. Evan with that  is still fun to play and is anyway better that the most of the junk games that comes out in our days.			"

												I'm going to be comparing this game to Dark Souls since it is VERY similar to Dark Souls except not as good.  It's so similar that the controls are virtually identical when using the ""alternate"" control scheme.  Even the special moves have the same controls, ie parry/riposte, jump attack, backstab, rolling attack.The world is a decent size but pretty small compared to Dark Souls, and it all kinda looks the same.  Maybe equivalent to about 3 areas in Dark Souls.  The game does encourage you to go back to old areas to find new items and open doors that were previously locked, but when you go back most of the enemies are trivially easy to defeat so it's not that great.  The combat is pretty similar to Dark Souls too.  You can use shield+weapon, or dual hand weapons for more powerful/faster attacks.  I found the strength based weapons painfully slow to use, but the agility based weapons behaved a lot more like Dark Souls.  It also has the Dark Souls system of fatroll vs fastroll depending on what % of your carrying weight you are using.  The enemies have a decent variety although nowhere near what you'll find in Dark Souls simply because it's a much smaller world.  The animations and hitboxes are a bit off sometimes though.  You get used to it but it's nowhere near as ""crisp"" as Dark Souls.The game also has a system of weapon/armor upgrades where you place runes into slots, but a lot of weapons don't even have any slots for runes, and even the ones that do usualy only have one slot.  Because of this most of the runes don't actually make a huge difference.  Sort of like upgrading a weapon to +5 or something in Dark Souls, instead of being able to go to +10 or +15.  You can also add things like poison/fire/magic to your weapon but because most weapons only have one slot you are sacrificing physical damage to use those runes.The story in the game is pretty generic and boring.  That's not the reason I bought this game, but even so this is one of the areas where if differs from Dark Souls the most.  Dark Souls has a very subtle/mysterious story and lore that you could totally miss if you weren't paying attention, whereas LOTF hits you over the head with it.  Luckily there isn't a ton of dialogue/cutscenes but still a lot more than Dark Souls.This game also has no multiplayer at all.  No PVP or co-op which really limits the replayability of the game.  I would also say it's easier than Dark Souls as long as you have the right weapon for your playstyle.  Maybe that's just because I've played a lot of Dark Souls though.Whatever performance issues the game had when it was first released, they seem to be sorted out now.  The game ran perfectly for me.  I think it's worth getting on sale for someone itching for some more Dark Souls-like gameplay.  Just realize before buying it that you probably won't like it as much as Dark Souls.  I hope more devs in the future try to create games like this though, hopefully with some more original ideas in them too.			"

Lords of the Fallen(patch 1.6) ReviewCTRL+FSpoiler filter, being informative&giving constructive critisismI am going to use spoiler filter to filter out both Story elements&gameplay mechanics but not all Gameplay mechanics - just advanced-mechanics.My review is ment to be informative about LOTF, give constructive criticism to to the devs. and not to ruin the experience, gameplay&story to the player.StartLords of the Fallen is an Action-RPG very similiar to Demon Souls - with more focus on story.StoryThe Story starts of with a battle between an unknown man with tattoos on his face & a giant monster. After the battle - the unknown man, with the tattoos, guides an elderly priest to Keystone('not sure if this is a flashback or...)Story - some actions One of my biggest complaints I have with LOTF is that it's not clear whether you are doing something good or bad with some actions. For example: I saw what looked like a bonfire - I lit it, got some XP, fought some monsters and I thought to myself ''Cool, I got XP. I did well :)''. Later on, soldiers in the Castle says ''Curse the moment we saw that beacon'' I'm like ''What? what are you guys talking about? oh well, it's probabley some random dialogue-nonsense''After I beat the game, I decided to look up info. for a different outcome. A piece of info. that took me by suprise was something that read ''don't light the beacon'' after reading that and seeing a picture of it - everything clicked & I was all like ''What? How was I suppose to know that?GameplayGameplay is very much like Dark Souls but a bit improved, especially a better roll-mechanic.Blocking attacks with your shield in LOTF is at times pointless. As a Melee-class - I found myself relying on wearing light armour, using a buckler that repels attacks and rolling.Some enemies(Tyrant) can penetrate through your shield which makes blocking sometimes pointless... Why can't rolling & blocking be equally as good?Speaking of Blocking in order to break down cracked walls, you have to shield charge at them. Why not just attack the cracked wall with your melee weapon?Gameplay - Dual-wield; no projectile-weapons? When it comes to Dual-wielding, You can only dual-wield weapons that are crossed on their portrait.The games' in-game tutorial tells me anything I can do the enemies can do too. If that's so,  why can't I use projectile-weapons as well?Gameplay - magic-system The magic-system in LOTF is good, with some flaws. No matter what magic-tree you choose - they feel the same. Any class can use the ''gauntlet''. You can choose one more magic-tree, but only after you beat the game... Why can't you choose another magic-tree while you play?Gameplay - XP-systemEverytime you kill an enemy, you will recieve an XP-multiplier&you can bank your XP. Why didn't the soul-games think of this?Gameplay - upgrades By the way, about upgrades, there is only one smith. You can upgrade your weapons, gauntlet&armour. I was kind of hoping that the smith could craft legendaries. Why can't you make legendary weapons out of the boss's... er... XP...? Instead, if you want ''something special'', out of the boss's weapon drops, you have to defeat the boss in a ''special manner''(there is a list online)GraphicsI love the games' art-style - it's a real eye-candy. For me, LOTF art-style is more apealing to me than the Soul-series.MusicThe games' music is ok. The music blends itself with the background. I barely noticed the music was there about 75% of the time, except when it came to bosses. Personally, the music isn't that memerable for Me.Pros and ConsPros:a very appealing art-style. I love the ''Dark-Fantasy'' atmosphere.simple combat; improved rolling-mechanic and XP multiplier.good story.Cons:there is no indication of how to get your desired ending. There is no indication if your actions, are good or bad. Just like the beacon part  you shield charge at a cracked wall to get to hidden areas. Why not attack the cracked wall? Blocking&rolling isn't equally as goodConclusion Before I get to the ''Conclusions'', let me make one thing clear: all the complaints, that I've pointed out through out the review, does not reflex how much fun I've had with the game. I had fun playing LOTF and I like the story of LOTF.Though I will admit, I too encountered annoying bugs/crashes. I think LOTF should've been released during Xmas 2014 or summer 2015.In conclusion, Lords of the Fallen feels like a prologue, a great warm-up start of an upcoming sequel. Can I recommend Lords of the Fallen? Yes. I can recommend LOTF to both parties: those that have or haven't played Dark souls.Deck13 & CI Games, thank you for develping Lords of the Fallen. Complaints aside, I enjoyed playing through the game. I can't wait for the sequel.What I'd like to see in the sequelprojectile weapons.dual-wield any weapon you want - even 2h-weapons.skill-tree -system.more NG+bigger story.blocking&rolling should equally as good.Normal-attacks  will unveil hidden areas.better magic-tree.memorable soundtrack.a better smith. I'd like to see a smith that can craft legendaries.			"

												Its a good game, but the difficulty is extremely high for really no reason. It feels like you are in an mmo raid instance and keep wiping on trash mobs over and over. Like no matter how much gear you get, you're constantly way undergeared for the place you are in, and it would be nice to have an option tone that down slightly. Most opponenets have a distinct weakness that you have to find on your own, and until you do you'll probably die several times. Quest objectives are very vague. All that said, the combat is good and I like the idea of fighting only one or two enemies at a time, instead of a swarm. It gives combat a layer of depth and skill and timing that other games can't have. I'd like to see this concept implemented in other games now that engines support complex blocking mechanics. 3.5/5			"

												This game could have been so great but really lacks.The combat system is similar to Dark Souls except dreadful; rolls and attacks take way way too long to start. Shields are too OP; every enemy encounter is basically the same and so freaking slow. If only they had of made it MORE like dark souls where the combat is actually fun and responsive.Oh, and the camera system... get too close to a wall and your character goes COMPLETELY invisible. If you get staggered too close to a wall you cannot tell when your character becomes movable again because it's completely invisible.The graphics are lush and there is a variety in item drops and in-game dialogue is reasonably good.

												After 50+ hours of play and ready to kill the last boss and start NG++ I can say this game is epic.  If you enjoyed the Dark Souls' games then LOTF is mandatory.  Some have suggested LOFT is merely riding on the coattails of Dark Souls but I disagree.  Very much like Dragon's Dogma, LOTF proves developers can take the Dark Souls formula and add their own style and make a fantastic game.  Performance issues which have largely been resolved with v1.4 slightly mire the game.  Some users have claimed they suffer random CTDs, or the game simply won't load at all but I have not experienced these problems myself.  LOTF2 has since been announced and I look forward to CI expanding on the game world.			"

												First and foremost, Lords of the Fallen is an excellent game!  It's impossible not to compare the game to Dark Souls.  I would agree Dark Souls is a slightly better game largely due to its' setting, atmosphere, and gear crafting depth.  However, Lords of the Fallen is without a doubt a superb action RPG in a fascinating would with epic boss fights!Secondly, while the game has a reputation for bugs and stability issues, as of patch 1.6 I can tell you I only encountered a handful of very minor glitches.  If this concern has held you back from purchasing the game, then worry no longer the game is solid.Lords of the Fallen is a superior PC gaming experience over Dark Souls.  The graphics are nothing short of phenomenal by comparison as they really take advantage of the muscle power of modern PC gaming hardware.  Additionally, you can see by the patch history they care enough to fix bugs and stability issues, and not leave PC gamers with year old bugs (*cough* Dark Souls 2 durability *cough*).I'm hoping we'll see a Lords of the Fallen 2 complete with multiplayer in the near future!

												A Dark Souls-like game for those of us who have neither the time nor the patience for Dark Souls.Pros:+ Forgiving checkpoint system+ Balanced and fair combat+ Nice variety of enemies.+ Great graphics. Particle effects of Unreal Engine 4 in full effect here.+ Great soundtrack. Reminiscent of Diablo II soundtrack.+ Audio logs. A lot better than reading about the world and the voice acting is good as well.Cons:- Not the best optimized game, but the frame rate is steady. If you must have 60 fps, you'll have to turn down some settings. I'm fine with the 40-50 fps I get.- Story is pretty barebones. That's not why I'm playing this game though.- Camera can get wild with multiple targets in a small space like a hallway.Conclusion: I have tried to get into the Dark Souls games, and I respect the design of them but I simply can't replay the same content bonfire to bonfire over and over again. This game provides an alternative experience and is the first competitor/clone of the Souls games. I picked this up from♥♥♥♥♥for $15 and it is well worth the price. If you want to get into Dark Souls but would like to start with an easier (still difficult though) experience than Dark Souls, this is the game for you.			"

The combat system and the overall gameplay is great (it's not linear, you have to figure out where to go, explore carefully to find secrets, ect..), awesome graphics, and it's pretty atmospheric in my opinion, even if not as dark and bleak as Dark Souls. Not as challenging as DS, but I play as a rouge character (light armor and weapons) and it's not easy at all (I soloed DS and DS2)Slight fps drops here and there, but no crashes for me.As a DS fan I'm having a lot of fun with this game, highly recommended!

 A far more better alternative to Dark Soul 2 When it comes to gameplay and fun, I think this title beats Dark Souls 2 in many ways. It is just sad, there is no coop mode. But instead it offers you the following benefits compared to Dark Souls 2:- far more better visuals. You don't have the feeling some state of the art visual mechanics are missing. Lightning, shading, animations. All feel more suitable- a better fighitng mechanic, even if you don't lock your target, you hit it with your strike. In Dark Souls 2 I managed it to miss a target lying right in front of me, cuz the devs force you to lock all your targets. Here you can even fight without this mechanic and beat your enemies. It feels far more intuitive and fluent.- a better and advanced dodging and evading system, so melee fighting feels a lot better and more fluent.- adequate keymapping options, you can map all functions to your desired mouse and keyboard buttons. In Dark Souls 2 e.g. all mouse buttons were restricted except, left right and middle. Generally both titles make a Gamepad dispensable and playing with your desired WASD config more fluent. But here you can map your keys like you expect it in titles released after 2010! So related to this, all functions like the character menu are accessible very fast; no workaround by using an inconvenient menu like in Dark Soul 2.When it comes to setting, I think both have their own and unique style. Lords of the Fallen reminds me somehow of Diablo 2 - Lord of Destruction. A snowy countryside is raided by some unfriendly creatures. Feels really great to pass the areas crowded by friends and foes.But even an alternative has its flaws. 1. I liked the design and ideas for enemies a lil bit better in Dark Soul 2. Sadly the devs messed this up with the outdated visual technique, animations. They should put more effort into visuals and usability like in Lords of the Fallen.2. The story and the background - it is very short. Could have been more content when it comes to enemies and locations.3. The mouse view has to be adjusted very, carefully, otherwise it is too slow / fast. But this can be done by the options very good.In the end I can say it is worth at least 10 bucks.			"

												First I would like to adress all that played just after release - game is now stable, great looking and many of the flaws mentioned in early negative rewievs are gone. It`s nice polished gem - smaller then Souls, yet with its own value. I played 3 runs - NG, NG+ and NG++ and if not for so many other games waiting for my attention, I would love to play more. Maybe that`s just the best thing I can say about Lords - I played 105 hours and still could play more. Anyway, try it guys - it`s worth it.

												Lords of The Fallen is Action RPG isnpired off the Dark Souls Series, as so it seams. Lords of the Fallen takes certain aspects from Dark Souls that made it great, puts it into Lords of the Fallen, flips it on its side, and attemtps to make it better but in a different way. They succeed in some aspects and fails in others, however, Lords of the Fallen is a fun experience and should not be missed if a sale comes by your way.PROS: Great combat, feels slow at first but after an hour or two it feels more naturalParrying that feels satisfactoryHard but rewarding bossfights Very Unique armor sets and rewardsThe player gets rewarded for taking risks with the games unique risk and reward systemCONS:When preforming a backstab animation or parry, the camera will change to an awkward position.Some boss fights may have difficult movesets, but some fights are only difficult because of an INSANE healthbarCRASHES occur no matter if you have a amazing pc or not. ( I have crashed a decent amount and I have a powerful PC.The game is not very well optimized which lead to the crashes.Lots of random glitches and bugs that just make the game feel unpolished.The level design left me wanting more, instead I just kept revisitng the same areas.There are several enemies in the game that are invincible all the time and they suck, until you find a way to make them vulnurable which is possible for all those type of enemies, except for one in particular. The one you can never kill ( at least I couldn't and I did almost everything optional) is very very agrivating, especially in small halways.Verdict:Lords of the Fallen in the end is a well made game. It did not fail and is not perfect However, it suprised the gaming community with a difficult, rewarding, yet a fresh new experience that is one of the first games to take inspiration off the Souls genere and succeed. If you have the spare cash to pick up Lords of the Fallen, do so, but preferabley at a reduced price in my humble opinion.Rating : 8 "

												Good game, from my perspective better than Dark Souls.. mainly for following reasons:- easier to play, im no longer teenager and i dont have lightning fast reflexes anymore- superrior graphics- and moste important PC FRIENDLY CONTROLS !!! yes this game actually dont feel it has been designed for consoles in  coparison to DS ""cant use mouse for combos"" huge leap forwardYes this game is definitely bit simplier but i dont see it as a flaw so if you have job id dont have dozens hours of free time to master every enemy in game this is great alternetive.

												My first note is that the game is very short. I beat it in 8 hours of playtime. No multiplayer, limited sidequests that are very vague and confusing levels had me getting mixed up all over the place. There were not very many bosses and they were all pretty easy. Only two bosses actually killed me.This game is NOT Dark Souls. Not even close. It uses dark souls combat mechanics like health potions that refill at checkpoints, dodge rolls, and left hand/right hand on LB/LT and RB/RT. The same mechanics are in it but the feel is much different. Everything in Dark Souls is very thoughtful and you can learn your opponents moves and such to make it a lot easier, but even as a magic build I found myself just smacking everything in the face with my hammer and ignoring damage.It was a very easy game, the only challenging part was that the level layouts are confusing and mazelike. I did enjoy the game, but it felt like it could have been so much more. I will probably do the NG+ but I don't recommend it for $50. Get it on sale and it will be fun for a while.TL:DR Fun but too short and no multiplayer. Do not expect it to be like Dark Souls. Mechanics are similar, but the game is way different.			"

												This review comes along time after finishing my first play through. I became interested in this game before it launched. I was looking for a game to quench my thirst for more Dark Souls. It appeared to have similar gameplay/character control. You will find many people comparing this to Dark Souls or saying that this game copied Dark Souls. I will tell you that this game establishes itself. The combat shares similarites. However, there is a total different feel to it. Magic and items have a different feel to them. The game does offer weapon enhancement, experience multiplier for the longer you go without touching a save shard. The visuals look great for the atmoshpere it is trying to achieve. The soundtrack and music is not as memorable as some other games. Enemy design is well thought out and the puzzles you encounter in the game take some thought to overcome. All in all a decent game to quench ones thirst. Give it a shot, it plays much better now than it did at launch. I will say that the final boss is a beast. The story has not stuck with me as much as Dark Souls. Although there were many more hours dumped in that game than this.			"

												This is prolly the most underrated game  iv played in a long long time. (darksiders imo is also a underrated game but that has a decent following). Compareing this to dark souls is just stupid, thats like saying... Ford came up with petrol engine so every petrol car is a ripoff.GRAPHICSI love the visuals and i am surprised that why most reveiwers dont use this game to benchmark GPUS.When i bought this game I was running it on a r9 290x @ 1080p, Recently i upgraded to a 980ti and am now running the game uber smooth at 1600p. I must say this game is prolly the best looking RPG right now, It looks better than witcher III which is saying something.Gameplay.Its nowhere as difficult as darksouls ( i spent around 400 hours in dark souls 1 on PS3) And that is a good thing, I like how the world is interconnected, I do wish they had a ranged  specifc class system which would have made the game much for fun , There are basically 3 main classes which can further be merged into more classes. All play the same it depends on your style. The game isnt very long which is a dud. It should have been longer and left me with a feeling of wanting more, the DLC they added wasnt all that fun tbh I was way too op for it.Sound.Not much of a sound nerd but i like how this game sounds :)so if u r a action rpg fan who loves to play pretty games and if u like the artstyle of darksiders and if you think darksouls was too difficult...get this game!!!

												I just wrote a reveiw for this trash and steam didn't recognize it when i posted. Get your crap together Valve.That being said do NOT buy this game. It is a piece of garbage and not worth any money whatsoever, not even worth downloading if its Free to Play.  Combat system clunky, movement clunky, spell/level advancement system convoluted and annoying to interact with, equipment load out has no ""drop item"" or ""destroy item"" option, so you're carrying constantly all the equipment you ever picked up in entire game from very beginning.  Monsters are bland and uninspired, characters are bland and uninspired, (every guy looks like he's working out with 1970s Arnold Schwarzenneggar, even old men), like the art designers from Gears of War and art designers from Darksiders got together and had babies. Spells are practically useless and time it takes to cast them you might as well just swing sword a few more times, no diversity of franged weaponry like bows and crossbows, just a magical gauntlet you get early on thats with you rest of game and yet it sucks and is boring and crappy to use, you might as well use sword and shield. Always feels like you're moving through molasses no matter what equipment you're using (light medium or heavy). I could go more and more in depth but I really don't want to give this game any more of my energy even in this way.  Stay away at all costs. You WILL be disappointed. HEAVILY.			"

												If you are looking for a game to play after Dark Souls, give this one a pass.Combat is slow and clunky. Class balance is completely skewed towards sword and board warrior turtle playstyle. There is no pure spellcaster class, most of the spells are purely supportive with gauntlet being the only ranged weapon in the game.Agile characters are punished by terrible claustrophobic level design filled with hulking enemies that block your movements most of the time. And speaking of level design, its linear, with every area feeling compressed in every possible direction, even the few outdoor areas feel that way.Story feels like an afterthought with absolutely nothing of interest in it, the game world looks and feels generic and boring. Aesthetically the game is trying to make everything in it look as badass as it possibly can, and that only makes it more boring. There is no contrast of any kind.Without comparing it to Dark Souls (which is hard, when even its developers are doing it) its an average third person action ""role playing"" game, good enough for a purchase on sale, if you are bored enough, provided you never played Dark Souls, or hate how it plays.PS: Forgot to mention, it's short, with very limited replay value.

												I went into this not expecting much as people tend to dismiss this game out of hand. I was plesantly surprised.I'll say right off the bat that this is a Dark Souls 2 clone. I say two specifically because this feels much more similar to the sequel than the original (or Demons'). Nearly all your enemies are humanoids, for example. It plays a lot better than Dark Souls 2 though. No enemies pivoting on the spot mid swing to auto-track you, all the hitboxes seem tight and what you expect. Also it looks a shed load prettier for what that's worth.The conversation system is a bit pointless, and I was a bit dissapointed in the weapon upgrading system. You can slot gems into your gear for things like +4 dmg or +10 melee protection. But most weapons can only take 1 or 2 runes, so you never really feel like your changing anything dramatically. You won't get that Dark Souls feeling of taking a crappy starting weapon and upgrading it to +10. Though you can freely swap runes in and out as you wish so it's a bit more fluid. If you're looking for more Dark Souls then give this a shot. It's a straight up clone with a fresh coat of paint. In comparison to the other games like this I'd say this comes in somewhere inbetween Demons and DS2 in terms of quality.Worth a punt, especially if you see it on sale.			"

												Dark Souls Jr. in basically every sense of the title. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it's good to know what you're getting in to.Imagine if Dark Souls was shorter, easier, smaller, and simpler. That's basically Lords of the Fallen. It looks and runs great, and the controls are acceptable (there's a control scheme that is a direct rip of Dark Souls). The story isn't great but is passable. Mechanics (leveling, combat, etc) are solid.It's not a bad game, really. I guess if you only had time to play one game, you should play Dark Souls instead. If you've already played through Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2, and you want more, similar gameplay, then hey, give it a shot.			"

												You might get some enjoyment out of this game if you're a die hard Dark Souls fan. That's really the only reason I picked it up. Ultimately, it's just a failed clone. This game is one hundred percent a Dark Souls rip off. From the combat to respawning enemies to the refillable potions (estus flask) at check points, they blatantly attempted to cash in on the success of Dark Souls with this game. Which I would not have minded at all had it been a good game. Sadly, it is not. I would only recommend Lords of the Fallen if you pick it up on sale for super cheap and have an unquenchable thirst for Dark Souls game play. And even in that scenario, don't go in with high expectations.+CONS:-The story is weak. I just beat the game an hour ago and can't recall the plot if that's any indication of its impact. -The characters are uninteresting. And instead of a custom made, mute protagonist (like DS), you play as Harkyn. A very boring, grumpy, unlikable big buff white guy. -The controls are nearly identical to DS. Nearly being the keyword. They're so close that the few buttons they switch up constantly messed with me the whole game. There is no custom button mapping. Only two pre-mapped set ups you can choose from. -The armors are dull. Finding new sets doesn't feel that rewarding when they all look almost exactly the same. -The enemies are bland. Most designs are cliche and/or unmemorable. -The combat is flawed. You'll often find yourself taking damage despite a very well timed dodge roll. They did a decent job of emulating DS combat overall yet it somehow ends up feeling not nearly as satisfying. -The magic is wonky. You are forced to choose one of three builds (each with 4 specific spells) at the beginning of the game. But you don't really have any clue what any of the spells will do or how useful they'll be. So you're blindly picking and are then locked into that build the rest of the game. You can't change. Nor can you eventually branch out and use the spells from the other two builds. I randomly chose 'Rogue' and ended up spamming the 'Stab' spell the entire game. Your magic automatically refills after about 10 seconds so spamming is an accurate term here. Magic does far more damage than physical attacks. So you'll often find yourself running and dodging to kill time between OP magic casts.+PROS:-Pleasant graphics?I did get *some* enjoyment out of this game. More so early on. However, finishing it became more of a chore. And the ending is extremely unsatisfying. If asked 5 hours into the game, I would have said it's decent. After finishing it, I have to say it's not really worth the time.			"

												It is very similar to the souls series, complete with bugs, crashes and dodgey hit boxes. The mechanics in this are nowhwere near as complex and interesting as the souls games, but still fun and functional in its own right.  Most enemies are humonoid with exception of a few (most of which are dogs). The writing is terrible as is the story, the npcs seem to know exactly whats going on at all times but neglect to fill you in, if i didnt know better i would assume they are the masterminds behind it all.The graphic while great are not optimized and are quite intensive even on supercomputers. There is a very basic crafting system, but i honestly dont see why they didnt just let us socket runes from our inventory rather than making it overly complicated.The magic is interesting and often overpowered, but the magic guantlet is next to useless.The starting class feels like an important choice without it locking you into a specific play style.Bosses have additional challenges that reward improved versions of their equipment, though they are generally easy enough that you will complete them accidently alot.Enemies and bosses themselves are all very unique and fun to learn how to beat.Unfortunetly like dark souls you are required to trial and error your way through the game.The world isnt at all interconnected and is very linear especially at the beginning.Bonfires are over complicated and not explained very well (yes i know there not really bonfires).Overall its not worth the asking price, but is definetly worth considering if on sale.Definetly nice if your looking for more dark souls but are bored of the souls worlds.

I'm bad at the game, so therefore it must be a bad gameI loved it as a fan of Dark Souls and the genre, my only advice is to play it for yourself. The gaming community as a whole has not idea what it wants, so if you're interested buy it and give it a shot. I got it for $20 on sale and got atleast $60 worth of value. Any problems with how it runs will be addressed over time, and if anything just look at crashes as part of the punishing nature of the game until it's fixed.			"

												If you liked Dark Souls 1/2, this game is for you. The story is a bit crappy, but the combat is really fun, and the graphics are amazing. It's a lot easier and shorter, but there is a replayability, new game+, similar as in the DS series.I did not have a single technical issue at very high settings @1080p with FX6300, 8 gigs of ram, and a R9 280 (although I bought the 1.4 version, idk how was the game at release).Definitely worth buying if it's on a sale.

												I honesly cant stop playing this! I have a charachter in NewGame+++ and I started a new character just for the fun of it! If you loved Dark Souls as much as I did and you want a simpler and more western Soul-like RPG I think this is the game for you. The visuals and the sound track are just amazing, the only part I dislike is the recyceling of mobs, and the boring bosses, they are kinda hard but not because they are hard to ""counter"" but beacause they deal a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of dmg if you happen to not be a tank using a 200lbs shield.

												You might get some enjoyment out of this game if you're a die hard Dark Souls fan. That's really the only reason I picked it up. Ultimately, it's just a failed clone. This game is one hundred percent a Dark Souls rip off. From the combat to respawning enemies to the refillable potions (estus flask) at check points, they blatantly attempted to cash in on the success of Dark Souls with this game. Which I would not have minded at all had it been a good game. Sadly, it is not. I would only recommend Lords of the Fallen if you pick it up on sale for super cheap and have an unquenchable thirst for Dark Souls game play. And even in that scenario, don't go in with high expectations.+CONS:-The story is weak. I just beat the game an hour ago and can't recall the plot if that's any indication of its impact. -The characters are uninteresting. And instead of a custom made, mute protagonist (like DS), you play as Harkyn. A very boring, grumpy, unlikable big buff white guy. -The controls are nearly identical to DS. Nearly being the keyword. They're so close that the few buttons they switch up constantly messed with me the whole game. There is no custom button mapping. Only two pre-mapped set ups you can choose from. -The armors are dull. Finding new sets doesn't feel that rewarding when they all look almost exactly the same. -The enemies are bland. Most designs are cliche and/or unmemorable. -The combat is flawed. You'll often find yourself taking damage despite a very well timed dodge roll. They did a decent job of emulating DS combat overall yet it somehow ends up feeling not nearly as satisfying. -The magic is wonky. You are forced to choose one of three builds (each with 4 specific spells) at the beginning of the game. But you don't really have any clue what any of the spells will do or how useful they'll be. So you're blindly picking and are then locked into that build the rest of the game. You can't change. Nor can you eventually branch out and use the spells from the other two builds. I randomly chose 'Rogue' and ended up spamming the 'Stab' spell the entire game. Your magic automatically refills after about 10 seconds so spamming is an accurate term here. Magic does far more damage than physical attacks. So you'll often find yourself running and dodging to kill time between OP magic casts.+PROS:-Pleasant graphics?I did get *some* enjoyment out of this game. More so early on. However, finishing it became more of a chore. And the ending is extremely unsatisfying. If asked 5 hours into the game, I would have said it's decent. After finishing it, I have to say it's not really worth the time.			"

												My thumbs down is not an hard one i had fun playing lotf, but when i was comparing this to the DS franchise, and they are just better in every aspect but the graphic.I was able to finish the game the fist time with no difficulty at all. The game was easy, shield are OP, the animations of attack were slow (probabily more realistic, but waiting 1 second to deliver a blow could be a bit frustrating. This might be a fault of Souls game that get us used to see the berserk's sword swinged easly as longsword). The game got some balance issues with pacemaker you can easly achive 5XX dmg, comboing 2k dmg. That damage is insane!!! (socketing the ENDGAME rune give you ~16 damage, the luck give you ~200). Trading blow with bosses is efficent, imho it SHOULD NOT BE efficent, you got tons of pots, they can just repeat the attacks.Spells are game breaking, creating a clone of you that taunt the enemy is broken.(i didn't tested other spells, didn't needed to).To find the game a bit more challenging i dropped the shield and the spell and used only slow 2h weapon, maybe i'll try again with a stealth/agy class and the game will be really hard, i hope so!!Prothe game look fantasticThe armors and the weapons are really coolThe weapon got weight when they got swinged, and mobs react to that.The reward weapon got some cool effects (only them).The enemy are cool, they seems to have a nice AI, and the skinny undead are really unpredictable.The game is easyer than DS 2 and DS 1The game have nice ideas (event challenges are really cool).ConsThe objective of the boss fight is not shown before the bossYou got the same animation for almost every weapon of the same class.The armors and the weapons are really cool (every armor is too cool).The game have no pvp/online.The game is quite short(yea you can play in ng+/++)[dark souls 2/1 have the same price and the world ""bigger"" and it is filled with more content].The story was not so good, imho.The game is easyer than DS 2 and DS 1Stereotypical npc with low personalitySome area go recycledBtw i had fun smashing mobs with my 2handed axe/sword/hammer but sadly it didn't last long, but it was quite funny!!I rank this game 6 only because we already got souls game to play with, but if we would have not, i would have ranked this game higher.~ Levirax			"

												This game is a clunky version of the Dark Souls series. It's also very buggy as I have had more crashes than I can count while playing the game.

												My first note is that the game is very short. I beat it in 8 hours of playtime. No multiplayer, limited sidequests that are very vague and confusing levels had me getting mixed up all over the place. There were not very many bosses and they were all pretty easy. Only two bosses actually killed me.This game is NOT Dark Souls. Not even close. It uses dark souls combat mechanics like health potions that refill at checkpoints, dodge rolls, and left hand/right hand on LB/LT and RB/RT. The same mechanics are in it but the feel is much different. Everything in Dark Souls is very thoughtful and you can learn your opponents moves and such to make it a lot easier, but even as a magic build I found myself just smacking everything in the face with my hammer and ignoring damage.It was a very easy game, the only challenging part was that the level layouts are confusing and mazelike. I did enjoy the game, but it felt like it could have been so much more. I will probably do the NG+ but I don't recommend it for $50. Get it on sale and it will be fun for a while.TL:DR Fun but too short and no multiplayer. Do not expect it to be like Dark Souls. Mechanics are similar, but the game is way different.			"

												Dark Souls Jr. in basically every sense of the title. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it's good to know what you're getting in to.Imagine if Dark Souls was shorter, easier, smaller, and simpler. That's basically Lords of the Fallen. It looks and runs great, and the controls are acceptable (there's a control scheme that is a direct rip of Dark Souls). The story isn't great but is passable. Mechanics (leveling, combat, etc) are solid.It's not a bad game, really. I guess if you only had time to play one game, you should play Dark Souls instead. If you've already played through Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2, and you want more, similar gameplay, then hey, give it a shot.			"

												This game glued me for screen like not many games managed to do so. Even though I have played 16 hours I haven't finished the game and I do enjoy the game a lot. Lords of the Fallen have good mouse and keyboard controls!  I haven't played Dark Souls because I don't have controller, don't like the controller and controls for mouse and keyboard are horror (I was fighting with controls in Dark Souls since they didn't let me fight the monsters). I thought after seeing so many videos that I have enough patience for this combat type - I was so wrong! First 4 to 6 hours I spent only learning how to be patient and careful. It was infuriating! Once I settle that down, only then I started to learn how to play Lords of The Fallen. Every weapon is a bit different and it is very punishing if not used properly. This is one of those games where the main focus is on playing again and again. There is no way around it. This is not the bad thing - on contrary! It is done in such way where player learns from his mistakes and tries again thus improving himself. Pure Warrior, Cleric and Rogue give quite diverse playtyle and I would advise anyone to start with pure aproach before making hybrids (my first save was hybrid and it is wrong).I encountered few crashes. On 16 hours I had like 6 crashes. I have everything on High except model detail on Very High but I think I should bring that back on High. Visually, game looks very polished. There are no blank unfinished spaces. Everything is designed to feel like finished game (this is the reference to Dark Souls where many areas feel barren and unfinished). Animations are quite good. Harkyn really moves like a human - he is not wooden imitation of a human motions. I am very pleased to see that a side from first initial intro, all cutscenes are ingame engine realtime rendering. The only thing I don't like in those is when upon killing a warden, Harkyn has no helmet for the duration of cutscene (they could make animation where he lifts his helmet and then rest of cutscene continues as usual.Gameplay, well as someone who could not play Dark Souls because of controls, I really enjoyed this game so far. In long time there was no game that glued me for screen. There is something in improving yourself and trying things. On top of that, even though simplified, character builder is very intuitive and gives enough info what will happen. One exception is last 4th spell where it states only Faith requirement but it also require 5 points spent in spells as another requirement.			"

												The Game itself is great! I love the Dark Souls series and since this game is basically a easier version i like this too.BUT!  It seems like it still has a ton of problems. In my case it would be the constant crashes. I mean 6 crashes in under an hour? I'm patient but that is kind of awful. And before anyone asks, i did update my graphics card drivers. Since the reviews split into 2 camps, meaning those who have the crashes and the those who dont, there is no accurate way to tell if you should recommend it or not. But right now, i do get the crashes and i think i should have waited to purchase this. So recommend it or not?Not right now. Will change if something changes or if there is a resolution to fix it. If you still buy it you probably have a 50/50 chance it does work. Do you feel lucky?EDIT: So i may have judged this problem too fast before really looking into it. It works fine for me now and another 2 hours into the game i do think have an explanation.So it seems like the Nvidia Trubulance feature caused the constant crashes, which is kind of weird because i have n Nvidia GTX 970. So by deactivating the feature it didnt crash on me again. So basically what the problem seems to be for Nvidia card owner is that the function itself causes some kind of problem and thus creating the crashes. And i guess alot of ppl don't have that problem because the have AMD card's and this feature is in general turned off? I don't really know, that is just my guess.Anyways.....having a lot of fun playing it. For Dark Souls fans a nice  treat ;)			"

												First I would like to adress all that played just after release - game is now stable, great looking and many of the flaws mentioned in early negative rewievs are gone. It`s nice polished gem - smaller then Souls, yet with its own value. I played 3 runs - NG, NG+ and NG++ and if not for so many other games waiting for my attention, I would love to play more. Maybe that`s just the best thing I can say about Lords - I played 105 hours and still could play more. Anyway, try it guys - it`s worth it. Especially it shows on many sales now.SPOILERSNow some small advice for all who will play:- don`t use attribute shards as long as You can- collect them - they pass to NG+ and NG++- just before the end of NG invest 25-30 points in luck - 90% of  boxes will have attribute shard (instead of equipment You got on 1 playthrough) on NG+ and NG++ and with that amount of luck it took me tops 2 tries to get it from each box - some boxes have fixed shards and willl not change but they are few,- save Your Heroes Shard on NG+ and NG++ for later and respec (utilizing Your luck before final NG++ Judge fight can give nice edge),- don`t spend even one point of exp on magic ( I ended NG++ with over 70  unusable magic shards),- no matter how green You are in heavy armour according to Your burden meter light armour is always FASTER,- if You will try to get all achievements kill Judge with Keeper`s Weapon on 1st run while giving Adyr`s rune to blacksmith or slotting it into armour (On my 1st playthrough I simply rushed in the end to Judge so fast that I forgot about Ancient Labirynth, on second I got strenght based Gauntlets from Keeper but my 2H sword took one more swing too much and I was forced to do Labirynth again on NG++, take Faith based Greataxe, sloth it with Adyr rune as I already gave it to Blacksmith on NG, and then used it on Armour on NG+ - well killing him with faith based 350 dmg Greataxe was doable but not easy ;) )- gauntlet, even with circa 120 Faith is not powerfull enough to be Your first weapon- Mimic is Your best friend- take Your time and enjoy the views :)			"

												This is prolly the most underrated game  iv played in a long long time. (darksiders imo is also a underrated game but that has a decent following). Compareing this to dark souls is just stupid, thats like saying... Ford came up with petrol engine so every petrol car is a ripoff.GRAPHICSI love the visuals and i am surprised that why most reveiwers dont use this game to benchmark GPUS.When i bought this game I was running it on a r9 290x @ 1080p, Recently i upgraded to a 980ti and am now running the game uber smooth at 1600p. I must say this game is prolly the best looking RPG right now, It looks better than witcher III which is saying something.Gameplay.Its nowhere as difficult as darksouls ( i spent around 400 hours in dark souls 1 on PS3) And that is a good thing, I like how the world is interconnected, I do wish they had a ranged  specifc class system which would have made the game much for fun , There are basically 3 main classes which can further be merged into more classes. All play the same it depends on your style. The game isnt very long which is a dud. It should have been longer and left me with a feeling of wanting more, the DLC they added wasnt all that fun tbh I was way too op for it.Sound.Not much of a sound nerd but i like how this game sounds :)so if u r a action rpg fan who loves to play pretty games and if u like the artstyle of darksiders and if you think darksouls was too difficult...get this game!!!

												Lords of the Fallen is Buggy and has problems with the framerate. But that is okay, i like these kind of games and i want to give this game a chance.Lord of the Fallen is buggy and doors or chests randomly don't open or the message that they are closed is missing, colloision detection is somewhat spotty here and there. But that is okay, you can find a solution to one and can work around the other.Lord of Fallen has a bit spotty design and the enemys turn sometimes DURING their attacks folowing you with an attack that clearly should be an opneing for you as the player to counter them. Sigh okey, i am now 15 hours in, let us get trough this.Lord of the Fallen can.. stand in the corner of shame, because it crashed twice, both times at the same boss and both times when the boss was down to around one fifth of his/it's lifes.Lord of the Fallen can GO HOME YOU ARE DRUNK because i couldn't really play around a bit and improve my stats because the game forced you into an boss encounter (or perhabs a door was again bugged out because there were some, but i couldn't open them) where i needed this because i was a bit rushing forward and slightly too much too weak for this boss.This forced me into a boss fight that took me around 30 MINUTES for the most successfull of many goes at him where i chipping away tiny pieces of his life.The Boss was down to one sixth of his health WHEN IT CRASHED AGAIN!We have Dark Souls (started), Dark Souls 2 (not touched yet), Dragons Dogma (started) and soon Dark Souls 3 on Steam.Don't buy this buggy mess of a game and get those. Seriously. Lords of the Fallen... to the Bugs... i guess.			"

												Was never going to live up to the Dark Souls comparisons. In some ways it's a mix of Dark Souls and Dark Siders, which has really nice results at times. I had a lot of fun with this, and the game looks great - especially all the gear you find. Two major gripes: 1) some kind of control glitch meant that about half the time I wanted to do a leaping attack, simply jumped and rolled. Super annoying. 2) I don't have a problem with short games, and this one isn't, really, but on the other hand I still felt like the content was a bit skimpy. Most of the enemies get heavily reused, and much of the game is stretched out by having you go back through previous areas. I only remember there being 5 or 6 main areas to the game.In all, it's a fun game, but certainly not worth full price. Worth grabbing if it's on sale for $5-10.7/10			"

												So I feel safe reviewing this due to the fact that it's been about a year since my inital playthrough, and my opinion of it is unchanged. It's alright.My first playthrough was a lot of fun.  You'll go through the standard stuff of discovering new weapons, rerolling to use different stuff, and the inital thrills of exploring the areas.  Like everyone else has mentioned, the combat is very Souls-like.  It's a little more clunky and slower-paced, but that's not a bad thing.  The difficulty is pretty low; most of the boss fights are super gimmicky.  The story is bland and the dialog is atrocious, but it's not too invasive and does an okay job linking one area to the next.  I enjoyed exploring the world, trying out different weapons, modding them in different ways, and reaching the conclusion, but that's where the enjoyment stopped.  There's some replayability, different classes, different stats with different weapon sets, and a few different endings, but I felt no desire to go back through the game and find them.  I moved on with my life and came back across this game recently and decided to give it another shot with some fresh eyes.  The level design is a certain kind of bland, it's so unremarkable that the layout is memorable but not enjoyable.  After just about a full year of not playing it, I still didn't have much of a desire to go back through the game.I believe I got the game on sale, and I got a solid 15 hours of gameplay out of it that were very enjoyable.  I'm sure that's more than enough to justify whatever I spent on it.  I see that it's currently on sale (posting during the winter sale of 2015) for $9, and it's a phenomenal game for that price.  The base price of $49.99 seems a little steep.  If you don't have a habit of restarting when you find cool gear, you can probably get through it faster than I did.  If you're new to the action-rpg genre and struggle with the difficulty, it might take you 20ish hours for a full-explore playthrough.  Either way, the game is enjoyable, but quickly forgotten.			"

												I bought this game a while back and began to play it.  After some false starts, I began playing in earnest.  I liked the game for the first 2-3 hours of trial and errors.  It may be that I've been consolized or other such term, but I just couldn't figure what to do/where to go next after enough time was spent exploring.  I uninstalled the game, not in a rage but just apathy in the 3rd area.  You're supposed to perform a task, but there's no information on how to do it (do I need to collect something, go to someplace in particular, pull a lever, what?), none of the NPCs are helpful and it seems to be more than just kill everything (I can do that one fine).  After a full afternoon of playing, I just couldn't care less. On a good note, it looks pretty good, the combat is fluid, hitboxes are fair.  I liked it more than I liked Dark Souls.  I just didn't like it.			"

												From the first time that we saw the Lords of the Fallen videos we could not help our­selves but com­pare it to the Dark Souls games. Even though the game does fol­low the Souls game mechan­ics, it does offer an inter­est­ing and some­what eas­ier gam­ing experience.Lords of the Fallen tells the story of Harkyn, an impris­oned crim­i­nal who is set free in order to save the world from the inter-dimensional Rhogar and their Lords. The story tries to keep things inter­est­ing through cutscenes and var­i­ous moments where the player is allowed to choose a spe­cific course of action. Unfor­tu­nately, the choices do not seem to be of any sig­nif­i­cance towards the pro­gres­sion of the game; their exis­tence how­ever does make things more interesting.Read the rest of my review here: http://www.blowsomesteam.com/lords-of-the-fallen/ "

												The Game itself is great! I love the Dark Souls series and since this game is basically a easier version i like this too.BUT!  It seems like it still has a ton of problems. In my case it would be the constant crashes. I mean 6 crashes in under an hour? I'm patient but that is kind of awful. And before anyone asks, i did update my graphics card drivers. Since the reviews split into 2 camps, meaning those who have the crashes and the those who dont, there is no accurate way to tell if you should recommend it or not. But right now, i do get the crashes and i think i should have waited to purchase this. So recommend it or not?Not right now. Will change if something changes or if there is a resolution to fix it. If you still buy it you probably have a 50/50 chance it does work. Do you feel lucky?EDIT: So i may have judged this problem too fast before really looking into it. It works fine for me now and another 2 hours into the game i do think have an explanation.So it seems like the Nvidia Trubulance feature caused the constant crashes, which is kind of weird because i have n Nvidia GTX 970. So by deactivating the feature it didnt crash on me again. So basically what the problem seems to be for Nvidia card owner is that the function itself causes some kind of problem and thus creating the crashes. And i guess alot of ppl don't have that problem because the have AMD card's and this feature is in general turned off? I don't really know, that is just my guess.Anyways.....having a lot of fun playing it. For Dark Souls fans a nice  treat ;)			"

												While the game has some potential, poor level design and constant crashes make this a game to avoid. Yet another game sadly ruined by an extemely buggy release! Even after supposedly patching to improve stability the game still crashes to desktop roughly every 5 minutes if i'm lucky, making it almost unplayable. The combat system is very good and for the most part feels pretty fair, though unless you want to add misery onto the already frustrating bug filled experience that is Lords of the fallen stay away from the rogue until you really know the game. The story, while a little thin so far at least makes an attempt at a story, though the over-use of copy paste makes for some very average level design. The voice acting is pretty bad as is the lip-syncing for the characters as is the in-scene animation, which feels comically wooden. I want to like this game, I really do, but sadly the game feels rushed to release and incomplete. Maybe when the stability problems are fixed I may revisit this game but at the moment I don't think so. My advice, wait until it's been patched... A LOT and wait till it is in a sale if you really want a fix while waiting for Bloodborne.			"

If you loved Dark Souls as much as I did and you want a simpler and more western Soul-like RPG I think this is the game for you.

												Was never going to live up to the Dark Souls comparisons. In some ways it's a mix of Dark Souls and Dark Siders, which has really nice results at times. I had a lot of fun with this, and the game looks great - especially all the gear you find. Two major gripes: 1) some kind of control glitch meant that about half the time I wanted to do a leaping attack, simply jumped and rolled. Super annoying. 2) I don't have a problem with short games, and this one isn't, really, but on the other hand I still felt like the content was a bit skimpy. Most of the enemies get heavily reused, and much of the game is stretched out by having you go back through previous areas. I only remember there being 5 or 6 main areas to the game.In all, it's a fun game, but certainly not worth full price. Worth grabbing if it's on sale for $5-10.7/10			"

												Lords of the Fallen is Buggy and has problems with the framerate. But that is okay, i like these kind of games and i want to give this game a chance.Lord of the Fallen is buggy and doors or chests randomly don't open or the message that they are closed is missing, colloision detection is somewhat spotty here and there. But that is okay, you can find a solution to one and can work around the other.Lord of Fallen has a bit spotty design and the enemys turn sometimes DURING their attacks folowing you with an attack that clearly should be an opneing for you as the player to counter them. Sigh okey, i am now 15 hours in, let us get trough this.Lord of the Fallen can.. stand in the corner of shame, because it crashed twice, both times at the same boss and both times when the boss was down to around one fifth of his/it's lifes.Lord of the Fallen can GO HOME YOU ARE DRUNK because i couldn't really play around a bit and improve my stats because the game forced you into an boss encounter (or perhabs a door was again bugged out because there were some, but i couldn't open them) where i needed this because i was a bit rushing forward and slightly too much too weak for this boss.This forced me into a boss fight that took me around 30 MINUTES for the most successfull of many goes at him where i chipping away tiny pieces of his life.The Boss was down to one sixth of his health WHEN IT CRASHED AGAIN!We have Dark Souls (started), Dark Souls 2 (not touched yet), Dragons Dogma (started) and soon Dark Souls 3 on Steam.Don't buy this buggy mess of a game and get those. Seriously. Lords of the Fallen... to the Bugs... i guess.			"

												This game is an amazing Rune....Almost no game is completely perfect.  This game is not perfect by any means of the imagination.  However, this game has some amazing maps, monsters and difficult challenges.Pros - The graphics are super sweet!!  I played this at 2560x1440p with a G-sync IPS  monitor and averaged between 80-100 FPS most the game.  The game looks fantastic- The monsters in this game are really fun to fight (not to mention they have cool names).  You fight people like the Beast, Champion, Annhialater, Worshipper, Guardian, etc... and they range in difficulties, but are all fun to fight!- The controls are good.  Some people complain that sometimes you hit someone and it doesn't register.  This is true, but it doesn't happen very often.- The loot system is nice because you can carry endless amounts of items.  However, you still have to be careful how much you are actively carying, because this will cause you to become overcumbered.  - Once you beat the game, you restart and can select a different area of magic and you keep your XP and weapons, abilities, spells, etc.. and play again.  This time the monsters are really difficult and it really feels like you are starting over!- It's not Dark Souls- Got this on sale for $9.99 (worth every penny)Cons - When I first started playing this game, it crashed on me a few times.  When it crashed, I lost an hours worth of saved XP and almost rage quit the game completely.  After the first few stages, it never crashed again!- In two of the portal (challenge areas) areas, I immediatley died when going in there and my XP simply vanished!  I was so upset, that I found a youtube video to farm experience to get my XP back.  Take that game!!! - Lesson learned, be careful when going into the portal challenge areas!- Voice acting is laughable.  The story isn't very good either, but you will meet fun people along the way that help you stay engaged throughout the story.- Not really a con, but sometimes you will get stuck trying to find an objective and you will run around for long times trying to find out where to go next.Summary - Buy this game if you want to have an awesome experience in an open world RPG.  Yes it does have its own issues, but if you like Dark Souls, then you will like this game.  It's great!  I'm really hoping they make a Lords of the Fallen 2!!!!			"

												It's hard to talk about Lords of the Fallen with out immediately comparing it to Dark Souls, both are 3rd person ARPGs in medieval settings with stamina driven combat; at a quick glance LotF seems like little more than your standard Souls-like, but there are multiple things that seperate it from DkS both good and bad.First I'd like to talk about what LotF does right, and that's its interesting take on risk/reward; while playing you will notice that every kill increases an experience multiplier, this multiplier lasts until you either die or activate one of the games checkpoints. This incourages you to be a bit reckless and make decisions on whether you want to play it safe or push on and reap more rewards. This system is made even more risky by the fact that when you die you have a limited ammount of time to recover your experience before it starts to decrease, meaning that skipping checkpoints not only makes survival riskier since you won't be  replenish your consumables it makes recovering your experience a bit of a risk since you might spawn several multiple checkpoints from where you died and will need to fight your way back as fast as you can.When the system works it's incredibly satisfying, and if LotF was fast paced and fluid as it's inspiration it could have made the game an instant classic. Unfortunately LotF feels incredibly slow and clunky, which in turn makes every encounter feel like a labored effort; but I will come back to that later.In order to understand what exactly keeps LotF from being a great game I think you need to look at what makes DkS a great game. Souls games are known for being difficult and throwing a variety of challenges at you; what it is also known for is giving you an incredible array of tools and choices to deal with these challenges. It's this freedom to face challenges any way you'd like with any number of possible strategies that keeps DkS feeling fresh and appealing to such a wide base. LotF however doesn't do this at all... Instead from the very beginning of the game LotF feels like it is constantly bottlenecking you into using specific strategies and character builds.Between it's unchangable class choices, its stong emphasis on balanced upgrades over min-maxing just so you can use your class abilities, and it's lack of weapon upgrades and minimal stat scaling forcing you into using heavy weapons just to deal enough damage to keep up with enemy health levels and healing LotF constantly feels like it is forcing you to play in a pretty specific ways; and unfortunately those ways aren't really all that fun.You are left between min-maxing to make the most of your damage and survival odds or dropping all your experience into spells/faith to make use of your class; you are given the choice of using fast weapons that do very little damage against enemies, some of which can heal faster than you can deal damage, or use high damage weapons that can take out enemies but are insanely slow and leave you open to be staggered constantly. The end result is a slow and clunky process that never really manages to make you feel like you are making meaningful choices instead of simply putting experience where the game wants you to, and that's ultimately what makes LotF feel so unfulfilling.

												Lords Of The Fallen™.Also known as ""What if Dark Souls had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cousin"" and ""What's optimization?""The frame rate is bad, The V-sync is horrible because instead of dropping frames when there is some heavy effects (just some fire or more than one enemy) the game will jump from a locked 60fps to 30fps, if you disable v-sync the tearing is unbelievable.the game is slow, there is no character creation, only 3 classes, i started as warrior and i had fat roll from the start, enemies are easy, you can backstab everything from the start except bosses. when you block an enemy attack they go back flying like they hit a wall or something.There is a lot of naration in this game, and music, you can't skip the monologue of some old dude when you pick up some items.The Story is... i don't know.You can't fall of ledges or hit a wall when fighting in a small room.The character menu can be accessed while fighting, you can also pause.This game is really special, i got this game for $1,60 so please if you want the game for some reason, don't buy itfor more than 5$ because i don't think it's worth more.

												If you've played Dark Souls, you know that the game's calling card isn't that it's hard, but it's a very fair game. When you die, it's your fault and you don't feel cheated.Lords of the Fallen takes the core mechanics of Dark Souls and adds a bit. The graphics are beautiful, the added roleplaying aspect is neat. But at the end of the day, the core mechanics that it stole from Dark Souls are implemented weakly. Hit boxes are awful. I haven't died once where I thought ""Okay, that's my fault I got greedy/hasty"". The problem is always the mechanics killing you. And that is not a good game.Lords of the Fallen tries to be a Dark Souls clone and gets everything about it's inspiration horribly, unappologetically wrong. It's difficult for the sake of being difficult so the designers can say ""We made a hard game."" 4/10, because the graphics are beautiful and that's really the only redeeming quality of the game. I'll be requesting a refund.			"

Posted: November 5, 2014
												Short summary: A linear dark souls style RPG with a more direct narrative but glaring issues in combat balance, general stability & performance and unfair AI.In depth:Combat felt unfair despite being told enemies follow the same rules as the player, it did not feel like that in any shape or form. At times it'd be laughably easy circle strafing enemies to backstab them and other times enemies would treat your shield as if it were made of paper because you went the wrong way.Finding where to go boils down to trial and error, did that enemy kill you in 2 hits? Try somewhere else in this bland landscape to explore, it's difficult to get your bearings when so much of the environment looks the same.Performance wise I am running the game with 2 Nvidia GTX760's on SLI and am seldom seeing the framerate go over 40, it sticks in the 30-35 range for most of the time. Animations on enemies looking very jarring at times, stuttering as they moved in combat with me, taking me out of the experience entirely.side note:A potential fix for Nvidia users is to switch physx control over to CPU instead of your GPU, doing this got me an extra 10fps though your mileage may vary.Addition:I gave the game another chance and shortly after the 3rd boss and its convuluted tactics I encountered an enemy that used a grab attack on me, which then caused my character to fall through the floor of the game and land into a room below of which there was no way out as the door could only be opened from the other side. I had no choice but to quit the game, losing my progress.In closing this looks and feels like a Dark souls clone trying to jump on the bandwagon before it even got rolling. With the horrible issues in combat, exploration, bugs/glitches and optimisation, I would not recommend playing it at all in this state.			"

												I'd just like to open by saying I'm a huge Dark Souls fan, and that fundamentally, I enjoy this game.  It does a lot of things right, but given it's marketed directly to Dark Souls players, I feel a warning is due.I'm gonna start with the good.The game looks and sounds /fantastic/.  The VFX engine is absolutely gorgeous, even on lower graphics settings, and for a next gen game, it runs fairly well on aging hardware, with some small FPS hiccups.  On top of that, as an audiophile, the sound downright thrills me.  It's deep, punchy, and weighty - armour and chains rattle realistically, a weapon striking metal lets out an endlessly satisfying 'clang', and the soundtrack is excellent.  It's also got a massive variety of interesting weapons and armour - less variety than Dark Souls, but there's something here for most playstyles, and with items of varying rarity on top of random rune cards, the game has, functionally, a more complex loot system than Dark Souls.  Some may not like this, but I'm a sucker for random loot.  It also adds some interesting gameplay mechanics - the game rewards you for going long periods of time without saving by granting you a progressively increasing XP multiplier and improved loot drops for every enemy you kill without accessing a checkoint, but it also discourages checkpoint-scumming by making it so that checkpoints can only fill your health and replenish your health items a certain number of times before needing time to recharge.But you can see the big red thumbs-down up there, so it's time to get to the bad.This game is harder than Dark Souls.  Not more challenging, just harder, and this is due to a large number of lazy, shortsighted, and downright perplexing design decisions.  This is a game that wants to be like Dark Souls, but didn't study the source material carefully enough.  Boss arenas are littered with rubble you can get hung up on and plants that can obscure your view.  All enemies can spin on point to face you without any intervening animation, making maneuvering around them nearly impossible outside the designated 'attack windows' - this is a massive pain when it comes to fighting enemies with shields.  The lock-on system has far too short a range, making keeping larger boss enemies at a distance very difficult, because your lock will drop and your camera will snap to something else seemingly at random as you back off.  Some bosses have tiny crash boxes that make no sense - the ankles of the Beast boss are the worst offender.  Some enemy design makes absolutely no sense.  Slippery rogue enemies can sponge hits while tanky guys with tower shields go down in three.  Fat, bloated enemies that look about five hundred pounds can nimbly dodge and evade your attacks, while effortlessly breaking your block with a single floaty punch.  And that's not even going into the game's poor writing, story, and mediocre voice acting that inexplicably varies from louder than normal to barely audible.To wrap things up, I personally enjoy this game, but I have a habit of liking bad games, and this one frustrates the /hell/ out of me.  In Dark Souls, I always kept playing because my death was my mistake, while I find myself frequently ragequitting from Lords of the Fallen because the game has done something stupid and it's gotten me killed.  Fundamentally, it's got some solid ideas, and it's outstanding in a few areas - I find myself genuinely enjoying the time between boss fights - but its poor enemy design and frequent mistakes in other areas make said boss fights an absolute chore.TL;DR: Good in places, but blindingly frustrating in others, Lords of the Fallen can only be recommended to those with the patience to put up with the poor choices made by the developers.

												I played this game at a friends house on the console, and when the Steam Summer Sale started I picked this up at what I would consider a somewhat good deal. However, everything didn't go to plan and I ended up refunding the game pretty quickly, my short rundown...The Good: For one, this game looks beautiful. One of the prettiest games I've ever seen, and the artistic style of the world, its inhabitants, and the gear are great. The performance was  also really good given the amount of visuals the game pushes. The gameplay itself (which strongly resembles the Demon/Dark Souls style) was also fun, with its own quirks compared to other games out there. I actually liked the leveling system for a game like this, and the interface (although not the most keyboard friendly) was really helpful telling me what I needed.The Bad: As of June 16th, the day this was written, I just couldn't get over the crashes from this game. What's worse, when you crash you'll be left off the last save crystal you used. When a feature of the game is NOT to use them to build up a monster  multiplier for the equivalent of bonus XP, a crash is devastating. In addition, I noticed a ton of odd audio anomalies with the game. Voices were never a consistant volume, and it didn't seem audio positioning was done very well either. The voice acting of the game was...not so great, and the lip sync wasn't that great either. Your character's attitude seems a bit silly at times, and overall the story was a bit hit and miss.I really want to like this game, and if it didn't have so many problems I think it could've been a really fun game. But my time in game was spent redoing everything I had just done due to crashes, coupled with the fact that the game didn't really seem to entice me to push the story forward, something the Souls series does fantastically.At this time, I can't give a solid recommendation for the game, but it's definitely on my list of games to revisit in the future, because it seems like this could have good potential.

												FINAL EDIT: OK, so finished it finally and actually giving NG+ a whirl. The pure garbage comment was just rude and i take it back. However, this is still not a recommended game. Anyone reading this, disregard everything below these pros and cons. Pros: - Nice visual style, very attractive at first glance - Some good choices along the way that are recapped when you complete the game in a sequence that i found oddly emotional  - If you want a Souls game with a more gothic/germanic feel, this might be something to look into- Some nice ideas like the gauntlet and magic Cons: - Nice graphics that hardly ever change and get boring quick: no diversity in environments, characters, effects - Painfully slow and cumbersome combat - Ludicrously maze-like levels that are just annoying, not interesting to explore, like someone did this on purpose to be an A-hole rather than with thought- Really much harder than Souls games as there is no summoning others for help and most players will be lucky to have 6-7 health potions by the end of NG. This leads to lots of frustration without reward, as some of the bosses make the worst Souls bosses look like child's play- Bad camera system and collision detection- Iffy target lock on - Relatively short story at around 30 hours compared to the 70-80 you get out of a similarly priced Souls game - Tons of gear that makes little to no difference- Leveling up also barely makes a difference beyond a very early point - Unfairly tailored to a very specific character build that makes the game much easier. Other builds this game is a nightmareOverall 5/10, do not get it unless it's heavily discounted and you're really craving this type of experienceEDIT: this game is pure garbage, so buyer beware. It's like the purely annoying version of Dark Souls. If you want the full review, read on, otherwise avoid. After 30 hours decided it was simply not worth it anymore. The entire game, and you can see this via YouTube videos, was designed for one build: warrior, rage spell, two handed greatsword. With that all the bosses are a cakewalk. Any other build and this♥♥♥♥♥♥is ten times harder than any Souls game, minus all the good parts. Avoid even if someone gives it to you as a gift. Got this on release day, which was like ten months ago...and can't bring myself to sit down and finish it because it's borderline boring. Still manages to be somewhat compelling, but just imagine all the difficulty of a Souls game minus the intrigue, mystery, reward, fluidity, natural exploration...and pretty much every other positive aspect. This is like a soulles (pun intended) copy of a Souls game done by an AI. Mind you i haven't had any major technical issues with this game, and don't understand why people say it's easier than Souls/Bloodborne. It's actually harder, there are very few bonfires/safe places, enemies respawn endelessly, you typically can only carry very few health potions, your guy Harykn feels like he's a tank wading through maple syrup even with light gear and high agility, and the map design is just convoluted: not interesting, not challenging, not lending itself to exploration. Just random maze-like, as I said, something an AI with no imagination would design because it was told to ""make it difficult and reallly not linear"". Sorry Deck 13, I'd say nice try but it isn't nice, it's the very epitome of mediocre.			"

												I feel like I can safely review this after just a few hours.  If you've ever played any of the Souls games then you'll get the combat system right away.  I didn't even need the tutorial and the keybinds for a controller are literally the same as Souls with a few minor exceptions due to spells.  If you enjoyed the combat system of the Souls games then you'll enjoy Lords.  If you are coming here looking for an epic story then turn around...the story is the weakest part of the game.  It doesn't give you that feeling of dread like the Souls games do.Graphics are outstanding, as are the combat animations.  You can safely run this game at 30 fps on high settings with a last gen video card (i.e. nvidia gtx 660 minimum).  Difficulty is something to be desired.  I cleared 2 major bosses without breaking a sweat or dying once.  I still have not died after a few hours of gameplay.  The game is a tad difficult in the first hour but quickly gets easier as you pump points into stamina so you can swing that sword like 20 times and the monster doesn't have a chance. As for the price...well here is where I disagree.  Its a full priced AAA game that has no multiplayer mode.  So what will happen is you'll spend 15-20 hrs completing the campaign then just do it again on the same toon to level up all your stats; fans of the souls series will know what I'm referring to here.   If you can, wait until a steam sale when its half off, then it'll be worth your time.  I still reccomend it right now though if you're a fan of action rpg's and you have some throw away cash.			"

Enemies have tremendous power, speed, stamina and move lists, some being just frustrating to fight. It started off looking promising but by the last boss i was just playing to finish the game. They try to encorpate a ""open"" based story but i found my self confused by some of the side quests as well as the main one. Over all alot of good ideas here but not exicuted well. "

												Fortunately you don't need more than two hours of gameplay to notice that this game, in fact, shares much with Dark Souls. The bad stuff, not the good - just in time to get that refund, though.- A constant barrage of glitches and issues with performance and rendering. This game uses nVidia PhysX and other bull$hit libraries, making it barely playable for both nVidia and AMD users from what I saw on the forums while trying to make it work. Nice job, nVidia. You did it again. Weird shadow artifacts made the game painful to look at. Graphics settings are almost non-existent, like on a botched console port. Various things, along with anti-aliasing, are hidden in a global ""postprocessing"" setting, and the game doesn't even try to explain what that might cover. No matter which graphics setting I changed, it always ended up rendering in a different way, seemingly random, but always worse than before. Even when moving from lower to higher settings, even when playing with anisotropic filtering multiplier, which isn't a very noticeable or GPU intensive feature, made this game looking worse and worse. I stopped trying when it started to look like upscaled 720p (except for the interface), just as if it decreased the rendering resolution, which isn't even an option.- Combat is painfully, unimaginably slow. Comparisons to Souls or Monster Hunter or other titles couldn't even begin to shed light on this. I cannot grasp how anyone could even compare this to Darksiders or any other action adventure game. I was very critical of many games that deliberately try to be difficult and frustrating (as opposed to challenging) by implementing archaic nintendohard / ""i will gobble all your arcade coins"" gameplay design, but this title takes the cake. It just takes your gaming instincts and turns them upside-down, and not in a good way. Your character's starting stamina only allows you to make three or four attacks with your weapon before before being depleted, which is suicide, because you need it to block and dodge. You are discouraged from using even the most basic triple hit combo. Your character's combat animations are so slow that the best approach is to use just a single strike against enemies that may retaliate. And they often do, because unlike you, most of them aren't staggered into a stupor when receiving damage. Dodging doesn't make much sense, because it leaves you open to damage while moving you in a single direction with the speed of walking. I'm not joking, you just tumble on the ground like a headless corpse. You might experiment for a while and try to guess if you should start dodging just before the enemy strikes you, during their attack, or maybe just before it connects. You will observe that during a single dodge animation your enemy will be able to attack you more than once, rendering dodging useless. Blocking isn't much better, as two or three hits in the shield (or even a single one in case of bosses) will completely break your stamina, sending you flying to the nearest wall or to the ground, open to attack. It all seems to be a very very hard try at making the game ""gritty"" and ""realistic"", at the same time allowing your enemies to swing giant blades and gargantuan two handed warhammers with the speed of a fine rapier*. I get it, you're fighting some demonic monsters, but I can't help feeling like half of the people that play this game would be a far better warrior than the antihero that we are supposed to play AS, at least in terms of speed and stamina.- Hit detection in this game is a mystery. Either the developer doesn't know what ""hit detection"" or ""hit box"" means or simply doesn't care*. Flaming blades will swing whole feet above your head and deal damage to you either way. Meanwhile you will gaze upon your weapon's model clearly clipping through enemies without any reaction on their side. It's like the de facto area of effect of each attack (either yours or your enemies) is one thing and the attack animation is something else entirely, just a symbolic visual representation. This is simply atrocious.- Clearly stolen from Dark Souls is the cherished mechanic of the player losing all unspent experience points upon death*. Then you are return to the last checkpoint and given a chance to reaquire you ""lost soul"" so to speak and recover the lost XP, for which there is always a time limit*.- Enemies are bullet sponges, because there is no better way to increase a game's difficulty than making the player repeat succesful control inputs over and over again*.- Enemies respawn infinitely, because who doesn't love grinding?- After defeating a boss or a tough fight there is that masochistic feel of accomplishment that Souls fans crave, but in this title's case it is washed away by feelings of lost time, like completing a joyless chore that won't amount to anything in the end. It just doesn't feel FUN, it never does.- Voice acting is very uneven - sometimes good, sometimes atrocious. Some written text fragments have weird syntax or other mistakes, which leads me to believe that the english version of this game wasn't proofread by native speakers. This ruins immersion and makes plot difficult to enjoy.*Because going out of your way to make a game difficult and unnatural to play and impossible to progress without flawless execution means FUN, as you give the player a chance to feel like a champion for braving your bad design and botched mechanics.tl;dr - if you're a hardcore elite fromdrone Souls fan then definitely try this game, you should like it if you like everything about Souls. If you're just looking for a challenging game to master then I suggest you look elsewhere. Beat DOOM on Ultra Nightmare, Spec Ops: The Line on FUBAR, Darksiders II on Apocalyptic, Devil Daggers, Triple Frozen Crown on Pillars of Eternity, do all Arkham City achievements, whatever. This game just doesn't offer any fun for a multitude of reasons.			"

												Love the setting and the lore, but the Dark Souls inspired gameplay falls just short in the most crucial area - the combat. Somehow I never felt in full control which led to many cheap, cheap deaths.  Game crashed a bunch of times too.  Still, if you've finished all the Dark Souls games and are looking for similar gameplay in a more traditional medieval-European fantasy setting, this is worth a look.			"

												It's hard to talk about Lords of the Fallen with out immediately comparing it to Dark Souls, both are 3rd person ARPGs in medieval settings with stamina driven combat; at a quick glance LotF seems like little more than your standard Souls-like, but there are multiple things that seperate it from DkS both good and bad.First I'd like to talk about what LotF does right, and that's its interesting take on risk/reward; while playing you will notice that every kill increases an experience multiplier, this multiplier lasts until you either die or activate one of the games checkpoints. This incourages you to be a bit reckless and make decisions on whether you want to play it safe or push on and reap more rewards. This system is made even more risky by the fact that when you die you have a limited ammount of time to recover your experience before it starts to decrease, meaning that skipping checkpoints not only makes survival riskier since you won't be  replenish your consumables it makes recovering your experience a bit of a risk since you might spawn several multiple checkpoints from where you died and will need to fight your way back as fast as you can.When the system works it's incredibly satisfying, and if LotF was fast paced and fluid as it's inspiration it could have made the game an instant classic. Unfortunately LotF feels incredibly slow and clunky, which in turn makes every encounter feel like a labored effort; but I will come back to that later.In order to understand what exactly keeps LotF from being a great game I think you need to look at what makes DkS a great game. Souls games are known for being difficult and throwing a variety of challenges at you; what it is also known for is giving you an incredible array of tools and choices to deal with these challenges. It's this freedom to face challenges any way you'd like with any number of possible strategies that keeps DkS feeling fresh and appealing to such a wide base. LotF however doesn't do this at all... Instead from the very beginning of the game LotF feels like it is constantly bottlenecking you into using specific strategies and character builds.Between it's unchangable class choices, its stong emphasis on balanced upgrades over min-maxing just so you can use your class abilities, and it's lack of weapon upgrades and minimal stat scaling forcing you into using heavy weapons just to deal enough damage to keep up with enemy health levels and healing LotF constantly feels like it is forcing you to play in a pretty specific ways; and unfortunately those ways aren't really all that fun.You are left between min-maxing to make the most of your damage and survival odds or dropping all your experience into spells/faith to make use of your class; you are given the choice of using fast weapons that do very little damage against enemies, some of which can heal faster than you can deal damage, or use high damage weapons that can take out enemies but are insanely slow and leave you open to be staggered constantly. The end result is a slow and clunky process that never really manages to make you feel like you are making meaningful choices instead of simply putting experience where the game wants you to, and that's ultimately what makes LotF feel so unfulfilling.

												seriously how bad can dark souls be that people dont see terrible game design so hard that they try to copy it. uninturruptable animations of every sort make the entire game slow and clunky just like dark souls.. etc . weapon legths seem to change depending upon the millisecond their swing so no attack is a gauranteed hit. why is there no diaganal roll its either forward left right or backward no diaganal this has killed me far too many times too count. there is no way to get behind enemies with shields unless their stuck in their own animation loops otherwise if you kind of get behind them they will spin a full 180 degrees in less time then it takes a neuron to fire. there are good elements here so long as there were not so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t elements to bring down gameplay experince.

												Bought this on sale (fall 2015), thoughts after 7 hours in:I am an average Souls player and i finished them all (all Dark/Demon/Bloodborne).TLDR: Has great graphics and sound, gameplay feels very clunky and not all hits connect - 7/10 - get it on sale, WORTH trying.I somehow like the feel of the game. Weapons feel heavy, and heavy armor slows you down. Combat is sufficiently diverse with guard brakes, parries, charges, dual wield chained combos - fun for everyone.But at the same time, this clunky-ness makes it really hard to progress and fight what this game throws at you. I can currently face two bosses which i am very underpowered against (Champion and Infiltrator).And common enemies are... not unbeatable, but just too hard to beat, so grinding them would take all the pacience in the world. They hide behind huge shields and are always locked-on on you. it's very difficult to get behind them or get an opening to hit them. And when you do get that small window of opportunity, your moves are either too slow to hit (big strength weapons) or do little damage (fast agility weapons). So you just have to grind those moments, and enemies can feel like a grind on their own.The game just doesn't make all the effort feel worthy. Maybe it's just me, maybe i'm way underleveled, maybe i'm missing something... But i might not want to complete this game.Maybe others would want to. So yeah, Recommended !LE: 16h in - game finished. chosing agility build may not have been the best idea, but i wasn't looking for an easy game :D rating still 7/10			"

I have two Radeon R9 290x cards in Crossfire and it typically held around 45 - 50 fps.I really enjoyed this game, it was challenging but fair. Usually when I died it was when I was spamming attacks instead of calmly and smartly fighting through situations.

												After more then a year (or is it 2 now?) it is STILL bugged, STILL crashes and really, now that DS 3 is out, if you want a hard dark fantasy game, get that.Gameplay is fine, however there are some major flaws that this type of game really shouldn't have!- Enemy Tracking: What I mean by this is that enemies basiclly always face you once they spotted you. They insta turn and face you. You can't role around them or walk around them unless they are stuck in an animation. however as soon as the animation is over they will be facing you again.- Shield / Faith beats everything. This is basiclly just a balancing problem, however it is pretty severe. You have next to no reason to go light armor dodge focus builds (sure there are a few attacks that you can't block / aren't worth blocking but you can still dodge no problem on medium weight. Blocking and heavy/medium armor (you don't want fat-role) is the way to go with strength builds and then there is faith builds that just make the game a walk in the park (though a really slow one).- The platforming (thank god there really isn't too much) is horrendous. - Lots of bossfights and enemies are really samy and just a test of patience. As in they have a few attack patterns and one of them leaves them really vulnerable (Hmmm, when should I attack the boss... me no understand).Worth mentioning though is that the graphics are great if your machine can handle it and the atmosphere is rather spot on.The Combat mechanics are while not flawless definitly good other then the above mentioned. Great Animations aswell.Maybe get it if its reduced price if you really want another dark fantasy game. "

Calling LotF bad in a world where No Mans Sky and The Division exist is simply asinine. LotF is flawed but still fun. And damn is it pretty.I thought we would have heard more of the sequel by now, so Im worried it might have gotten canned.

												Lords of the Fallen had, and may still have great potential, but technical flaws and not enough unique takes, leave it a little behind the competition.Pros:-Great visuals, effects, and combat system-Amazing looking armor and weapons, and other loot, await you right from the start-Engaging properly spaced Boss fights-Heavy deep dungeon Dark Souls Esq feel-I really can't stress how fun the combat is, it might not have as much content to it as Dark Souls, but it feels better, swings really have weight to them, your character can feel really badass at times.-Interesting areas, enviroments that really draw you in, even if you may not 100% understand where you are sometimes.-Replayable at least 2 or 3 times.Cons:-Heavy technical flaws on launch, numerous crashes randomly and on launching the game, low FPS on high end systems, save file corruption, game breaking bugs, and option settings not saving if you don't use a controller to set them. These are the biggest problem with Lords of The Fallen right now for many people.-No difficulty adjustment, some people love an insanely hard challenge, others might find it too easy, but regardless you don't have a choice in the matter, which will be frustrating to some. Sometimes enemies can be cheap, a lot of the ""difficulty"" can be an illusion. One example is many stronger normals or boss enemies can just outright kill you, they are almost always AOE spells or abilities that if hit, will automatically end your life and wipe all progress from last checkpoint.-Game can get generic at times, lacking  standout customization, magic, etc...and the variety on these isn't that high.-A little short-Easy to get lost without any sense of direction, and the objectives don't update enough for you to tell if you are on the right path; this leads to a lot of backtracking and aimless wandering.Summarrize:4.5/10 The technical flaws, generic feel, and especially the lack of any navigation system or sense of direction are the biggest downfalls with this game, that being said there is a decent game underneath here if the dev follows through on fixing the heavy technical problems of the PC version. Right now I would say if you want to try this game, wait. I mean you can wait and both get it on sale later, and after the kinks have been ironed out if at all.I can thumbs up this, but only barely. The developers have released two patches already, so if they follow through and get the game to a more playable state... Well, there is a good game underneath, it just needs to be pulled out yet.Additional Questions:Is the game minimize friendly? No.Is the game Steam Overlay friendly? Sometimes.Stong Chormatic Abrretion? Yes, but can be disabled but you must disable all Post Processing FX.EDIT: I had to come back and lower my review to a negative this time. About 3 bosses from the end of the game, it just ♥♥♥♥ed up my save file when I died, so I now have to delete it and start the entire game all over again, which after this dreadful experience, I am not doing.This game has been a nightmare of tech problems, which is a shame, because there was a good game in here, beneath terrible level design, difficulty imbalance, and the many many MANY tech problems.Other people have had similar problems, the bugs are not small, they are game breaking/ending, as in you hit a bug thats it, game over, delete and restart all over again:http://fextralife.com/forums/t39758/stuck-in-a-pit-in-the-catacombs/ "

												I Would recommend this game. However its broken. I'm 6-7 hours in and I cant progress because my mana meter stopped recharging itself, crippling my ability to progress in the game. You have to leave an area using your magic, if you have no mana you cant leave this area. This is a known problem and if I want to finish the game, or in fact do anything else, I have to start over with a new character. SOOOOOO what the **** developers? Fix this game, like yesterday!			"

												This is a challenging game, but it is fun. I am still progresing through it. I think the visuals and gameplay are pretty good. I don'tknow much about the developers, but from what I can tell they put a tremedious amout of thought in the game. The game, It make me explore the different abilities my character had to defeat enemies. I feel good when I fight and win.If you are reading this, give it a try. If you like single player games and melee style fighting, you might like this game. I bought several games on sale this fall, but this may be my most favorite.			"

												It starts off feeling like Dark Souls, but later takes those game mechanics and creates something else with it.  The game starts off somewhat difficult, feeling under-powered, and enemies hit hard; and areas that seem gated by your level to keep you from going in that direction until you're ready (catacombs early on really showed me how weak I was).However, it get's easier pretty early on as well.  I started play as a cleric type, and once I had enough points into the Daze spell, things just got a little too easy, especially bosses.  Dying became irrelevant , as fidning potions to recover your ghost after death were plentiful, as well as attribute/spell point shards to increase your stats even more.  I think I finished with 20 VIT, 30 Faith, and 20 End, wearing the Fallen armor set and wielding a massive club, making end game bosses a joke.New Game + was a pleasant suprise, as I found the enemies scaled very well to it, though the bosses were still pretty simple.  I tried being a rogue for NG+, but with the amount of experience needed for a single attribute point becoming increasingly expensive, I relied mostly on those attribute/spell point shards to boost my stats.The story telling was done in a way that I like, picking up audio notes to listen to the lore as I fought, instead of finding a note and having to read it to take away from the action.  The story, overall, was pretty decent in my opinion, and with the audio notes found, it gives you a deeper understanding of the world and just what it is that has happened/is happening.  The one part of the lore I would like to see expanded upon is the main character, Harkyn.  I don't know what sins or crimes he has committed in the past, but his face, if one could understand it, tells the tale.  The only thing I can gather is that he was a soldier, as the captain you meet in the game knows Harkyn, and vice-versa.Decent story, solid mechanics, and fun gameplay; I recommend this for anyone who is a, ""Souls,"" fan, though don't look for an exact clone, but a game that took many elements from the series and expanded upon them in it's own way.

												Very good game altough a little rough around the edges and could use some work and hopefully will with its sequal. For those playing this game I advise turning off the PhysX. For me it worked fine in most parts but in places where snow fell or sparks flew the game would somtimes lag and disabling Physx fixed this.			"

												One of the best games of this type especially if you are new to the genre. this style of combat and complexity comes from the original Demon souls but it is definitely made a lot easier for this game. however I still found myself dying quite a lot and enjoying every single minute of it! Brilliant visuals along with brilliant gameplay make for what i think is quite an underrated game!If you are keen to get into the Dark souls genre and are not patient enough to deal with the huge amount of dying involved then i would say this is a great choice. The visuals are definitely better than Dark Souls 1 on PC so you will enjoy the gorgeous environments regardless. On another note I have now stepped up my game and just bought Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the first sin so I am preparing myself to Die and die I shall lol.			"

												Game worked fine, smooth on i5 @ 4.6 GHz/R9 290 OC'd a tad from factory.Played till first boss, got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥my shield is useless since can't block 2 attacks back to back. Can't stagger the boss, so he'll always hit even if I hit first.Character is way too slow to get between boss attacks, I assume the rogue option is fast and would actually work.Why have slow classes then? I dunno, only got to the first boss.This game isn't about action, it's about patience. I don't have the patience for it.Not what I expected given reviews of epix battlez. It's an annoying dance where your char is too slow to react.(So many times I'd be like ""DODGE YOU @$&%"" and Manly McManman would be busy moving at the speed of smell to get slapped by a giant sword for 21 damage nbd)Game not for me, may not be for you either. Looks nice though. Voice acting/faces a bit funny. Attempted to be real, but not real enough to succeed at illusion.May attempt in couple months when I forget what I thought about the game.			"

												For those who greatly enjoy the hardcore combat RPG genre introduced with the Dark Souls series, this game delivers!  It's a tremendous improvement in discoverable weapon abilities and combat styles that counter every type of enemy you face.  Secrets, puzzles, and quests everywhere you turn - just be careful, because that next turn could be deadly.You should already be used to death...lots of it.  It will happen often, and even more than you think possible.  But it's part of the game, and definitely part of discovering how to complete each area you find.Character customization is unique, yet familiar, and even the experience you earn has some very interesting and appealling uses - besides just leveling up your characters.  There are times where you'll be battling that desire to spend your experience, or hold onto it...this can be a tough choice!For anyone new to this style of gaming, you must come to terms with the fact that dying is part of the game.  For those who already know and understand it, you won't be disappointed!			"

												Score: 6.5/10It's a much easier Dark Souls, but doesn't have near the same polish. I'm on the fence with it, but I would still give it a thumbs up if only slightly. It teases multiple playthroughs, but once was enough. There's a lot to like here, but it feels a bit half-baked at times. It's a strange game that wants to let you explore and then punishes you by doing something cheap, and it's not as rewarding once you've overcome it. On the other hand, it's not nearly as frustrating as Dark Souls can be.- You'll get hit through walls and see all manner of glitchy things.- You'll face enemies that will use cheap tactics to land hits on you. - You will find the yo-yo difficulty to be hard and then easy, then difficult again. - You will find the gear to be mostly useless.- Exploration isn't too rewarding.- The risk/reward system is a joke. Saving up kill streaks to earn more XP is barely noticeable.Get it on sale and play it over a weekend.			"

												I'm ambivalent about recommending this game.Taken on its own as an action rpg, it is a solid offering with reasonable difficulty, and moderate plot, with good mechanics.The problem is that it is trying to take Dark Souls and make it a little more approachable, which I actually think it does well enough. However, this makes me realize that when you make concessions about difficulty and playability, you can end up with a much worse game.I absolutely loved Dark Souls, and this game pales in comparison, which is why I have some trouble recommending this game. DKS has a fully continuous world, where LoF uses area transitions to allow for better graphics. However, I still think the asthetics of DKS is better.Admittedly, LoF has a coherent story that is delivered to the player, but I actually liked the obfuscation of the story in Dark Souls, and it made the moral choice not just ambiguous, but also not readily apparent.I would have tried to review the game in the absence of my knowledge of Dark Souls, but it's just not possible for me to do so, so I tried to compare as best as possible.In short, I think it was good, though I haven't done a second playthrough yet, so that may change things a little, but I'm reluctant to think so.

												Thought these guys were supposed to be PC game developers. But 60% score on Steam? On Steam?? Check the negative reviews. All complaining of technical issues. It's disheartening, to say the least. Whatever. It's still a good game when it works. The content lacks, but the gameplay doesn't. Feels like Dark Souls but with more thought gone in, instead of difficulty due to large gaps between player and NPC damage/hitpoints. And you shouldn't be suffering more than a couple cheap deaths (if at all) so long as you play it smart. Different tactics can yield widly different results. Surprisingly, rushing the enormous melee boss with my two handed axe jump-slashing at his knees was the best way to win in one instance, where hanging back with a big shield previously was hardly helping at all. The game is short though. And the plethora of technical problems discourage a second run through the story. But hell, if you see it on sale for good, I'd still reccomend it, since the devs at least are releasing patches.			"

												I finished the game as warrior. The graphics are next-gen (think Unreal Engine 4, altough it is something else).Four things that annoyed me, you can fall and die. To add insult to the injury, the enemies' hits usually throw you in various directions and those directions happen to be in the falling areas sometimes, and you die, and die, and die and die again.And the second thing is the character's hack'n'slash is slower than the player's input, so it won't be a fast one and 80% of the time enemies get to hit you before you even lay a finger on them.Another thing is that enemies usually spawn and respawn if  you enter or leave different areas. Additionally, all the doors are reset and if you happen to have unlocked the door from the other side, you have to do it again next time you visit the same area, once you left it.Lastly, there is no map, nor there is any arrow pointing you to the quests, so you can go around sometimes for an hour to figure which door is the one that leads to the next step.

												Thouroughly enjoyable game! When you play this game, expect to die... LOTS! This is the beauty of the game, you will die - but you will enjoy it! You will pull your hair out trying to figure out how to kill many foes/bosses.Patience and reflexes are required. This game is not full of ""Active Time Events"" like in Tomb Raider or Resident Evil 6, you either fight / dodge / block / run away... or DIE!You can change the story by chosing to do many events throughout the game differently, some choices you will regret, but you can replay the game as the same or different class and get completely different outcomes to the story. Once you start playing, you will be glued to it! Well worth it!Good luck to all those that play this game!			"

												There's no end to the problems with this game. The combat is clunky, poorly timed and often unfairly difficult rather than actually difficult. The boss fights in particular have some interesting gimmicks that seem like a positive at first, but really only make sure you never want to play through them ever again because no-one likes solving the same puzzle twice. There are 0 likeable or relatable characters, period. The main man is built like a brick shithouse with a past obtusely obscured, has no discernable motive in any way and is acting for other characters whose motives are nebulous and poorly explained at best. The world is littered with audio notes that serve to fill in the backstory, but since the game wants to try and avoid having an ENTIRELY linear progression, trying to use those notes to learn the history of the world is tedious and scrambled. The dialogue options all feel entirely without consequence. The game has a horrible fascination with giving zero direction to the player except a one sentence task and that's ultimately what killed my enjoyment. I got to an area, realised that I was being given no direction (and in certain cases outright lied to about my direction or given conflicting information by characters and questlog) and put down my controller. After 13 hours I realised exactly how little fun I'd had at all. It's such a shame, as well. The game is graphically beautiful, the aesthetic of the character design and world design is incredibly cohesive and often remarkable. The new twists that LotF brings to standard RPG elements serve it well and are pretty damn unique. It's let down by how little I care about anyone and anything in the world, how boring a lot of the combat and exploration can be and how little the developers care about directing a player through their world.I'd recommend picking it up at maybe $5, checking it out and seeing if you get more out of it than I did.

												Don't let the pretty visuals fool you; save your money for a game that is remotely playable!I don't know why developers feel the need to make games like this one: games where you can play for over two hours and not be able to defeat the FIRST boss in the game (I only tried over 20 times...).  You actually LOSE experience when you die, and even if you stockpile enough XP to level up (in a reasonably designed game, at least), you can't use it because you haven't reached a certain spot in the game yet.  So those who aren't gaming ninjas are left essentially without a mechanism to even beef up their character to the point of being able to defeat said *first boss*.  Disgusting...  The boss that hits you even when you roll out of range of his attack, kills you in two to three hits, moves faster than you, has unlimited stamina - compared to you being crippled by just two to four attacks (all of which barely dent his health, even when you stab him in the back).  I was *behind* him a few times and got hit by *his* sword, yet mine did a measly *two* damage compared to the 50 his weapon did to me!  Yeah, I could go on.  You basically have NO advantage to use against this guy.  I literally had no way past this first area to even start the actual main portion of the game.  Wasted money...			"

												The game is virtually unplayable in it's default form on some systems. Not due to system requirements (mine far exceed the recomended to say nothing about minimum) but due to some inherent flaw in the game mechanics. When the first enemy you encounter past the tutorial can 1 hit you, and you have to replay nearly a dozen times till you manage to get good enough to never get hit to get past it only to be once again 1 hitted by the next mob, there is a problem. In a month I have merely managed to get to the tombs past the First Warden and that last bit on my sons PC (which is less powerful) affirming that it is a problem not related to me potentially sucking (which I still might). So I do believe I have given this game a fair shake. Watching youtube videos it is definately a bit more difficult of a game then I expected going into purchasing it. However I can successfully play through similar titles like Dark Souls, so it isn't my skill level. I am not saying it won't be playable for others, but I wouldn't recomend the game based on it's price and the potential for catastrophic problems. Pros: Visually impressive, immersive story (from what I can tell from what little I have played and what I have seen in videos), and deverse detailed enviroment to explore and loot.Cons: It's hard yo. ...also it might be broke for you and that sucks.

												The Short:Its a Dark Souls clone.You say it like its a problem.The Long:Lords of the Fallen is a game that takes heavy inspiration from the Souls games, but does enough on its own that it can be rightfully called its own thing. From the spellcasting being closer to that of a traditional RPG (hurray for mana bars!) to the way the characters and enemies feel, I find it to be just as fun as any Souls game.Fiords of the Lawnmower (one internet cookie should you get that reference) has a very pleasing visual style. and by pleasing I mean everyone looks bad@$$. Skulls and flames are on basically everything and while it may get old after alittle bit, I still find it to be much more exciting than Dark Souls traditional medieval gear. Everyone has pauldrons the size of a small city and the detail in the armors and weapons are gleefully over designed. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous even with a medium spec'd rig such as mine. It runs very well outside of the occational open area where the framerate noticably dips, but it never becomes unplayable. Particle effects and such are everywhere; sparks flying when an attack bounces off a sheild, snow swirls, and ash sprouting from flaming weapons and torches make sure it looks extra pretty.Combat is very weighty, even with the light weapons. All of them feel like they have weight to them and it feels wonderful, especially when you bring a mighty greathammer down on a cowering enemy and watch as they are crushed and the screen shakes from the shear force of it all. Your attacks feel like they're going to do something as your character grunts from the strength needed to heave an axe with the head as large as one of your pauldrons over his shoulder and into an enemy.The controls on keyboard and mouse a great (I'm looking at you, Dark Souls) as are the ones using a controller. The buttons can all be remapped to your liking, but the default ones should be just fine.The gameplay is similar to all the Souls games, with you exploring a castle (or 2), fighting enemies, getting loot, and dying. Alot. However the game is easier than Souls, due to it not punishing you as much when you do inevetably kick the bucket. Another thing is how experience is gained. every time you kill an enemy you gain an experience multiplier. The more enemies you kill, the higher the multiplier gets and the more XP you get per kill. However, whenever you go back to a checkpoint to refill your potions, level up, and save; the multiplier is reset so weighing whether or not you want more XP or to live is a key point. The game also encourages multiple playthroughs allowing you to select an additional spell tree on each go. This allows you access to weapons you may not be able to obtain on other playthroughs. From my research an average playthrough takes around 15-20 hours.Overall, this game is a great pick for those who finished up the Souls games and want to have a game that plays much the same or for someone who wants to get eased into this style of gameplay and found the Souls games too unforgiving.LotF gets a solid 8/10			"

												Remember auto-tracking overheads from dark souls? This game is that, minus overheads.At least, that's what it seems to be, since I can't get past the first boss. The first boss is harder to me than any boss in any game, simply because the game is too fluid. Good games like dark souls shouldn't be fluid. If it is, that means that animations have start up times, and from start up to actual animation is about half a second. That may not seem like a lot, but in the world of reactions, it is. I have the weight for the fastest roll, which, much like dark souls, is a quarter of your maximum, and it still takes forever. Not to mention the fact that the roll takes forever to come out of, and the hit stun is way too long, and a bunch of other technical junk that just doesn't feel right. I got this game because it looked like a good way to satiate the dark souls hunger pangs, but it just reminded me of what I didn't like about some dark souls mechanics. I'm not completely cynical though, so I will add to this after I've beaten the boss, and depending on what there is, maybe I'll change my recommendation.UPDATE: Alright, I've beaten the first boss, and I'm now at the second boss. Each boss has a strategy to beating them, no shocker, but much like the rock in the Friday the 13th NES game, whether or not it works all the time is completely up to whatever RNG is deciding whether or not you are worthy enough to progress. And now we get to the interaction scenes. You meet this girl in front of the area for the second boss, and in your first interaction, you tell her whether or not to kill this monk. Alright, good moral decision. Then she tells you about a lost family heirloom, and all the answers are ""be a♥♥♥♥♥♥"" Then, when you go to end the conversation, you say ""I don't care."" Not the morally ambiguous ""I must go now"" or some♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. You instead say ""Tata for now ♥♥♥♥er."" I'll probably play more though, because I have a problem.UPDATE 2: Admiteddly, I didn't play a lot of this game when I first said I don't recommend it, however now that I've beaten the second boss I can say that this game is alright. It's not great, but it's not attrocious. The rating it has on the store page is what I'd say is perfect. I have mixed feelings for it, where part of me just says this game is not fun, but another part (my DS mind) says I could play this a lot longer. P.S. The hit stun is affected by poise, but I'm not sure how much, because I haven't tooled around with it.			"

												I feel the comparison with dark souls really hurt this game as it is not a bad game.The gameplay is dark souls-like and it is pretty solid, but it does fail in some other aspects.The soundtrack was average for me and the voice acting is sometimes good and most times not so good.Plotwise, not much to see here but a couple interesting audio log.Did experience a couple crashes.Overall, the gameplay alone is enough to make the game enjoyable but i do recommend waiting for a good sale.Yetka/10 would make her cry again.

												I'm ambivalent about recommending this game.Taken on its own as an action rpg, it is a solid offering with reasonable difficulty, and moderate plot, with good mechanics.The problem is that it is trying to take Dark Souls and make it a little more approachable, which I actually think it does well enough. However, this makes me realize that when you make concessions about difficulty and playability, you can end up with a much worse game.I absolutely loved Dark Souls, and this game pales in comparison, which is why I have some trouble recommending this game. DKS has a fully continuous world, where LoF uses area transitions to allow for better graphics. However, I still think the asthetics of DKS is better.Admittedly, LoF has a coherent story that is delivered to the player, but I actually liked the obfuscation of the story in Dark Souls, and it made the moral choice not just ambiguous, but also not readily apparent.I would have tried to review the game in the absence of my knowledge of Dark Souls, but it's just not possible for me to do so, so I tried to compare as best as possible.In short, I think it was good, though I haven't done a second playthrough yet, so that may change things a little, but I'm reluctant to think so.

												Thought these guys were supposed to be PC game developers. But 60% score on Steam? On Steam?? Check the negative reviews. All complaining of technical issues. It's disheartening, to say the least. Whatever. It's still a good game when it works. The content lacks, but the gameplay doesn't. Feels like Dark Souls but with more thought gone in, instead of difficulty due to large gaps between player and NPC damage/hitpoints. And you shouldn't be suffering more than a couple cheap deaths (if at all) so long as you play it smart. Different tactics can yield widly different results. Surprisingly, rushing the enormous melee boss with my two handed axe jump-slashing at his knees was the best way to win in one instance, where hanging back with a big shield previously was hardly helping at all. The game is short though. And the plethora of technical problems discourage a second run through the story. But hell, if you see it on sale for good, I'd still reccomend it, since the devs at least are releasing patches.			"

												Love(d) it. i've gotten to almost the end with three completely different characters, and like a book i just don't want to end i've been spending my time playing other classes instead of pushing on with my main.. even though  iknow this game has a ng and a ng + mode, so i suppose i should pick a fav style and build and get'er 'done... In the probably hundreds of hours i've played it its crashed 2 or 3 times because of blueray movies playing on the other monitor, so not sure if i can blame the game on those... but other wise no problems there, love it, want more of it, there is a sequel already in the works and looks like a good content dlc pack is headed this way... so if you like a darksoulsesque kinda game then this is for you,,,  haven't played it without a controller though, i think like DS it would be a pain to play kb+m but to each their own.. but this has been alot of fun, frustration ( difficulty at times ) and soo bloody rewarding, few games will have me sitting there wondering if this crazy gambit will actually play out or if i'm gonna have to waste another ghost thing, or just waste the time and slog it back to where i died... only recently found out about the ls+ y = checkpoint without xp bonus loss... so atleast that way you have less of a distance to go to get at your precious precious xp's .....

												This game shares a lot of obvious mechanical similarities with the souls series but really does stand out as its own title.  This is a relatively linear action rpg with some castlevania esque backtracking and a lot of hidden side quests and rewards for those of us that are itching to explore every nook and cranny ( like souls, but you know where to go nearly all the time to progress the story).  The story is played out through fmv cutscenese and for the most part  the game does a good job of letting you know what's going on and where to go next.  It's not all hand holding however as there are no quest markers or maps.  no, you'll have to get accustomed to the area and recall location names if you intend to follow the leads to that special magical item you're trying to discover.  Misc Pros:Leveling and the whole purchasing stats to level thing works similar to dark souls here with its bonfire mechanic.  There are alternate hard mode challenges for each boss that rewards extra loot.  There are challenge portals that appear after a boss is defeated for those that remember to backtrack a little and get some more loot and items.  Mobs are varied enough and the bosses are distinctly unique.  Misc Cons:You can't avoid damage in this game so much as mitigate it.  Sure you can avoid a lot of it but theres much you can't or just isn't worth trying.  Second, there are relatively straight forward, clear and linear upgrades for weapons and armor types.  Third; the movesets don't change much from weapon to weapon in each wepon class (ie: all greatswords handle pretty much the same.  Just go with the one with the biggest damage.)  That being said this game holds its own as a very good title.  Coming from someone with over 700 hours across the soul titles, i happily played through this game and immediately rolled into a second play through.			"

Fighting rewards correctly timed attacks instead of R1 mashing, the bloodstain mechanic evolved past a simple pick-up to a choice between safety and boosting your combat ability when near it, armor finally has a noticeable impact. Enemies attack accordingly to their gear - you won't see a knife-wielder wind up as if he's carrying a massive club.The art design is brilliant, I really enjoy the armor and weapons, as well as the scenery.Overall I enjoyed it for what it is.

												™ Arpium -  10.2s: Lords of the Fallen has some really great combat mechanics, you can charge bash with a shield, power swing, combo, dodge roll, backstep, counter, block (except for ridonculously big attacks that pierce your sustainability)....there isn't a vast amount of different npc models but there is a lot of different mastery of how to combat each one. The boss fights are dreadfully hard the first time around, especially the third boss. Everything has to be maneuvered just right or else you will pay for your mistakes big time. You can choose to do hardcore which provides better rewards by not emptying any gained experience into upgrades. The game is fun and very frustrating at times, I don't recommend trying the hardcore route first play through. The game is definitely a 9/10 in my book, especially since the developers are a new face in new-gen gaming advancements. Dark Souls knock-off or not, this game will satisfy action-rpg players until the Witcher 3 is released. I have a 2012 top notch gaming rig, max graphics in this game require a 2014 top-tier gaming rig for positive framerate pool, but the graphics are definitely up there with far cry and crisis series.

												Score: 6.5/10It's a much easier Dark Souls, but doesn't have near the same polish. I'm on the fence with it, but I would still give it a thumbs up if only slightly. It teases multiple playthroughs, but once was enough. There's a lot to like here, but it feels a bit half-baked at times. It's a strange game that wants to let you explore and then punishes you by doing something cheap, and it's not as rewarding once you've overcome it. On the other hand, it's not nearly as frustrating as Dark Souls can be.- You'll get hit through walls and see all manner of glitchy things.- You'll face enemies that will use cheap tactics to land hits on you. - You will find the yo-yo difficulty to be hard and then easy, then difficult again. - You will find the gear to be mostly useless.- Exploration isn't too rewarding.- The risk/reward system is a joke. Saving up kill streaks to earn more XP is barely noticeable.Get it on sale and play it over a weekend.			"

However, I still think the asthetics of DKS is better.Admittedly, LoF has a coherent story that is delivered to the player, but I actually liked the obfuscation of the story in Dark Souls, and it made the moral choice not just ambiguous, but also not readily apparent.I would have tried to review the game in the absence of my knowledge of Dark Souls, but it's just not possible for me to do so, so I tried to compare as best as possible.In short, I think it was good, though I haven't done a second playthrough yet, so that may change things a little, but I'm reluctant to think so.

												Thought these guys were supposed to be PC game developers. But 60% score on Steam? On Steam?? Check the negative reviews. All complaining of technical issues. It's disheartening, to say the least. Whatever. It's still a good game when it works. The content lacks, but the gameplay doesn't. Feels like Dark Souls but with more thought gone in, instead of difficulty due to large gaps between player and NPC damage/hitpoints. And you shouldn't be suffering more than a couple cheap deaths (if at all) so long as you play it smart. Different tactics can yield widly different results. Surprisingly, rushing the enormous melee boss with my two handed axe jump-slashing at his knees was the best way to win in one instance, where hanging back with a big shield previously was hardly helping at all. The game is short though. And the plethora of technical problems discourage a second run through the story. But hell, if you see it on sale for good, I'd still reccomend it, since the devs at least are releasing patches.			"

												The fact that this game was pretty much unplayable at launch really hurt it. I dont think it ever recovered from that bad image, although the game is now fixed and never once crashed on me. And theres the fact that its emulating a game with one of the most protective fan bases of all time. Is LotF on the same level as Dark Souls? No. But is it a bad game? Calling LotF bad in a world where No Mans Sky and The Division exist is simply asinine. LotF is flawed but still fun. And damn is it pretty.I thought we would have heard more of the sequel by now, so Im worried it might have gotten canned. But if its still coming out in 2017, it could be one of the years best if they improve on foundation they have here. 7/10			"

												Had some performace issues, but much better after turning off volumetric lightning, single CTD yet ( one in 4 hours).Pros:-Similar to Dark Souls-Great Visuals-Good controls, I like how favorite weapons are not considered in equip load unlike Dark Souls, the item/magic toggle and use is pretty good as well, but jump could be better.Cons: -Some weird hit boxes-Bad magic system, too long to cast, too flashy, more like small buffs than actual spell casting, Gauntlet laser is nice, the others aren't.-Attribute system with less freedom to try out weapons-No autosave, frustrating if I expect another CTD especially with the exp multiplier stuff.

												As a newcomer into the 'dark soul' type of game, this was surpringly easy to get into, but hard to master. There are plenty of secrets to find and bosses to get stuck on. The maps seem huge until you complete the game you realise how small it actually is after unlocking shortcuts or routes back to earlier parts of the game. I see this as a testiment to good map design and there are plenty of varied enviroments- from castles, to prisons, graveyards and even demon realms.Overall this has consumed my time and I'm close to completing NG+ at the time of writing.However, right now there are random crashes to the game. After updating my geforce drives, it seemed to reduce substantially, but occasional crashes still kills the experience. However, I'm sure more patches will come soon or there will be mod options.In summary, I think this game is a good start if you wanted to get into the genre and hopefullly pass the time for vererans until Bloodbourne is out (assuming you have a ps4).

												I can recomment this game to action game lovers and dark fantasy explorers, 7/10. It could have been a great game, but somehow it fells unfinished, some things are never explained in game, and the story is presented too sparsely... a quest log would also have done wonders for the side quests... they get mentioned in voice overs, and thats it... also, there is a lot of backtracking, you need to traverse between the 2 main game areas 3x during the story... with some doors just being unreachable or locked until you encounter them suddenly open later in the game, without any hint that this is the reason and not, that you have not found a key or so...Nevertheless, great graphics, cool fights, rewarding battles, nice bosses, and although difficult, not as insanely as the Dark Souls series. Also, hte game is stable as of end 2015, only the story DLC seems a bit unstable, and short/not worth it.			"

												Just clear the game.I feels this game is designed to be more frustrating than challenging. Camera control is as bad as hell, stay away from this game if you are motioin sickness type.Most of the time you will walk through the corridor and fight trough the horde of enemies. This is not fun at all.For me boss battle is on par with ""Souls"" there is a moment where you feel adrenaline rush in your body. But some boss pretty boring too because of you don't have many option/strategy to kill him except wait his big move then attack.The worst part is there is a moment where you are locked at boss. You can't go anywhere and if you can't kil the boss infront of you you can progress the game either.			"

												One of the best games of this type especially if you are new to the genre. this style of combat and complexity comes from the original Demon souls but it is definitely made a lot easier for this game. however I still found myself dying quite a lot and enjoying every single minute of it! Brilliant visuals along with brilliant gameplay make for what i think is quite an underrated game!If you are keen to get into the Dark souls genre and are not patient enough to deal with the huge amount of dying involved then i would say this is a great choice. The visuals are definitely better than Dark Souls 1 on PC so you will enjoy the gorgeous environments regardless. On another note I have now stepped up my game and just bought Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the first sin so I am preparing myself to Die and die I shall lol.			"

												Dark Souls Lite!It wears its inspirations on it's sleeve, but after you get past that you'll find a genuinely well put-together action RPG. While it certainly lacks the same depth as Dark Souls, it does enjoy unique enemies, good level design, and an overall fun combat system. Certainly worth playing if you're into the harder-core action RPGs. Just don't expect Dark Souls			"

												I RECOMMEND THE GAME ITSELF. NOT THIS VERSIONI have had no issues in my 20+ hours but MANY other have, so while I will say the game is great fun,the PC version suffers from major instability issues on some systems while others like mine are totally fine.So buy at your own risk****Lords of the fallen is a ""souls-like"" Action Adventure RPG with a heavy focus timing and positioning.The comparison to the Souls series is a given, and this game proudly wears its influences on its shoulders. This is not exactly a bad thing, but it will cause a lot of people to bandwagon hate the game (as will the DRM it uses and the PC port issues).Combat is best described as ""heavy souls"", your attacks and your enemies attacks are highly telegraphed and take quite a while to wind up. This means you need to make every shot count and since the rolling is far slower than the Souls roll mechanic, you will need to be more aware of your relative positioning to enemies. The combat is very fun and has a very meaty visceral feel to it that the souls games simply do not provide. Which is not to say there are not issues with the combat. Attacks seem to ""hone"" in on enemies as do theirs to you. Some attacks do it, some dont. Makes positioning difficult at times especially if you dont like locking on.The level's, while linear are both well designed and have a more dark souls 1 feel about them. By this I mean the world feels like it winds and interconnects in a realistic way. This may not be the case exactly as I have not looked up geometry maps but I always felt like the levels just made sense in addition to being beautifully detailed.The story was alright. Nothing special and nothing I will fondly look back on. It's a far cry from the Souls method of story telling. Its far more straight forward and told thru cut scenes. I personally didn't care about the story so I really cant say much other than how forgettable it was. Now for some lists...Similarities to the soul's games.........*Slow ""difficulty"" based ARPG gameplay*Potions [estus] that refill at checkpoints*RPG leveling system*Overall Feel of the game (like I said this is inspired by the Souls series and it does not hide this)*Different weapons have different move sets*A currency loss system for death Now some differences.............*Actual physical save points, so if you die (or crash) between them you lose all progress since the last save*MUCH more accessible mechanic wise (level up at any checkpoint)*Using the crystal thing [bonfire] does not reset enemies, only zoning or dying does*MUCH slower combat *You actually lose potions as you die over and over. Can be frustrating when you dont know the mechanic and it seems like you're losing potions for no reason.* MUCH more forgiving death mechanics. You can not only use an item to recover your points but you actually heal while standing around your EXP mass. * Simplified spell system* Simplified stat system* True blue combo system* functional pause* no co-op/PVP (PVEers dream)* Few more things I cant recall at the momentOverall Lords is a great game which manages to do enough different to avoid being called a Dark Souls clone. They simply have changed too many mechanics to make this game feel unique and different from any souls game to be written off as a simple clone. What this game is tho, is a game that was CLEARLY made by people who loved the souls games to death and wanted to create their own take on the game. It's similar, but different enough if that makes sense.So if you want to roll the die and see if this game will work on your PC, go for it. Otherwise get it for the next gen consoles as im told those versions are generally much more stable.			"

												OK first off, this game may have a few similarities with the Demon/Dark Souls series, mainly controls and the stamina/energy system, but that's where it ends. Lords of The Fallen is a great game. Graphics are stunning and even better if you make some small tweaks. If you are having problems making it look good for you then i suggest changing your GPU settings and have them override the ingame settings. I changed the settings in my Nvidia Control Panel to really make this game look amazing.With the controls being similar to DS/DSII you might start trying to play the same way but try not to because the combat in LotF is very different. It's nowhere near as difficult but it's much slower. You have to time your attacks carefully when there are openings to counter attack. That being said it's not too punishing if you mess up as long as you don't get sloppy. The combat can be very satisfying if you take your time.There are plenty of different weapon and armor types to choose from that directly affect your weight and encumberance to suit your play style. I prefer great axes myself in this game because when timed right your attacks are brutal and the ragdoll force looks awesome after a kill but not overdone. Hit boxes in general are very tight and realistic in my opinion. The story is ok. Nothing epic there. The problem is that it's very easy to lose focus on the reason the protagonist is there in the first place. ""Oh yea. I'm more than a demon-killing badass, there's something I'm supposed to do."" I found myself with this thought a few times after i would complete a part of the main quest and the story brought me back in. Other than that, it's fine. Voice acting, in my opinion, is very well done.The game world isn't as big as some other games in the genre. You'll find yourself going through some of the same areas to get to different objectives. Also there is no compass or radar or anything like that to give you a general idea of your location. You have to memorize the areas to get around more efficiently. I personally liked this, adding to the immersion for me, but i can see how this can be frustrating to some due to frequently getting lost or going in circles. Exploration is encouraged as there are plenty of secrets and lore to be found and even more after you complete your first playthrough, which adds to the replayability factor of Lords of the Fallen.Character development and growth is straight forward and easy to manage. Some rpg's can get a little extensive with their leveling system and attribute and/or skill distribution making for a lot of useless skills or abilities. Lords of the Fallen lets you level your character in different ways depending on your combat choice, warrior, rogue, or mage, all with useful and practical abilities that you will use all the time. You can allocate attribute points to your strength, vitality, faith etc. separately to raise the attributes you actually need and ignoring less needed ones for your play style.LotF does suffer from a few bugs. You can basically read about them all over the reviews for this game. I've seen a few glitches here and there but nothing game breaking. Mostly stuff like occasional frame rate drops or bodies glitching here and there. The only noticeable bug that i encountered was my graphics settings not saving while i was tweaking them when i first bought the game. But haven't ran into the issue again.Lords of the Fallen is a great third person action rpg that is visually breathtaking (after some tweaks) with a satisfying and rewarding combat system when patience is used and a story that can start becoming an afterthought after a few hours in but brings you back in at key points, overall it's pretty decent. The bugs are present but don't break immersion in my opinion. I really enjoyed it and hope for more like this from City Interactive.			"

 100% Recommend this game. There are many Negative reviews for this game which almost kept me form buying it, and the 'Mixed' reviews really scared me, but I'm VERY happy that i purchased this game.     This is going to be a rather long section as i feel there is a very large amount to talk about. The game has the same 'Souls' feel that we all know and love with some differences here and there that really help it feel like its own game, and not just a clone as i was expecting.

       Speed: 
     This game has a very unique feel to it. The combat is slower than the Souls games, which each action having a small amount of 'wind-up' time as you would expect in real life. This is not a complaint. Yes it makes your attacks take longer than Souls titles but it also does the same for your enemies

      Movement: 
     This is a big one for me, as i always play the nimble rogue in Souls games. I feel like the movements in the game feel VERY good. Very organic and natural like you would expect from a real person diving around. 

      Crashing: 
     The one thing that ALMOST stopped me from playing but surprising enough, upgrading my gfx drivers actually solvedthe issue (something that in the past has never affected much). Definately recommend doing this BEFORE any other fixes you find. Overall i REALLY love this game. Personally i think the gameplay is better (albeit similar while also very different) than Dark Souls 2 (which really was a letdown in my opinion, but i digress).  RECOMMENDED  "

												Lets get the important bit out of the way first.STAY AWAY IF YOU CAN'T TAKE TROUBLESHOOTING.Stability. Stability. Stability.It took me over 3 hours to get the game to load past the first cut scene. Turns out my problem was lack of virtual memory. Popped it up to 4Gigs and off I went with no crashes in sight. I've got 16 gigs of ram so I don't know WHY it NEEDED VM at all.This game is wonderful. It's immersive, powerful and rage inducing at times. (Beside the stability issues)Pros:-Beautiful world and armor choices-Heavy response based combat.  Each swing feels more realistic than Darksouls.-Full fantastic voice acting-Difficult but not too terribly mind numbingly painful.-Powerful musicCons:-Crashing crashing crashing-Lip synch during cut scene is just horrible. They didn't even try.-First half of the bosses were so-so-Lack of keybinding support. There's no way to set up a custom config for a controller.-Lack of enemy variety. -I got lost a lot... Level design is composed of a lot of tight hallways and caverns. No necessarily a con but was bloody annoying after getting lost in the same place 3 times.When it comes down to it it was a great game, albeit short (13.4 hours first run through), fantastic combat that took forever to get the nuances to. Have a guy with a huge shield? You have to have a mace to knock it down. Low armor fast assassin type? Use a short sword or fists. You really have to adapt to who and what you are fighting through out the game or else you'll have to get creative or have a bad time. It took me about 6 hours to get the combat system down right.I picked this up for $20 and it was $20 well spent. The standard $50 is a bit steep for the time spent though there are a lot of incentives to play NG+ more spells, armor, weapons, hidden items, side quests, multiple endings, etc. I pray they make a second one with twice as much content and a wider variety of foes to sink my axe into. All in all I think I've enjoyed this more than Darksouls II and that's saying something. I just wish it was a bit more rounded out. "

												Review on Lords of the Fallen:After finishing Lords of The Fallen, it gave me a ""Mass Effect 3"" ending disappointment. The game is Overall Pretty Good, though the back-stab is rather iffy. but I swear the amount of bugs I went through really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off which I will list down there later.Positive points:1. Just as current day gamers categorize Rogue-Like and Rogue-Lite, I agree with other reviewers out there that this is Dark-Souls-Lite. The game is very similiar to Dark Souls but the game was designed for you to take hits even if you choose the rogue agility class. Other classes will take damage from the beginning of the game until the end, but for the rouge, you have to take some damage at the start of the game to kill enemies and get experience to level up. After leveling up to a certain point and obtaining your final magic ability, that is where the fun begins and you can sneak almost every enemy, ""Stab"" and back-stab.2. The weapon timing mechanic is very interesting especially when you dual wield. When you dual-wield, you cannot unleash your combo unless you successfully execute the perfect timing strike two times consecutively, any remaining stamina after that can be used to continue the multi-hit combo if you, once again, successfully execute the perfect timing strike.3. I've played heavy-weapons as well, and it relies more on timing the strikes or tanking enemy hits to deal a heavy blow. Early on, the perfect timing strike allows you to attack 2 times and dodge roll before having your stamina deplete. Without perfect timing, you may only attack twice and have your stamina depleted, leaving you open to attacks. Also, with this stat called Poise, more Poise means you can take larger hits without getting staggered or falling down. It is a pretty nice way to portray the ""Tanky-Feeling"" of Heavy Armor.4. The stamina/energy recovery is relatively fast compared to Dark Souls/ Dark Souls 2. In my opinion, this makes it a bit more enjoyable. Remember, this means the enemy has the relatively fast regeneration too.5. The enemies in the game are quite normal and it was easy to figure out their pattern. Boss attack patterns are also easy to figure out cause every attack has a distinct preparation pose. This does not necessarily mean it is easy to beat them, you still have to figure out which attacks do they combo with. Depending which magic class and armor you chose to play with, you have to react accordingly. This makes it fun, it gives me a monster hunter feeling.[The style reminds me of monster hunter, but why I did not use monster hunter as an example is because in MH, attacks do not consume stamina. In Monster Hunter, you can throw caution to the wind when fighting common mooks, and only fight seriously and learn the pattern of the boss monster. Whereas for Dark Souls and Lords, you have to fight every unit with the seriousness of a Monster Hunter Boss] 6. The Rune crafting is quite interesting, depending on what type of equipment you put the rune in, it provides different stats and different runes do different things too.Negative Points:1. Seems to me if you are a rogue and you meet an enemy with a shield, you must bring out your own shield which most likely won't work because you have low poise OR cheese'em with the magic gauntlet of pew pew. This kind of makes me feel like I'm forced to NOT play Rogue 2. Some bosses and units are too easy to cheese with the gauntlet, I experiment ""the cheese"" for a few shots and proceed to fight normally, when the boss changes style I experiment again to test if it can be ""cheese-ed"" and continue to fight as usual.3. The walls will make your camera get screwed up. When you run into a wall, chances are that your camera will zoom into your face and you cannot see the enemy. Another possibility is that you get to look inside the wall and nothing else. Therefore, besides the enemies in front of you, you have to remember, walls are you enemies too. It would have been nice if they would make the walls transparent when you go too close to the walls and zoom out but hey, maybe it was intentional to make walls your enemies too.4. The choices you make in game don't really matter which makes me feel like I should just do the main quest and nothing else if I ever play the game from start again. Just slight changes for the end, which gave me a ""Mass Effect 3"" ending disappointment, as said on the top.5. Sometimes when you attack, you clip through the enemy and all you see are their undergarments (loin cloth) or armor. Screwing your camera up in the process, leaving you vulnerable. Also, when this happens, 50% of the time, your damage will not register.6. The magical illusions are flawed. Not ""Prayer"", other skills like the Rogue's ""Stab"": occasionally the enemy will register that ""Stabs"" illusion is a target-able unit like all Magic Classes ""Prayer"" and proceed to attack that illusion. It is an advantage to the player but that is not suppose to happen.7. I may have said that the Rune Crafting is interesting but there is too few variety of runes. Which make it quite dull at the same time.[BUGS] Before Patch 1.4:1. Subtitle not disappearing if you change area when the subtitles are present;2. Death but not death: black screen never fades back into game except when i pause, happens when you fall into a death pit but there are stones that block your way down to the bottom which make you take damage but so happens that part of the pit is also the death line;3. Units flying into the sky during death animation and stays in the air (this one is ok, just funny);4. Run to checkpoint with enemy chasing, checkpoint disabled animation did not proc, kill enemies; checkpoint cannot proc reactivation animation; checkpoint forever disabled;5. Even after lowering graphic setting, I can't move my character as soon as the screen fades in. In two ways, holding down the button cause I knew there are units there, disabled my WASD. (yes im playing with keyboard) and another way is that when I see the screen fade in, I press any of the WASD key, he does this little shuffle to that direction and barely even moves an inch. (Note: I had 3 enemies in front of me and i'm a rogue)[no movement means death]6. The dodge invulnerability time is odd,[for the early part of the game i tried using it, after that I just didnt bother using the invul time anymore]sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't; some times you get invul at the end of dodge, sometimes i get hit at the end of dodge, doesn't make sense to me. In addition to that, the enemies' weapon hit box seemed irregular to me.7. Whether this is a bug or not, whenever a rouge uses the ability Mimic, the spirit will block your vision and you cannot see what's in front of you most of the time, this is the worst skill I have ever used if this is not a bug.Conclusion:I enjoyed playing this game, but the bugs of the game really got on my nerves. There are times I found the game ridiculous, there are times I found the game interesting and almost genius. Thus, the score is given below.Lowest I give the game : 6 .5/10Highest I give the game: 8.0/10Overall I give Lords of the Fallen: 7.0/10.			"

												The fact that this game was pretty much unplayable at launch really hurt it. I dont think it ever recovered from that bad image, although the game is now fixed and never once crashed on me. And theres the fact that its emulating a game with one of the most protective fan bases of all time. Is LotF on the same level as Dark Souls? No. But is it a bad game? Calling LotF bad in a world where No Mans Sky and The Division exist is simply asinine. LotF is flawed but still fun. And damn is it pretty.I thought we would have heard more of the sequel by now, so Im worried it might have gotten canned. But if its still coming out in 2017, it could be one of the years best if they improve on foundation they have here. 7/10			"

												Love(d) it. i've gotten to almost the end with three completely different characters, and like a book i just don't want to end i've been spending my time playing other classes instead of pushing on with my main.. even though  iknow this game has a ng and a ng + mode, so i suppose i should pick a fav style and build and get'er 'done... In the probably hundreds of hours i've played it its crashed 2 or 3 times because of blueray movies playing on the other monitor, so not sure if i can blame the game on those... but other wise no problems there, love it, want more of it, there is a sequel already in the works and looks like a good content dlc pack is headed this way... so if you like a darksoulsesque kinda game then this is for you,,,  haven't played it without a controller though, i think like DS it would be a pain to play kb+m but to each their own.. but this has been alot of fun, frustration ( difficulty at times ) and soo bloody rewarding, few games will have me sitting there wondering if this crazy gambit will actually play out or if i'm gonna have to waste another ghost thing, or just waste the time and slog it back to where i died... only recently found out about the ls+ y = checkpoint without xp bonus loss... so atleast that way you have less of a distance to go to get at your precious precious xp's ..... Def one of my if not fav Game of the year...			"

												Excellent Dark Souls-esque aRPG that expands upon the basic Souls gameplay in pretty much every aspect, and does it well. Fighting rewards correctly timed attacks instead of R1 mashing, the bloodstain mechanic evolved past a simple pick-up to a choice between safety and boosting your combat ability when near it, armor finally has a noticeable impact. Enemies attack accordingly to their gear - you won't see a knife-wielder wind up as if he's carrying a massive club.The art design is brilliant, I really enjoy the armor and weapons, as well as the scenery.Overall I enjoyed it for what it is.

												™ Arpium -  10.2s: Lords of the Fallen has some really great combat mechanics, you can charge bash with a shield, power swing, combo, dodge roll, backstep, counter, block (except for ridonculously big attacks that pierce your sustainability)....there isn't a vast amount of different npc models but there is a lot of different mastery of how to combat each one. The boss fights are dreadfully hard the first time around, especially the third boss. Everything has to be maneuvered just right or else you will pay for your mistakes big time. You can choose to do hardcore which provides better rewards by not emptying any gained experience into upgrades. The game is fun and very frustrating at times, I don't recommend trying the hardcore route first play through. The game is definitely a 9/10 in my book, especially since the developers are a new face in new-gen gaming advancements. Dark Souls knock-off or not, this game will satisfy action-rpg players until the Witcher 3 is released. I have a 2012 top notch gaming rig, max graphics in this game require a 2014 top-tier gaming rig for positive framerate pool, but the graphics are definitely up there with far cry and crisis series.

One was when starting up the game, when my display was set to ""Borderless"", it would run in a standard window. (Just applying the borderless option again was enough to fix it), and a weird bug during a boss battle where I would be teleported a few feet away after being knocked back.The game is a lot of fun, and don't let the ""It's easier than Dark Souls"" saying fool you.

												When this game released it crashed a lot apparently.  I'm on AMD with the latest version and it's totally smooth and not a crash yet.  A lot of the bad reviews were for that reason so keep that in mind, a lot of them.This game is fantastic.  I know the whole graphics don't make a game thing but if you love art as I do you'll appreciate this game.  I love to just look around at all the detail everywhere, you armor and weapons, the world, the way when you open a chest the force of the heavy lid will nudge the whole thing a little bit as would really happen.  If your coming from Dark Souls you'll appreciate the controls which are copied.  Ain't broke, don't fix.  Now when you try to play it like Dark Souls is where you will get a nasty shock.  I played this for a bit then stopped cuz it was to damn hard.  Then I came back to it fresh and really tried to understand THIS game and I'm now loving it.  It's hard to explain exactly, maybe just that the combat is more realistic in that these huge weapons have massive weight.  But there are lighter weapons as well but you have to play the game in it's own way, once you do that it's a great challenge with lots of fun secrets to find and things to dispatch.  Backstab is once again your friend.  The magic and gauntlet are great fun to use as they add a strategy as well as offense.Lets face it all these games are Dungeons and Dragons come to life and if you like the genre, love exploring decaying old dungeons and fortresses then don't hesitate.  I wonder if my 14 years old self was plopped down in front of this game what would happen.  Actually I know what would happen my brain would explode in a rainbow fireworks display.			"

												Game finished, review too:) TL:DR at the end;pSo far, quite good. Level design is great. Armors and weapons looks awsome. Combat feal relatively realistic (apart from walls that does not stop yours or enemy weapons like in Dark Souls, which was great idea in these games), you can see that your weapon has weight and it is seen on enemies when you hit them, you can see the impact. Other mechanics are a lot like Dark Souls, you still have exp/souls to collect in order for better loot and lvl up your main stats. Chcaracter wise, you can choose from 3 archetypes (brawl, deception, and faith) and then you select your starting gear (rogue, warrior and cleric)  which gives you 9 possible cobinations which is quite good. Althou there is no mage charcter per se. Only Ranged magic attack is gountlet, which is found after 2nd boss (around 1 hour into the game).Speakin of bosses, in my opinion they are nothing special. Most of them, if you played and completed DS/DS2 can be beat on your first go. I write most of them as there is few interesting mechanics (like insta kill on Worshipper boss). Each boss has some kind of gimmic that you need consider in order to beat him. Speaking of ♥♥♥♥♥shipper (pun intented), as far i know more bosses in game features summoning adds mechanics, which is not bad lets say on Commander (which have sense as he commands), but on this Worshipper boss, level of toxic atmosphere created by summoning golems (that stagger you while attacking) and boss can summon multiple adds at the same time, which happens to be instadeath for you as these little golems can jump-attack ridiculs amounts of space and stagger you to death. Which is really bad boss decision. In fact this mechanics remembers me Royal Rat Authority from Dark Souls 2 which was crucified by fans as not interesting, frustrating and very poorly wittern boss fight. Looks like creators of Lords... had no better solution to make bosses challenging, just insert add mechanic. Which is bad. Following this little rant of mine, if you are still interested in this game (and you should, even with failed boss adds) i have encountered few annoying bugs. Here is an example of such bug:- in catacumbs (omfg great lvl ;p) i died near entrance, when i respawned i could not find my exp/there was no timer nor any indication that i had died (apart from lost exp/pots etc.) - enemies tends to bugout, you cant target them or attack, even if you cant get past them, as they block your only exit. - execution camera is wierd, it tends to zoom in like crazy, and all you see is piece of armor (if you are lucky) - for AMD users, you should manually disable PhysX in 2 seperate ini files ( just google it) - poor optimalization. - voice acting and lip sync is super wierdOk final verdict: 7,5/10why? i flippin enjoy this game, if you stop looking at these annoying things game is enjoyable. So far i have 7 hours, and i still enjoy it.TL;DR:  After finish game with Warrior Brawler, i must say, fun game, deffinitly worth your attention and money. Yes, you will encounter few bugs, like vanishing monsters, but its nothing that breaks the game. Fun title.			"

												If you want a more narrative forcused, middling version of the souls games, this fills that spot nicely. It has a lot of interesting ideas and just as many, if not more problems in executing them. It provides a less tight and less satisfying version of the souls combat without being as punishing. Except all the times I died.I experienced 1 crash in 24 hours of gameplay and very few bugs. The developers have done a lot to fix the game, so now might be the time to give this a chance.

Relented and bought it, and have no regrets - either it runs fine on just my computer, or the bugs have been fixed ,as I am about to complete my first playthrough and have experienced absolutely no CTDs. The only bugged content I have encountered was an issue with one of the rings/trinkets (Greed - would recommend not using this until it is fixed).			"

												As a newcomer into the 'dark soul' type of game, this was surpringly easy to get into, but hard to master. There are plenty of secrets to find and bosses to get stuck on. The maps seem huge until you complete the game you realise how small it actually is after unlocking shortcuts or routes back to earlier parts of the game. I see this as a testiment to good map design and there are plenty of varied enviroments- from castles, to prisons, graveyards and even demon realms.Overall this has consumed my time and I'm close to completing NG+ at the time of writing.However, right now there are random crashes to the game. After updating my geforce drives, it seemed to reduce substantially, but occasional crashes still kills the experience. However, I'm sure more patches will come soon or there will be mod options.In summary, I think this game is a good start if you wanted to get into the genre and hopefullly pass the time for vererans until Bloodbourne is out (assuming you have a ps4).

												I honestly don't know where all these  bad reviews are coming from i have not suffered a single crash in my 17+ hours of gameplay. The game looks stunning on ultra settings and the art style is is interesting and consistent. The game might be a little on the  easier side if you're used to games like dark souls but that doesn't mean that there is no challenge . while the bosses aren't super stunning like those found in dark souls they are still a lot of fun to figure out and they all have a special way you can defeat them so they drop a special weapon. Im glad that more developers are willing to work on the formula that dark souls has established. Just like we have metroidvania and rouge likes I cant wait to see more souls like games its one of the most rewarding gaming experiences and this game does it fairly well. it’s a fun game with realistic combat that presents a decent challenge in a unique atmosphere. The story is okay but it is nothing to write home about but the weapons and equipment collecting is where the most fun is to be had   "

												I RECOMMEND THE GAME ITSELF. NOT THIS VERSIONI have had no issues in my 20+ hours but MANY other have, so while I will say the game is great fun,the PC version suffers from major instability issues on some systems while others like mine are totally fine.So buy at your own risk****Lords of the fallen is a ""souls-like"" Action Adventure RPG with a heavy focus timing and positioning.The comparison to the Souls series is a given, and this game proudly wears its influences on its shoulders. This is not exactly a bad thing, but it will cause a lot of people to bandwagon hate the game (as will the DRM it uses and the PC port issues).Combat is best described as ""heavy souls"", your attacks and your enemies attacks are highly telegraphed and take quite a while to wind up. This means you need to make every shot count and since the rolling is far slower than the Souls roll mechanic, you will need to be more aware of your relative positioning to enemies. The combat is very fun and has a very meaty visceral feel to it that the souls games simply do not provide. Which is not to say there are not issues with the combat. Attacks seem to ""hone"" in on enemies as do theirs to you. Some attacks do it, some dont. Makes positioning difficult at times especially if you dont like locking on.The level's, while linear are both well designed and have a more dark souls 1 feel about them. By this I mean the world feels like it winds and interconnects in a realistic way. This may not be the case exactly as I have not looked up geometry maps but I always felt like the levels just made sense in addition to being beautifully detailed.The story was alright. Nothing special and nothing I will fondly look back on. It's a far cry from the Souls method of story telling. Its far more straight forward and told thru cut scenes. I personally didn't care about the story so I really cant say much other than how forgettable it was. Now for some lists...Similarities to the soul's games.........*Slow ""difficulty"" based ARPG gameplay*Potions [estus] that refill at checkpoints*RPG leveling system*Overall Feel of the game (like I said this is inspired by the Souls series and it does not hide this)*Different weapons have different move sets*A currency loss system for death Now some differences.............*Actual physical save points, so if you die (or crash) between them you lose all progress since the last save*MUCH more accessible mechanic wise (level up at any checkpoint)*Using the crystal thing [bonfire] does not reset enemies, only zoning or dying does*MUCH slower combat *You actually lose potions as you die over and over. Can be frustrating when you dont know the mechanic and it seems like you're losing potions for no reason.* MUCH more forgiving death mechanics. You can not only use an item to recover your points but you actually heal while standing around your EXP mass. * Simplified spell system* Simplified stat system* True blue combo system* functional pause* no co-op/PVP (PVEers dream)* Few more things I cant recall at the momentOverall Lords is a great game which manages to do enough different to avoid being called a Dark Souls clone. They simply have changed too many mechanics to make this game feel unique and different from any souls game to be written off as a simple clone. What this game is tho, is a game that was CLEARLY made by people who loved the souls games to death and wanted to create their own take on the game. It's similar, but different enough if that makes sense.So if you want to roll the die and see if this game will work on your PC, go for it. Otherwise get it for the next gen consoles as im told those versions are generally much more stable.			"

But the game itself is challeging and fun much harder than dark souls 2 can you remember a boss in dark souls to that was hard...no thats what I thought the end boss was a pain but when i killed him it felt like i accomplished something.  Then you  go to new game+.  This is something i normally love but it was done so poorly that now I've stopped playing the game.  It seems all they've done is change some enemies and give them a HUGE health boost so much of a boost it feels tedious and boring to fight them now but overall I really liked the game.			"

												Don't let the pretty visuals fool you; save your money for a game that is remotely playable!I don't know why developers feel the need to make games like this one: games where you can play for over two hours and not be able to defeat the FIRST boss in the game (I only tried over 20 times...).  You actually LOSE experience when you die, and even if you stockpile enough XP to level up (in a reasonably designed game, at least), you can't use it because you haven't reached a certain spot in the game yet.  So those who aren't gaming ninjas are left essentially without a mechanism to even beef up their character to the point of being able to defeat said *first boss*.  Disgusting...  The boss that hits you even when you roll out of range of his attack, kills you in two to three hits, moves faster than you, has unlimited stamina - compared to you being crippled by just two to four attacks (all of which barely dent his health, even when you stab him in the back).  I was *behind* him a few times and got hit by *his* sword, yet mine did a measly *two* damage compared to the 50 his weapon did to me!  Yeah, I could go on.  You basically have NO advantage to use against this guy.  I literally had no way past this first area to even start the actual main portion of the game.  Wasted money...			"

												So far I've had quite a bit of performance issues. 20 minutes into the game and I crashed. The game itself is good but the actual deliverance is poor.Edit: Fixed it. Pro tip: don't choose rouge magic with the warrior class, the final boss was the worst thing I've ever played against with that build--that includes anything on Darksouls. I was a shortsword user the whole game but had to switch to daggers to get a maximum of two hits in every 30 seconds. Poor game design on the final boss due to the fact that it's an easy challenge for a heavy warrior build but crazy difficult for a light rogue based build. All-in-all, it was something I had to beat. If you're looking to go easy-mode, go warrior; if you want a real challenge, finish this game as a rogue.			"

												Lords of the Fallen had, and may still have great potential, but technical flaws and not enough unique takes, leave it a little behind the competition.Pros:-Great visuals, effects, and combat system-Amazing looking armor and weapons, and other loot, await you right from the start-Engaging properly spaced Boss fights-Heavy deep dungeon Dark Souls Esq feel-I really can't stress how fun the combat is, it might not have as much content to it as Dark Souls, but it feels better, swings really have weight to them, your character can feel really badass at times.-Interesting areas, enviroments that really draw you in, even if you may not 100% understand where you are sometimes.-Replayable at least 2 or 3 times.Cons:-Heavy technical flaws on launch, numerous crashes randomly and on launching the game, low FPS on high end systems, save file corruption, game breaking bugs, and option settings not saving if you don't use a controller to set them. These are the biggest problem with Lords of The Fallen right now for many people.-No difficulty adjustment, some people love an insanely hard challenge, others might find it too easy, but regardless you don't have a choice in the matter, which will be frustrating to some. Sometimes enemies can be cheap, a lot of the ""difficulty"" can be an illusion. One example is many stronger normals or boss enemies can just outright kill you, they are almost always AOE spells or abilities that if hit, will automatically end your life and wipe all progress from last checkpoint.-Game can get generic at times, lacking  standout customization, magic, etc...and the variety on these isn't that high.-A little short-Easy to get lost without any sense of direction, and the objectives don't update enough for you to tell if you are on the right path; this leads to a lot of backtracking and aimless wandering.Summarrize:4.5/10 The technical flaws, generic feel, and especially the lack of any navigation system or sense of direction are the biggest downfalls with this game, that being said there is a decent game underneath here if the dev follows through on fixing the heavy technical problems of the PC version. Right now I would say if you want to try this game, wait. I mean you can wait and both get it on sale later, and after the kinks have been ironed out if at all.I can thumbs up this, but only barely. The developers have released two patches already, so if they follow through and get the game to a more playable state... Well, there is a good game underneath, it just needs to be pulled out yet.Additional Questions:Is the game minimize friendly? No.Is the game Steam Overlay friendly? Sometimes.Stong Chormatic Abrretion? Yes, but can be disabled but you must disable all Post Processing FX.EDIT: I had to come back and lower my review to a negative this time. About 3 bosses from the end of the game, it just ♥♥♥♥ed up my save file when I died, so I now have to delete it and start the entire game all over again, which after this dreadful experience, I am not doing.This game has been a nightmare of tech problems, which is a shame, because there was a good game in here, beneath terrible level design, difficulty imbalance, and the many many MANY tech problems.Other people have had similar problems, the bugs are not small, they are game breaking/ending, as in you hit a bug thats it, game over, delete and restart all over again:http://fextralife.com/forums/t39758/stuck-in-a-pit-in-the-catacombs/ "

												I absolutely loved this game, I read too many unfair reviews: some dislike it because it is very similar to Dark Souls, and some others dislike it because it is not enough like Dark Souls. In my case, I find it unique enough to be refreshing and familiar enough to feel comfortable. In my humble (yet somewhat outraged) opinion, pay no heed to the reviews, experiment with the game yourself, immerse in the lore and athmosphere and give it some time, it may be, as in my case, a wonderful experience.

												I steered clear of this game do to the harsh reviews at first. There was a great sale so went ahead and picked it up. This game is basically Diablo 3 meets skyrim.  Ironically many of the reviews said this game was too easy. I guess I am an old guy now because I find it crazy hard.  The monsters are amazing and the loot is diablo-esque and kept me going back for more.Note I have had zero problems with the game performance or lockups like some reviewers. i7 wit ri 290 .			"

												mmmmmmh,it's hard to make a rewiew now,but i'll try:Lords of the Fallen it's a good game,not a masterpiece but still good,the gameplay is similar to Dark Souls but its different in many ways,it's challenging in some part and tha art design is fantastic,BUT it has many tecnical issue,you'll complete the first playthrought in 16 hour discovering almost every secret,sidequest are not so good and the bosses (even if anyone is unique and i found them well done) are easy if you played a dark souls game and finally the new game + is pointless.there are pro's and there are cons,but for now i'll say:don't buy this game until it's fixed,then you can be sure that this is a good game.

												™ Arpium -  10.2s: Lords of the Fallen has some really great combat mechanics, you can charge bash with a shield, power swing, combo, dodge roll, backstep, counter, block (except for ridonculously big attacks that pierce your sustainability)....there isn't a vast amount of different npc models but there is a lot of different mastery of how to combat each one. The boss fights are dreadfully hard the first time around, especially the third boss. Everything has to be maneuvered just right or else you will pay for your mistakes big time. You can choose to do hardcore which provides better rewards by not emptying any gained experience into upgrades. The game is fun and very frustrating at times, I don't recommend trying the hardcore route first play through. The game is definitely a 9/10 in my book, especially since the developers are a new face in new-gen gaming advancements. Dark Souls knock-off or not, this game will satisfy action-rpg players until the Witcher 3 is released. I have a 2012 top notch gaming rig, max graphics in this game require a 2014 top-tier gaming rig for positive framerate pool, but the graphics are definitely up there with far cry and crisis series.

												This game rewards you by fighting for longer without using a save point as an actual mechanic, which is a neat idea and the combat is very good. HOWEVER the game is prone to crashing, so after you've wandered about kicking♥♥♥♥♥for huge xp bonuses for an hour only to have the game crash then your fury level goes well over 9000 as you have wasted that hour.Some crashes in games I'll forgive but when crashes conflict directly with the inbuilt game mechanics of not checkpointing regualrly... it's a big stinky problem. If they fix the crashing, get this game easily reccomended! If they don't fix it then... well.. don't.			"

												I haven't play enough to give a well aimed review.I will say this though; If you have a pc that is lower than I5 (or amd equivelant) I wouldn't suggest getting this game unless you don't care about graphics and saying that, the game is still very playable (I've had to turn all my settings down but it doesn't bother me one bit, gameplay>graphics) and really atmospheric. I've seen reviews saying that this game is 26hrs (which is pretty short) but from what I've seen, it makes up for it with game mechanics.Get this game at your own risk.			"

												Looking through the reviews, I suppose this game got patched, since I've yet to havw it crash. I've also only came across 2 bugs. One was when starting up the game, when my display was set to ""Borderless"", it would run in a standard window. (Just applying the borderless option again was enough to fix it), and a weird bug during a boss battle where I would be teleported a few feet away after being knocked back.The game is a lot of fun, and don't let the ""It's easier than Dark Souls"" saying fool you. It's still very challenging. "

												Lords of the Fallen is usually compared to Dark Souls (sometimes unfairly), and while yes, it IS similar, there are differences that make it its own game.The game play is very similar, and if you own a controller and have played dark souls you'll feel right at home.You gain experience from each enemy which can either be gambled or stored, and monsters only seem to respawn if you die, so it will balance earlier.The beginning of the game is very much a tutorial, and it does (thankfully) get a little more difficult as you progress through the story (for me one of the very positive aspects).You also get challenge portals linked to lords. Kill a lord, and then go into the challenge portal, survive and you get loot.The more you have of these, and the more risks you take, the better you will do in the game.The balance of the game is set for people who will use the Checkpoint system, so you may find it either too difficult, or too easy if you circumvent it.The experience is engaging, and quite addictive.Positives:  Great aesthetic  Challenging  Good story/Strong story telling  Rewarding feeling (loot / challenges / accomplishments)  Large levelsNegatives:  There are frame rate issues, and stuttering. Sometimes it will freeze for 1 second or so (seems related to asset loading)  Crashes (I've only had two and they seem to be related to alt+tab) - Alt+tab == crash.  Mixed balance - some enemies are too easy, some are too tough (for no apparent reason - though this may be related to an area you shouldn't yet be in.) "

												There's no end to the problems with this game. The combat is clunky, poorly timed and often unfairly difficult rather than actually difficult. The boss fights in particular have some interesting gimmicks that seem like a positive at first, but really only make sure you never want to play through them ever again because no-one likes solving the same puzzle twice. There are 0 likeable or relatable characters, period. The main man is built like a brick shithouse with a past obtusely obscured, has no discernable motive in any way and is acting for other characters whose motives are nebulous and poorly explained at best. The world is littered with audio notes that serve to fill in the backstory, but since the game wants to try and avoid having an ENTIRELY linear progression, trying to use those notes to learn the history of the world is tedious and scrambled. The dialogue options all feel entirely without consequence. The game has a horrible fascination with giving zero direction to the player except a one sentence task and that's ultimately what killed my enjoyment. I got to an area, realised that I was being given no direction (and in certain cases outright lied to about my direction or given conflicting information by characters and questlog) and put down my controller. After 13 hours I realised exactly how little fun I'd had at all. It's such a shame, as well. The game is graphically beautiful, the aesthetic of the character design and world design is incredibly cohesive and often remarkable. The new twists that LotF brings to standard RPG elements serve it well and are pretty damn unique. It's let down by how little I care about anyone and anything in the world, how boring a lot of the combat and exploration can be and how little the developers care about directing a player through their world.I'd recommend picking it up at maybe $5, checking it out and seeing if you get more out of it than I did.

												I was really hoping to enjoy this game but the combat, which is really the biggest part of the game, is sooooooooooo slooooooooow and clunky. Even just running feels slow. The responsivness just isn't there.The first boss was ridiculous, a later boss was easy just took a long time as I had to fight off other enemies periodically and the main guy had a huge shield I couldn't do much against. You can't get behind shielded enemies unless the attack even then they turn quick but you can't, even with the lightest armor.Shortly after that there is a enemy with a big shield, not a boss just a higher than normal ranking enemy, and he is impossible because he hardly takes any damage. Totally absurd leveling and consistency.Some of the voice acting is pretty bad. Graphics are great though. That is about the only good thing going for this game. I have 13 hours on record but have only played about 2 hours into the game because I have restarted that many times trying to give it another chance. I just can't deal with how slow the combat is and the lack of response in the game. I really don't get what the devs were thinking here.Anyways, big waste of money and time I won't get back. Would be nice if the devs fixed the combat as there seems to be potential for a good game, but that probably won't happen.			"

I had to kill the graveyard boss 3x due to crashes...3. gameplay... coming from DS2 feels like i'm constantly fighting through god damn tar to move! The FPS doesn't help but putting everything on low (for a constant WOOPING 55 ~35 fps that varies all the time and makes consistency impossible) and staying under 25% load it's still slow as HELL! Enemies too, even the ""assassin"" ones move like a block of bricks.Anyway, too late for me to refund (still trying tho) but thought about adding to the overall hate-trend this game deserves.I was aware of spotty mileage with the title but thought about giving it a shot due to sales and got burned beyond belief.

												This is probably one of the most overlooked and under-rated games I have come across.  A real hidden gem.  The art makes it look like any other western fantasy game with oversized swords and shoulderpads, but if you look deeper underneath those fur-padded pouldrons you will find a very well put together game.  The game setting is kinda generic, but it is so well executed that when you start playing you wont even care.It is worth mentioning that the bugs that plagued it at launch are gone, so don't wory about that.The graphics are amazing, though I find the post processing a little overdone.  It is easy to turn off though.The level design is fantastic, and is outdone only by the dark souls franchise itself.  The same goes for the combat.The combat is really satisfying, bug free, and very engaging.  Button mashing will not see you through.			"

												Stick to Dark Souls. Its better, cheaper, and you wont be wondering the entire time, why you decided to play this game instead of Dark Souls. First off, this game looks stunning. It runs very well, and is very flashy. But, it tries so hard to BE Dark Souls. All the monsters I fought looked very cookie cutter and generic. It was a bore. I never once felt any intrigue while playing this game. I love the Souls series, and have played amd beat every one. But I could not play this one to completion. Cannot recommend.			"

Game seems easy because if you know the tactics you can kill every boss, with or without armour. Story sucks but gameplay is good.

												It might seem like a good dark souls-like experience, but what you'll get is a frustating, unbalanced game.It does have good graphics, but the enemy design is just not very good. The game begs you to go full heavy armour cause the only way to go with medium is if you're very very experienced with the game. What about light armour might you ask? Forget it, you will break many keyboards or controllers if you do.The astetics are very good, but the controls ARE clunky dispite what people say. Sometimes the game just refuses to change the camera focus of my target, even if I just stay put and press only the analog stick to change and doesn't do it.To sum up:- Horrible enemy mechanincs.- Clunky controls.- Poor storyline.- Good graphics.

												I've tried very hard to like this game but I'm just not having fun. I knew going into it that it was a slow and clunky dark souls, but I thought it would be a case of 'different is not worse'. I'm now not so sure about that. I am constantly frustrated by combat mechanics that simply don't work as well as they should. There are also a few frustrating non-combat mechanics which seem to have no good reason to exist. Doging and parrying are too slow. The majority of parryable enemy attacks are too fast to reaction parry. If you want to parry you will often have to anticipate blind. Even fewer attacks can be dodged on reaction; the dodge is pretty useless except for bosses with extremly slow attacks. There are some enemies with combo attacks for which the first attack is dogeable on reaction but the second is a guranteed hit because rolls can't be chained; there are too many vulnerabilty frames between successive rolls. And since the buckler isn't very good at blocking this all adds up to an agility character having virtually no reliable tools. It's not fun to play. Like DS, if you die you drop your xp and you must return to the spot you died to recover it. The difference however is that in this game there is a timer. If you don't get back in time then they are gone.  In DS I might die often, but I rarely fail to recover my souls. In this game however it seems like the opposite will be the case; recovering my xp after dying seems like it will be rare. If I die early then I can recover but the xp dropped is insignificant, and if I die late (when carrying a lot of xp) it seems impossible to get back before the timer expires. Also like DS, you can return to the checkpoint to recover your healing items. However in this game that does *not* cause the enemies to respawn. It makes absolutely no sense. If you're not going to respawn the enemies then why make me run all the way back and forth through the empty stage to refill my healing?? The only incentive offered to not do this (besides the hassle of running back and forth) is that is resets a xp multiplier that increases slowly the longer you go without resting. However, for casual players, the xp multiplier is insignificant compared to the risk of dying and losing all your xp because of the stupid recovery timer mentioned above. Playing this game involves constantaly running back to the previous checkpoint to refill healing and bank xp. "

												I paid 9€ so I don't want to be too hard on the game, but it's far from perfect. I heard it was difficult, but that's not the word I'd use. I'd go more with unfair (I mean, I've died only once from the start until a bit after the 2nd boss, and it was because of the lock screen button bug). The combat feels kind of sloppy, and it's too slow (you don't have many ways to do things faster without getting hit), which is fine for some enemies, but not for every single enemy in the game. The first bosses are boring and spammy, plus they're just biggest version of the other enemy knights.Pros:- The game looks great.- The combat feels good against certain enemies (specially those that don't have a giant shield and take 2h of running around to kill).Cons:- The game tries to imitate Dark Souls' combat mechanics, but fails. Most of the combats up until now have consisted of running in circles around the enemy until they decide to attack, because if you try to attack first, you'll get hit.- The 2nd boss adds to that the ability to spawn adds, so the fight consists of: a) Run around the boss until it attacks so you can avoid the giant shield. b) You hit it 2/3 times, so it shields up, becomes invulnerable and spawns 1/2 adds. c) Rinse and repeat.- The ""Lock camera on enemy"" button works only when it feels like it... I got hit a couple of times in a boss because it didn't work.- All the enemies look the same.- The 1st ability I got feels totally useless, so that isn't encouraging either.- The dialogs and characters (up until this point, at least), don't help to make me want to keep on playing.I'll try to continue, but everytime I face one of those knights with a giant shield and we start to dance around each other, I feel like just deleting the game.

												Probably one of the first reviews for a game on Steam i've made...but it has to be done.  I'm not averse to challenge or a steep difficulty curve.  But that's only acceptable when the game's mechanics and controls are tight enough to overcome those hurdles.  Lords of the Fallen does the complete opposite.  First off, the good parts. The game looks pretty damn good.  The graphics and surroundings are very atmospheric and draw you into the game's world.  It runs smooth on a moderately spec'd PC with shadows turned to low since they're mostly a resource hog that provides little to no immersion (IMO). The armor and weapon designs are awesome. I'm a huge fan of variety when it comes to gear, and that was one of the main draws to this game for me.  The leveling mechanics and loot drop boost based on how much XP you're carrying is actually pretty clever, although the increase you get based on the amount of XP you have is almost pointless, 5 levels worth of XP to get a 1.2 times boost? Um...no.  Then there's variety in gear choice based upon stats.  You can choose to be a walking fortress that's slow but tough with heavy armor, or a nimble rogue with super quick reflexes and little armor to weight you down!...or at least that's how it SHOULD be.  Sure with your carcass clad in plates of metal you roll as slow as an overweight armadillo attempting to do a cartwheel, which is only normal I suppose.  But get butt naked and you can now roll with the speed of a mongoose and the reflexes of a cat!....which is where the bad comes into play.  Weight stats on armor and weapons are a lie!The game pits you against mobs ranging from tiny annoying spiders to monster sized tower shield weilding enemies.  Regardless of what enemy it is, they can attack two or even three times in the same window of opportunity it takes you to get 1 maybe 2 swings if you're lucky.  But wait...didn't the game say that the enemies are governed by the same rule set that you are? Meaning that they can be stunned, staggered, blocked or dodged just as well as you? Sure, so long as you're aware that your character isn't really Harkyn, but his stupid cousin Derpkyn, who takes 3 seconds to swing a 1h axe with a weight of 1.00 and can't roll out of the way of an enemy to, well, literally save his life!  Let me break it down in Derpkyn like terms.   You're slow.  And when I mean slow, i mean ♥♥♥♥ing slow!  A 1 handed axe, the starter shield and all Rogue light weight armor does NOTHING to increase your ability to dodge incoming attacks!  The weight stats are a complete lie.  Sure, the animation makes it LOOK like you're rolling as fast as Sonic on crack while going after a Chili dog, but it's all in your head.  Because even though you may look like you're about to break the sound barrier you get your butt plugged by an enemy who's 4 feet taller than you, has more armor than Iron Man and a weapon that should take the power of a thousand white hot suns to move!Derpkyn is slow.  Regardless of armor and/or weapons.  The game isn't hard because of mechanics or learning curve. The game is hard because the movements of all your attacks are slow as frozen balls.  Plain and simple. False difficulty due to forced sluggish combat is lame.  "

												People mention that this game is not Dark Souls and should not be reviewed as if it were a Dark Souls title. That being said, a game creates an experience for the player, and if they made a game influenced by Dark Souls then that relationship will be inherent in the experience because that is how it was designed. The Good: Exploring the level is enticing and bound to create some interesting experiences. The ""bonfire"" mechanic where you can opt out of a character refresh for higher experience points is an interesting take on the checkpoint system for a harcore ARPG.The Okay: The combat is really sluggish and clunky. You need to get used to slower dodge mechanics and a slight input delay if you are coming fresh off of a Souls experience. Once you get used to it, the game is definitely doable and offers a unique challenge. The feeling it provides the player is less of a nimble assassin, or powerful warrior, and more of an old man doing his best not to die. Not bad necessarily, just different. The Bad: Boss Battles and Crashes. The boss battles are very drawn out. This would be fine if there was multiple phases, or that gameplay led to a high paced action battle. As mentioned earlier, the combat is slow. A long slow battle becomes boring. Even when you have been trying over and over again and finally succeed, you don't let out a victory cry, you just feel like you came off a slow day of work and are finally done. This game loves to crash in the second half of boss battles, as if it wasn't tedious enough.This game is a different experience that is not super terrible. They tainted the experience by drawing a lot of influence from Dark Souls and missing the boat on some of the significant elements that created such a strong community. If they modified the bonfire and souls aspects to make it less like dark souls and more like its own game, the experience may have stood out and been judged by its own merit.			"

												not a bad game, while the combat and style is similar to dark souls this is a very different game with a more vocalized story. how ever by comparison the over all feel of the game is a lot more clunky with almost every armor build leaving you feeling heavy and some unintuitive weapon attack styles. at times the camera can be horrible offering you little to no view of the fight as the game often stuffs you into tight hallways leading to your death. Waiting for an opening can be tedious as enemies can take quite a while to launch an attack and with no way to provoke them, small openings, and some builds lacking the ability to break an enemies gaurd comabt can sometimes get frustrating. the powers are very intersting and unique but some are more usefull than others in cases where many of support powers have no effect on bosses leaving people that took offencive powers with a signifcant advantage. while most bosses are fun and even offer a challange there are a few that are way to strong with way to much health and a gimic that doesnt work, either they recover too quickly, dont have any form of tell just simply launch an attack leaving you scrambling to find the counter or change their pattern so irregularly that the gimic required for the fight simply is ineffective. the two biggest let downs of this game however are its pittiful replay value offering nothing more than slight change to the ending cinamtic where you don't even get to view the conciquences of your actions it is displayed in a way that makes it seem as though nothing changed. and the worst part of the game is its length, this is a full price game and in one run i got over half the achievements found almost all of the secrets and cleared all the story and sidequests. All this took a total of 16 hours and the NG+ feature is trivial once you've spent the time to power up your character during your first play. all in all i had fun with the game but its just simply not roth full price 4/10			"

												I have been playing the game now for about 5 hours & I have to say I am really enjoying it. After playing both Dark Souls 1 & 2 this game is definately more forgiving and does not have the depth of the souls series with combat, exploration or magic types, but the combat is fun, responsive, a good challenge (for me so far) & lit ook really cool (the artstyle reminds me of Warhammer Fantasy & Darksiders.) I did have a few crashes on launch, but they put a temp fix in while working on a patch & I havent had anoher crash after playing for 3 hours straight. So far I would say it is worth picking up, I will update as I get further in to it.			"

In hints they say that it is important to use camera lock on your enemy, but camera lock does not work as it should! If you go behind, as I often did as I played rogue, camera become unlocked and I can't see enemy, so they hit me in the back and I die. It happened more often then it should. In 1 hour it happend 5+ times.Dodge suck in this game. If you will play, never dodge - block. If you try to dodge behind enemy and strike it in the back - you die while dodging. If you stay behind the wall and enemy attack and you do not block it - you die.I am learning programming in 3 month and even I can see that people who made this game are bad at their jobs.This game is bad, really.

Also repeatable.There is  much to the story,and the storyline looks like someone made it in a hurry.FPS problems. I got a lot of graphical/frame rate problems fighting enemies. I had much expectations for this game, but here are my quick grades:Graphics- 8/10 (If I don' look at the FPS problems)Music-6/10 Nothing specialStory/Lore- 4/10 Minimal Gameplay- 4/10 Repeat to the Overall 6/10If  played Dark Souls or any game  that is like it, do  waste your time on this one. It is  worth it. "

												Lords Of The Fallen attempts to seize the crown of the Action RPG genre.Maybe another time.PROS:+ arguably, aesthetics(fans of Warhammer will be pleased by armour and weapon designs)+ using heavy weapons is great+ occasionally, combat..CONS:- ..which(combat), most of the time, is clunky as hell- the plot; you couldn't care less about the fate of Harkyn and his world- the general ""heaviness"" of the game(works just fine when using a two handed weapon and an ultra heavy armour, in other cases it is infuriating)I understand the creative process behind this game.Take a successful formula, give it a spin or two and- voila!Sadly, the end result is simply not enjoyable enough.If the game is meant to be challenging and difficult, it has to present the player with, at least, decently polished mechanics.LOTF's gameplay is neither precise nor tweaked enough to make the experience rewarding.I tried to convince myself a few times that the game has enough value to be recommended.Don't help Lords Of The Fallen get up.It isn't worth your time.

												Easiest way I can describe this game:It's like Souls. Only with broken hit boxes, broken parrys, stun locks that go on for a frame longer than needed and punishing in the wrong ways. Think playing Souls 2, but as though it relied on a shoddy netcode that resulted in lag. That's about how some of the deaths feel. Dodge the same attack 4 times, but that 5th time  you get hit and it feels like you were desynced or some♥♥♥♥♥♥.. even though it's obviously a single player title. So it's like Souls. But the hussied up Chinese quality version. It's pretty, does what you wanted and It was a good price on sale; but after a few hours you find yourself wishing you had just spent more on the brand named item. Each time I find myself thinking that I'm enjoying the game it quickly reminds me of why the reviews are a solid ""mixed"". In short. It's a knockoff . Nothing more, nothing less. A lot off superficial work that went into something meant to be a cash in on the ""Souls-like"" genre.I do plan on seeing it through... but something tells me the journey and payoff is going to feel like  a road trip gone wrong. You set out planing on having a good time, but after 2 days on the road, seeing nothing interesting and eating ♥♥♥♥♥♥ truckstop food you finally get to where you  were going. Only to find out it's just a tourist trap and not worth staying at for more than 30 minutes.

												I'm having a hard time getting into this game simply because your character just moves like a turtle.  Expect to get hit alot.  I like characters who can move faster and dodge quickly.  It feels like your moving in slow motion and by the time your guy actually starts to dodge, not as you press the dodge button, but shortly after, you are already getting sliced and diced  like a pepporni pizza.  Your enemies you fight move faster than you.  Bull Crap!			"

												Probably one of the first reviews for a game on Steam i've made...but it has to be done.  I'm not averse to challenge or a steep difficulty curve.  But that's only acceptable when the game's mechanics and controls are tight enough to overcome those hurdles.  Lords of the Fallen does the complete opposite.  First off, the good parts. The game looks pretty damn good.  The graphics and surroundings are very atmospheric and draw you into the game's world.  It runs smooth on a moderately spec'd PC with shadows turned to low since they're mostly a resource hog that provides little to no immersion (IMO). The armor and weapon designs are awesome. I'm a huge fan of variety when it comes to gear, and that was one of the main draws to this game for me.  The leveling mechanics and loot drop boost based on how much XP you're carrying is actually pretty clever, although the increase you get based on the amount of XP you have is almost pointless, 5 levels worth of XP to get a 1.2 times boost? Um...no.  Then there's variety in gear choice based upon stats.  You can choose to be a walking fortress that's slow but tough with heavy armor, or a nimble rogue with super quick reflexes and little armor to weight you down!...or at least that's how it SHOULD be.  Sure with your carcass clad in plates of metal you roll as slow as an overweight armadillo attempting to do a cartwheel, which is only normal I suppose.  But get butt naked and you can now roll with the speed of a mongoose and the reflexes of a cat!....which is where the bad comes into play.  Weight stats on armor and weapons are a lie!The game pits you against mobs ranging from tiny annoying spiders to monster sized tower shield weilding enemies.  Regardless of what enemy it is, they can attack two or even three times in the same window of opportunity it takes you to get 1 maybe 2 swings if you're lucky.  But wait...didn't the game say that the enemies are governed by the same rule set that you are? Meaning that they can be stunned, staggered, blocked or dodged just as well as you? Sure, so long as you're aware that your character isn't really Harkyn, but his stupid cousin Derpkyn, who takes 3 seconds to swing a 1h axe with a weight of 1.00 and can't roll out of the way of an enemy to, well, literally save his life!  Let me break it down in Derpkyn like terms.   You're slow.  And when I mean slow, i mean ♥♥♥♥ing slow!  A 1 handed axe, the starter shield and all Rogue light weight armor does NOTHING to increase your ability to dodge incoming attacks!  The weight stats are a complete lie.  Sure, the animation makes it LOOK like you're rolling as fast as Sonic on crack while going after a Chili dog, but it's all in your head.  Because even though you may look like you're about to break the sound barrier you get your butt plugged by an enemy who's 4 feet taller than you, has more armor than Iron Man and a weapon that should take the power of a thousand white hot suns to move!Derpkyn is slow.  Regardless of armor and/or weapons.  The game isn't hard because of mechanics or learning curve. The game is hard because the movements of all your attacks are slow as frozen balls.  Plain and simple. False difficulty due to forced sluggish combat is lame.  "

												I paid 9€ so I don't want to be too hard on the game, but it's far from perfect. I heard it was difficult, but that's not the word I'd use. I'd go more with unfair (I mean, I've died only once from the start until a bit after the 2nd boss, and it was because of the lock screen button bug). The combat feels kind of sloppy, and it's too slow (you don't have many ways to do things faster without getting hit), which is fine for some enemies, but not for every single enemy in the game. The first bosses are boring and spammy, plus they're just biggest version of the other enemy knights.Pros:- The game looks great.- The combat feels good against certain enemies (specially those that don't have a giant shield and take 2h of running around to kill).Cons:- The game tries to imitate Dark Souls' combat mechanics, but fails. Most of the combats up until now have consisted of running in circles around the enemy until they decide to attack, because if you try to attack first, you'll get hit.- The 2nd boss adds to that the ability to spawn adds, so the fight consists of: a) Run around the boss until it attacks so you can avoid the giant shield. b) You hit it 2/3 times, so it shields up, becomes invulnerable and spawns 1/2 adds. c) Rinse and repeat.- The ""Lock camera on enemy"" button works only when it feels like it... I got hit a couple of times in a boss because it didn't work.- All the enemies look the same.- The 1st ability I got feels totally useless, so that isn't encouraging either.- The dialogs and characters (up until this point, at least), don't help to make me want to keep on playing.I'll try to continue, but everytime I face one of those knights with a giant shield and we start to dance around each other, I feel like just deleting the game.

												Right now as I sunk into this game 2 days I can honestly say that this was suposed to be hard beat em up rpg game but it gone out as nicer looking easier and quite buggy game similar features as dark souls.With similar i dont mean that it is same or anyway more that game mechanics resembles.First it looks quite nice graphicaly on scale for me 9/10 and it does what it should and does nto want you to play graphics.Second mechanics well here is the harder part beceuse anyway as I tried to get a freaking grip on some things how work the freaking game started to reacto totally different.AI behavior is getting more eratic and random. In one way good in second way totally stupid.I mean that some people will get super easy fights. And some will get super hard fights cause when the AI wants it skips parts of animations and hands you your♥♥♥♥♥ It might be a bug but it is happening on all my 3 characters as with rogue I have super easy run while warrior is extremly hard. There is a lot more like hitbox issues and so that make you super angry sometime but sometime you will exploit them.with this part 5/10Playability well in this case it is easily controlable with keyboard and mouse as with controller and you have a lot of settings to play with.It has no multiplayer as far as i did not notic anything. And has a lot of dlcs well everybody can live with that but this whole game gives me feeling i would not replay it more than once.and on this i give my overal 7/10points as it could have been polished a big bit better.

												Probably one of the first reviews for a game on Steam i've made...but it has to be done.  I'm not averse to challenge or a steep difficulty curve.  But that's only acceptable when the game's mechanics and controls are tight enough to overcome those hurdles.  Lords of the Fallen does the complete opposite.  First off, the good parts. The game looks pretty damn good.  The graphics and surroundings are very atmospheric and draw you into the game's world.  It runs smooth on a moderately spec'd PC with shadows turned to low since they're mostly a resource hog that provides little to no immersion (IMO). The armor and weapon designs are awesome. I'm a huge fan of variety when it comes to gear, and that was one of the main draws to this game for me.  The leveling mechanics and loot drop boost based on how much XP you're carrying is actually pretty clever, although the increase you get based on the amount of XP you have is almost pointless, 5 levels worth of XP to get a 1.2 times boost? Um...no.  Then there's variety in gear choice based upon stats.  You can choose to be a walking fortress that's slow but tough with heavy armor, or a nimble rogue with super quick reflexes and little armor to weight you down!...or at least that's how it SHOULD be.  Sure with your carcass clad in plates of metal you roll as slow as an overweight armadillo attempting to do a cartwheel, which is only normal I suppose.  But get butt naked and you can now roll with the speed of a mongoose and the reflexes of a cat!....which is where the bad comes into play.  Weight stats on armor and weapons are a lie!The game pits you against mobs ranging from tiny annoying spiders to monster sized tower shield weilding enemies.  Regardless of what enemy it is, they can attack two or even three times in the same window of opportunity it takes you to get 1 maybe 2 swings if you're lucky.  But wait...didn't the game say that the enemies are governed by the same rule set that you are? Meaning that they can be stunned, staggered, blocked or dodged just as well as you? Sure, so long as you're aware that your character isn't really Harkyn, but his stupid cousin Derpkyn, who takes 3 seconds to swing a 1h axe with a weight of 1.00 and can't roll out of the way of an enemy to, well, literally save his life!  Let me break it down in Derpkyn like terms.   You're slow.  And when I mean slow, i mean ♥♥♥♥ing slow!  A 1 handed axe, the starter shield and all Rogue light weight armor does NOTHING to increase your ability to dodge incoming attacks!  The weight stats are a complete lie.  Sure, the animation makes it LOOK like you're rolling as fast as Sonic on crack while going after a Chili dog, but it's all in your head.  Because even though you may look like you're about to break the sound barrier you get your butt plugged by an enemy who's 4 feet taller than you, has more armor than Iron Man and a weapon that should take the power of a thousand white hot suns to move!Derpkyn is slow.  Regardless of armor and/or weapons.  The game isn't hard because of mechanics or learning curve. The game is hard because the movements of all your attacks are slow as frozen balls.  Plain and simple. False difficulty due to forced sluggish combat is lame.  "

												Lords of the fallen is often accused of being just a dark souls rip-off, to be honest it doesn't rip-off dark souls because this is not dark souls, the game is extremely linear, barerly to no exploration and the level design just can't compete with dark souls 1.Does this mean that the game is bad? well no, it's not awful, it does a lot of thing right but it has a lot of issues.Issue 1: The game performance is extremely inconsistent.My pc is not stellar in any way but i think that most pc users will not enjoy this port's perfomance, my frame-rate varies to 40fps to 8fps, sometimes even when there is nothing on the screen it drops to 15 or even 10 fps.The graphics look incredible at max settings, but at low they look horrible, i know that low settings the game does not have to look spectacular but the thing i don't understand is why my fps gain is 5 or 10 compared to max settings, even lowering the resolution does not help me at all.Issue 2: Combat:Combat in lords of the fallen is somewhat of a mixed bag, it starts just like a dark souls game but then it becomes extremely unfair and boring with bosses.It's unfair because most enemies will practically do massive damage to you while knoking you to the ground, just so you will get up and then KILL YOU BECAUSE THEY SOMEHOW FORGOT TO MAKE YOU INVINCIBLE WHILE YOU GET UP (you can't dodge while getting up on the ground), or you could equip a weapon that attacks faster but does little to no damage to those enemies, and to make it worse those types of enemies always go in packs of 3 or more.The boss-fights are complete and utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ this is another huge complaint i have, they only have like 3 or 4 attacks max,one when they are close to you, another one when you are far and one special attack. They are extremely predictable but worse of all is that it makes battles boring, it's just attack, dodge, attack, dodge... you get the idea.Issue 3: Exploration and the landscape.For a game that it's said to be based on dark souls is very suprising to find that they didn't implement one of the best things in the dark souls games, the exploration. It's an extremely linear game with barerly any exlploration at al and when it does offer you a chance to explore, it ends with a room whitout nothing in there or an item, it never goes beyond this and it's extremely frustating.The places you go in the game are not very inspiring either, they look like they just look at hellish monsters and places, while they at first look inspiring, it quickly becomes clear that it's the only theme you will see with the monsters.Issue 4: ChallengeOne of the most nerving things about this game is that unlike other games that provide a hard challange, but are fair is that they give you enough room to prepare and learn from your mistakes, this game does not, it's not a challenge to be thrown in a room where you will get constantly killed by a monster that takes 100 hits to kill while it kills you in 1 or 2 hits, and to make it worst he has other monsters that chase you and want you dead, just so can drive you ♥♥♥♥ing insane, if this was, you know optional i would say, meh it's not worth it, but when the game does this 3 or 5 times it gets really on my nerves, so no this is not a challenge it's ♥♥♥♥ing unfair.So no, i will just continue to play dark souls, which is what i should be doing in the first place.

												After a year of being unable to play this game, I finally played it today, and I'm rather disappointed.Story: 3/10 - The story is very close to non-existent. You play a hardcore criminal named Harkyn who was conscripted to defeat the bad guys and keep them from doing what all bad guys do - dominate or destroy. When the game first starts, you're thrown into the middle of cutscene that has no real solid foundation. Cool visuals, but you have no idea what's going on. Once the cutscene finishes, you build your character (simple decisions of starting equipment and magic spells you want to be able to unlock), and then, without any sort of information or story events leading up to it, you're suddenly in the room of some tower with some scholarly type guy and you're looking for some other guy who is apparently ""The Guy.""The story is all over the place, assuming there was a story in the first place.Gameplay: 4/10 - Basically a spiritual clone of the Dark Souls games (only difference is that you can pause, when all is said and done.) There's talk of fantastic, powerful attack combos, but each weapon only really has one or two attacks, and it's either rapid swining, or slower swinging that doesn't really do much more damage. Nothing comboish about it. The Gauntlet is supposed to be your magical long ranged attacks. Good for doing a chunk of damage to an enemy, but, unless you use a magic energy shard, which you don't ever have many of, you can only shoot the gauntlet maybe once every 30-60 seconds. Utterly useless against bosses. Of course, I wasn't specializing in magic attacks, but I doubt they're much better in a Magic build. You also lose all your experience when you die, and have to run and grab that experience without dying again - because the huge chance that you'll lose all your progress is just so appealing these days. Sure, you can put in all the experience into a checkpoint crystal, but those aren't around every corner like Starbucks. This game is only for the masochist at heart.Visuals: 6/10 - Not the best looking game, but it does look pretty awesome. Weather effects and environments are pretty cool. Other than that, just about all the environments in most games these days are pretty cool, so LOTF doesn't really bring anything breathtaking to the picture.In the end, Harkyn's an anti-hero you really have no desire to connect with, the enemies are needlessly tedious to fight, chances are you're not going to find any equipment worthwhile if you go the Light Armor/Deception route (That's basically the rogue build)..... not really a fun mix of crap at all.Overall: 4/10 - Could've been something. Had a lot of potential, but the devs just made bad design choices and couldn't quite pull off what they managed to put in. Definitely not worth the year wait. Or the $50.			"

												 Dark Souls Lite has all the real Dark Souls taste you've come to know and love with only half the Souls for those who are watching their soul intake. You know exactly what you're getting. You're getting a game that saw how popular the Dark Souls style game was and quickly made their own. It's not as good. That's just a fact. If you're looking for more Dark Souls, just play Dark Souls again... But if Dark Souls was just a little too subtle for you and you felt it would have benefited from a more overt plot, you should give it a go. I'll be the first to admit I never finished this game. I enjoy taking my time in games like Dark Souls, but with this I felt like I was losing time, not spending it. If you're a hipster and Dark Souls is just too damned mainstream for you or if you just want to branch out and try something similar but not identical, you'll have a good time... Or in the case of the hipster, you'll do mental knot tying to convince yourself you're having a better time than people playing Dark Souls and be sure to tell everyone about it.			"

												Beautiful Game, but riddled with inadequacies in game design.   A dark souls wanna be that more closely mimics dark souls 2 than the original.  Enemies are difficult for no other reason then they are tedious to defeat and you'll find yourself wanting to move along through the game and thus make some rushed mistakes that gets you killed.  A flaccid storyline leaves the player unmotivated to uninterested while character interactions feel artificial and surreal when they occur.   The game seemed largely driven by art and animation which, while masterfully done, leaves the rest of the game to suffer.			"

												""I love it but i hate it"" - This is how i can describe my feelings toward this game.Here is the funny thing... this game isn't hard because of slow tactical combat... this game is hard because this game is flawed. There is no balance between enemies - it's easer to defeat boss than one Knight or even Shieldmaster - why? Because of difference in space you have to deal with your enemies. Basically combat system in this game is designed to work well when you have enough space to dodge and keep distance from you opponent but pretty much fails when you are in tight spots which this game have tons (e.g. catacombs). I would love to reccomend this type of game because it's fun to beat hard games BUT i don't want to have people at my door screaming in madness for refunds.UPDATE: NO F... IT I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PIECE OF CRASHING JUNK.			"

												I will try to be short and to the point. If you are looking for a darksouls replacement this is not it. the combat is not intuitive the boss battles have cheep mechanics as often as not. This game often substitutes genuine dificulty with enemy spamming or broken enemy abilities. Also it does not balance how hard an enemy is with the exp they give. I found that farming the begging area I could get exp much faster and with next to no risk to my character. Over all this game is not terrible but it suffers in many areas. One of the biggest is in combat. Rolling has become almost completly inefective in this game but at the same time tanking hits is often not an option either leaving you with shooting things at a range or just grinding until your fingers break.

Spent extra hours in game trying to find the path/door to continue story.3rd boss was easy but took many tries to figure out how to beat.Nice invetory screen lay out.Cool looking armor.Very fun game, reminds me a lot of Dark Souls.No need for heavy armor. you get by just fine with light armor, they give you more than enough health pots.Best spell in game is the one that boosts defenses and heals you over time.

												Ever played a souls game? It's basically that but more clunky, less cryptic, shorter and easier. Easier doesn't mean ""easy"" and the game still offers a challenge.All in all I did enjoy the game for what it was, but it could have been better.			"

												Lords of the Fallen is an action rpg that plays very similarly to Dark Souls though it's a considerably better looking and also a lot more forgiving game. The boss battles i fought before the game got unplayable was very predictable and too passive which makes them too easy to defeat but it doesn't mean you can just slash away and hope to defeat them, the bosses still have attack patterns you must learn to defeat them just like Dark Souls and that in itself makes it feel rewarding just not to the extent of Dark Souls.Lords of the Fallen isn't a straight copy of Dark Souls however and tries to have more focus on the story and have more interactions between Harkyn and npc's to mixed results since the dialogues are often uninteresting and awkward much thanks to the less than stellar lip sync and facial/body expressions which could have used a lot more work to be more natural and the story is nothing to write home about either since it's the usual save the world from demons (Rhogar) that have been done so many times before and better, a generic story is not always a bad thing but it needs to stand out imo  because it have been done so many times and this game fails to do it for me personally.I would argue that yes the story in games like this is less important than the gameplay and therefore i could have overlooked it if the rest of the game was well done but more of that later.As for the main character Harkyn, you are an criminal that tries to atone for his past crimes and while there's potential in that i couldn't connect with him as a character because he feels empty and void of personality it's feels like there's nothing that drives him which obviously his strive for atonement and will to save the world does but the game fails to make that connection with the player.Now to the most important aspects of the game, gameplay and perfomance which i expected a lot from but was left disappointed. I really wanted to like this game and that it would be a worthy rival to Dark Souls and for all it's faults i really liked the gameplay WHEN it WORKS then it feels heavy, satisfying and impactful just like it should but every know and then it gets stuck in it's clunkiness and unresponsiveness and forces you to click several times to strike your enemy and dodge an attack which often makes you miss or fail to dodge in time almost like the animation for it is too slow, also the lock on feels very unprecise and could use more tweakes.Now to to the main offender it's performance which is absolutely horrible, very disappointed and the day one patch didn't do anything for me personally, the game feels very sluggish even when the fps is fine and add constant crashes to that which made me give up when i got to  the commander boss, 7 tries and 7 crashes and 5 of those was near the end of the battle, gg CI gg not acceptable at all and Lords of the Fallen is just another in a long list of broken games that's been rushed out lately and my total playtime yet ended with a staggering amount of 40 crashes.For that reason i can't recommend this game for full price and will wait for a bunch of patches, maybe then it will finally reach some of it's potential and be a fun game, there's a lot of potential in this game but the edges feels way too rough right now.Current Score: 4/10- but if they patches the performance and tweak the gameplay a bit to make it smoother and more responsive then i will happily raise the score to a 7/10 a good but flawed game.Last Words: the score may seem low but be aware this is from my experience with the game and might differ from yours but with these many crashes/bugs it feels unplayable atm and thus i can't justify to spend full price on it until it's sorted out.

												I bought this game on release day, I paid full price. You may notice I only have 0.1 hours on it, that's because I can't get further than the Nvidia splash screen without it crashing. I've tried EVERYTHING to fix it. I upgraded my ram (I was excited and thought it'd be worth it), I verified the game hundreds of times, re-downloaded it just as many and I've tried launching the game with commands to skip the cutscene or at a lower resolution and much more.Had enough of trying, it's been over a month and it's costed me more than it's worth.Specs:i5-4670k8gb 1833mhx Hyperx RamAsus Matrix Platinum 280xCrucial 250gb SSDGigabyte Z97 DS3HEDIT: I had to re-install Windows 8 so everything was wiped and I installed new drivers, I managed to get to the menu. I will play the game and add onto this review.EDIT: I've played the game for a bit now, if I could I'd bring it up to a neutral review. The inital effort of getting this game to work has turned me off it but the gameplay is quite good!Things to note:- Nice looking game- Combat feels heavy and patience in combat pays off- Quite a lot of items and weapons, there's varity- The magic was fun to use, there's quite a few different types in the game- Bosses seem to take forever to die, requires a patient gamer. Is not the same 'feeling' as a Dark Souls boss! Maybe I'm rubbish though.- May have been inspired by Dark Souls but it really isn't the same, it's different enough to stand on its own- This is definitely a game worth getting in the sales, I would not buy it at full price knowing what I know now.

												I bought this game charmed by the trailers. When I start playing it was like its fine, graphics are good mechanics do its job. As soon as I made my progress in game I saw a lot of influence of games like DarkSiders, Dark Souls etc but unfortunately with a bad performance. As we progress the plot is simply shallow I seriously hoped for more. The ""Choices"" that you make barely influence the gameplay only cinematics in end game changes. The ending is just a big disapointment cinematics made in the style of Fallout series, there could be much more about it!Boss fights are pattern like all along and boring some casual creatures gave me more trouble than some bosses...The Great plus is hack and slash type of gaming and graphics rest need a serious re-do. The skill tree for each class is to small. 4 main ""spells"" when you play NG+ you have another 4 skills from another class but game just gets boring as I progress (made brawler then assasin). The only thing that is chalenging in this game is try to beat it without checkpoints and thats all. The whole idea of a game is great packed in nice graphics but game needs a lot of development in plot and boss mechanics. If You didn't play darksiders or darksouls this game will look ok but if you want to spend money and you consider games I mentioned above buy one of DS.  "

												Where do I start ? The graphics engine is very, very poor optimized. And the graphics are like DARKSIDERS (a 2010 game). But Darksiders is a MARVELOUS game and LoF is crap... I refuse to coment on Dark Souls comparations because it´s like comparing water and wine... The sounds are... Where the sounds are ? I really don´t know.... Playability and level design are ok, at least. But the controler response are erratic, the game frames freeze at times (and you die) and, in the end, it´s irritating. The first boss are ridiculous, your weapons are a joke, you move like ""slow motion"" EVEN whithout armor... It´s VERY frustrating to play games like this if you like games like Darksiders or Dark Souls. Do yourself a favor and don´t buy this.- Enemies just teleport to places. They just ""appear"" out of nowhere. Very annoying.- Rolling sucks. A LOT. Many times you will roll in the wrong direction - or will be stuck in a corner or a wall.- Magic bar bug - no fill above 80%.- Save bug - sometimes you will save in a way that you will die in a loop. You will lost ALL your progression.- Enemies STAMINA - I think there´s NO STAMINA to Enemies, because they can beat you, defend, roll, and kill you and they even blink....- STAB Power - You will have to wait A LOT to be capable to use this and... It MISSES half of times. Its ♥♥♥♥ing RIDICULOUS !- Magic bar is very, VERY SLOOOOW.... Gauntlet is useless....- Gameplay - If your build is a TANK with a MASSIVE armor and a very BIG WEAPON, the game is so easy.... other way around, if you like to play a ""agility"" build...you are ♥♥♥♥ed ! There´s no balance. You only have one choice: go Tank, or be a weakling....- ONE hit kill... you WILL be very angry. Believe me !- Very confuse world. There´s no map AND you get lost so easily....- Crashes. A lot....			"

												Dark Souls Lite: Prepare to Crash EditionPros:-Looks pretty-A slightly more forgiving soulslike, generally (see cheesy enemy types below)-Interesting leveling/loot system in theory-Combat feels weighty, if a bit slowCons:-Crashes frequently-Some enemy types are walking blocks of cheese, and the best way to deal with them is with even more cheese (hurr durr shield charge)-Game heavily leans toward a str/heavy/turtle playstyle (hurr durr shield charge)-Said shield charge is wonky as hell, leaving you standing there next to an enemy with your♥♥♥♥♥♥in your hand half the time-Crashes frequently-Combat and movement feels a bit slow/sluggish for a soulslike-Annoying leveling/loot system in practice-Save system was recently nerfed, compounding the annoyance of the leveling/loot system-Terrible voice acting and writing (though kind of expected tbh)-Did I mention this game crashes frequently?I really wanted to like this game, but it was quite disappointing.  If you can find it in the $10-15 range, I'd say it's worth giving it a shot if you're into the Souls games, otherwise you might want to just pass.  It's hard to justify spending more than that with the frequent crashes, lack of MP, and relatively short playtime (10-20 hours), though there is ng+ if you're a glutton for punishment.  I will give this game another shot down the road probably, and hopefully most of the issues and kinks will have been worked out by then.			"

												For those who didn't play Dark Souls much, if at all ( i didn't i was gonan smash my computer that game was so difficult) This game take from DS in terms of difficulty, though tones it down a notch. And makes the combat nowhere near as tedious. Combat is still kinda tricky sometimes, as stamina plays the biggest role in it and with switching a single gear item, your char could go from fairly agile, to a ♥♥♥♥ing slug in a second. this i've found is the most difficult part of the game, managing speed and attack. At the start of the game you can 3-4 hit enemies and they die. After the 2nd boss, which isn't very far in, you can no longer rely on those tactics. Enemies with shields become promonent and, for me, some encounters can take 5 minutes to complete. AND then you got 2 guys coming at you at once, and the attack patterns get all ♥♥♥♥ed and its hard to read enemies. For me, this is the hardest modern game i've played, and enjoyed playing. DS was too unforgiving and tedious for me to care for. But LotF find a right spot i think.Caution: If you are not a fan of dying alot in the same area, 40 seconds after you respwan, for like half an hr at a time, don't get game.

												A beautiful game with gorgeous environments that tries - and utterly fails - to be Dark Souls. Weapons swing too slowly by far, and enemies recover from strikes - both their own and staggers - far too quickly. Environments are crowded and character models are far too large for said environs. Bosses are larger enemies with enormous health bars and quick recovery from animations. All in all, its more exercise in frustration, than challenge. I recommend most fans - and especially those who came for more tight Souls like game play - avoid this title. Hopefully many of the weapon speed and animation recovery issues will be fixed in a patch, but barring that, skip this and go back to Dark Souls or its sequel, as both are far superior to this blatant clone.

												NOT A SOULS GAME. Now if this wasnt being called "" a Souls game"" It would have been better.Enemy AI is dumb as all they do is block and strafe side to side makeing SINGLE LOW-CLASS MOB BATTLES go on for MINUTES on end. I for one, dont like this idea. There are ways to break their guard (like chargeing with your sheild up) but they have such a fast recovery time its nearly impossible to get a hit off with your greatsword of heavy weapon before they bring their sheild up again (and dont even talk about useing a faster weapon as they deal so little damage it'll take just as long to fight them). This DOES add to difficulty but not in a good way. Bosses on the other hand, are REALLY dumb as much as you can bait nearly all of them into doing a single move where you can just dodge and hit. Very Underwhelming. I have yet to beat game but i can already tell its not going anywhere different with this setup.Oh and the bugs. ITS VERY BUGGY. Wait till an update or a patch before buying it. So many bugs from, the game just crashing on start up to, my Mouse just not working in the Status screens. Makeing it VERY Annoying to level up.On the GOOD side (which isnt  much), It looks very good. LOVE the way it looks, the cloth physics and the shine. Its very fun to look at.I dont normaly write reviews but after i had bought into the hype of this game being a ""Souls"" game, I was VERY disappointed and i felt like i needed to get this off my chest. So take mine for what you want either it for being nonsense or just plain butthurt.Overall, its an OK game, Just very poorly optimized. I hope they can fix ALL of the bugs in the future, till then it'll just sit in my Game Library Unfinished. "

												The game is unplayable - FPS drops to less than 1fps, settings are not saved (so I can't lower GFX details); when editted in *.ini files I was able to lower some settings but it still freezes and framedrops to the point where it's impossible to play, let alone enjoy. It's a shame the game has been released in this state. You're better off just making a new character in 'the other game'...			"

												Bought this game at launch and that was a huge mistake. This game was rushed and it had a lot of bugs. Not to mention the game crashed about 10 times during the first few hours of playing causing me to lose a lot of progress. To be honest if you want to buy this game because you heard it's like dark souls don't buy it. The only way I could recommend this game to anyone is if it's on sale for like $5. This was one of the worst experiences I've had with a game.			"

												It's a pretty nice game, when it works.Unfortunately, it does not. First it crashed on startup, making my whole system unresponsive. This was fixed by updating my GPU drivers, which is fair enough.However, after that it has decided that it wants to crash every 15-20 minutes, and not just crash, because that would be too convenient. No, it FREEZES my entire system. The sound keeps going, including other programs, but I'm forced to hard reboot my pc.			"

												Some dark forces invade, again. Some guy is released from prison to fight the aforementioned dark forces, again. We don't know what exactly is happening, again. We have to fight an kill every one, again. We die, the sector is repopulated and we try to kill everyone, again. You probably see where I'm getting at, the game is a pretty and somewhat polished collection of clichés  with an emphasis on 1 on 1 (maximum 1 on 3) sword/axe/hammer/etc fight and some magic. The game is similar to the Dark Souls series, with an emphasis on combat and loss of experience in case if you die (no quick saves here). It is a nice action RPG based in a citadel and *drum roll* dimension of the evil invaders. The game will also take some time to get used to controls and some glitches.Pros:•	Sometimes interesting battles•	Reflexes are important•	Audio/video quality of the game is 9/9•	some battle realismCons:•	somewhat glitchy controls and camera•	no map (yep, you have to memorise the locations)•	battles become systematic once you learn the enemy types•	boss fight are often frustrating because of controls, and become easy once you figure out bosses' fight patternAll in all this is a solid mid-tier action RPG, it is not worth the full price, so I can only recommend it for $20-25 if you have 12-20 hours to kill.One Grumpy Russian score: 6 out of 10 - not as tempting as vodka, but an a nice alternative when you have none and have no mood for Dark Souls.For more reviews join: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/ "

Posted: December 12, 2015
												This game on the surface looks beautiful, but unfortunitly it has at least three major flaws (besides the known technical issues) that really take the fun out of the game.1) The big issue for me was the combat. In Lords of the Fallen, all, and I do mean ALL of the combat is based off of timing. This means that combat moves pretty slow and feels clunky and one tries to position the enemy into just the right spot and then waits to swing the weapon. Weapons are fairly heavy in this game and so they take a good amount of time to swing, which means one has to mentaly calculate how long it is going to take you to swing your weapon, how long your enemy is going to take to swing his, and then determine the window of oppertunity. This leads to an awkward period in which on is trying to judge all of these things...in really slow time since the weapons are heavy. I know other games do similar things to this, but once agian the apparent weight of the weapons makes this feel like it is going on forever. 2) The second big issue for me was the weapon leveling system (and really the whole leveling system in general). The only way to improve a weapon in this game is to add a ruin to it, and hope that the weapon you want to add the ruin to is one that you can add a ruin to. See why this is annoying yet? What makes it worse is that the ruins only add special effects, and don't really do much to the damamge base damage of the weapon. My problem with this, other than it being anoying, is that it doesn't really allow you any good or even decent way to grind, work, or attempt to make personal approvements to gear up for a boss or tough enemy. The leveling system doesn't help either as the complex load out and multitude of essentialy useless options means there are plenty of places to put skill points but very few that seem to help. 3) The story. Its just bland and at times can be a bit hard to follow. I know I didn't get terrebly far into the game, but after three bosses, you would think one would at least have a vegue idea as to why one is trying to fight these bosses. Or at least why one fought the bosses I did fight. I watched the cut scenes and all I know is that nobody likes monks and demons are bad. The story just bores me.Despite the beauty and great graphics of this game I just can't recomend it. I should also not that I never experianced any of the technical issues many other users have, but I'm using an MSI GT72 Dominator Pro so...that may be something to think about. Anyway, I just don't think its worth the hassle.			"

It is nothing of the sort the game is truely well done the weapons are quiet detailed with flames, glowing features and detail. The bosses are quiet ""Cheap"" at some points but it does give you some great combat elements while this game in enjoyable there is one big issue.. A gamebreaking bug were mana does not regain thus leaving areas unable to explore, and battles way harder then the normal. I have tweeted at the deves and they have not responded while this game is quiet fun the issue bugs of crashes and this makes it very unenjoyable game to play after investing so many hours into it.

Choose rouge, no armor,no dps, small shield doesn't block all damage.And guess what? 80% of weapon drops is for warrior. So don't even think about buying this game its max worth 10 eu,but not 50.

												Completely misses the point of the Souls series.- Combat is unfair, tedious, badly designed.- Enemies are uninspired and have gimpy attacks. Example: Fat enemy with crossbow/traps/fire grenades with 1 inch long legs moves faster and hits harder in melee than your ironclad knight character. He also seems to have no problem leaping 20 meters back the moment you start to swing your weapon (which takes 5 hours to complete). He can also do this consecutively without getting tired. Ever. And then he smashes your face in while you're recovering. Twice.- Backstabbing mechanic is clunky and rarely works when it should.- Objectives are unclear.- You have no idea where you need to go (mapping isn't done well).- You can't distinguish anything, everything looks too similar, too much of the same debris everywhere.- Side quests are vague and simply badly designed.- Voice acting seems robotic. Pre-recorded text and slapped here and there, no 'emotion' or 'reactive' dialogue whatsoever.- Characters are bland and one dimensional.- Skills are uninspiring.- Casting skills takes a ridiculous amount of time.- Casting a skill and getting hit during bugs things out. You sometimes get the benefit of the skill without triggering it's Cooldown or using Mana. Unintended bug, but is actually really useful for the player when it happens.- Fighting the simplest enemy can take 5 minutes because of the way combat is designed.- Company intro cinematics take a very long time.- In fact, everything takes a ridiculous amount of time.- Company intro cinematics cannot be skipped nor disabled.- Weapons / gear seem bland. They feel very similar to eachother, no real variety.- Difficulty curve is all over the place. Sometimes you get roflstomped by the simplest mobs, but the boss's heaviest attack does only 10 damage against you.About the controller:- Cannot disable controller vibration.- Control schemes are unintuitive.- Cannot set your own control scheme, and there are only 2 to choose from.- Made me spent my time to write a negative review.On to the good things:+ Looks quite good graphically.+ Another contestor for Souls like gameplay.+ Greatly displays how much Dark Souls could have sucked, but didn't.+ Makes you appreciate the Souls series even more.+ They tried. Did they? With a few changes in design this game could already have been so much better than it is now, so I'm not even entirely sure.			"

												If anyone looking to get this game has played Darksouls and findes themself any good at Darksouls, this games combat is really slow for the main character and the enemy is much faster. For example if your weight in Darksouls is not very high and your over the the limit and are using a giant greatsword and its really slow and then thats the speed this game plays at if you play naked and unarmed or atleast thats what it feels like. It would be fine if you never played a Souls game before though.			"

												If you are a fan of dark/demons souls then you might enjoy this game. Visually appealing with a gothic theme. The combat is slower than that of the Souls series', however, it is enjoyable. In some aspects the atmosphere is better than in the souls games. The armor and weapon design is artistic, definetely not bland or simple for most. The sound design and voice acting is quite good and plays a very large part in setting the tone of the game and it's environments. The spells are interesting, but lacking. When you pick a spell class (ie mage rogue or warrior) you are stuck with those spells and cannot get the others, I could be mistaken, but I havent been able to do this. The upgrade system through the use of runes is pretty basic. No fast travel capabilities despite having many instances in the game where you are tasked to backtrack a long distance to a previous area. Overall this game is pretty good and is worth a buy in my opinion.			"

												Alot of the combat in this game is waiting, as nearly everything has a sheild that you cant break past. The first 2 bosses are examples of long fights that are only long because of their sheilds; and this can create the illusion of difficulty but its just waiting. Where as Darksouls always have a way for speeding this process up, with increased understanding of boss mechanics. But in this game it is alot of attack baiting (And not the fun kind, Prepare for epic side stepping action!)As the games combat is similar to Darksouls, people will create comparisons between the two. But for darksouls fans I dont think you will like this game, not that it is trying to BE Darksouls and I am not criticising the game for that. But alot of this game seems very sloppy (As an example there is no camera reset button, meaning you always trying to center your character in the screen after walking around corners. Which gets very annoying.) As a recommendation I would wait for a steam sale before picking this game up. Not a bad game just not worth the current asking price.6/10.			"

												Quite average with quite a few quirks already (and I am not much more than an hour in). If you were planning to buy this, I do recommend it, but not for the current price. It may be more worthwhile for about €15.00.I'm recommending it as a ""no"", not because I think it's worthy of a no, but because it is not worthy of a yes. This game does a lot of things wrong in my eyes, and is not all that interesting. I find the story and controls difficult to grasp. and the tutorials are awfully average. The enemy positioning and aggro ranges are odd and the ""stealth"" system is silly. The game doesn't hold you by the hand, and as result ends up explaining a lot of elements very, very poorly.But in the end I am still not having a bad time - just not a great one either. There are a few comical elements to this game and it doesn't feel particularily bad to walk around in cool armour. But that seems to be the key selling point of the game - that everything looks cool. I can't add much to the story yet, but it doesn't seem all that impressive either.With the footage that I have seen, the playtime that I've put into this game, and the research I have done, I am fairly confident in my judgment that this game (for now) is better left in the shelves until it gets seriously cheaper.In the end, you may have more fun watching someone else play through this than play through it yourself. I definitely recommend you do research when you are considering buying this game, and if you do, buy it on a discount.			"

												Dark Souls is my favorite game. This game is pretty bad. The combat may look similar, but it really isn't. It feels slow mo, not ""heavy"". The moves are nonsensically slow. There is no waiting for an opportune moment to strike or countering an enemy attack. There is only stunlocking, and back stabbing. Bossfights are too easy unless they are just broken. The magic is complete trash. All of it, and every aspect of it should be removed entirely. I played through Demon Souls, Dark Souls, and Dark Souls 2 multiple times. I got through 3 bosses in this game (much faster I might add) and am labeling this game as garbage.			"

												Pretty decent dark souls copy. The biggest plus is the weapon system, it might seem really slow at first but once you get the hang of it, it actually makes a lot of sense. The weight of armor and weapons is shown in the characters behavior. What I really liked about that is that some weapons have to be double handed to be able to use, so no double wielding giants hammers in this one, or even double wielding anything bigger than a short sword for that matter.Voice acting and animations are not to good but do the job just fine. Story is very forgettable and doesn't make to much sense, and the lenght of the game is just not enough. Took me 15 hours to complete which is not by far enough for a SP rpg with quiet a bit of backtracking. Graphics look really nice but the environment is so similar in all areas it loses it's appeal a bit later on. Armor and weapons on the other hand look great!The Boss fights are where the game shines, they are challenging and different from one another.I enjoyed it.7.5/10.			"

												After completeing the game in only 15 hours, it appears obvious just how much of a rush job this game really was. Poor quality through out the entire game. Lack of enemy variety, clunky combat system and awful sound effects make this game a real bore to play. I pretty much forced myself to playthrough this just to see where it would lead.I have nothing positive to say about this game, it has no redeeming values. Even if you buy this for $5 you aren't going to have a good time. Not even an okay time. This isn't just mediocre, it's poorly executed and riddled with bad design.I can't say I experienced any moment of fun. Everything this game tries to do, other games have done better. You might think ""well it looks pretty good at least"" it really doesn't. To get this game to run at around 45 fps i had to turn off EVERY graphical option and set textures to Medium at 720p. It runs horribly on a brand new gaming PC that runs other current gen games at 60+ fps on 1080p. So needless to say, it looked pretty bad for me.Sound effects are terrible as well. There's about 3 weapon sounds in the game and you will hear them a million times. They don't sound powerful or realistic at all. Many missing sounds for a lot of enemies and environmental things. Cutscenes often feel like they are lacking sounds or the sounds are too quiet or just don't match what you are seeing. I turned the music off because I thought it was pretty awful too. Some of the boss music sounds like a parody of symphonic music and doesn't feel intense at all. The tracks that aren't completely awful are generic at best.It's not a very difficult game either and that's coming from someone who created the worst build possible. I put all my points into HP, MP, stamina and equip load. (I did this because I was under the impression that there would be plenty of faith-scaling weapons since i had one very early in the game) This meant that I couldn't use 90% of the weapons and shields. While I had good defense, probably too much considering I barely took damage in the later half of the game, I couldn't use any weapons or block effectively. I two-handed a weak staff for the first half of the game which took forever to kill anything. Than I finally got a good faith-scaling weapon, grinded super easily and eventually found a super low strength requiring sword that dealt way more damage than the 3 faith weapons i found in the entire game. So i used that for the end game areas.With that, you can get an idea of how poorly balanced the game is. Later weapons in the game completely replace early game weapons as the scaling is completely useless for most weapons. There is no upgrade system either, just a rune slot system for weapons, shields and armor and only the higher strength and agility weapons have slots so none of the weapons i used through out my playthrough had any slots. a completely useless system that i never even got to experience outside of giving my armor extra defense.Bosses are so bad in both design and gameplay. Some are completely broken such as getting stuck in walls or in one case I had a boss completely stand still the whole time as I slowly chipped away at his massive health pool. Most of the bosses have a ton of health so it can take ages to kill them but luckily they are very slow and predictable doing the same moves over and over again. Rolling is mostly useless in this game so you can't roll through most boss attacks so it's a waiting game, you just have to wait for that split second after they perform a combo to get a hit or two in, back away and repeat. This ""technique"" will work on every boss in the game even though it is extremely tedious and with the final boss, there's barely any oppertunities to safely get a hit in. Most of the bosses will ALWAYS knock you down when they hit you, even with heavy armor and really high poise. Ground pounds are very common and will knock you down from a good 15 feet away from the boss.Another example of poor quality is the overabundance of glitches and bugs. It almost seems like nothing really works as fully intended. Hitboxes can be really messed up, getting hit from attacks that don't make physical contact with you or in some luckier cases, boss attacks going right through you but you recieve no damage. If you are casting a spell (which you only get 4 in the whole game) and you get hit towards the end of the long animation, you will recieve the effect of the spell but lose no MP. This made healing during boss fights really easy so I didn't have to rely on potions too much. Slidy collision detection makes walking on stairs really weird. The lock on system is bogus, barely functional. You have about a 10% chance of being able to change target when locked on. Sometimes the camera won't even face the enemy you are locked on to but you still walk toward the enemy, this killed me in quite a few areas involving pitfalls.Level design. It's there and it involves lots of switches, back tracking and locked doors. Early areas aren't so bad, they seem pretty average at first but then you get to the middle of the game and it just gets worse from there. Narrow cooridors, enemy ambushes, floating blocks and jumping across gaps as well as pitfalls galore. Many times I had to look up a guide to find out where to go because progressing through the later game is so convoluted. You need to pull several levers to open one door sometimes, or to move some blocks around to progress. This isn't exactly obvious when you will see a switch next to a gate and expect that switch to do something. You pull the lever, nothing happens. What?!Despite all these problems, I still didn't die too much. Most of the time it felt pretty cheap when I did die. Enemies like the mages can drain your HP really quickly, shoot really fast magic that deals huge damage and knocks you down, cast a buff that drains your stamina and every time you hit them, it deals equal damage to you, these guys can end you very quickly. There are checkpoint crystals in rooms with 3 enemies sometimes so as soon as you die and respawn you are getting attacked. Getting cornered by 2 enemies with greatshields and repeatedly attacks results in no posibilities of survival. Speaking of greatshields, you can't kick through them, attack through them or do ANYTHING to counter them. If you do stagger them, you won't even have enough time to get a SINGLE hit in with how slow these weapons are. Only way I could kill them is with magic which seem to go right through their shields making them easy. Otherwise you would be screwed.The story, ha. It's run of the mill and has poor voice acting and writing. Some of the worst stuff I've seen. Awkward animations that keep repeating when npc's are talking combined with non-existent personalities makes none of the characters appealing or relatable. Even after seeing the ending of this game, I didn't have a clue what I had really done in the game plotwise. I don't even know who the final boss was, just kinda there. I assume it was a certain character but it's never explained why there's a big demon beastie as the final boss. Also plotholes as you can expect. How do the [end game enemies] know I supposedly betrayed them? Nothing here really makes much sense and the world is so generic and boring you won't really care.I think that just about covers everything. The TL;DR version is: don't buy the game. It's garbage. No, really. Don't even think about it. I don't care if it's on sale, it's bad. Really bad, probably much worse than you can imagine. You like Dark Souls? That's cool and all but this is nothing like it. Not even a low budget version of it, it's more like if you had taken Dark Souls and shattered it on the ground and tried to reassemble it but you have several large chunks missing and it just looks hideous. That's Lords of the Fallen.			"

												It`s like Dark souls Butt.After reading a couple of reviews of this in the steam comments and on the interwebz a singular frase seemed to pop out in every discussion about Lords Of The Fallen.It`s like Dark souls but..........So far i am not impressed with this game.So it tought i would recap som things using the new It`s like Dark souls but meme:Fighting mechanics is like dark souls but worse. Slower reaction from input, less advanced moveset etc.Enemy AI and moveset is like dark souls but, more predictable and less varied.Difficulty is like dark souls but not because its hard to master but because bosses have high HP and do a lot of damage. Thank god the AI is a predictable retard.Controls are like Dark souls but, no they are actually almost identical(360 gamepad).Atmosfere is like dark souls but it`s not, it`s just not really there at all.Story is like Dark souls but, its a lot of the same only with constant narration.Game mechanics and number of bugs in general is like Dark souls except its worse and has more bugs.Overall this game IS a lot like Dark Soul, but it isn`t a new better more advanced version of dark souls. It actually playes worse than Demon soul`s  and that`s 5 years old now,In summary i would like to quote something i read in another online review.""Its like Darks Souls, but it is its own game""This pretty much sums up my opinion of this game, It is its own game, but it is by far a worse game than any of the dark Souls series.So if you are a fan of Dark souls like me you probably won`t like this game, however if you have never played dark souls and or did not like it. This game might be more to your taste. Not worth full prise tough so try and get it on sale.			"

General GameplayLords Of The Fallen is a third-person action RPG where we play as Harkyn a convicted criminal to save the world from the Rhogar threat.Both the character and weapons feel extremelly heavy in the beginning, but with proper gear and weight management this is easielly fixed.We are limited in terms of classes (warrior, cleric and rogue), but makes total sense considering the narrative of the game.Much like Dark Souls, this is a game that requires patiente to study the enemies and exploit their weaknessesGameplay Rating: 3/5EngineFledgeGraphics OptionsThe game has all the options we could have asked for.Graphics QualityOne of the first next-gen games that hit the market, and lives up to it.PerformanceIt's cursed with performance problems due to NVidia (Gameworks), the game forces PhysX that cripples performance on both AMD (specially) and NVidia builds.Even though it was stated by the developers you can disable PhysX, this is a lie. PhysX is coded deep into the game engine, and even with PhysX disabled the particles show traces of PhysX rendering.Engine Rating: 3/5Overall Rating: 6/10NotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and engine (how the game looks and runs).

It's also incredibly harsh (normal enemies take 1/2 health per hit). Magic is terrible and not interesting. Battles are very slow and you ALWAYS feel completely inferrior to the strength of the enemy you are figthing.  The graphics are nice but nothing to write home about. Avoid at all costs. I bout it on sale and regret spending any money at all on it.			"

												Dont. Just.... dont.Whoever designed the combat needs to be shot, repeatedly to be sure.Unless you like bosses who use pure RNG abilities, or enemies whos hitboxes move slightly as you dodge to make sure they still hit you even though you are way out of their range, then stay away.Go play dark souls or something. At least that game is fair.			"

												It's a Dark Souls-alike that looks gorgeous and controls well.The weapons look cool and are fun to use but have terrible scaleability The magic system is awful.I stopped playing this game for a few days and felt no compulsion to go back.2/5 would not shrug again.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!This game is horribly unbalanced and unfair the enemies will kill you nearly instantly with anything but heavy armor, as far as I've gotten there is no love for the light builds I've gotten 1 set of light armor and 3 agility weapons I have 6 total sets of medium and heavy armor and more that 10 heavy weapons and a great shield the backstap system is totally broken to the point of not working and the parry system is hit parry and pray you timed it right because the animations simply do not work thia game is a horrible mockery of the Souls series and should no longer be sold it really feels like this game was made by someone who hates Dex builds in Dark Souls and trying to play anything but a tank build in this game is unfairly difficult. (They compared it to souls so I'll compare it to souls this game has failed to even come close to the souls games and I honestly wish I would have saved my money.)			"

												Before you read this, yes this is about the stabiltity if you're sick of those reviews please continue.Well.... This game's stability is a mess. My PC is under the minimum requirements but it is for many games and those run fine. However this game is unplayable for me. I have no crashes but my FPS is just about 5 in outside area's and like 30 in the inside area's. I'd like to see an option for turning the particles off outside (like snow and such). But right now until they fix some stuff I won't be able to play this game which is sad as I was hyped as hell about this game... Such a shame...For any of you who would like to know: Graphics Card: GTS 350 x3Proccesor: AMD Athlon II			"

												Re-writing this review as the game has finally managed to be played. My last review complained of not even being able to make it to the title screen let alone play the game. This has since been fixed. Game itself is very pretty graphically but plays a bit stiff. Having 150+ hours in all 3 Dark Souls games, the ability to dodge is delayed. Be prepared to hit the dodge button a good 2 seconds before the attack is coming in.My last PC was an AMD FX-9370 paired with an AMD R9 290X video card and 8GB ddr3-1600mhz RAM. This game took so long to actually work properly, the PC now has an Intel i7-6700k, EVGA 980TI, and 32GB DDR4-2400mhz.Case in point, the patch to have this work properly took way too long. If you can get this game on sale ($15 or less including DLC) go for it.			"

												If you played Dark Souls, you'll HATE this game, even more if you liked playing fast characters, the flow of combat is clunky at best, they didn't take any care in the frames it takes to do something, you can't chain♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's more of a turn based duel, cause you either do thing A or B, you won't get a hit and the roll from the enemy, the enemy can, that's the worst part, the enemies flow, so you feel like more of a peace of♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's not your fault.AND the AI, Ohhh my friend the AI, it's some dumb, there aren't many enemies, and to make it even better, they have like 3 things to do, like, three movements, they can fast attack, they can heavy attack, they combo or they can try to flank you (pick three and you have a character) so there isn't any depth thereI caný think why would anyone say: ""If you liked Dark Souls, you'll like this"" you like DS, because is a masterpiece, this only shares genre with it, that's it, the story ain't alluring, the combat ain't inmersive, the characters are as much fun as a brickpD, ♥♥♥♥ Dark Souls didn't even HAVE to tell you the story to be alluring...

												Despite my best efforts, I cannot get past the black-screen-mouse-cursor glitch.  This is entirely my fault because this game simply can not run on the lower-est end PCs.  However, I can review what I have experienced.The menu music is pretty good.  I imagine it would set the pace for a good adventure.  Once, I was able to hear my way through killing someone, so that leads me to believe the combat is intuitive enough for a blind person to use.  Better than Darksouls.One day I'll get a real computer and play again, until then I can't fault it on what I don't know.8/10			"

												I really wanted to like this game. It looked so awesome.I really expected the characters to have some hulking power behind them. Expected to feel like every swing of my sword had an awesome force, and my shield would feel heavy, yet responsive.But alas. Whilst the atmosphere is really great, everything else is a miss. The controls are clunky, and your shield does very(!) little to block incoming blows. seems like half the time i would block, and the enemy would still hit ""around"" my tower shield somehow.The enemy targeting is cumbersome and unresponsive, and it is very difficult to switch targets during lock - a HUGE problem when multiple enemies spawn.Finally, the enemies. Granted, i've only played a few hours, but i've only seen 4 or 5 enemy types. Same, same, same, all the time. Makes the game feel slow and just not worth it.I REALLY hope they make a Lords of the Fallen 2, and fix all these issues.			"

												I was told this game is ""Dark Souls done wrong"". I had no problem with that, I wanted to like it for what it offers on it's own. I didn't think it was fair to make the comparsion, despite the game clearly wanting to aim for the solid 2nd best position, trying to ride the fame and hype of a genre another game bringed back, lives and profits from in a quite dominant position. And I said, I'm okay with that, it can be a great game because what's inside is what matters the most, not the franchise name burnt on it's box. And still, Lords of the Fallen is just B- in everything on it's own, compared to no other game. You just feel in every moment of it. I picked it up for 3,99 so no regrets here, mainly because I wanted a taste of what Dark Souls games are like and honestly it's only good for that. I haven't played any DS games, but I'm certain they must be better than this. It is a game that is never going to be finished (by me, it's a complete game tho), so overall I still consider it a waste if you buy this game for itself. I bought it for a taste of the DS experience, and it lasted 7 hours, and I feel like this isn't the way to make that work right. With no experience about the DS titles, I know THIS isn't the way to do it right.For this reason I cannot honestly recommend it.The game known as ""poor man's dark souls"". And I bought it to be that, so can't say I was disappointed with what I got, but the ""poor man's dark souls"" title speaks for itself. It wants to be something, but fails so, and has nothing else on it's own.1. The combat is incredibly boring. You could say it is supposed to be tactical, but reality is that you have to use a few spells you get with every class, and it's almost always the solution. Or you can look at each other with both shields up and everyone bunkering down for 5 to 10 minutes. With a random filler enemy. Shielded opponent? Whatever class you pick you can either go a) invisible to backstab b) slow down time and walk around c) just send a firey clone of yourself in it's face to explode. You can do workarounds, try interesting special moves with all the weapons, but it gets repetitive incredibly fast due to..2. the lack of cretivity. And this applies to EVERY aspect of the game. I think I have met about 4 types of opponents in the 6,6 hours I spent in Lords of the Fallen. Random ""ork guy"" with a shield, without a shield, jumping dog type that can breathe unblockable stuff, and crossbow guy. And variations of these, smaller, bigger, sometimes poison, sometimes fire, sometimes thin wizardey sometimes fat guardey, sometimes 4 legs sometimes none. But mechanically there is barely any difference between them and when a game is built like this, with the ""less is more"" in mind, so you have to fight a really small number of enemies compared to other similar games, the lack of creativity really shows. Same goes for the enviroment, it wants to be Dark Souls gothic so desperately, has a great looking engine to do so, but it just ends up being Darksiders with more blur. With the exception of the very few vistas (I think I've came across 2 under this ~7ish hours) and more unique rooms such as the temple hall at the first boss, it's always the same. Fortress, garden, cave, prison, royality rooms, even a different dimension,  battle hardened or brand new,  ALL looks the same. Not just the atmosphere, but the structural layouts, construction style, even the size of the bricks walls are mostly made of, everything is the same everywhere, and it gets boring. It wants to be Dark Souls, but every new room here is just like the one you came from instead of being something exciting, and outside areas are the same with the exception of not having a ceiling. And the bosses, oh the bosses. As interesting as they seem to be on first sight, you'll realize there is barely any challange there because they are SO BASIC mechanically that only your lack of patience can get you killed. All of them are like they exist in slow motion only, and just a bigger variant of some basic enemy with one or two extra spells and a really boring looks. Have you seen the first DS3 boss, the knight transforming to that darkness-snake thing? That alone has more creative design than everything and anything added together in this game.If you are still interested, you should know that it is a solid PC version, no fps, crash or anything else issues happend. It's not particularly demanding, you should be fine somewhat above the minimum requirements to play it on nearly maxed out settings with good speed.			"

												I bought this game hoping for something to do before dark souls 3 released. I walked away from this game after only and hour becuase I could not believe how unbelievably bad it was. Sloppy controls mixed with frustrating button layouts. the first two bosses were (if you can even call them that) stupidly easy, and then a bit later on I happen across a spider that kills me in two hits from across the room, through my shield. That was so jarring and I felt♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and annoyed. I tried to fight this spider a few more times and just couldnt kill it and I figured I wasnt supposed to be there. So I moved on from that disaster onto the next area were I find this giant knight with a tower shield who I spend a solid 2 minutes trying to circle around to get an opening and I couldnt, the area was to narrow or he was to ....fast....a tower shield heavy armor wielding knight was to fast to get behind. I decide since I am also a tank class I will try to trade blows, this gets me one shotted. This is a problem, one minute I am recking everything and the next I get one shot. There doesnt seem to be much of a difficulty curve because at least in the first 2 hours was everywere. This game is seriously boring with bad design choices, horrible enemy placement and lackluster animations. I hear it has nice graphics but it has O.K graphics even on ultra. The frames for it being ultra are lower then it should be signaling bad optimization but Im not an expert on that so I wont go further with that complaint. Over all I cant recommend this game to a real souls fan. Its been described as chunky souls but its more then that, its soulless souls too. Get it to try for yourself if you have to get it out of your system but otherwise just wait for DS3. Watch a Lets Play :P I here dsp is halariously fun to watch due to his horrible gameplay. So go watch that instead.			"

												Great art and atmosphere, a huge sense of power and weight to movement and attacks, enjoyable combat challenges, and interesting narrative. If the game is taken for what it is, I think there's little to complain about what's received.Also, setting textures to Very High without 6 GB of VRAM can cause crashes - I recommend playing with it set at just High.

												The game looks great but isn't for everyone. I enjoy playing games for the story, the fact that this game had no map at all was extremely frustrating because i was always feeling lost which ruined my experience, so i stopped playing it.			"

												Game would be fine if I didn't randomly get alt tabbed or lose control (cursor appears on screen & can't get it back to screen without crtl+alt+delete... can't pause, so usually die when it happens. Also cannot use my second monitor when playing because the windows colour scheme popup crashes the game everytime.			"
