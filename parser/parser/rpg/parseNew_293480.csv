Early Access Review
								Ah FRONTIERS, what a great idea for a game, what a huge amount of effort and what a sad state the project is in right now. Now look, I love the idea of FRONTIERS. Traveling around in a huge world with so many different things to explore, so many different towns to wander through and so many fantastic views that was waiting to be enjoyed by your big bright eyes. The game didnt rely on combat or leveling up, magic or anything like that (but FRONTIERS does have all of these things if you want to use them, the game just doesnt rely on you using them) which is sort of a big turn off for a big buncha people, but I loved the idea of it, I wanted to explore the ♥♥♥♥ out of FRONTIERS and uncover it's mysteries and also see if the game managed to pull through Early Access.Oh, wait. Early Access. Yeah that's one of FRONTIERS biggest problems, most people like to play their games in a finished, pristine and polished state. If an Early Access game takes too long people will usually start bashing it. Now usually this wont be a big deal towards the developers as they'll turn their cheek and continue to work on their ambitious games. But to Lars, FRONTIERS's main developer, it kind of is.  Oh Lars, how ambitious you were back then when that Kickstarter succeeded, how starry eyed you were. Lars is and has always been FRONTIERS main developer, he has made mostly if not all of FRONTIERS. Now if you think about what FRONTIERS is, what engine it's running on(no offense I love Unity to death) and how many people that's working on it you KNOW that this game isn't exactly going to be leaving Early Access soon. The guy works almost 24/7 on FRONTIERS, the rest of his team from AAD Productions making other smaller games on the side.FRONTIERS hasnt been doing well and that's no good. The main problem here is that you'll probably be running the game at it's medium settings even if the game isn't exactly the most realistic looking game and nobody really likes that unless you can put up with it. The game will also be confusing to most players (including myself way back) and doesn't hold your hand at all, you will also be facing things such as: Weird NPCs walking about, strange and confusing trading and crafting systems in the game and the previously mentioned low framerate.But hold up! Before you decide to leave, hear me out. An update is coming soon, Lars has been working hard as hell on pulling it off but he actually managed to get FRONTIERS from Unity 4 (a very old and outdated version of Unity) to Unity 5.5 (the very newest version of Unity)!! What does this mean? Well, you'll hopefully be experiencing way better framerate, development will probably be a lot smoother for our good man Lars and FRONTIERS will overall be a better experience for people who are interested in supporting the development of FRONTIERS as well as play it's current state of being.You can say whatever you want about FRONTIERS, but I love this game. It's a project that has potential and is being worked very hard on, it simply doesnt desserve to be left behind in the mud. Help pull the game back up on it's feet again and encourage Lars to keep working towards finishing this beautiful dream project of his! Help him by giving feedback, tell your friends about it, writing bug reports and write a review for the game wether you like or hate it it's feedback and Lars needs it. If you read through this whole review then I thank you for your time :)Please consider supporting FRONTIERS.			"

Early Access Review
								First the positive. This game captures that wonderful essence of games from days gone by - it has that sense of wonder and really makes you want to explore the world and see what is out there. The graphics fall somewhere between Morrowind and Skyrim - certainly serviceable. I read another review that said the game is unplayable on mid-level machines. My PC is the embodiment of mid-level and it ran fine, although the frame rates need to be improved a bit - other wise I had no problems.Now for the downside. I know that this is a survival game but if I eat a loaf of bread, a sausage and a banana, should I really be  starting to get hungry less than five minutes later? Honestly, I don't mind foraging for food but in all these types of games, your character must be an insatiable, gluttonous hog-demon for all the food and water that they need. Also, by all appearances it seemed to be mild weather outside with people milling about, yet I am freezing to death in a matter of minutes and need to run to the fireplace to get warm again. There isn't a backpack or wheelbarrow big enough to get you a mile down the road for all of your ""needs"".  I hope that this gets tweaked - I'd like to see a survival game that actually let you explore for five minutes without your dashboard flashing red for some trivial thing that you took care of three minutes previously.That said, I am enjoying exploring the initial town and hope to be able to get outfitted to explore further. I'd recommend this game highly to anyone who misses that good old fashioned game that doesn't hold you by the hand and doesn't feel the need to knock you over the head with contant tutorial style gameplay. I really hope this game succeeds and wish there were more like it.			"

Early Access Review
Key supplied by developer for review.======================================FRONTIERS (Read on for the full review!)======================================TL;DRFrontiers is a buggy, but immersive open-world RPG game made by one man, and I heartily recommend it if you want to feel like you're a part of the world you're exploring, and doing everything you can to unearth its secrets.======================================Pros+ Graphics: Pretty good when everything is maxed.+ Gameplay: Explore, and do everything with your own hands.+ Audio: GREAT music, ambient sound, and sound effects.+ Really good fasttravel system!+ A ton of sights to see!+ Engaging storyCons- Performance: Pretty bad when everything is maxed.- Bugs: Bugs can be found easily in many areas.- Bugs: No really, you've been warned.- Fast travel will often kill you.Neutral+/- Doesn't hold your hand at all.+/- Requires a pretty decent GPU.+/- Some of the sounds are louder than they should be.======================================IntroductionYou are a man whose uncle has according to the law, passed away, on a quest to honor his life by doing the chores he left behind in it, and potentially find him across the Rift on the way. The Rift is an aptly named place where everything stops in favor of a more molten theme. Many have tried to cross it, but any who have, have yet to come back. Your family has been trying for generations, with varying degrees of success, and Daniel has caught this wanderlust. Will you?GameplayWelcome to FRONTIERS. a game about exploring new frontiers! I can definitely see the comparisons to Morrowind and Daggerfall here, and I'll add my own, this universe is strangely reminiscent of one of my favorite series as a kid: Deltora Quest. Everything has an ethereal sense of urgency and wonder and magic.FRONTIERS sets a slow-paced lore-filled task of mainly exploring before you. You will wander from location to location, reading books, talking to inhabitants, burning firewood, ocassionaly fighting beast and man alike, and occasionaly partaking of food and drink. Skills may level through usage or by studying books, but skills take a backseat to your sightseeing, of which there is much to do. Every area feels unique, from the lay of the land, to the construction of the homes, to the color of the ground or sky or plants.One thing this game doesn't do is hold your hand. I'm surprised the map even marks locations, or where you are currently, for that matter. You will be told to go places  without specific instructions on how to get there, or where specifically to go. You will be thrust into a world with little idea of how to interact with it. You will be tasked with surviving with no instruction on how to kill, what to kill with, or what all you can or can not eat. And for some people that's where all the fun comes from. You will be given basic instructions, though, such as that you need food, water, and to avoid the ocean. At one point I successfully asked for directions to a family friend. It's not all bad, just hit and miss. Depth is how I would sum up my experience.All things said, it seems there's a lot beneath the surface here, with plenty of things to see.GraphicsThe graphics in FRONTIER are beautiful, for a price. You will take quite a hit to performance for maxing them out, but they will look quite nice. There's a good sense of light and dark, and things look relatively realistic. Nights are nice and dark, and light sources aren't fountains of bloom. A lot of the models look fairly realistic, but the animations could use just a little work. I can't say too much about the graphics, because they need to be experienced through playing, and also, in order to play, I had to turn them down to late 90s level quality.AudioThe audio in FRONTIERS is amazing. Everything and everywhere will have an exhuberant ambient sound to go with it that gives the game some real life. Some of it can be a little loud depending on the location, though, seeming a bit unrealistic. Each region has unique music, offering a nice thematic touch. The audio cues are nice, but the lack of any voice for the NPCs makes things feel slightly lonely after a while. Either way, what's there has heart and soul.ConclusionI heavily recommend experiencing this game for yourself, even if it can be quite buggy, and is definitely still a bit early in development. It's beautiful, vast, varied and feels like it has been imbued with the heart and soul of its creator.======================================If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

Early Access Review
								tl;dr: Still buggy, but the feeling of exploration is definitely there already.  Updates every day, the developer is serious, hard working and honest.  Do not jump in right now if you expect a smooth ride since some of the mechanics are not reliable yet.  One thing is bug-free: the peculiar mood, the intriguing and well-written story, the surprising landscapes, the feeling of exploration and discovery.As this is an early access review, I want to stress the fact that the game is not finished.  Not all the features have been implemented, and some implemented features do now work quite well.  I'm writing this on December 24th 2014, the game has been available in Early Access for about two weeks and open for beta testing for about a month.  The game has been thoroughly tested since day one.  A hundred of issues have been raised; some very minor (weird pixel on button texture), some critical (crashes); and all are being addressed by the one developer, Railboy, who's been working full time and releasing patches almost every day, often several times a day.The result is a game that is working better and better every day.  From my point of view, it is already good.  I keep jumping into the game with the goal of breaking it and reporting a new bug, but I end up each time walking down new paths for hours, exploring new lost villages and discovering strange events.  What you can see in the trailer videos is all here already, and much more.  I have put fifty hours into the game and still haven't explored half of the continent.  I haven't finished the main quest either, and haven't tried 10 % of all these crafting recipes.  I still haven't even cast a spell (even though I did find the dark luminite to do so)!  The world is Big, in the sense that it will take you a lot of time to get to know it, and believe me, you will be lost.  Even with the maps, there are places I saw once and have never found again.Frontiers has this sandbox feel to it: you set your goal yourself and just roll with it, or you follow the story.  There is no pressure to finish the main quest.  Actually, pretty much everything is optional in this game; there is even an option for disabling survival if you do not want to bother killing bears for their meat (a very hazardous activity, believe me).  I like the main quest very much, though, because it isn't just about big epic things, it's about people, trust, friendship, vengeance, broken hopes, and what one is ready to sacrifice in order to be the first to accomplish the impossible.In addition to the main quest, there is something about the world itself that feels...  weird.  Abnormal.  Out of place.  It is subtle but you can tell something is wrong.  I do not know yet whether it connects to the main quest, but I will definitely walk the paths of Frontiers until I find out. "

								Lars.  Lars.....Lars....LARS!   Frontiers is dead....DEAD.   Stop talking like there's ever going to be a functional game...because there isn't.   Stop with the business plan and charts and graphs and lawyer goobledy-gook.  When I see you writing about VR and see you in pictures with a VR set on your head....I know this game is dead.  You've moved on already in your heart.I recommend you let the game go and remove it from Steam.  It's actually been almost a year and you've done nothing major on it.  It languishes.  The game, and the excuses, make you look bad...even if your explanations are honestly given.  The absolute right thing to do is take it down so that noone else spends any of their money on it.Chalk this one up to a learning experience, Amigo, and let it go at that.  Now go forth and make better games!			"

								Got this game in a Humble Bundle today. Looked pretty awesome. As soon as I finished the prologue, it became painfully obvious that the game is ""broken"". You cannot speak to any NPCs or interact with anything around you. According to the forums, this has been a problem for quite a LONG time. I have no clue about how the game is supposed to play or anything because I wasn't given the opportunity to find out. I am only dropping this review to warn others who may miss the chance to drop just a buck on it. Hopefully the game will be salvaged, but considering the history of Early Access, I will not hold my breath waiting for that to happen. It is sad because it really sounded like it has potential.			"

								This should not still be for sale on Steam. It's essentially a dead Early Access product.The dev is still working on it half-heartedly, seemingly just out of obligation, but at this rate it will never be finished. The idea for this game is so great, and the dev seems like a nice guy. It's a tragic situation, really.Buy if you want to vote with your dollar, but don't expect something playable or expect it to be completed.			"

Early Access Review
								:::EDITED:::OK, so, after some testing and research on the forums I think I've found a solution to the problems mentioned below!So, the game, by default will be set to have you spawn in the Prologue. It basically gives the backstory to the game and lets you learn a little bit of the controls in a small area. The problem is that if I continue, it causes the game to not work properly after leaving this starter area.(It may still be worth playing the prologue to get a feel for the game, but you'll have to start a new game after it)When you start the game, you can change the spawn to ""academy"" and change the gear to Act 1 gear and default starter clothes. And that lets you pick up where the prologue start should have continued.After that, the game (so far) seems to be working as intended. I'm able to talk to npc's, get lectured by a professor, and dare I say even pick up my mail from the post office!If this game sounds like your cup of tea, give it a shot. (no tea guaranteed)Old Review below------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This game is Great! I picked up a huge map that was stuck to a wall, and couldn't put it down!10/10- would hold sign for all eternity again!(press G to drop things btw lol)In all seriousness, the game seems to be broken in more ways than one.After finishing the intro area, you will arrive in another town. The problem is, once you get here, the game breaks. You can't talk to any of the NPC's or look at the logs(book reader) to figure out what you're supposed to be doing. So, from the beginning, the story and the game are broken.The dev does seem to be active on the forums and seems to be working on development. I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt, but this major issue has been around for a long time.My suggestion: look through the forums, look at *current* reviews and make an informed decision.

Early Access Review
								A game like Frontiers is the reason Early Access exists--to give independant game developers the time, money, and resources to develop great tailored games at an affordable price without having to rely on compromising with the big name developers.  Unfortunately Early Access is riddled with so many games whose developers do not honor the implied code of the privelage they have been granted with infrequent updates, total lack of communication, and their own closed vision of a game that is not open to input from the community who paid to develop it.  Frontiers is not one of those games.This is an outstanding example of how an early access game should be.  The game, although buggy, is still enjoyable and playable.  This alone does not make this a great Early Access game; what does is that the developer is in CONSTANT contact with the community regarding what he is doing and asking for input with what he should do and he is fixing problems as fast as they are being discovered all-the-while continuing the development of the game.  This does not give due credit to a scripted story of great quality uncommon to not only independant developers, but the ""big-guys"" alike.  What also makes this a great game is a currently small active community of players who were excited about this game since it's Greenlight on Steam.  The majority recognize that this is a work in progress with a great foundation and a committed developer and are regularly submitting their bug reports in a helpful and professional manner--not ♥♥♥♥♥ing and moaning about how this game is nothing like Call of Duty.Though the balancing isn't quite there yet but I'm sure will be very soon (as the Developer has stated so and let nobody down yet), this is a unique game and the first of its very specific type to the genre--a successful hybrid adventure-survival game.  As this game develops into what it's potential dictates, it will wake the sleeping point-and-click adventure enthusiasts and reel in the survivalists.  Whatsmore, if the player is only interested in one of those aspects or even if they simply want to explore without the dangers of a true survival game, they are invited and able to do so.Whatever your interests are, Frontiers has something for you.  Well, actually, it's not like Candy Crush... F!@# that game.			"

Early Access Review
								A game that gets my enthusiasm juices running again.Fantastic what I have played so far (I walked out of the university building thingy lecturehall after the intro and fell into the unrendered village and got a bit...lost) Felt a pang of emotion having to tell characters they weren't cut out for the expedition, which instantly made me think that this game has huuuuuge potential. I love the RPG feel of the game without the spending numbers to invest in your anti-flame death to get screwed over by the pointy-spear death monster 2/3 of the way in and feel like you just wasted your life -_-. It captures the feeling of exploration in a kind of Jules-Verne Journey to the Centre of the Earth (or Atlantis' frankenstein amalgomation of the above and 20'000 leagues) kind of way and is very relaxing to wander the world and see what mysteries contront you. It's like the perfect blend of Morrowind meets Myst without the tedium of either. It is also refreshing to show off that games don't always have to be about maiming and slaughter. That is not to say there is no element of conflict or danger in the game, but it takes a very much backseat to emphesise the scope of the world and the people around you. It is a very vast project and I do have some reservations when it comes to early-access titles, that some devs bite off more than they can chew and end up releasing the game unfinished because of time, money or sheer boredom and begin working on a 4x Strategy instead. I can see there is a passion for the genre they are trying to encapsulate here and I am feeling enthusiastic about the project. As Darth Vader would say... it's a feeling I've not felt since.... Keep up the phenominal work guys and I cannot wait for as many people to play this that it becomes a household name to go down along with games like The Elder Scrolls, Myst, Baulder's Gate and Minecraft.

								(For the sake of full disclosure, I should mention that I was one of the contributing writers for Frontiers.  I was not the one responsible for most of what you'll find in the game, though [I mostly worked on sidequests and some of the books/letters you might come across]- the lead writer is Ryan A. Span, and he deserves the credit for the main storyline and most of the dialogue!)Frontiers is not just a game, but a vision.  The world of Kantvarld has many secrets tucked away for those willing to find them, but keep in mind that Frontiers is a specific type of game for a specific type of person.You won't cut down hordes of enemies in this game- that isn't what this world has to offer. Instead, if you want *exploration* and to a degree survival (with occasional combat) then Frontiers may be for you.Frontiers is about the curiosity in each of us, and what we do with it.  If you find yourself wanting to take in your surroundings- not fighting in them, just *enjoying* them, then know that this game was made by people like you, for people like you.  If you find yourself in videogame worlds, staring far into the distance, basking in the light of the morning sun, then Frontiers is for you.  If you enjoy the challenge of mapping out the known world, including every nook, cranny and orifice, then Frontiers is, without a doubt... for you.In Frontiers, curiosity is king.  The desire to make sense of the world (and to find your Zen in the process) is the drive that this game specifically caters to above all other things.  The game world is plenty big (around the size of Oblivion's landmass) and the brilliant soundtrack (made by the talented Steve Barnes) will carry you as far as you wish to go.  It will be a while before most of the bugs are behind us, but the framework is already here.  So if Frontiers sounds like your cup of tea- come join our community, and you might like what you find!P.S. Lars/Railboy (the lead developer) is known for his honesty and straightforward nature for a reason.  If you are worried at all about the Early Access nature of the game, just take a peek into the Community Hub and you'll find plenty of reasons to root for the guy.  And you don't have to take my word for it- see for yourself!-Matt.3			"

Note, this game is a bit buggy at the moment but for what it's worth, and how amazing that this runs on Unity, it's worth it if you like exploration. Animations aren't that great, but it's made by practically one guy on a limited budget. Overall, I'd wait until the full release to get the best experience.			"

								The game is really good as far as concept and being really fun and interesting. The bad stuff currently outweighs the good. So am I saying that you should not buy this? No thats not my verdict at this time. I say if you are a patient person and dont mind waiting a while for a polished experience and want to support the games development then buy now. The game is packed full of content and lots of areas to explore and systems to learn. Only problem with that is that half the time you have no idea where you are going or even why you are going there. This is mainly because of the map being bugged, buildings and towns dissappearing, yes thats right! locations gone and nothing there but good ol terrain. If you are lucky and the buildings are there then the quest item or person is missing. I have been playing this game for what feels like forever. I backed the game and been with it since the very first build was released. The game has improved over time but honestly I really dont think a game of this magnitude with only one person working on it can be finished without dropping some things in the game that are really not needed or just boring. I will give it to the developer, he has stuck with it and never once have I felt this guy is going to burn us and abandon the game.			"

								I backed this game for the higher 100usd tier when it was on Kickstarter. It looked to have a tonne of potential and I loved where they were going with it. But it never really meant much of anywhere. I paid specifically for the OSX version (still doesn't work) and was to get several items to be able to play with my friend (still not implemented).  I understand that the developers perhaps became a bit tired, but nearly every message from KS I received regarding this game in the more recent years were asking for money to help them to develop other games. I was really quite hoping they would follow through. But this is just another early access game that will never be completed. And I definitely feel as though I wasted my money. I've learned my lesson this year with pre-ordering (thanks No Man's Sky) and with Kickstarter and Early Access projects now. I've several other KS projects I backed that I'm seriously considering asking for refunds now.Don't back on KS and don't pre-order. You'll just be super disappointed.			"

								I have derived much more enjoyment from this game (despite its bugs which sometimes feel like they're being replaced rather than resolved) than I have from a game in a long time. The pace and surroundings are a welcomed contrast to what has become the norm. No pointless flashy lights and bright colors in this one.The interactions between player and NPCs feel important and every word is meaningful. Very well written with few wasted words to wade through. It requires close attention and good retention to progress in the game. This game came along when it was exactly what i was seeking. A bit sick of games which require little thought and only passive involvement. I only end up playing them for a couple of hours and getting bored.If the developer is able to find someone to help squash the bugs, the game will be a favorite very soon.			"

Early Access Review
								(I will update this review from time to time, as I make it further though the game.)Ever since I booted up Morrowind for the first time over a decade ago, I've been looking for a game to help me recapture that since of wonder and fulfillment I felt while exploring the island of Vvardenfell. I bought Frontiers hoping that it finally might be that game.I crashed shortly after finishing the Prologue.Well, that was mightily disappointing!But I'm still plugging away at the game, optimizing and prodding game settings until I can finally manage struggle past the post-prologue. Until then, I'll leave off by saying that this is one of the few games I've purchased since last year that has given me hope for another classic experience akin to the early Elder Scrolls games. cannot give the development team enough of my support and wish them the best in making this extremely ambitiously promising game!UPDATE!So I made it out the area immediately after the prologue! Hooray!!!Without spoiling the post-prologue region too much, I can tell you that already I am pleased with what I see. The environments of the game, even on lower graphics settings, still manage to inspire a tingle of excitement. You'll be treated to sweeping grasslands and sparkling seas, foreboding mountains and quaint, if slightly static, villages. Whenever I begin to wander, I am immediately reminded of when you first clambered out of that prison drainpipe in Oblivion. You are bluntly presented with the game world, which is both tantalizingly open and slightly intimidating. You are given a rough direction and a license to travel, but if you want to go off rails, you have complete freedom!Mechanically, the game rides comfortably in the ruts of previous survival crafting sim trailblazers like Minecraft, but with some very pleasing additions. You can move and interact with most objects in the game with the right mouse button or by pressing the 'use' button. Some objects and even NPC's have descriptions attached to them that either give some insight into your objectives or are just a morsel of humorous fluff that fleshes out the game and gives its sometimes worlds some additional character. While that itself is probably not too amazing, I was impressed by the amount of objects with which you can interact right at the start (Note: picking up entire cabinets/tables/crates of baked bread is possible, though not advised). You also have your basic survival meters of health, hunger, thirst, etc. Rather then plain bars that decrease over time, these needs are represent by icons that grow larger as your character's desire for them increases. Fulfilling these needs currently gives you a boost to certain stats and encourages you to make yourself as comfortable/prepared as possible before starting an arduous journey to parts unknown. I haven't investigated crafting very much, and will do so later on.Stylistically, the game actually reminds me a bit of the Thief series, albeit brighter, cheerier, and significantly less claustrophobic. Yes, that is a strange comparison, and I will do my best to elaborate. The NPCs, for one, remind me so strongly of the old character models from Thief that I have began mentally referring to anyone in the game wearing face paint as a 'woodsy one'. Mind you, this isn't a criticism! I loved the look of those angular puppet people back in the day, and the character models in Frontiers much more detailed than the taffers in Thief 2 ever were. The models in Arx Fatalis might also make for a good comparison. The game also toys around with the same pseudo-medieval/early modern vibe that Thief perfected. You carry around an oil lantern, but many rooms are also lit with torches or candles. Character wear sometimes robes and tunics. while they also don long-cuffed gloves and knee boots while no doubt searching around for their heavy, leather greatcoats. While there isn't yet quite as much world building as Thief yet, no doubt it isn't far in coming.To end this next installment succinctly, I'll just say that I still have shaken my strong sense of excitement for this game. I can't wait to dive back in as the builds get more stable and I can explore further!			"

								Please keep in mind, FRONTIERS is in the Early-Access Beta Stage. FRONTIERS, is a First Person perspective RPG, with low budget graphics. In it's early-access state, it still has bugs, but reminds me of Morrowwind a little. It has a vast map, full of varying landscapes, and Villages with NPC's. Collect resources and live off the land, Interact with NPC's, Explore and Discover ancient ruins, FRONTIERS is a complete open-world RPG.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open-world RPG's, but I will stress again that it is an Early-Access Beta, so it does have bugs, and the graphics are something you would expect of a game from 2002 - 2004, not 2015. This doesn't make it a bad game, but for some who are used to the hyper-realism of todays games, the point needs to be stressed. Given the game is being created by one person, I can only imagine what it could be if it had a full team of developers and the budget of an Elder Scrolls game. I think this game has a lot of potential and give it a thumbs up.			"

								The game has some serious bugs and grphic issues. Grass growing inside most buildings and seem to keep falling through walls and having to reload. Trying to complete a quest to give items to the uncles friends and have a seriously difficalt time locating them. Not sure if I just can't find them or if they are not loading, hard to tell since I only find about 6 different NPCs and all with the same 6 names. Princing of items is silly, A cool ring for 1 cent and a potato that cost 8000+ cents? lolThat being said....... IT IS BETA!The concept and model are awesome and once the bugs are worked out, this game will be epic, I have spent 6+ hours just getting a grasp of the beginning, can't imaging the hours of game-play when I start building skills and striving to explore the open world.If you want to play an awesome completed adventure..... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME....... YET!If you want to watch the growth of an EPIC GAME....... GET IT NOW!First look - AWESOMENESS IN PROGRESS!			"

								This game is great even at start, the base of the content is ALL there. BUT this game isn't playable currently, i'd say wait at least a month before buy. I'd give this game a 10/10 when it's completed most likely. But at the moment 6/10, obviously you shouldn't mind my current rating because its still in Beta. The base of the game is all there and its pretty good. This game will be amazing when its completed. But again, I do not recommend currently buying it. But I am not going to give this game a thumbs down, I will give it a thumbs up for now even though I do no recommend to buy it currently.			"

								Aside from not being able to get past the ""six months later"" area in the school (crashes), I really have enjoyed the first 40 minutes of play so far. The graphics are well done, character movement is smooth, and the music is flat out fantasy awsomeness. I'll give it a few more tries getting past the area that has been constantly crashing, and hopefully will succeed - I want to explore!So far I'd say 7/10.Edit*I have finnally gotten past the school. It seems it was the graphics settings that lagged the game to crash - was running everything maxed on desktop gtx 760, quad core i5, 8gb ram. Strange becasue I thought my computer would easily handle this game... Must need to be optimized better. Other than that I have been able to explore more so that is a good thing.			"

								The introduction text of this game seemed very interesting. A game like Daggerfall, which I played on DOS box, but after playing 2 hours, there are just soo many bugs in this game: items disappearing in the inventory, Books that you steal or barter don't even end up in the inventory. The world doesn't load all places and you simply sink through into nothingness. That part is very much like minecraft when digging through the bottom of the world. One of the houses has an elevator and 9 out of 10 times, it lifts right through the player and it doesn't take you up. NPC's don't fight back they simply die and when you want to take their stuff, you can somehow magically still barter with them. Be careful to follow the paths or you might end up in the part of the world that doesn't yet contain any trees or cities, which makes the game look empty.Ok I've revised my review. I will recommend it, since the game as a lot of potential, but just be aware that at the moment there are lots and lots of bugs. It will take them at least half a year to fix those before they should add new functionality. Hopefully the new programmer will do a lot of good.			"

This is game is built for people who enjoy exploration, building/crafting items from scratch with a minecraft type system. I didn't reccommend this game at first becasue i simply could not play it but as of now i have changed my mind and i DO recommend this game, there is a lot of content for a 15$ price tag hopefully this review helps you figure out your deciosion of purchasing this title.

								At the time of this review, I had not put a SINGLE minute into playing Frontiers. (A minimum of 5 minutes is required to write a review) However, I am giving it a thumbs up simply on the basis of pure honesty. You may be thinking I am crazy to do such a thing, but try to hear me out. I have been following the progress of this game for awhile now, so I can assure you that I have been sincerely interested in it since it was announced on Greenlight. But when I read a recent article about it, I was sold right then and there. The developer of Frontiers has publicly announced:""A lot of folks have told me: I'm buying this game for my kid/friend/spouse for Christmas, they love exploration games! And I say the same thing every time: DON'T!""""The only people who will love it are players who seek it out for themselves, because it's NOT FINISHED. Your kid/friend/spouse will just be annoyed with you. I'm proud of this game, and with everyone's help I believe it's going to be great - but it's not great yet, so in the meantime get your kid/friend/spouse Dragon Age or The Binding of Isaac or something, trust me.""I must say.... How REFRESHING. I am speaking from a position of having a very bitter taste of early access nightmares on my palate. Now you may be thinking that it's a genious marketing ploy using reverse psychology, but I find this to be doubtful considering this is major revenue the developer very well may be losing, especially during the Holiday Steam sale...a very opportune time to make some excellent dough. This takes guts. The game may have a long ways to go, but I believe this incredibly responsible attitude needs to be encouraged in a selfish new era of gaming where the end product is a often a deliberate farcry from an honest game players can enjoy. Here is the original article that sold me on this: http://kotaku.com/dev-on-steam-warns-do-not-buy-this-game-as-a-christmas-1671913955 "

								Warning: This game is inexorably broken... after the prologue you literally have to restart the game in order to play...so why do I recommend this game? Because It speaks to me of a time when games were a glitchy, convoluted mess. A time of Arena, Daggerfall and Morrowind; when it felt like only a true master was able to progress in games, let alone understand what the hell was going on...and that was ok. I still remember playing Morrowind as a child: I never managed to finish the campaign, or even progress past my first meeting with Vivec. I would always end up killing some important npc or just on the otherside of the game world, doing literally nothing and loving it. But even though I was too young then to really understand the glory of a true rpg, I could always see that potential, the possibilities the game would give to me.  Anything was possible.  To this day I often go back and try to finish the game, but always end up getting sidetracked. The problem is that a difficulty spike in different areas meant you kind of had to follow a strict story arc in order to progress... This game gives me that same feeling, except that's what FRONTIERS is about. It's about that journey, it doesn't just let you, but encourages you to go on  the adventure of going off the beaten path and screwing up the main storyline.  In fact there's even a feature to build your own paths (and fast travel routes) so that you can do this easier. This game isn't going to be for everyone. It's not even really for me, and I probably won't play it as much as I like to think I will. But the time i've had in it so far was easily worth the money I payed for it, and I look forward to playing FRONTIERS in the future when it's more...playable. Also, as a strange sidenote, the inventory system is spot on. I don't know what it is about inventory systems in these games but they always just hit that spot for me.  Being able to pick up a sack and then arrange my inventory into it... I spent far too much time in the prologue arranging items only to find out (to my dissapointment) you play as a different character and don't get to keep any of it.  And Equiping gloves, boots, leggings, chest etc. seperately? I love that stuff. Don't ask me why newer games simplified it so much.  Who the hell thought they should remove boots and make it part of the pants? and whatever happened to shoulder guards? Well, sorry for that rant, I know it came out of nowhere. Anyway, if you've had the patience to read this review all the way, you have the patience to enjoy this game. buy it.			"

								Honestly wouldn't recommend. I was a Kickstarter backer because of the original premise, and the game look a 180 degree turn during development. The graphics are HORRIBLE because the developer scaled wayyyy up and tried to develop a huge world by himself with too many features. He should have stuck to his original plan. The game is so buggy that I honestly can't play very long. On top of that it seems like once he realized he couldn't do it, he took his money, ran, created a company and started making other games instead. So here we are stuck with this, fun.			"

								This game was a bit confusing at first, but after 30 mins of gametime i learned most of the mechanics and i must say i was immersed into the game's enviroment almost immediately. That said, this is still a early access game and thus is obviously prone to bugs and glitches, but surprisingly i didn't notice that many. This game has alot of potential and it will definatly go far if the developer sticks to it and updates it regularly, but before you consider buying the game, look up reviews and gameplay vids to see if you think it is worth a buy in its current state.

								I can't reccomend the game, and for many reasons. For starters, the game is dead, no more updates, the developer use to be updating this game 24/7, but as soon as the game got bigger, the game got more difficult to continue. Another reason why I can't reccomend this game is because the game is not optimized, the game is so poorly optimized that if you set it to the lowest graphics, your still going to experience lag, which I find ridiculous. If this game was optimized, I probably would have leaned toward a yes for a review, potentially because the game does have a lot of content, the poor optimization just makes this game impossible to give a good review.  4/10 for me, if the developer ever optimizes, I will consider in changing my review.

Got out of the prologue area and into some Guild town, but can't get anyone to talk to me so that I can get missions or anything.

But it really does not matter. The game is lovely and fun, and i'm suprised that the developers have accomplished what they have with Unity!! A few things need some work: like the animations for weapons, adding in some arms to make it look like the items arn't just floating in front of you, saves not working, ect. All together as it stands i would give the game a 6.5/10I would still recommend waiting for it to be fully optomized and hold all the features it should!			"

								You play as a friend or relative of a guy named daniel who went on a journey. After the prologue, in which you play daniel and recruit people for a journey or something, you wake up in a university or school with a professor in front of you. There are no other students around you and the professor don't want to talk to you, maybe she is angry because you felt asleep? Maybe just hates the ugly UI and her existens? So you explore the castle in which you're in and find many other, similiar looking npcs and a lot of doors with lovely loading-times when opening. Still nobody wants to talk to you. So you go out to the (early 2000 graphics but still low FPS) world, still not nothing what to do or what to become. A blue lightning is marking a way so you follow it. You come by a training ground where you find a pickaxe. You picked it up and think to yourself: ""maybe i can become a miner and people will finally like me?"". With new joy you go to the nearest rock to use it, but this doesnt work and the result ist just a stuck blurry text blocking the middle of your visuals.Your body feels not normal, you can't sprint without blacking out. Just one rock and already a injury? So you have to abandon your new lifeplan and lose the rest of hope. You continued to follow the shiny blue lighting, as it is the only thing to do, till you realize it is going in a circle - so even the blue light is trolling you. After a while you feel not welcome here, so you are getting more and more depressed and alone. Out of boredom you steal things and even start to set things on fire (which is a function you get pretty much everywhere). More and more things are burning. The whole castle is burning, maybe people would give you attention as pyromaniac psychopath? Still nobody talkes to you, they even ignored your lovely fire. you began to think this couldn't be real, the whole world is against you.... but you will teach them.... you start mudering those arrogant NPCs one after an other, while constantly having almost blackouts because of your medical condition (back in the day's as a miner). Nobody tries to stop or arrest you, so you continue with a huge smile. Their screems in agony and pain are the first voices you hear in this game...you know, it feels good to get finally some attention..... 10/10 Psychopath-Simulator			"

								My First Impressions and 53minutes of Gameplay:Game looks like it can be fun, if you do the whole Role Playing and just let yourself merge into the game and take your time, reading everything, looking and exploring all items in the room before you leave to the next room. The Skills that you have to aquire and level of detail makes this a great game.Suggestions to the Creator of the game.I would definitely add in these to make this a top notch game probably even better than skyrim if it's done right:1.Voices to every Dialogue/interaction with people (there is lots of reading)/ although it does not deter me away from the game, this might be a major turn off for other gamers who don't have big screens or enough patience or good readin skills, it would be wise to add voices, not even necessarily moving lips to it, but good RP games have good voice overs. Heck im sure people you know would even be willing to do it for free.2.NPC movement (not just circling around) or at least add line of sight, so you are not always being spotted during a murder or theft, the constant ""don't bother me now"" dialogue is a bit excessive.3.NPC features: they go to sleep when it's late, shift rotations, (this allows for thievery to be more exciting and even just exploring)4.Shadow Meter:  it would be nice to have a visibility system and noise  to give it that real world i can choose my own path effect.5.Lockpicking Skills6.Music: needs to be more medieval/villagy feel at times7.Graphics: this is always the hardest part and time consuming and takes lot of resources ($$) to run it, but going little more into the detail of faces and character creation would be nice.While i understand the early access idea is to generate the income necessary to make it all work, there are several things that you have in this game that can be optimized already, especially the list i made above. I believe this could be the ultimate game, but waiting too long can also thwart any plans of it.I am looking forward to more gameplay and I hope you consider these mechanics into the game.			"

								The concept and story seem great, but the game is frankly unplayable in its current state, and I don't mean because of the framerate drops.  The initial prologue/tutorial broke for me 4 times in a row due to a number of inventory bugs, and after I had finally completed it, I entered the real part of the game and couldn't interact with any objects.  I tried restarting and selecting the option to move straight to the university spawn to skip the prologue and see if that helped, and it did!  I was able to play through the first part of the first mission, got the portrait, then followed the quest marker to the estate.  The maid told me that the quest target was upstairs, and I proceeded to spend 30 minutes scouring ever inch of the estate, inside and out, to find the man the maid told me to.  He wasn't there.  Given that the prologue was broken along with the very first mission, I'll wait for a few updates and then give it another go.  I understand it's early access, but the beginning segments are so broken I can't tell what is even in the game right now.  I'll update this review if the game gets updated because I really do want to like this game.			"

Early Access Review
								IMPORTANT: This review is based on my expectations on the game and the early build thats out for the time being, as I like those kind of games and have  high hopes for this one. If you are looking for something to start playing right away, don't buy this yet, as it will take quite some time till it is finished.Pro: -Solid, colourfull artstyle that fits the fantasy-like setting of the world-Interessting landscapes to explore-A lot of interaction with the enviroment (you can litteraly take every object that is standing around, rearrange furniture and gather ressources-Many nice features of sandbox and RPG games in one package (learning-by-doing skills, plants to experiment with and alchemy, crafting, bartering and stealing etc.)-a unique world setting -not only basic needs like hunger and thirst but also temperature, endurance and diffrent damage types-civilitation system: being in a town or near civilization gives you buffs and encourages you to build camps to have those boosts in the wilderness too, or you will suffer from cold/heat and danger in the wildsCons:-many features not or semi-implemented as expected of a beta-no real response of the NPC's to your actions (stealing, murder, reputation)-crafting only has a few recipes-a lot of bugs and glitches (clipping, camera, the second city has a road that ends in some kind of garden area, if you drop down from it you are trapped, as the road is a floating 2D platform above ground ad you can't get back up, etc)-the sandbox and RPG elements seem to hinder each other sometimes (more info below)-no tutorial yet to explain key bindings and mechanics-graphic details are very low, especially NPC's, faces, animations and enviroments need a lot of work-very clunky interface, inventory managment is a chore, and mouse movement seems buggy in menus, especially the menus for Quests/Logs and skills are unintuitive and hard to navigate through or find information in them-world and story are quite short to this dateThe civilization aspect is a really good idea: It gives you this feeling of an explorer, that conquers the unknown and sets up an outpost to bring the comforts of home with him. This makes building a proper, fleshed out base a worthy goal, rather then just carrying a bed with you to sleep through the night in minecraft-style.I really could see me enjoy the story, if it would lead me directly into adventure, but the current quests are more a standart RPG approach from the book of roleplaying 1O1. They have quite a nice touch to them, but they are boring if you aren't into this kind of imerrsion right at the start of the game.The game has definetly a lot of potential, but it also needs a lot of time, maybe a half year or more, untill it will be enjoyable. And it would be very nice, when there will be a more survival focused start to the game, that seems to be in the works. The mixture of the genres is quite new and interresting, but the devs will need to balance the elements out some more or give players the decision to play either a explorer in the wilds or roleplay as a hero, because right now those two parts kind of split the fun, as you have to quest a lot without any hints when the survival and adventuring will start. Of course you could just run of into the nearest forest to set up a tent, but this just makes me feel like a kid that imagines to be a pioneer instead of actually BEING a pioneer.But I'm sure that the devs will find a way to combine the genres and as it seems now, there will also be a free sandbox mode to play your own way in the future. I just hope that progress and update will be coming in frequently, since news are the best way to keep this game alive.			"

The Dev is also a great guy. Honest and friendly. I wish more companies were as genuine and transparent as Lars! Worth $15 now. Worth $50 when it's finished.			"

								Rough around the edges, but shows a good deal of promise. While the character models and animations are rough-looking, the environments look nice, definitely a plus for a game about exploration. Has an interesting story and setting. It's nice to see a game in this style that goes beyond recycling medieval fantasy tropes. Worth a look if you're nostalgic for the pre-Oblivion Elder Scrolls titles and similar games.			"

								Man, this game has got a lot of problems. I'm used to Bugthesda games but this is a tinge worse I gotta say so I can't give this game a recommendation as of right now. Is it playable? Yes. Can you play it without pulling your hair out? No. I would consider this game being in early alpha. WAY too many bugs/glitches. Only get Frontiers if you somehow see the potential and want to help the developer balance and bug test this game. Read the Early Access notes.			"

								I want to love this game, I really do.  The concept is great, the dev is passionate and invested in making it......but it's a hot mess.It's loaded with game breaking bugs, AI pathfinding issues, the controls feel swimmy and loose, the menus are confusing and hard to navigate, combat is servicable at best.It really feels like the dev should have started with a smalled area, gotten the engine hammered out and functional, then worried about story and content after.  As it stands, it's pretty unplayable, and despite several updates, not much ever really changes.Getting the world working should be the priority before deciding how players should buy things.All in all, worth a follow, and maybe a causious purchase to support the dev as he really does seem dedicated to making his game happen, but if you're looking for something to play, you may want to hold off.  Can't recommend it for now, but will keep checking back on it.			"

								Let me start off by saying I don't usually play these types of game, care about the stories or anything to do with them, but I got it in a bundle and decided I would give it a try thinking it didn't look too awful. It's not good, the optimization is terrible and for that reason alone this game needs to be pulled from steam and worked on in private for a good while because as of right now it's downright unplayable. As of writing this review, steam says I have about 10 minutes in game, here is what I did: loaded it up, looked through the menus thinking ""this is quite nice"", spent about 3 minutes (it was probably closer to 1 but it felt like a while) loading into the game, picked up some random stuff, got a chair stuck on a table, set the table on fire, picked up some more stuff, managed to get the chair off the table and sat in it, got stuck in the chair, set the chair on fire while still in it, mashed buttons until I managed to stand up (I think F1 is what did it), walked outside and spoke to 2 people 1 of whiched I believe called me ""Daniel"" which isn't my characters name, left the village, spent another 4 days loading the next area only to find it running at about 4 FPS which is always nice, went to leave the Church of Lag only to find opening a door required more loading, quit. TL;DR: It needs more work before anyone should play this.			"

								Do you want Morrowind? Because this is how you get Morrowind!In all serious though folks if you're a fan of old Bethesda RPG's ((before they got ransacked and turned into Baby's First RPG: see Skyrim or Fallout 4)) than this is definitely heading in the right direction. A lot of reading is required something the modern RPG doesn't set you up for in all actuality but you like that, than time well spent on an immersive feeling. Hopefully the developement continues in such fashion as to clean up some of the glitches and bugs encountered in the short time I've spent on it. Something to keep your eye on and if you've got the 1$ for this month's Humble Bundle (April 2017) than I recommend at least giving it a shot for a few pennies, nothing ventured nothing gained or so its told (which seems to be the theme of the game in the prologue).I'll try and give an update with more gameplay time under my belt but life is busy so who knows...

								Well, I don't want to be mean but words have a meaning : this is not a beta. It's an alpha, and a VERY buggy one. It looks like to have some potential : the story could be interesting, overall the world is believable, etc...However, you cannot play this game for  now. I will give you  a couple of bugs I saw in my 5 mins of play :- the introduction cinematic cut when something happened (a fire appeared)- a guy behind a desk told me he needed to talk to me.  I went near him but I touched him, so he moved back through the wall ... sorry about that !- looks like the worm in the water cannot hurt you- when you move backward in the water, after a while you are running like 1000 miles / hours- the only lethal enemies I found were pigs ... and they were creepy as they moved but without any animation - the UI is so buggy that I had to restart the game many as my cursor  was stock or an asset overlapped buttons- and so many more ...Once again, this game have the potential to be OK, maybe even good I think. But with those bugs, it's more like a competitor of Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing. Yeah, that bad. Don't bother for now.			"

								I 'm typically supportive of Early Access games and believe they deserve a chance, so I typically won't bad-mouth them pre-release. I'm making an exception. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- the controls are atrocious from the begining (inverted axis only sometimes, not FULL controller supprt), the intro is fairly dumb (improve the font and add narration, please!), and I'm just at a point where I feel I've been fooled by the screenshots into believing this was a game worth trying. This is in addition to the developer's apparent lackluster attitude toward going forward with the game (via what I saw on the kickstarter (because games on Steam from devs making additional games need Kickstarters?).The developers need to get their crap together. Finish what you start in a positive way and you'll establish a fan base that will buy future products. That's like Business 101. Don't move on to more projects and spread yourself thin.			"

								I remember the first game of my childhood - it was Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, a faintly primitive arcade with linear design, and nothing special in any aspect, except, well, for the sense of magic and wonder it brought. Partly because it was my first game. Partly because it was about magic after all. It's been years since then, and a lot of games. Well-written games. Interesting games. When I launched Harry Potter not so long ago, out of pure nostalgia, I regretted - not everything ages well, and some impressions are better kept where they are now - in the memory. But when I launched FRONTIERS, some of that sense of wonder and magic came back.It's a well-written and interesting game. It's very raw, yes, but even in its current state it's capable of intriguing and entertaining. It's well-written. It has a lot of nice concepts. And most importantly, it's fun. Can't wait for it to get released fully. Did I mention it's well-written, though? Can't stress it enough.(Will be updated).			"

								Reading other reviews depresses me as it clearly showcases the impatience and ignorance of many gamers in our generation today. I see complaints from people who played the game for 6 minutes about things that, if they had spent even 30 seconds reading about, they would not be complaining about. I see complaints about being called Daniel in the prologue when if they read the opening letter they would realize they are not yet playing as their character. That is the most embarrassing thing I've ever seen. It doesn't even require reading outside the game. It's the very first piece of text you see. If you are incapable of reading a sentence in a game, why did you bother to write a review about a game centered on casual exploration?! The second complaint I see is the glitch where you can't speak to anyone after completing the prologue. This is something easily fixed by saving and reloading the game... Instead of giving the game a chance, I see oceans of negative reviews because people refused to invest even one moment in finding a way to make it work. With that aside, I'll give my actual review: For what it is trying to be, it's spectacular, but very incomplete. The world is very empty, and honestly quite lonely. Very few people have even passing dialogue, and even if you wander far you're not guaranteed to find anything really very interesting. Despite this, the developer had shown persistence in trying to advance this project, despite people baselessly speculating about nonexistent side projects that have supposedly overtaken this one. Quite honestly, if the developer wants to see this project in its full form, he needs to sell it to a major developer and have them complete it, because one person cannot do it alone. That is the unfortunate reality. Despite this, I still have enjoyed my time with this game and will continue to. Please don't be demoralized by ignorance Lars. A truly reasonable person will always see the worth in this masterpiece in progress. Everyone else is just too foolish to know when their input is not required.			"

								If you decide to play the prologue, you will see shotty, clunky controls. Youll talk around with a few people, and it seems somewhat decent. You learn a couple basic controls and a rough guide to the controls.After you exit the desert camp, a cutscene starts and it brings you to a classroom (if you skipped the prologue, you start here) in a different town where you can not talk to anyone. You see a blue trail line (similar to the line you see in Fable or Skyrim that leads you to your quest) that brings you to the walls and then it brings you back to the entrance. The mechanics all seem broken, its not even alpha. You get 5 minutes of play time before there is a wall. You can ""explore"" outside the village with the people you cant talk too. Explore only entails you walking around the scenery.The designer is a single person and wants help to develop the game. If you are okay with helping him develop the game, go for it. Just expect this to be similar to a kickstarter campaign rather than a alpha but almost beta game.			"

								i am not going to do a full review of this game. My 14 minutes of game play wouldn't warrent such. However, i will give you my impressions of the game. Thankfully, it looks like i will get a refund. If you want to try it, keep the refund policy in mind (14 days after purchase, less than 2 hours of play). And this is early access. I knew that buying it, but didn't want to take a $15 hit for a game that did not live up to its bold vision.3 good2 average1 badgenre: 2open world sandbox. My actual game play time was almost 2 hours, so i did see some of the world. It is open. You can wander off in any direction you want. That is good. character, customization: 1 and 1/2you have very limited choice in what your character looks like, and it wouldn't matter anyways since it is in first person view. There really aren't classes. Not bad. Means you can play and develop your character as you want. Can play as male or female. i believe there are skills or a perk system you can choose from. This part was passable.story, mission, relevance: ?gameworld: 1It claimed to be a throwback to Morrowwind, but the game reminded me of Morrowwind in no way, shape, or form. didn't see much of it. There are towns with npcs you can interact with, in a very limited way. Doesn't seem to be any wildlife in the world. At least not in the first portion of it. Nothing spectacular stood out to me, other than how incredibly ugly and distorted the npcs looked, and how generic the village environment looked. Generic at best. The reviews said it was a big and wonderful world to explore. Didn't get much of a chance to do that. What i saw was not wonderful.innovation: 2it has some good ideas that it has borrowed from other games. Nothing wrong with that. It wants to be a survival game and has stats for hunger, thirst, and rest. It wants to be a mining game. I never got to that part. It wants to be a crafting game. Didn't get to that either. And it wants to be an exploration game. It failed miserably in this respect. The game talks big and dreams big. I applaud that. It just isn't there yet. mechanics, combat, saves: 1/2for me, the only thing that would have made this game worse in this category is if it did not load at all. It loads, but it takes longer to load than my Skyrim game on the PS3 console. Once it loads, you get to the character development screen, and this was pleasant and kind of inspiring. It gives you hope that maybe it was worth the wait. Not so. As i said, the game world looks generic. I am not one of those gamers that needs a game world to look pretty as long as plays pretty, but it plays ugly. The controls are upside down. To interact with the world, you have to have things positioned perfectly. The NPCs don't seem real. And when you go out to explore, you are moving at a mind-numbing 5 to 10 fps. And that lag is the reason i requested a refund. I can not play a laggy game. I have read full pages of books and turned them faster than my first person blob moved. As for combat, the game doesn't want to be a COD stepchild, so it isn't in the front end of the game. That means i do not know anything about the combat.Not all was negative, though. The game lets you save anywhere, just as long as you have the time to wait for it to finish. The user interface that stretches out at the bottom of the screen looks nice. And it seems to give a lot of useful survival information. I think it is useful. I don't think hovering the mouse over the interface tells you what the symbols represent.  replayability: ?uniqueness: 2it is true to its claims: it is an open world exploration game with survival elements add in. I wanted a game like this and knew this was what i was getting.graphics: 1the wilderness doesn't look bad. The village is mediocre. The npcs are horrible. Worse than unmodded Morrowwind. Meaning, this game would have looked bad even back when Morrowwind came out. But i have no issue with this. I played and loved Daggerfall, which had god-aweful graphics. I am currently playing Darklands, which makes Daggerfall look like Witcher 3. No one would have bought this game based on the graphics, including myself.10 out of 27 or 37%. If we rate the game minus the two sections i was unable to explore, it gets a little better rating: 10 out of 21 or 47%.i guess i lied. I did do a full review. Before doing this review, i went to the game's forum and looked at some of the posts. One of the gamers had a lag problem that he was able to fix by doing some sort of fix to some sort of file. Didn't understand how he did it. So there might be a fix for the lag. As for the developer, he seems to do regular updates and is very responsive to feedback. Which makes me kind of sad that i can't approve his game at this time. If he gets everything figured out, or gets an understandable fix to the lag problem, he will have a fun but ugly exploration, crafting, survival game. When it is fun, i will not care about the graphics. And maybe i will buy it again at that time. For now, i have to get my refund so i can try out another exploration game that i passed up to play this one. Conclusion: has potential, has lag. If you try it, make sure to not mess up your refund.			"

								I'll try to make this as brief and accurate as possible. I will try and highlight what little the game has to offer if anything and the seemingly insurmountable amount of work that will need to go into this game before being a legitmate title worth money.  Pros:-Landscape is massive. -Fast traveling is useful to go back and forth.-As of now death is impossible.Cons:-Death is impossible to achieve. -Npc's will not attack you no matter how hard you try or how many people you murder in front of them.-Bought every item in the game for under 20 gold. (I seemingly started with over 150 gold.) -Upon reaching one of the six wonders of the world I was delighted to see that absolutely nothing was there and that the whole are in general was not even complete as most of the enviroment was floating in mid air.-The game's formatting is among the worst in recent time. Your computer will not be able to run this game properly no matter what GPU you have. i.e. NVIDIA, AMD.-Aimless exploration that offers no satisfaction or reward.-You have the ability to equip over 15 items on your person however no items have any stats or weight or for that matter any characterisics what so ever. -No customization or ability to see your character from third person.-Almost every interaction is bugged.I'm going to cut myself short on this con list of mine because there is no limit to the problems this game has at this time.. All I can say is that I am very disappointed in what I thought would be a promising game, and I feel mislead by the advertisment around this game. All the features you see in the trailer are either yet to be put in game or just not realized. This game has a lot of potential I will give it that, but until you can run the game at 30 fps this game literally has nothing to offer. Slow choppy animation, horrible graphics, consistant game crashes and I would be hard pressed to honestly tell you any actual piece of content this game has to offer. STAY AWAY FOR AT LEAST A YEAR. The developers have a lot of work ahead of them if they actually want to complete this project, but in my opinion based off most early access games this will be another incomplete garbage cash grab.

I got this and two other games for $1.00 and I still feel ripped off.  Just another ""stuck-in-developer-hell"" early access game.  Not worth the time...  YET.			"

								I will not recomend this game till you fix the boundries and colisions.  If I can walk through the walls of ruins and when It takes some serious patients to get the game just to load then you have much greater issues then Bartending and trapping mechanices.  Get it right guys, you can't play a game even if its early access without there being something of a basics to game play finished.			"

								As an Oculus Rift user, having bought the game based on the mostly positive reviews, I feel cheated. I was so surprised at the lack of function and the ps1 era character models and the massive bugs that I at first thought that all these positive reviews are bloody fake! that's the only way I can explain why anyone would give a positive review at this point. The game needs tons of work, and is absolutely horrible to experience on the Oculus Developer Kit 2. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE EXPECTING IT TO BE PLAYABLE AS PER BEING IN THE VR SUPPORT SECTION. 5 minutes for the rest of the level to load while you can walk through the walls that haven't pooped in yet, HORRIBLE frame rates in seemingly lackluster environments, etc etc etc. I wanted this to be what steam seems to think it is, but steam this time turned out to be full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I tried to get a refund, exchange, etc etc, I excplicitly told steam it's FALSE ADVERTISING as in the ""VR SUPPORT"" category, and also asked them to remove it from their VR section, no go.

								Thumbs-up from me, concept and potential are great. Yet at this point there are too many issues  though (graphics, GUI, performance, everything :) )being a smart♥♥♥♥♥ i give my humble advice to keep an eye on the following:- Interface: the amount of functions, items and options is going to be vast. keep the menus accessible. e.g. not only give hints what to do with an item, but also quick access functions for things you are about to do very often (example: dont make it necessary to open a menu and click around when you want to eat or fill yout water bottle). Always hide options that are unnecessary in a given situation (crafting menu is horrib...erm... difficult ;) )- mood: the great open-world titles are so good because their teams had the capability and resources to spend months of development on millions of tiny details that make the world alive.  i know speech, sounds and all cannot be finished at this point but theres much to consider: npc activity, pc-character animations, ""unnecessary"" social interactions, tiny animals, wind, ..., ...- balance rpg vs. crafting: i suspect many folks expect a skyrim with way more interaction possibilities. dont get lost in crafting only and keep an exciting  character development in mind. for some social, stealth or combat skills are equally important in an open world that feels real.i'll keep watching :)			"

								I bought this game years ago, and its been utterly unplayable since the day I bought it, completely broken with no way to really progress. So why am I recommending it?Essentially, I just really respect what the developer was trying to do here. He made the sort of ambitious game that, in an age of nostalgia-bait 2D platformers and terrible Unity FPS games, is utterly refreshing. Its the sort of game every developer wants to make, but none have the drive to do. Its big, its beautiful even despite the game breaking glitches, and while I'll never be able to experience any of this game, somehow or another I can't bear to uninstall it, and am wishing to try again as I type this. It reminds me of the days of the days of games like Braid, Fez and Dust, games made by a small team with a lot of ambition.TL;DR this game is a broken, unplayable mess, but it makes me nostalgic and somehow or another I have faith in the developer.Rating: if you have 15 bucks its worth a look, I think			"

								Thanks Humble Bundle and L (dev) for letting me play this nice exploration game. If you want the same feeling you got with Daggerfall or Morrowind, try this one. If you are able to put aside flaws, you'll enjoy this raw jewel. Sure it's buggy and incomplete, but we are here to help this guy completing the project. Please, check forum for important known bugs before playing (major one: must restart game after prologue and choose Academy spawn point for NPC conversation to be accessible and actually be able to play the game).
