												It's a well polished game where the loot is actually viable to use. You are not just selling everything to the vendor but you find stuff that you can use and come up with different combinations for your characters like maybe an embermage that carries a gun and a shield or a traditional weapon like a staff or even two wands. Simple put: the itemization in the game is enormous! There are skill trees available that offer numerous different builds. For example, I started with an embermage and went all +Ice damage. But then I added some fire gear and spells and now I have a completely unique spell build that just makes me want to create another embermage to try out different combinations.The only thing that I am not a big fan of is the art work and bright color scheme of the game. At first it wasn't my cup of tea per say but it actually does work well for the style of story they are presenting the customers/gamers.It's extremely well done. There is no Auction House or Real Money Auction House. It is the standard for an ARPG and what a game should be.			"

TL;DR? See ConclusionNOTE: Related ContentAlso see my:Torchlight (1) ReviewINTRODUCTION:Torchlight II is an isometric action Role-Playing Game developed and published by Runic Games who's composed of developers from popular titles such as Fate and the Diablo (1 and 2). This game was designed to resurrect the old school dungeon crawler genre adding to it a fresh coat of paint and an attempt to quench the thirst for the classical isometric experience. True to the formula on what made the first Torchlight great, Torchlight 2 is one of the better Dungeon Crawler / Top-Down Action RPG available in the market.PLOT (No Spoilers):The game takes place several years after the first game. The Alchemist, one of the three original heroes, gets corrupted by the Heart of Odrak, the monster that was the source of evil that plagued the small town of Torchlight. The Alchemist, wearing new power armor and wielding the Heart of Odrak, destroys the town and sets out on a mysterious quest that would, if not stopped, eventually disrupt the flow of nature and interrupt the delicate balance of power in the world. PROS:+ Classic gameplay with nice little tweaks to fit the modern age of gaming+ Colorful Graphics+ Good level variation and environment design+ New classes and a much more varied choices for pets+ Much more complex skill tree: This is a good new addition from the first game. More complex and more specialized player builds are sure to come up.+ Good re-playability: Lots of characters, lots of builds and lots of loot.+ Multiplayer option that was absent in the first game+ Better end game content+ PC hardware friendly+ Steam Workshop Support+ Does not require 24 hour internet connection to play. CONS:- Inferior voice acting: -Unlike Diablo II who had very good dialogue and memorable quotes.- Inconsistent volume levels on dialogue: -background music can sometimes drown NPC voices.- Confusing Story: -The story isn't immersive enough to keep you interested. Story is also very difficult to comprehend without paying close attention and references.- Inconsistent Difficulty: -Normal is extremely easy that you will probably get bored the moment you get some of your more powerful skills/spells. Hard and Elite however are extremely difficult that it would make a frustrating experience to the casual gamer. I would recommend playing at Hard since I believe that getting a better challenge is much more acceptable than getting bored.- Connecting to multiplayer can sometimes be difficultCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME, GREAT BUY and comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.WORTH IT?:Whether this game is at full price or on a sale, this game is worth your money.FINAL NOTES:Torchlight 2 is a great spiritual successor to the classic Diablo games that provides a good alternative to the Always-Online Diablo 3 experience (specially if you're only looking for a Singleplayer or Local play.) WORTH IT?:This is a MUST BUY and MUST TRY title for both fans of the classic isometric RPG games and new players alike.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												I didn't buy this for a long time, despite wanting to try it, because in my opinion, once you'd played one Diablo clone, you'd played them all. And I still hold this opinion to be very true in a lot of ways - for example, Titan Quest, while initally intriguing, became a hellish repetitive single-player slog through to the end that, after 20-something hours of playtime, left me exhasted and scarred. Torchlight, however, surpised me. Perhaps it has something to do with the well-designed classes that aren't quite as derivative as many Diablo-clones, or the deep levelling system that allows so much variation within the same class, or the well-honed difficulty scaling that makes you feel like you're always growing, or perhaps it's all these features combined that make this game stand out. The controls are intuitive and the mechanics of the game are well-implimented. The enemies are numerous and varied, and there's always surprises to be found in every corner of the randomly-generated maps. The champions and bosses are similarly frequent in appearance, a factor which helps to eliminate that feeling that you're just grinding a way, wasting time until you fight a boss battle. In saying that, playing this game on single player, I did feel like I was taking part in the occasional grind through enemies and loot and levels, which bordered on tedious at time, but playing with a friend and sharing that burden eliminated that feeling entirely. On the topic of multiplayer, I felt that it could have been slightly better implimented, in that, for one, it took forever for my friend and I to find each other in the server screen, and there was a bug that occasionally stopped us from adding one another without a full game restart. Also, unlike the Borderlands games (the pinnacle of intuitive multiplayer connectivity in my opinion), you cannot see what missions your partner has to do, so you're contantly relying on them telling you what they're up to (via text chat, if you don't have steam chat), and if you're more advanced than your partner, then any enemies that you've killed won't reappear for your partner, regardless of who is hosting the server. Although I'm sure there's a reason for these issues, they seem like really bizarre features to omit from the game. I mean, sure, you may get a tad overpowered if you're allowed to kill creatures a second time round, but is that really worse than your partner being forced to wade through a sea of emptiness, constantly underpowered due to lack of combat? In any case, all I can recommend is that you start multiplayer games at exactly the same time.Torchlight 2 is a well-made, deep and enjoyable experience, especially with friends, that separates itself enough from other Diablo clones to really stand at the top of the pile.

												Let's be completely honest, Torchlight was a Diablo clone. Nothing odd about that either, seeing as both Max Schaefer and Erich Schaefer worked on the game - both once members of Blizzard North, the team behind Diablo and Diablo 2. So, basically, Runic Games returned to the same formula, polished it up a bit, incorporated a few cool features and voila - a new RPG was born. As Torchlight 2 boldly steps onto the contemporary gaming scene, ready to tackle heavy competition (well, mostly Diablo 3) we are immediately drawn into its simple and yet incredibly compelling gameplay mechanics.Torchlight 2 commences several years after the conclusion of the original game. The Ember Blight has corrupted the Alchemist. The Ember Blight originates from an ancient evil entity known as the Heart of Ordrak, which is the very source corruption beneath the small town of Torchlight. Your task is to put a stop to this evil, which threatens to disrupt the balance between the six elements of the world.Simplicity is the key, as you'd imagine. Torchlight 2 takes a similar approach to storytelling as Diablo 3. There isn't much of a plot or any exceptionally interesting characters to draw you away from the gameplay. To be honest though, Diablo 3 does have a better story than Torchlight 2, but I guess that's beside the point. Slashing your way through countless foes is the main drive here, so essentially, you'll be on familiar ground if you've been playing Diablo 3 in recent months. There's nothing wrong with borrowing Diablo's mechanics, particularly in T2's case, because Runic has really polished this one to perfection. Everything works smoothly. There are no hiccups during combat or exploration that would warrant any major concern.There are four character classes to choose from. The Engineer (Railman in Torchlight), who represents a heavy fighter suitable for melee combat, the Outlander who employs magic and ranged weapons, The Berserker who's quick and agile and often uses animal-based powers and, last but not least, the Embermage, who mainly resorts to powerful spells. The combat differs according to the class you choose. For the single-player playthrough, I selected the Engineer and it was fun all the way. The fact that this is a character focused on close combat doesn't mean that you can't make use of certain magical abilities and scrolls that can be picked up along the way. This goes for other classes too. So, apart from your default class-based skills, you also get a chance to use a range of useful spells that can help you heal or improve your character's abilities like movement, marksmanship etc. Players have one basic attack, a secondary attack and an additional powerful attack that deals extra damage - providing the charge meter is filled up. The more it fills up, the more damage you can cause with this attack. Usually, the best way to handle groups of enemies is striking when the charge meter is maxed out, giving you the edge in combat (even when you're massively outnumbered).The game is likely to hook players straight away, largely thanks to its appealing loot system. There's an impressive variety of items on display and ready for players to make use of. Exploring as much of the map as possible is the key to this game. Locating hidden areas and defeating stronger enemies is often enormously rewarding. Taking your time to sort your gear to suit your play style is what the whole thing is about. For instance, items like swords, axes and staffs may come in socketed variants, so you have to decide which chips, shards and gems to attach (depending on which enemies you're facing). In addition, the same item can then be enhanced by visiting the Enchanter in the local town. Certain armor and weaponry may hold class-specific traits, so you need to keep your eyes peeled for those.The game is enjoyable both in solo and multiplayer modes. There's nothing more satisfying than taking on hordes of baddies with friends and things can really heat up in Torchlight 2. Several cool boss encounters await players and the really cool bit ensues when friends join together, mixing different abilities to take these large opponents down. There are certain impracticalities in multiplayer such as having difficulties finding sessions created by friends. This may prove annoying if you want to jump smoothly and quickly into a co-op game. However, as soon as things kick off, Torchlight 2 becomes a barrel of fun in multiplayer.The graphics have been significantly improved since the release of the original. The cartoonish-style art looks great, while every area in the game was meticulously designed and, of course, enriched with Matt Uelmen's eerie Diablo-inspired tracks. Matt is the renowned video game composer, best known for his brilliant darkish Diablo and Diablo 2 melodies. Subtle touches, like beautifully animated background details, create an eye-catching atmosphere. Also, we salute the animation team that brought all those cute little monsters to life and were responsible for a variety of cool-looking spells to boot.Torchlight 2 is an experience you can't easily walk away from. The combat is the beating heart of the game. It's simple and incredibly fun. Commendably, Runic improved everything they possibly could in this one. As I've already said, I witnessed sharper and more colorful visuals, in addition to a delicious multiplayer mode that allows up to six players (a highly compelling feature not present in the first title). This is quite simply an action RPG that has everything for both fans and newcomers to the genre. Don't miss out on it.			"

												After 250+ hours i can say this game is a great sequel to Torchlight, and i'm not going to stop playing it. TII has improved almost every aspect of the original game. It basically is a greatly expanded version of Torchlight, with wider maps, more items, more enemies and more classes to choose from. Everything seems smooth and well placed. It is a pleasure to keep trying new classes and, most importantly, new builds and skill paths. In conclusion: Torchlight II is a great hack 'n' slash every fan of this type of games should own. It will entertain you for hours and hours and you will hardly repeat boring actions like farming and grinding. A must have, for such a low price.			"

												Torchlight 2 is the successor of Torchlight, having you pick up right where the action ends in the first game, in a scenario where you must again save the world.Unfortunately, I did not play the original Torchlight, but that might intrigue others who are coming into Torchlight 2 as their first game of the series.Torchlight 2 came out around the same time as Diablo 3 and was arguably better at that time, the controls feel very tight and responsive and the combat enjoyable and satisfying. Diablo 3 has improved, however, and so has Torchlight 2! The huge modding community has added such a dearth of content to the game it's almost added an entire gamesworth of content to it!For myself, I completed the game on Veteran mode within 22 hours and enjoyed it all. It got a little tedious towards the end as I just wanted to complete it, but that's just me being impatient and not being too au fait with these types of games (D2/D3/PoE etc). But yeah! A great game overflowing with charm and depth! Check it out!Nilesy			"

												I didn't even realize I had over 300 hours in this game until I decided to write this review. That's how fast time flies with it.It has depth; it has fun; it has character. And most of all — a feature that separates it from most ARPGs out there — it's rewarding. You can reach level 100 with a character without hundreds of hours of mindless grinding. You can get rewarded for intentiveness with builds. You can play however you like.It does lack in a few departments, namely, some of the lore and bosses are shoddy. However, the sheer number of brilliant design decisions in this game in terms of character progression, gear management and peripheral activities greatly ouweighs its shortcomings. Give it an honest try, and you won't regret it.			"

												It is a very fun game.Many call this the worthy successor of Diablo 2.The combat is extremely rewarding and smooth.Unlike many RPGs,you actually want to go and grind because it feels so good to kill stuff and the graphics are extremely appealing.The storyline is pretty boring to be honest,it didn't even try to make it interesting.I was more concentrated on the loot and the killing even though the game really tried to be a bit storyline oriented.This I believe is a weak point,some people may enjoy a good story but TL2 doesn't have one.A strong point of the game is the replay ability of it.After finishing the story you can choose to continue the game in 2 modes,either do random dungeons or restart the campaign with the same character but face equally strong monsters.Another thing that makes this game replayable is the sheer number of mods that you can find for it.The skill tree/abilities and characters are pretty basic,I would say user-friendly because you quickly learn the game.It could have been better polished with more options and more paths but it's decent,this might upset the ''hardcore'' players of the genre.One of the best RPGs around and it is incredibly cheap for the amount of content it has to offer.

												Runic Games, creator of the award-winning Top-Down, Action-RPG Torchlight, further the Torchlight franchise with the second rendition in the saga, Torchlight II.Torchlight II commences with you, the protagonist, in hot pursuit of the Dark Alchemist, the inevitable villain. The Heart of Ordrak, which he has taken, has imbued him with inconceivable powers & a clear purpose. Will you be able to stop him before his mental blight sets Vilderan aflame?The game takes place in Vilderan, a vast continent, sub-divided further into different areas. Vilderan’s areas are diverse & unique to each Act, from lonesome deserts to dense marshes. It invariably exudes an open-world adventure unlike its predecessor.There are four distinct classes – Engineer, Outlander, Embermage & Berserker. Each class has three different skill trees, which enable mixing & matching different skills to maximize efficiency and/or enjoyment. All weapon types can be used by any class, further adding to the sheer variability of play styles. The character creation screen has a small selection of different aesthetic options. The option to choose between genders is also present. There is a wide variety of pet companions to choose from. There are four distinct difficulties – Casual, Normal, Veteran & Elite. They pleasantly suit a wide array of gamers & scale in difficulty at a fairly even pace. Hardcore mode – a defining proponent of the genre – is also present & available at any difficulty. Enable at your own risk, of course. The co-op in Torchlight II boasts of a user-friendly system that enables up to six players to play together. Either join a band of adventurers or start your own adventure & wait for others to join in on the fun. From showing your friends your lackluster DPS while a werewolf teaches you a lesson in face-to-paw combat to trading your wares to better your gear, the co-op experience is not to be glossed over.Did anyone mention modifications? Steam Workshop enables the use of a sheer endless amount of mods to suit almost every whim. Mods may also be used during co-op sessions if users have the same mod(s) installed.The graphics and universal interface in Torchlight II are reminiscent of its predecessor but overall feel refined & improved upon. The graphics while marginally cartoony bring the world to life & does the game its due diligence. The musical notes are fairly bland & unmemorable; they don’t go beyond fulfilling their base purpose. Apart from the musical notes, the animation sounds are crisp & noteworthy, bringing Vilderan to life.In conclusion, Runic Games’ Torchlight II is the quintessential culmination of the defining proponents of the Action-RPG genre & an improved iteration in the Torchlight saga. Truly, a must-have masterpiece in the collection of any Action-RPG fanatic.9.5/10			"

-Quick Review-Torchlight II is a dungeon crawler game that lets you chose to play as a few different classes. The basic concept is the same as nearly all dungeon crawlers:  Explore, level up, find gear, beat the boss, rinse and repeat. -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Oh no! the alchemist is going to bring about the end of the world! You there, unnamed random hero, it's your job to warn everyone, and be just a few steps behind the alchemists defiling touch.As I implied, you're obviously the hero, the villain you will be trying to catch is known as ""the alchemist"", whom has been corrupted and destroys all that is in his way.Game Play: I sense that most dungeon crawlers are time consuming on purpose, I spent a good 30-40 hours before I beat the game, then I kept playing for another 30 hours to get to max level, and at that point I stopped playing.The whole dungeon crawler genre is criticized for giving us ""carpool tunnel"", you click, a lot. you do use keys to cast different spells, attacks, and abilities. So for fair warning, you will spend a lot of time in this game clicking.There is a feature in the game that lets you load up your pet with tons of gear, and send 'em back to town to sell them for you, or buy health potions, basically you never need to go to town to sell gear or buy potions, you're servant pet will do it for you. What does this mean for you, brave adventurer? More dungeon crawling, less vendering trash items! Yay!  (Hopefully!) Achievements: So I hit 76% completion on this game, I've given up trying to actively get 100% completed for achievements, mostly because RNG (Random Number Generator) hates me. I decided getting above 75% was pretty good for a game with 123 achievements, many requiring grinding.Achievement categories: Beat the game/boss, try doing this, kill this many enemies, open this many of these, do this ____ amount of times, get lucky, play long enough to do this 100,000,000 times. Again, basically I assume that I'll eventually make more progress on this game as I find people who are like ""hey, play this with me!"" and I'm like ""okay, I only need to 3,000 more potions! let's do it!""Half of these achievements are from just playing the game, so you can enjoy that, but getting 100% will require a lot of play time. Just a warning :)Price: Torchlight II costs $19.99, I've spent 70 hours playing it. That's definitely worth it. Most people will at least get over 20 hours in the game, even if they're not trying to beat it.As always, I suggest getting the game on sale or in a humble bundle, but the stand alone price is very much worth it, based on the amount of game time I squeezed out of it. Conclusion: Story: interesting the first time through, it was very dragged out (not in a bad way, really),  Game play: click x1,000,000 (over 9,000 clicks used in the making of this review), Achievements: nothing to write home about, Price: very good price based on the amount of time required to play through the whole game.This type of game is best suited for people who already know they like dungeon crawlers, I've played several, if you're new to the series this is a great game to start trying it out with! Just be warned there is a lot of clicking involved. Again, this game becomes a 100 times more fun with a friend or two. But, I did play through the whole game solo my first time.			"

Torchlight 2 takes everything that has come to define the action-RPG genre and delivers it all in an incredibly well polished package. From fast paced brutal hack n’ slash combat to immersive diverse level design to an abundance of loot, Torchlight 2 has it all. Developed by Runic Games; a small Dev team of around 30 members in Seattle WA, they prove that they have what it takes to create a quality product that can compete and even outshine the likes of juggernaut developer Blizzard and their own ARPG Diablo III.The game starts the way you would expect an Action-RPG to start, by choosing your characters class. The game offers four different classes to choose from; Outlander: the gun wielding bad ♥♥♥ class, Engineer: the steampunk style, tinkering, gadget using class, Embermage: the typical wizardry spell casting class, and the Berzerker: the warrior heavy hitting class.  Each class feels different enough from one another where your play throughs still feel fresh and entertaining if you decide to give the game another play through as a different character. The combat is fast paced and hectic, the best way to describe the way it feels would be to call it a “controlled chaos”, meaning that while at times things do get crazy as you’re being ambushed by a massive horde of enemies, but you never resort to just spamming mouse clicks to succeed, you have to understand how your characters class works and use that knowledge to stay alive. For example; if you are an Embermage, you aren’t going to be able to rush head on into hordes of enemies and make it out alive like you would as a bulkier Berzerker.Next to the combat, the games second greatest strength is the level design, with each map being randomly generated you will never experience the same thing twice. This allows the game to continue to feel fresh if you decide to do multiple play throughs. While randomly generated maps aren’t anything new to games, Torchlight 2’s random generation feels like they are gorgeously hand crafted levels, if you weren’t already aware of the R&G then you wouldn’t ever be able to tell by the games gorgeously laid out levels and dungeons.The developers also paid a strong attention to detail in the weapons, armor, and items in the game. With such a large diverse number of weapons and various armors to equip you won’t become bored from having to use any one weapon or set of armor for any long period of time as there are loot drops and chests galore located all throughout the expansive dungeons you’ll be crawling your way through. But what good would such a large trove of weapons and armor be without an expansive onslaught of enemies to vanquish? Have no worries, the game has a large array of varying enemies to slaughter, from hulking snow beasts to dark lord necromancers the game does not burn you out on any one style of enemy.Torchlight 2 is best played with friends, but even if you don’t have anyone to play with Torchlight 2 provides you with a trusty animal companion who will fight alongside you. Not only does your pet companion work like a beefy tank to distract enemies when you have to run off and heal, but they are also your errand running slave, they double as a 2nd backpack that can be packed full of all the valuable loot that you’ve managed to acquire. You can then send your pet off to the market with a shopping list of various health and mana potions and he will sell your loot and return with the potions, this eliminates the need to travel all the way back to town yourself and interrupt your questing. Not necessarily a revolutionary gameplay mechanic but it is incredibly convenient and keeps the game pace going full speed ahead. Torchlight 2 doesn’t do anything that hasn’t really been done before, it’s not new or innovative, but it does take everything good that has been done before and bundles them all together and manages to deliver them all perfectly. The combat is seamless and the expansive diverse levels and dungeons leave much to explore. The game has so much to offer and I would highly recommend Torchlight 2 to anyone looking for a fun fast paced gameplay experience. "

												Amazing. Torchlight II is all about skill trees, equipment, looting, equipment, defeating hordes of monsters, making your name known to the world, and equipment. Did I mention equipment? Because you'll be finding tons of that. I love that changing equipment actually changes the appearance of your character (I wish there were vanity items because sometimes I went with the prettiest gear, not the ones with the best stats). Playing with a friend is, naturally, a lot more fun than on your own though, to be honest, all you need is the pet you choose at the very beginning because SPOILER: it will never die. There are a handful of such pets to choose from and the pet system is one of my favourites out of any I've experienced because, not only do they act as a completely necessary additional inventory (did I mention you'd find a lot of equipment?) but because you can send them off to sell the goodies you no longer need. Mind blown. If you're getting this game, that should be reason enough.There are also classes with their own customizable skill trees--both of which keep growing in diversity due to mods from other players. There's something for everyone: if you're into blasting everything to pieces with a cannon, do that. Fan of fire? There's a class for you, too. The world is constantly growing for new and old players alike.Torchlight II is a hack and slash adventure that will have you traipsing through zombie infested bogs, crossing the desert and going to the underworld itself in order to save your world from the evil Alchemist. I invested a solid 20 hours during my first playthrough and I'm ready for a second round with a whole new class.Buy it.			"

												Finally I found an action hack and slash game bringing me back in time to the edge of millennium. Running around searching every corner of the map and furiously clicking on everything that moves, that's what you want and what you get. Wide scale of equipment (inc. enchantments; gems) and talents gives you many oportunities and playstyles and that's what every player appreciates. Torchlight 2 has much to offer, just grab it and play! I recommend Synergy mod, it significantly increased my personal rating. In basic game there are only 4 classes with 3 talent branches, synergy widen this to 8 and that gives this game a new dimension, but it is only one feature, there is more torchlight players shouldn't miss this. 8.5 /10			"

												If your a fan of the diablo 1 & 2 and your looking for an alternative to diablo 3.Then look no further torchlight 2 will be a game you will want to play.Sadly there are few things which prevent it's from achieving a masterful status. The lore of torchlight 2 is not that interesting and cutscene are reminess of bad cartoon network show.The voice over is not that great and the story it self is something we have seen a 1000 time.However the pet system, looting gear and the Master Full soundtrack will keep you entertain till the end 7.9/10 Verdict: Torchlight 2 should satified your looting needs just dont expect the quality of a Blizzard Game.

Torchlight 2 ReviewOne only has to look at the numbers to see that Runic Games really struck gold when they released the hit sequel Torchlight 2 as a follow-up to their original action RPG game, Torchlight. While it may not give anything new to the genre and it didn't win a bunch of awards like its predecessor, it still sold over 2 million copies in less than a year of its full release date. Impressive. The reason is quite simple: everything Torchlight 2 does, it does well.All of our favorite features from Torchlight return and have been improved, such as pets and fishing, in addition to some new features being added. Some of the changes you can expect to see include: an expanded crafting system, a longer campaign that spans across various maps, the user interface has been improved and made simpler, mods are openly welcomed, a Multiplayer co-op mode has been added, and now players have two choices to continue gameplay even after finishing the campaign with New Game Plus and Mapworks. The graphics and sound are really nice and the special effects are superb. With Torchlight 2's random map generator for dungeons, replay value is even greater. Loaded with action and filled with loot, this game is sure to entertain.Probably the best thing about Torchlight 2 is the seemingly endless customization possibilities. Players can choose their character from four different classes, each with their own unique abilities and specialized equipment. There are countless armor and weapon variations throughout the game, most of which add additional bonuses or power-ups to your character. Then of course, sockets can be added to the equipment which will allow you to insert gems into them, giving even more bonuses and special abilities. And don't forget that while journeying through the expansive dungeons scattered across the maps, players will come across furry little critters that offer an assortment of enchantments that can be added to each item for a fee. With the right combinations you can turn your character into a demigod and that's before you ever begin experimenting with the almost limitless crafting system where players can create stronger potions, better gems, more unique items and armor, etc.Of course, no game is perfect and players have their own tastes and preferences. So while the game is a lot of fun and highly recommended, there are a few things players should know when deciding on whether to buy this game or not. There is no controller support included with Torchlight 2. Players who prefer controllers over mouse will need to add in their own mapping or download one. The good news is there are several already out there and can easily be added, so its not a really big hassle. Don't expect a deep storyline in this game. While there is a story that plays out across the campaign trail, its not fleshed out very well and is less than enthralling. While it is lacking, this shouldn't be an issue for the most part because the game keeps the action moving at a steady pace so most players probably won't even give it a second thought anyways. Also, expect a few random bugs. Fortunately none of them are game-breaking and not of big consequence but they do exist. From fishing holes not being accessible to loot being hurled out of the player's reach or even characters occasionally being pushed onto a ledge by a charging mob with no way to escape (other than using a port scroll), know that on occasion something like this may happen. Players aren't really going to miss much of anything as a result and aside from these minor nuissances the game runs very smooth and never crashes.The Good:=======+  Good graphics with top-notch special effects+  Solid sound effects and above average voiceovers+  Full-length story campaign+  Limitless character & item customization options+  Variety of special abilities+  Well-developed crafting system+  Simple controls+  UI is comfortable and easy to use+  Multiplayer co-op+  Mod-friendly game environment+  Low resource requirements allow gameplay on most machines+  Steam Achievements & Trading Cards+  High replay value+  Price (similar games often cost twice as much)+  A ton of loot and treasureThe Bad:======-  No controller support included-  Random bugs (not game-breaking)-  No auto-collect for treasure after battle-  Story is not very intriguing-  A ton of loot and treasureFinal Thoughts:===========While Torchlight 2 isn't ground-breaking and its not going to blow your socks off, the game is still very entertaining and offers numerous hours of gameplay. There's a reason why its one of the most popular and liked games on Steam and can be found in most game libraries. This game has a lot of features included and all of them are packaged extremely well. If you don't already own it, I definitely recommend picking up a copy.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

-----------------------Introduction---------------------One of the major fantasies I've had since childhood, is that of being a strong warrior. The concept of destroying hundreds of enemies with ease, facing legendary monsters, and having reality-breaking abilities, have been inspired through countless forms of media. Whether you're a superhero fanboy, or you're grounded in reality, the hero concept is always fascinating to explore. Torchlight 2 takes the simple hero concept, gives you a story, and some excellent gameplay to boot. With an overall rating of Overwhelmingly Positive, is it really worth the acclaim? In this review, we'll find out.------------------------Gameplay-----------------------Torchlight 2 at its core is an action RPG, in which you slay monsters, collect piles of loot, and clear countless dungeons. Taking inspiration from games such as Diablo, Mythos, Fate, and of course its very own predecessor Torchlight, this game expands upon a fairly well known formula, and creates something rather unique. You see, this game has the makings of an online MMORPG, but can be played completely offline. The loot-focused, grind-oriented nature of the game is something that is frequently delivered in a variety of games, but is not often done well. To my relief, this particular game really shines in this aspect.You generally take quests from NPCs, which you will find primarily in the base camps. There are many other quests to be found in the world as you explore, so there's never a moment where you should be lacking in direction. I particularly liked the feeling of having so many quests to complete as I journeyed. It reminded me of some of my favourite MMORPGs, and I finally realized what it was that I liked about them; direction. Don't worry about being overburdened, Torchlight 2 strikes a very fair balance between quantity, and quality. To my recollection, I never had more than about 3 active quests at a time.StoryTorchlight 2 is a story-driven game. It's about as predictable as one could expect, though this does not make it a bad story by any shot. A good story gives the player a real motivation; a reason to exist. No longer was I just your everyday hero. Instead, I was a pivotal character in this world. I was important, and I felt a sense of purpose as I cleared hallways and caverns of monsters, getting closer and closer to my end-goal.The story is divided into 3 major sections, exposing you to different environments with each, and bringing you closer to the final showdown. Playable CharactersYou start out by choosing between four distinct classes: Engineer, Berserker, Outlander & Embermage. Each one specializes in the use of unique weapons and armor, and each one can have a widely flexible play-style. To allow this, each class has 3 skill trees that they can allocate points to. Depending on your preferred gameplay style, you can take a melee or ranged approach. From bows, to dual swords, to staves, and even cannons, you'll find a rather large arsenal available to you, depending on your class. The number of potential builds are quite limitless, so it really inspires creativity and flexibility.In addition, you are given a permanent companion; a pet. This pet will usually serve as secondary storage, as well as additional damage if you so desire. I really love the pet selections, the ability to change its nature, and the ability to send it to do my shopping whilst deep inside a dungeon.CombatThe combat in this game is one of its greatest strengths. Each character has a wide selection of abilities. You can assign each one to a numbered hotkey, as well as your Mouse 2 button for easy casting. You can also have two separate weapon loadouts! This allows you to swap between two different weapons in the middle of combat, to further suit your play-style.During large battles, you'll find yourself running around trying to avoid dangerous monster abilities, while dealing damage at the right time. This is even more crucial for boss fights, as they often have unique mechanics which you need to play around with. There are a wide variety of monster abilities and strategies to be used, so you'll have a bit to learn.Game ModesWhile being primarily story-driven, Torchlight 2 extends the re-playability with New Game Plus, Mapworks (special dungeons for your grinding needs), and LAN or Online Co-Op. It's an absolute pleasure to have a game that caters to multiple gaming needs in this way. Whether you're home alone, or you want a great LAN party game, Torchlight 2 has you covered. You may be able to finish the story at level 50, but chances are, you'll probably not stop until you reach closer to level 100 thanks to the addictive nature of the game.In addition, Torchlight 2 supports MODS! Hell yeah! Thanks to the ease of modding, and the large community behind the game, there is an absolute ton of mods you can use to enhance your gameplay experience, and change almost everything about the game. If something about vanilla didn't appeal to you, chances are, there's a mod for that.-------------------------Visuals-------------------------While being slightly dated as of 2017, the graphics aren't the worst I've seen. In fact, they hold up quite well. While not being the primary area of concern, Torchlight 2 delivers a pleasant visual experience, filled with colours, particles and effects galore. Prefer something less fancy? Turning the settings all the way down is perfectly fine, and can help framerates on weaker PCs. Overall, while not being the primary focus of the game, I never found the graphics distracting or hideous to complain about. Many of the effects were quite beautiful, and perfectly suited their environments.Map DesignFrom wide platforms, to tight corridors, the world of Torchlight really felt immersive and really gave me a desire to explore every inch of it. To my knowledge, many (not all) of the maps are procedurally generated, which added to the unique feel of each new environment.----------------------Sound Design---------------------From the soundtrack of the game, to the varied sounds and effects of combat, I had a great experience with this game's sound design. Each shot from my Engineer's cannon felt powerful. You could really hear the kick of the blast, followed quickly by the sound of monsters dying and loot being dropped.There was a substantial amount of narration, mainly for the story, but it was well done. I had initially been uninterested in the story, but listening to it being read really gave it life and energy.-----------------Summary & Conclusion----------------Torchlight 2 is possibly one of the best games to play if you're interested in great combat, unique classes, and abundant mods. It's one of those old but gold types of games that you really shouldn't be skipping unless this type of game doesn't appeal to you in the slightest.At $20 you could easily spend hundreds of hours playing this game and it would be worth it. However, this game frequently goes on sale for a quarter of that price or less, so you really have no excuse not to get it.I rarely ever replay games, but I found myself coming back to this one, again and again.For excellence in the action RPG genre, I give Torchlight 2 a:10/10 - Addicting gameplay, Wide appeal, High re-playability & great fun!======================================This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union,providing better standards for reviews and reviewers.====================================== "

												Runic Games, w/ some former members of Blizzard and Travis Baldress of Fate, have once returned with Torchlight II. If Torchlight 1 felt a lot like Diablo 1 to you (in its ARPG gameplay department + with the constant direction of going further down the dungeons w/ each level), then Torchlight II should then feel like Diablo II. Torchlight II improves so much over the original TL, I don't even know where to begin - just like how Diablo II improved immensely over the original Diablo. Granted, TL2 has its own spin on the ARPG genre, in some ways: you have a pet by your side (who you can send back to town to sell items; who can help you in battle; etc); the graphics are much brighter + more colorful than Diablo series; and it has a steampunk-inspired setting. No longer are you confined to go down, down, and down the dungeons some more like Diablo. The game is now a bit more open and epic than that. TL2 sports multiple towns - just like Diablo II. Also, the side-quests here - they also can be found when you're out an about in the game-world, which likely will have their own areas and dungeons for you to crawl through. Combat is as awesome and as action-packed as ever, with the game constantly chucking out tons of new and unique loot to the player to modify and upgrade; and there's tons of skills to learn. Leveling-up allows the player to sink points into the player's base-stats for numbers how they see fit, unlike some other major ARPG (Diablo III) - allowing the player's builds even within the same class to possibly be different from another player's build. While the story + characters are nothing truly special here - like in many of these ARPG's - it's still certainly better than the previous game. The graphics are nothing truly remarkable in terms of technical quality, but the art direction is fantastic, quirky, and colorful. TL2 sports SIngle Player support (for online play or offline play); Online support for Co-Op via Runic's servers; and also LAN support - unlike another ARPG that has currently forced ""online always"" gameplay (Diablo III). If a gamer is looking for numerous different ways to play this game - it's certainly here. Once finished with the Campaign, fans can come back and explore some other Randomized Dungeons and even enter New Game Plus Mode. Given that, and that this game offers a lot of value for those not just who do one playthrough (took me around 27 hours, all by myself - SIngle Player style) - but also to those who want to replay the game. When it debuted at its budget-price ($20), it offers plenty of value and ""bang for the buck"" when compared to its competitors that were charging $50-60. Even now, when it's on sale dirt-cheap - it's pretty much a steal. And this all, this isn't even counting that the game also does have Mods out there, which further can extend the life of the game - since this game comes with The Game's Editor (GUTS) and also supports The Steam Workshop.If you love ARPG's, this one's pretty much a no-brainer: Torchlight II is an excellent ARPG that just cannot be recommended enough. Simply put: it's one of the best of these loot-crazy, action-packed ARPG's around.Final Grade = A.			"

												After 2-3 years of not actively playing it, I gave this game another try for nostalgic purposes. These are my thoughts.A great game for its time, but destroyed by nearly every other ARPG to follow after it. Most of my hours on this game were put before Diablo 3, Marvel Heroes, and Path of Exile made substantial improvements to their games. First couple years this was out, game was bliss. Only other viable options were Titan Quest, Diablo 2, and Torchlight 1. The game was designed to be played in Multiplayer, apparently, but I spent most of my time solo. The multiplayer is actually very bad and scales terribly with the more players you have. Monster damage and health isn't properly tuned and everything ends up doing too much damage and being sponges, especially the bosses. It also forces you to sign up for a Runic account because apparently this is a good idea for some reason. The network code happens to be abysmal as well, and handles lag in the weirdest way I've seen in a game. For the person lagging, the game creates a seperate instance, until the lag stops. Causing confusion for everyone involved (wait you already killed those monsters?).You can manually allocate stats, but this doesn't actually matter. The most important stat will always be strength, unless you're using a shield, then you pump vitality in until you reach a high enough block chance, then back to strength. Enemies crit in this game, which is a stupid mechanic when there's no way to properly mitigate this, so you'll die to random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, making this game a poor choice to tick the ""hardcore"" option on.The protection and armor systems are probably the worst I've seen in this genre. There are no percentage reductions, only ""armor"" for each damage type. Which is literally a flat value. So if you've got 20 physical armor, you take 20 less physical damage. 60 poison armor, 60 less poison damage. There comes up a point pretty quickly in the game where the armor stats don't mean much at all, and it's more about dodge chance, stacking self heals, getting health boosts via gear, and popping potions constantly.In addition, no matter what mods you try, the game is inherently designed around doing what I described above, as well as using only one active skill (many of the skills for classes are worthless) and spamming it constantly. The rest of your skill points go into the overpowered passives. In addition, there are many skills in the game which scale terribly, and it's actually discouraged to improve upon them further, because it substantially increases mana costs which low level characters can't keep up with. Alternatively, some classes such as the Vanquisher (ranged gun user) can make builds around using the normal attack. But either way, the game is designed aroun you holding down and clicking on one button and mulching everything.Modding tools came out far too late after the game was out, and the community didn't end up doing much, and the tools are limited to begin with. So the modding scene has been dead shortly after the tools came out, outside of the most popular mod, Synergies. Which seems to be dead, when it hasn't had an update in over a year. The engine itself is quite bad, and lags horribly when too many monsters are on screen at once. It also has atrocious loading times, which are worse depending on how large of an area you're loading. For a game which has such poor graphics and didn't even look good for its time, this has always been very annoying. Titan Quest came out many years earlier and looks far better and suffers from none of this. In addition, there's almost zero benefit for using a solid state, so load times are perpetually slow!The good thing about this game, is this was THE game to play when there were hardly any competing ARPGs on the market. Years later, this game has proven to be an outdated relic. Which in many respects, Titan Quest, which came out years before it, is still a better game.It's totally worth buying on a sale, but not at full price. You'll possibly get one playthrough out of it. The campaign for TL2 is actually very well designed fun, but drags on at points, particularly in act 3. It offers a decent endgame and mods expand more on it somewhat. If you've been playing other ARPGs recently, such as Grim Dawn, Diablo 3, Marvel Heroes, and Path of Exile, you'll find yourself frustrated with this game pretty quickly, as it has no depth and customization worth a damn.

												This one was hard for me to decide on.  Diablo II was one of my all-time favorite and most played games.  Torchlight was good, scratched the itch, but didn't really 'hold' me.  I had a lot of hope for Torchlight II, but like TL1, it just sort of felt.. empty.What works: The atmosphere is pretty good, I like how the monsters 'exist' before you wake them up in various sets of realistic repose.  Very nice touch.  The game is colorful and generally graphically engaging, although I don't really like any of the character designs.  It /is/ a Diablo clone, so it has that addictive loot-gathering gameplay, but I can't really evaluate it, because I didn't stick with it long enough for that to become relevant.What doesn't work:The skill trees feel bland, with a limited number of 'correct' choices.  The class-specific charge bars are terrible - either really boring (wizard and archer) or uninteractively 'see-sawing' power spikes (berserker).  The engineer is the only one that feels like it 'works'.Melee still feels kind of like a bad choice, with the amount of damage enemies deal at closer range.  As a ranged fighter, much of the combat takes place off-screen, which is terrible game design (albeit, extremely common in the genre).Having some skills be dropped or bought (for example, most of the summon spells) makes building characters even /more/ dependent on drop luck than is the norm.  It also breaks down some class variety.Most significantly, the game just felt off, for reasons I struggle to describe.  I never felt fully engaged.  I put a fair amount of effort in, pushing multiple characters through act 1, but every time, I found myself fighting boredom by the halfway point, and had totally lost interest by the time I stumbled blearily into the desert.  (Act II is a desert?  How novel!)I kind of regret voting 'no' on this one, because it's plainly a labor of love, because I had high hopes for it, and because I still desperately want to like it, but it is what it is.  Not recommended.			"

												Current NG+13 Elite Lvl.500 Berserker's save file has been corrupted. Over 600 hours played with the class over the span of 2 years.(NOTE: I have played 550hrs up to this point with my one and only berserker, NG+8 Elite w/ SynergiesMOD, maxed to lvl.500, all skills unlocked, fully socketted legendary weapons and armor (cast swords) <- The fact that I've spent all of my time with one character 1 class out of 70-80 I have from mods is telling. This should also emphasize how much I've played this game and my experience playing it.)(This is my first actual review, I thought I would give this masterpiece the honors.)Intro: To start I would like to say that I will have bias towards the game even if I try to be as objective as possible. Given my playtime and connection to this game, this should be a given. I found out about this game from a friend of mine who told me they loved the first game but never played the second, I found out about it and decided I would buy it on sale for I think around 10 dollars around the time (forgive me if this is wrong my memory may be wrong). My past arpg's had been only Diablo 1 & 3 and Sacred 2 at the time so I was excited to hop into another being a newfound fan of the genre. It all started when I clicked that ""New Game"" button. Clicked the berserker and typed ""Shaddah"".Now to the actual review!I'll make each of these sections quick for your reading pleasure.Gameplay: (Almost Perfect)Everything in this game plays extremely smoothy, response times are instant and combat is quick, flashy, and most importantly fluid.Except for the occasional bugs like when i try to shift-click or right-click an item to transfer or equip and the ocacsional hiccup everything else is like it says up there in the parenthesis, almost perfect.Randomization is extensive in this game, loot enemies, levels, basically almost everything in this game is randomly generated, except for things like your chosen character and pet.Recommened Mods for ridiculous amounts of content:Adventure Pack II (and levelscale:HIGHLY RECOMMENDED WITH LEVEL500 MOD)SynergiesMODHaknslash Essentialsclasspackand level500mod (KEEP IN MIND THIS WILL BREAK AND/OR RENDER SOME GAME MECHANICS USELESS Examples:Making Builds, Some Synergies Content)Graphics: (Perfect)They are cartoony, doesn't go for realism and fulfills it's purpose.Graphics mods I would recommendInk'd & Ink'd for SynergiesThe Half-Life 2 ENB Enchancer (ran through Torchlight II Directory)Sound: (Perfect, phenominal with mods)Music fits it's purpose with general orchestral pieces (my favorite being the menu theme) and nice songs that fit the mood, theme and atmosphere of every location.Phenominal music mods:Diablo II music modFinal Fantasy music mod (includes track from Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross)Overall: (Amazing game)Overall this game is a phenomincal package for it's extremely low price and even better it you happen to catch it on sale, the community is friendly and the modding scene from what I've seen, seems to be strong and thriving (mainly being represented with Synergies). The game is, in my opinion, the BEST arpg out there hands down and offers the MOST content out of any arpg I've seen here on steam or played in my entire history with the genre. Sadly there comes a time where I must mention the cons, because even with my deep love for this game I must point out the quirks and cons.Quirks and Cons: (ehh?)No OpenGL support? - whenever I've tried this by enabling it through .config the game crashes on start.Shift-tab and Right-click sometimes don't work.With a freely moving camera the detail on the levels is only viewable from the fixed and defualt isometric perspective.Some achievements require online play (just a really tiny quirk for me)Mapworks accesibility and variety is, at times lacking, I found it more worth my time to beat the game again, given the more intresting randomly generated enviroments.All in all the game is phenominal, the DEFINITIVE arpg, If you love arpgs or are intrested in the genre, or even just want a relaxing game to kill time in, this is a MUST BUY!To end this I would like to thank all the developers and modders that made my experience possible, Runic Games, Salan and all the other mod authors and players out there! Seeya and happy looting!Do I recommend this game, yes... hell yes!			"

												Everyone, hail the new Diablo 2!!Tochlight 2 is the sequel to (You guessed it), Torchlight. It takes everything the first game did wrong (Or not quite good), starting for the lack of Multiplayer, and fixes it, improves it, and makes it right. For torchlight 2 the developers did really listen to the communitty and did their homework: Gameplay, mechanics, upgrades... everything is fixed, polished and balanced. The multiplayer, although with some connection problems here and there, tends to work great and is really well implemented into the game (both loot wise, as each player gets its own loot so no more fighting over the coins and mod wise, as you can easily connect with other players who has the same mods) and, as expected, not only really fun to play, but the main reason to get the game.  But, this is it. It's a polished but already known formula. If you are a veteran in this kind of games, you will feel at home in the world of Torchlight 2, but maybe you will feel it is ""too home"": There's nothing you have already seen in other diablo like game, nothing original in its approach, even each of the acts style is similar to the Diablo 2 acts (desert-jungle-hell/volcano anyone?): It's a genuine jewel, but a jewel we all have seen in a lot of places before.A huge extra point is the communitty behind this game. Mods like synergies have added TONS of new places to kill monsters, TONS of new monsters to be killed, TONS of new weapons to kill with and TONS of armor to avoid getting killed. Although the vanilla game is short in its main campaing (remember: the fun is in the second time you finish the game), with the mod support the Torchlight world expands beyond any other Diablo like game.Torchlight 2 is a great game many of us have already played. If you are looking for the next step in the Diablo formula, you are not looking in the right place (maybe the workshop has some hints already), but if you are looking for a step in an already stablished place, a consistent, fun and balanced Diablo clone, Torchlight is the best option you have right now.

												Many people compare this game with Diablo III, but in my opinion, this game takes the cake.With an outstanding amount of loot you can find, numerous of Boss battles, hours of gameplay with your buddies, and what's best is YOU GET TO DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT.Not only the game is affordable, YOU DON'T NEED TO PAY FOR A SINGLE DAMN THING IN THE GAME. (Well, excluding the items you buy with gold. P/S: Stop it trolls.)Now it may seem farfetched, I would probably have more people telling me that ""DIABLO III IS BEST BLA BLA BLA"" than playing this game.Well, I can tell you for a fact that they're certainly wrong.

												Man I feel like such an idiot. When I first saw this game on steam a long time ago I said to myself. ""It seems to be a crappy eagle vision version of Dota 2"" No offense to any Dota 2 fans...   I ended ignoring Torchlight 2's existence for about a year.About a week ago I saw this game on sale and I bought it well because it was on sale xDMan, I feel so STUPID as to dislike this game on its appearance.Pros:- Amazing loot selection. Your not just selling every single item that doesn't appeal to you.- Freedom of weapon customizations. Maybe you want to have your Berserker use dual pistols or whatever you feel like using.- Interesting bosses. Your not just fighting a giant blob...- Most of the time, you use your mouse to move and attack so you rarely need to use your keyboard, which is great for those who want to multitask...no not in that way...-Beautiful settings. (Realistic forests, dungeons, etc). - The game runs very well with all settings turned the highest. Unless you have a windows 98 or something which can't run this game xD (OBVIOUSLY)- Max level is 100 so you can show off and get a bunch of characters to lv 100 if you wish.Cons:- Sometimes the quest marker really pisses me off. Sometimes the quest marker will direct me to a dungeon that I have already explored. I end up going inside, the quest marker tells me to go back out. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?!?!? Though this rarely happens, but when it does, it is on a side quest mission. This was for me though, I have no idea if the game will be like that for you guys.Overall I rate this game 9/10                                                             SUGOI!! "

												Deciding to re-review this game now that I'm abit older and the game's been out for quite awhile. Torchlight II is the definite successor to the original game which played a lot more like a hidden continuation of Fate in some sense. This game isn't very much different in terms of gameplay, so if you didn't quite like how the original played out...you might not enjoy this one to much. Thankfully however, this game now comes with its own Workshop which is still very active to this day. With the community coming up with more and more ways to expand and improve upon this already fairly massive game, there's nearly endless mounds of playtime. To prove this, I have nearly two hundred hours dumped into this game. I regret no wasted moment of my life, but on to the actual review. Gameplay - Like I said before, the gameplay isn't very new. It's a slightly improved version of the originals Diablo/Fate style of hack and slash where you click on opponents to engage in a fight with them while constantly spamming skills with the use of your hotkey bar above your exp gauge and clicking on the ground to move from space to space. You'll be finding tons of loot throughout each area as well as mounds upon mounds of monsters to fight depending on the difficulty. Occasionally you'll get a critical hit on an enemy and make chunks of his body explode over the ground in a bloody mess that's often just so satisfying to see. Then again, I'm just a sadistic ♥♥♥♥ with a bloodlust so don't listen to me. The pet system in this game is much the same as well. You have an interesting variety of choices at first that can expand massively with the use of mods from the workshop. Really, the thing is ♥♥♥♥ing glorious! Back to the topic however, your pets will aid you in battle. Rushing in and clawing, stomping, or ramming your enemies in your defense or sometimes just because they can depending on what you set them to, which brings me to the options below there health bar. You can set your little companions two one of three options. Defensive, Passive, Aggressive. This is useful for coordinating different plans for various areas especially if you carry around a decent amount of a transformation fish you may find yourself stocking up on by grinding in the multiple fishing holes you'll find throughout the game. I don't know how many times I entered a dungeon and found maybe just five to many enemies for my little self to handle around a corner, so I fed a fish to my dog and made him grow into a snarling, badass dragon before setting him to aggressive and watching as he bathed in the organs of the undead!Sound: I'm not sure where to begin with this game as far as the audio goes. Sometimes the constant noises along with the animations of each attack can get repetitive to listen to and look at for so long. Despite this however, the game has an amazing and beautiful atmospheric soundtrack that blends in perfectly with the scenery and graphics. Enemies sound like there own, and never once did I get annoyed with anything other then the attacks I stated earlier. Graphics: I'm honestly not sure how to describe these. It's like Dota meets Wakfu. The art looks wonderful and detailed, the animations polished and smooth. The weapons can sometimes lose there charm in appearance due from more then a few looking the exact same, but there's always enchantments for that and its hardly an issue when considering everything else around you. Enemies have there own personalities and feel to them as well as movements occasionally. Aside from a few flaws, the graphics are perfect!Overall: Torchlight II is a very fun ever-changing experience that fans of Diablo, Fate, or even Van Hellsing should be able to get into rather easily. With the shear amount of loot, action, management, and planning you'll be doing; its impossible not to sink more then ten or multitudes of more hours into this title before putting it down and eventually starting it up right back again. It's timeless, get while you can. 9/10  "

In total 4 classes that are pretty good balanced. Awsome new graphic (since Diablo 2). Perfect just to sit down, connect to a friends server and click till your fingers will burn.Starting at the moment my third character (engi, bersi done) and I still don't get the point what happens in the story, but I seriously don't care.

												I love Torchlight and Torchlight II. Having said that I have to admit I loved Diablo III as well. The mobs are easier in Torchlight. The characters and classes including the add on ones make for a great game. I am hopeful they bring out a Torchlght III that improves on the gameplay further, not that there is much for which to ask. I kept going back to Torchlight until I got Torchlight II and now, despite over a hundred games, Torchlight II pulls me back in. It plays like a dream on my 2011 MBPro, which cannot be said of similar aged games.Thank you for making such a great one Runic Games. Thanks also to the people involved in adding classes/characters so the original game could be so much more.			"

												One of the best ARPGS games made by the original creators of Diablo II. While the lore and story are nowhere near as engrossing as Diablo, the world is varied and complex. The game oozes originality, creativity and tender loving care. The classes are completely different from each other and each have their own playstyle. The sounds effects and the impacts of each hit is wonderfully rendered, the skill system rewards you for truly dedicating yourself to one playstyle instead of a jack of all trades approach. The loot is plentiful and creative with very interesting procs and combos built within the gear itself.Difficulty is built on a basis for veterans of ARPG series with stats distribution, skills points, enemies with stuns, aoes, resistances to elements, and procs off of melee attacks. A wonderful game that is always great to come back to. My favourite game of all time by far.			"

												I am a huge Diablo fan and I've never played this game. I've always rejected it as a cheap diablo clone.I picked it up because it was on sale for like nothing. I had it over a year and never played it. But once Diablo 3 turned out to be a huge disappointment, I gave this game a try. And oh boy is it awesome.It surpassed my expectation by far! I couldn't stop playing it.It does almost everything better than Diablo 3.The game just plays and feels great.I really love the free skilltree and character development, you can do whatever you want.You can choose every difficulty right from the start.The Elite difficulty offers a great challenge, right  from level 1 and it wont get easy until very very late into the game.The game world itself is huge and feels alive.The towns are full of merchants, gambler, enchanters and other NPCS.The over world and dungeons are filled with hordes of monsters and many bosses that offer a great challenge.The Mapworks offer a unlimited amount of random generated dungeons. Which is just awesome.And the best thing. The loot system. Every player gets his OWN loot. There are hundreds of items with 5 quality tiersAnd set items.Enough with the good stuff, the game lacks story. If you don't watch out you miss the story. And the story is also pretty short you can get through the game in 20h or even less. But it has a New Game+ feature so its no that bad.The multiplayer loading time can  get really really REALLY long. I don't know why but sometimes it takes like 5~10 minutes! to move from  map A to B.The game saves on your local hard drive so you run  into a lot of cheater when playing multiplayer.Only 4 character classes. That's always a letdown for me but...Thanks to the Steam Workshop and the great community we have access to so many mods that we are able to change every part of the game to our own liking. Every point I've listed can be changed. I've ended up with over 30 character classes and thousands of new items, new dungeons, bosses...everything Is possible. Most mods do work in multiplayer. New mods are coming out almost everyday and you even get the developer kit to create your own mods.At this point, i want to point out one specific mod, Synergies.Synergies is the best Mod  for TL2. Its an overhaul mod that changes almsot everything. Salan, the mods creator put alot of work into this awesome mod.Make sure to visit us at: http://forums.synergiesmod.com/index.phpI recommend this game to everyone that like RPG, mod and co-op/multiplayer games.End.

												Torchlight II is a quite enjoyable ARPG dungeon-crawler with a huge amount of loot, fun, and exploration to be had! I've enjoyed this game since 2013, and I still play it with friends.Torchlight II has some very enjoyable gameplay, and its visuals are pretty cool and its soundtrack is good too, and they both compliment the game and give it its cool style. The environments in the game are pretty cool, and sometimes quite varied, and there's many places to explore and quite a few side quests to participate in, too. Its combat is also incredibly satisfying. Throughout the game, there is a huge variation of armor, weapons, and enchantments that you will find, and you can also transmute items and enchant things at an enchanter. You can also find ""ember"" to socket items with that will give you a boost in elemental strength, from defense to attacking with that element.There are four classes in the game: The Embermage, the Berserker, the Engineer, and the Outlander. Each class has different skills and weapon specializations, although you can use any kind of weapon that you want, no matter what class you play as. You can also customize the characters a bit and choose a pet, although the default options aren't very extensive.Torchlight II is also a mod-friendly game, and it has plenty of cool mods that can change the gameplay, add areas, give more customization options, and add convenience features.Overall, I have no complaints about Torchlight II. The story isn't very fleshed-out, but I find that it's still sufficient for the game nonetheless, and its gameplay is very satisfying and quite fun! I would definitely recommend Torchlight II to anybody who enjoys ARPGS, Co-op games, and loot games. ^.^			"

												Torchlight II is a dungeon crawler RPG, created by an indie developer Runic Games. In this review, I decided not to talk about the story of the game because I was not paying attention to the story (pretty much killing mobs to obtain legendary loot or leveling up) and it is really difficult to remember what happened so let's get on the review. The game's theme is robotic, magic wizardry and witchcraft. Once the player progresses the story (Acts) of the game, it will take you to different lands and it's completely random generated dungeons as well. There are 4 classes to choose from; Engineer, Outlander, Berserker and Embermage. The game's mechanic is obviously similar to Diablo's gameplay. The loot system, weapon add-ons, pet system are great. You can do the item micromanagement without going home by sending your pet to the home portal and sell the inventories you have been hoarding for you, so you can keep grinding on the fly. The skill system on each classes have unique skill trees. Including Active and Passive Skills. They have 7 Active skills each trees and 3 Passive skills (About 21 Active skills including Ultimate and 9 Passive skills). It's very accessible skill trees, you can build whatever you like. There is an end game content, like purchasing any random generated scroll map to level up and your fame level (to earn fame level, you kill any legendary monsters to earn EXP or XP and gain skill points.) You can do another play through or New Game Plus which is great additional, whatever floats your boat.+ Pros+ 4 classes with different skill trees+ Replayability+ Randomly Generated dungeons+ Multiplayer with friends (even though there aren't plenty servers)+ Gameplay mechanics+ Mods are available to implement your game experience via Steam Workshop and Level Editor to create a map- Cons- The story is lacking and no one cares about the story since it's dungeon crawler genre.- Servers are lacking due to the population of the game.For the final review of the game, the gameplay mechanics are strongly familiar to Diablo III. The classes are great but I wish they have sub-classes. The content is limitless because of the mods, RNG dungeons on end game content. But no one cares about the storyline of the game and I found it shallow and snooze fest. The looting system of the game and all RPG aspects that make me want to grind more. The final score for this game is an 8 out of 10, a strong recommendation. I would recommend you Grim Dawn or Path of Exile (Free to Play game) if not.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. Playing solo or with a friend - it can prove to be challenging. Graphics are pretty, story line is interesting and the gear skins are nice. My only gripe is with the lack of inventory space. Granted, once you  get your gear and all gemmed up there isn't much of a reason to keep new items, but I like to save things for the hell of doing so. One of the best features is allowing your pet to go sell your drops while you remain in the dungeon.  After beating the game, buying maps to replay for a quick or more difficult run keeps you coming back for more. I played most of my time multiplayer but still a fair amount of solo play.			"

												Torchlight II is one of those timeless games which you can play even in 10 years and feel enjoyment every time. After Diablo II, it was very hard to find some game that can keep me interested for a long time play. And there comes Torchlight II with the same old style like real RPG should look. With graphical point, the game is more with cartoon style and wild west elements, but nothing overwhelming. The dungeons and monsters goes as hard as the character is strong so gameplay can sometimes be challenging which is actually good because it's very well balanced.			"

												First off I would like to start with then fact that people saying this is a ""clone"" of diablo. Well, every single top-down dungeon crawler, can be called a ""clone"" of diablo so be quiet haters. However if you are debating over getting diablo 3 or this game, this game is the way to go, because 1:it's cheaper. 2:Diablo 3 is not even that good without reaper of souls. Thus this game is a better deal for cash reasons, and the mods are amazing for it, so if you still prefer diablo over this game you could at least mod this game so much that you can at least make it enjoyable. If you wanted to get diablo 2 over this game, then yes get it, it's like 6 bucks on amazon and like $4 shipping that's why it is like $6. Now that I have that cleared up I will actually talk about this game. This game is made by the people who made Fate, my first dungeon crawler I ever played, and that game is quite good as well. I suggest it, but not over this game. This game is so enjoyable, especially with the synergies mod, if you like vanilla of this game then you will love the synergies mod it makes the game easilly twice as better. Now this game follows the classic dungeon crawler basics get loot, and kill stuff, but also instead of just leveling up a few skills that the game already has for you to level up, instead it has skilltrees so it has major replayablity and also it has many different weapons for you to use and there is 4 classes with 3 skill trees on each so that could easily be 12+ playthroughs. But i can tell you with my mods i have i have like another 6 classes easily all well made. Another thing that is great about this game, is that the pet mechanic works brilliantly, inventory full, I think not send your crap you don't want and put it in your pets inventory, pets inventory full? Send it to town to sell that crap you don't want, so you can stay killing stuff and looting stuff. I highly recommend this game one of my favourites of all time. 9.5/10 this game is waaaaay to underrated it must be more popular. Also I have an idea if this game evr gets a torchlight 3, if they can try this, maybe make it like a dungeon crawler but heres the catch mix those mechanics and make it like an open world sandbox, such as skyrim or fallout. That is all, once again 9.5/10 I hop this game gets a triquel.			"

												Torchlight II, another fun and entertaining ARPG. I've had the joy of experiencing multiple ARPG games, but something about Torchlight II really kept my attention. Not only does it offer a continuing story from its first installment, you get to choose from four new classes. My first run through I started with the Engineer, because in all honesty having a healing bot and many other bots to assist you creates an easier education of the game. Later on I did check out the other classes and eventually followed a guide from a fellow gamer for the Outlander truly finalized the experience I was hoping for.Pros:- Choose who you want and build them how you want. (True there are main recommended builds for each class, but it is much more rewarding when you experiment yourself.- Plenty of loot to get you excited.- Champion mobs or bosses, not sure what they classify them as; some pack a punch to test your survivalbility.- End game runs to complete your build with loot.- Having a pet you can send out at any time to sell your items is the best ARPG aspect ever!- The story is fun to follow- Mods!- Fishing- Not just your character, but your pet can also learn scroll skills too!Cons:- Only four classes. Not truly a big deal, however, sometimes it is nice having slightly more variety from the creators.- You can only respec the last three skill points you've spent. This feature alone bugs me, because it limits the idea of altering a build or changing up a character's build without having to start over.- Maps don't reset. I do recall someone writing up a guide on how to reset maps, but this feature alone should have just been implemented.- Cookie-cutter class specs. This, sadly, will always be an issue in any game that offers customization on character growth.As usual in any review I write, this is all based on my experience and opinion. The game is still really fun and with a modding community it does have a long life. I do wish to see, some day, Torchlight III hit development and introduce even better features to a promising campaign. This game does have my recommendation!			"

												Lots of fun, whether alone or with friends. Tons of different monsters, cool levels, big dungeons and of course items with plenty of room for enchantments and embers to further customize your equipment. I never really got into the story and felt nothing for the characters, but that isn't the point of this game nor was it the reason I played it. Fun to play and definitely recommended if you love ARPG games like Diablo.A strong 9 of 10.			"

												A huge upgrade from the first Torchlight, and that's a fact. Not only are there plenty more weapons, accessories, and armor combinations to choose from, but a more immersive environment with a decent story behind it. The cutscenes are very simple, yet still makes you want to play on for another few hours. It's also considerably longer than the first one.One thing I have enjoyed the most would have to be the large amount of skills provided in the game, and the ability to upgrade them to different tiers, making them even more powerful. That is certainly one of the best parts of the game to me. I'm constantly working to level up so I can get a new skill or get to the next tier because it sounds so awesome to be able to ""slash your way through your foes, leaving them stunned in your wake"" or to ""stomp the ground causing ice shards to come out in four different directions, producing massive damage"". That's not word for word from the game, but you get my point.Another thing I really love is the fact that during multiplayer, everyone gets their own loot so you aren't fighting for who gets what items and gold. That, to me, improves multiplayer 100%. Even still, while playing with friends, the difficulty increases so it's not a walk in the park. I like a bit of a challenge, so it's fun when you and someone else have some sort of epic boss fight and get your own epic loot from it.I highly recommend you try this if you have played the first Torchlight. Even if you haven't, it's not like the entire story will be confusing, almost forcing you to play the first one.It's that good.			"

												Torchlight 2 is a hack n slash game made by the original creators of diablo II.The story is about a dark alchemist threatening the balance of the world by opening the nether portals for a cure of some sort.There's a total of 4 classes, engineer, embermage, berserker and outlander, and you can add more with workshop mods, i'd recommend sinergy one but after you beat the main game due to the increased difficulty.Once you create a character and select a faithful pet, you can even get the headcrab from half life 2 if you're into that O.o, you get prompt with a difficulty setting, nice mechanic, all the way from easy to elite and obviously the famous hardcore mechanic one death equals losing that character forever.Each class got a nice set of skill trees and those skins are fun from level 1, unlike games like titanquest or diablo where the cooler spells require tons of hours in the game, plus you can learn additonal 4 spells for you and your pet, summoning creatures, haste, and more.Your pet similar to the game Fate, can pick up items or take the items from your inventory to go to the town and sell it while you keep killing hordes of enemies, can also buy portals and potions if needed, there's also fishing spots you can catch unique fishes to transform your pet into monsters in order to make it more efficient in combat for the duration of the fish.Game is a must have for hack n slash fans, and even if you're not one but enjoyed diablo II you should get it, even at full price is still a great deal.

												Forged by the former Blizzard developers who brought you Diablo games (none of the former Blizzard North employees worked on Diablo 3, btw) it's hard to not compare the two, especially when you hear that nice and atmospheric soundtrack from Matt Uelmen (who, of course, wrote the soundtracks for the first 2 Diablo games) which will certainly bring back some memories of Sanctuary. Since they are just an indie dev studio now, without WoW-milking Blizzard budget, there's no more shiny things like super-duper CGI cutscenes, but that doesn't take away from its charm.Besides those mentioned reasons there are some others with Diablo vibe. Former hero who got corrupted, and now poses a threat to the world, while he is traveling across the wooden-snowy/dusty desert/jungly regions (sounds familiar, doesn't it?) in an attempt to free an ancient evil. Of course, you are always behind him, while you are trying to fix things which he messed up, until the final showdown at the end.Each region has a town which serves as your safe heaven/hub area. There you can trade, use enchanters to boost your equipment, certain specialist who can recover your gems by destroying the equpment or vice versa - destroying gems and freeing the slot to insert better gems to give better stats to your equpment. And there you will get majority of your story related quests. In the town, and in the areas around it, there are folks who can give you bunch of optional quests. You can ignore them completely if you want, but without the experience from their quests it will just be harder for you the further you travel into the game.You can chose between four classes: Embermage, Engineer, Outlander, and Berserker. Personally, I've found Engineer to be the most versatile, as through investements in his skill tree you can turn it easily into close combat fighting machine or into ranged fighter. Sure, you can do with other classes whatever you want, but Berserker is obviously close combat class, which you can't say for Outlander.You can also chose a pet, including iconic Half-Life headcrab. Your pet is your shadow, it fights beside you, and also serves as a secondary inventory. You can send it into town to sell whatever you don't need, and also to get the potions/scrolls from your shop list, and in this way you don't have to bother using town portal scrolls or to travel back to do it yourself. Pet can be fed with various kinds of fishes (yes, you can also fish in this game), temporary transforming it into different kind of a beast. And, just as yourself, it can learn spells, making it even more usefull in combat.There's multiplayer co-op, which requires creating 3rd party Runic account.  Group can contain up to 6 players, although I've never played in a group this large, but more players will certainly help in the hardest modes, especially when you create an hardcore character who's death is permanent (at least pet's death isn't permanent, even in this mode). Speaking of which, you can also share your equipement between your own characters over shared stash in towns, but you can't share between hardcore - non-hardcore characters. As gold and loot flies everywhere just grab anything without any pardon, since every player sees his own loot. Then you can trade with each other, which is usefull for getting rid of certain class exclusive pieces which your current class may not use (unless you are planning to share it with yourself for another character of yours, over previously mentioned shared stash option).Once you complete the game, you can start the New Game + mode, and continue developing your character. By finishing the game you are also unlocking Mapworks area (also available in NG+), where you can buy dungeon maps with various buffs or nerfs for either yourself or your enemies, and spend the time killing and looting in them to your liking.If I have to nitpick about something... Those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 4 broken achievements! UARGH, this achievement-hunting junky rash in my hand... Its really lame when you've spent so much time completing everything, including some annoying grindy achivements, and devs are still saying it will be dealth with, even after an year since they originally promissed it will be solved... As you can see, the support of this game is dead, as they are just a small studio which moved all of its manpower to the next big thing. But there's Steam Workshop support, and no lack of quality mods for this game. EDIT: After several years of whining at Runic Steam forums those broken achieves have been finally removed. It was totally worth it...But if you don't care for such things, the game itself is worth the cost (even with some free quality titles such as Path of Exile, but T2 doesn't have microtransactions like PoE has), especially on the sale, as you can easily squizee at least 20-30 hours of fun from it. Friend of mine who said he got sick of the game has over 20 hours.			"

												Torchlight II is almost everything I want from a loot driven RPG. It's a fast-paced game with a good loot drop variety and frequency. Its co-op supports a party with up to 8 members (with an official mod). By the way, it's also very moddable and it has a lot of cool options that range from slightly modify the game to complete rebalance. The classes are all different from the original and there's a lot of different ways to build everyone. It can have some problems when it comes to syncing with other players but that seems to have improved a lot in the last months. It's better with friends and there's even a LAN mode but it still has an active community if you're interested in playing online.			"

												Kept me up all night, I'd give it a solid honey badger / 10.Believe me, I really, truly wanted to leave it at that.But after ages of telling myself, ""I need to try it out,"" I finally purchased Torchlight II last night. And I was blown away.Is it like Diablo? Kinda, yeah. But it's a lot... comfier, for lack of a better term. You can customize your character a bit and you get to start with a pet that isn't just cosmetic. Character building, as I understand, is really flexible. I mean, I wanted a battle-mage and I made one. Not fully optimized, mind you, but it's working so far. For the first time in a long while, I've found a game that's made me want to start a save after save, just to see what kinda stuff I can come up with - at only six hours in. The soundtrack hasn't gotten on my nerves yet, which is saying something. The graphics surprised me, positively; for some reason I was expecting it to look like WarCraft 3 zoomed in. The gameplay's familiar if you've ever touched Diablo, but the game adds its own little things to the mix (inventory cleaning service says hi). I'm sure everything that had to be said already has, so I'll just add one more thing.Best 3,79 euros I ever spent.			"

												A very good Diablo II-esque hack'n'slash.Graphics are nice, if fairly basic by today's standards. The art style is hit or miss, it's very colourful and almost cartoonish across the board, giving the game a distinctive vibe. I like it.Audio design is mostly fine, some voice acting is borderline garbage, the soundtrack is really nice though.The story is as basic and unengaging as it gets, and the fact that you only get walls of text with no voice acting for sidequests doesn't help either, but you know what? I don't care. I play games like this for the beatdowns, not storytelling.The gameplay is exactly what you'd expect from an ARPG - kill things, get loot and experience, optimise your loadout and build, rinse and repeat. And it does all of this pretty well.- What I like about this game as opposed to Torchlight 1 is that it incorporates large open areas so you're not just dungeon crawling all the time (in fact you're likely to spend MOST of the time in overworld areas if you want to explore them completely). The environments are largely varied and nice to look at.- Four character classes focusing on melee, heavy weapons, ranged weapons and magic. You can use most weapons with any class (and some crossover builds may be viable) but it's obviously most efficient to use the ones you have bonuses for.- Lots and lots of loot to go through, with numerous things to take into consideration, like ""is 20 more armour worth giving up my +10% crit damage bonus?"", you'll probably need to do some serious math if you want to get the absolute most out of your gear.- A wide range of active and passive skills that are only limited by level - no skill requires you to unlock a different one first (although there are cases where getting one skill is pointless without having another). A considerable downside is that there's no full respec option in the vanilla game so if you pick a subpar skill and don't realise until later on, you're stuck with a broken build.- Like in TL1, you have a pet who helps you in combat and you can send it to town to sell items and (unlike in TL1) even buy some consumables (e.g. potions or identify scrolls), saving you a lot of warping back to town.- Four difficulty levels (plus hardcore mode where dying means game over) allow casual players and masochists alike to have some fun.- New Game Plus (being able to play through the game again at higher level with the same character) and The Mapworks (where you pay to enter randomly generated dungeons with modifiers that may noticably alter gameplay) make sure there's always something you can do with your character.I picked this game up when I was feeling nostalgic for the old Diablo games and it more than delivered on what I expected from it. An absolute must-play if you're into ARPGs and worth checking out even if you're not.(special thanks to steam support for making this review postable)			"

												One of the best Loot-based RPG that I've ever played. You can play as one of the four classes that have their own unique skill-tree and play-style. They are:> Outlanders, who are good at long range weapons and poison-based magic. Skill Trees: Warfare, Lore, Sigil.> Berserkers, who are goot at close range weapons, quick attack and animal-based special powers. Skill Trees: Hunter, Tundra, Shadow> Embermage, who are goot at high level elemental magic attacks. Skill Trees: Inferno, Frost, Storm> Engineer, who are good at heavy melee wapons and steam-puck technologies such as robots and stuff. Skill Trees: Blitz, Construction, Aegis.Pros:+ Good story.+ Great gameplay. + Great pseudo-randomly generated world. Each map is generated so that you will feel certain differences in each of your visits.+ Great loots. There are so many great Items that you wont be able to carry and save with your very limited Inventory slot.+ Good and gorgeous graphics+ Great arrays of side missions, which will keep you busy for hours and hours and gameplay and loots.Cons:- Inventory slots are too limited, wont hurt to add more :DOverall: 90/100 "

												The game is good but Runic games stopped supporting it after June 2013, no more Patches since then. You are now still stuck with Multiplayer problems, you can't see your friends online or join them unless you logged in on the same server. So after 5-10 times of relogging in you should be able to play with your friends. Also there are 4 broken Achievements, who where promised to get removed after Summer Sale 2013, sadly that didnt happen. It's been a long time since I saw a developer saying something in the steam forums. You are better off if you play this game alone in my opinion.Edit: Unachievable Achievements were fixed early 2015.			"

												Torchlight 2 is it worth it ? Torchlight 2 is a sequel to original torchlight top down dungeon clawler that has you playing as 3 classes in original game, and four classes in sequel, how does this one compare to original ? quite well.  Gameplay = Second game gives us Coop mode, which was a must, in a first game, but devs didn`t think probably, and we had that since diablo 2, New Game Plus was introduced, which makes alot easier once you have your character on a cap :) to start NG+ game tells you to have level 51, i didn`t find that all that neccesary as embermage, could take down level 60 mobs, in 4 hits. Story, Characters = Torchlight 2 story continues from where torchlight 1 ends, after you kill ordrak with alchemist class, you become insane, and after that torchlight 2 starts, and alchemist starts searching for cure to cure ""ember blight"" sickness which was a problem in a first game, alchemist sets out in search for guardians, and power ordraks heart once more, and you have to stop him.as for characters i don`t have much to say : i liked once person in act 2 which rhymes and gives quests he was the most memorable of a bunch.Boss Fights - you have three kinds of bosses, Champions, Side Bosses, Main bosses, Champions you encounter through out the game, and those guys hit like truck, if not underrestimated. Side bosses, and Main bosses, can be found, and usually you`ll get achievments for killing them, which makes doing all quests worth it. Favorite fights have to be ending of an act fights : those being Regent Fight, Guardian fight (Mana/Siege guardian) and Alchemist. Final boss could have been alchemist, because netherlord is a pushover. i killed him being level 48 and with full unique gear. so wtfP.s Mods for this game are insane #PlaySynergiesoverall : if you want a game to runthrough endless amount of times, to get 100 hours in, and do all classes, this is the game. Get it on sale, or if you can find it for a cheap price :)			"

												I purchased Torchlight 2 on a hunch because I never played the first game and I was in need of a Diablo 2 clone type game to fill the void and after playing the game for about 2-3 hours I was very much enjoying it, the character customization though not brilliant (Diablo 2's is for depth but customization it isn't) is good. The pet sidekick is a welcome feature that I actually love a lot a feature that would have been great in D2 but granted this is probably TL2's unique feature as remember I never played the first game. I love the idea you can give them items and when your full send over the useless stuff and then send them to town to sell the stuff is fantastic, bear in mind when you do your without your attacking pet for a limited amount of time but using it wisely you'll have no problems. I love the skills system and the levelling up system is pretty much the same as Diablo 2 so that's a good thing because sometimes games can have a cheap feel or a complex feel, but you can respec your skills points as much as you like providing you have enough gold to pay for it this is one feature D2 only got very late in it's patch history and only then can it be used once.The story is good and the world is vibrant and colourful with plenty of variety in enemies I have yet to play a co-op game or online but I probably can say it's like any other RPG game that has it again D2, Titan Quest etc, for me this purchase was one of the best purchases in the last few years when it comes to finding a fresh RPG for myself I would recommend it especially if you see it on sale because it's steal at any price.

Overall Rating: 9/10I can't believe I owned this game for so long and never played it until now. One of the more fun aRPG hack & slash games I have ever played. (/10 only because of some odd input bugs or glitches that prevented mouse inputs at times, making me use all keyboard inputs for short periods of time. Which was bit annoying and broke the flow a bit.First full playthrough as a REALLY tanky Berserker. Seemed like I was a bit too OP? (Played through in Normal Mode softcore). Tanked up hard, with obnoxious HP regen and signinifcant dmg reflects in gear and socketables, and made my pet a Warbeats (Mittens is a little badass...), mainly because I expected to take more, or even some damage. Made it through w/o using many pots. Still haven;t used 50 for the first achievement for pot quaffing. Kinda dissapointed it was so easy. Looking forward to using maps now and going into NP+. Quite possibly will do a HC run, even though I generally do not play HC in hack & slash games. Highly recommended to anyone who hasn;t played it yet. I can;t be the only one who wated so long. Can I? Great Easter Eggs and humor in the game, made it qyite fun. Ran beautifully on a true toaster, 100+ fps, which shocked me for as old as my rig is. No stutter or hitching. Only issues was the mouse input failures. Wired mouse, so no battery issues, mouse is functioning perfectly in othe games and on regular everyday PC apps. But it wasn;t gambreaking, so, not that big of a deal. Just a small PITA a few times.Just plain fun, though future builds may be done intentionally underpowered, just for more challenge.   :)			"

												I really can't sing the praises of Torchlight 2 enough.  A lot of people I know describe it as ""Diablo 2.5"" and to be fair, it kinda is.  I maintain, however, that it's not a bad thing.  Graphically, it's as pretty as anything I've seen Diablo 3 produce.  Its interface will be instantly familiar to you if you've played Diablo 2, unlike D3 which looks like I'd have to learn all over again.  It has a quest system overworld-and-dungeons combo you'll be familiar with from D2, a potion and scroll system reminiscent of D2's, an item transmutation system that's a very simplified variation of D2's, even tiny atmospheric critters you can squish underfoot, just like in D2.That's pretty much where the similarities end.  For one, your inventory is far more convenient.  Gone are the days where you have to juggle space for every item - now everything takes up a single inventory block, and furthermore, consumable items and spells (more on those later) have their own inventory tabs.  Gone are the skill trees, where you have to take this skill in order to take that skill.  Now if you meet the level requirements, you can level the skill.  You can even freely mix skills between various trees without feeling like you're penalizing yourself.  Gone is the irritating stamina system - you can move at full speed, full time, instead of being forced to walk unless you guzzle potions.  Gone are the complicated extra rarities of stuff - there's normal, there's enchanted, there's rare (which includes some sets), unique (also with some sets), and at the highest end, legendary.  Everything drops, eventually.  No need to jump through complicated hoops of requirements to get a particular item - if you're at the right level range for it to drop or appear in the Gambler Shop's inventory, you can get it, if you have the patience and gold.New to the genre are permanent pets.  They're more than just there to look cute.  For one, they have their own inventories, which are as robust as yours.  Load 'em up with everything you don't want to carry, like all those trash items you'd never bother with otherwise.  Then, send them off to town to sell your loot.  No need to stop adventuring or use a town portal scroll just to clean out the garbage!  Your pet can even go purchase supplies for you while you're in the field.  Just a brief one or two minute wait is all it takes to get whatever basic amenities you need to keep adventuring.  More than just pack mules, all pets can fight, possessing a basic attack.  However, you can also teach them skills, too.  Ever wanted an alpaca that could spit fire and ice?  How about a bulldog that shoots swarms of bees when it barks?  Or maybe a necropanther - a panther necromancer, summoning skeletal archers and exploding zombies?  Find the right spell scrolls, and your pet can do just that!Speaking of spells, these little gems are throwbacks to the days of Diablo 1, where all the magic you own was found in the dungeon and learned the hard way.  Spells exist in addition to your class's skills, and you can have a maximum of four spells.  They're not unique to any class - any class can learn any spell, with the only restriction is having the required level or better.  They range from passive effects to buffs to direct damage spells.  Your barbarian, in addition to his horrific melee combat ability, can supplement his murderous rampage with fireballs, or buff up his attack and movement speed to get him into the fray faster.  It all depends on what spells you find and learn.Finally, Torchlight II does away with the slowness and stodginess of Diablo 2's gameplay.  Characters are fast and dynamic, enemies are slightly fewer but more brutal, with many, many more enemies having special attacks and abilities, not just champions.  You need to think on your feet a lot more, and use your skills intelligently and in good combination to dominate your foes.  There's less a focus on the stats you fight with and more on how you fight, and there's always numerous ways you can approach a situation with every class.  As an engineer, do you charge in with melee attacks and rely on your armor and defensive buffs to survive?  Or do you hang back with a cannon and blast crowds of enemies while your various killer robots do the grunt work?  It's up to you, and both approaches are completely viable.  In addition, enemies and the world feel more 'alive' - they don't just approach you in random themed hordes, but instead appear dynamically from the environment.  Ezrohir ambushers will burst from the sands of the desert underfoot.  Sturmbeorn raiders will leap from the cliffs overhead to challenge you.  You'll encounter zombies and ghouls devouring a corpse, and when you kill them, the flesh-stripped corpse rises as a skeleton to fight you as well.  Vile mystics will be found performing rituals upon desecrated tombs or will be trying to sacrifice innocent captives, and you can draw the attention of a lich by disturbing its grave.  You can rescue slaves from packs of slaver-bandits, and be surprised when you fight a horrid monster, only for its even-more-horrid mate to show up and join the fight!All in all, I consider Torchlight 2 to be a worthy entry to the action-RPG dungeon-crawler subgenre.  It strips the BS out of Diablo 2, keeps what Diablo 2 did well, and then improves upon the whole formula without being as wildly experimental as Diablo 3 is.  And hey, if you don't like what Torchlight II does, vanilla?  Well, it's mod-friendly, and has Steam Workshop support.  If you don't like it, change it!			"

												Torchlight II is awesome! 10/10 for this genre.Super cool art style, smooth gameplay and feel, lots of items, lots of loot, and pets! This is a great top-down action RPG game, even coming from me, someone who really doesn't like top-down games. Action is fun and smooth, skill trees lack a little but each class is quite different, coop with friends is crazy fun.One of the biggest things for me about these top-down games is I hate the click fest it is because you have to click to move, so you are just constantly clicking just to walk across the room. Well in TL2 you can map a key to be a movement key (I used W) then use the pointer to direct the character. +1 for that. Best control feature.There are some great mods out there as well, it has a very rich mod-base to choose from to tweak the game to your liking. Minorly or majorly. I use stuff like minimalist item labels so I can actually see when there are lot of items, respec and reskill potions added so I don't have to worry about the “perfect character build” right from the beginning and can just re-skill my characters if I get a new skill or want to try a different style, and the LurkerHud which gives tons of stats and info right on the dash and I recommend it very heavily. As I do the game, try it!			"

												Torchlight has been revamped and upgraded in every aspect since its first debut.Amongst the best ARPGs, Torchlight II is one of my favourite. It has moderate random generated landscapes, insanely customizable, 4 totally different characters, moddability (!) and tons...no, I mean TONS of loot.In Steam Workshop, there are heaps of mods that improves/completely changes the game, giving you the ARPG you really want to play. I do not like to compare games or saying which one is better. Grim Dawn, Torchlight II, Diablo...: all of them are unique quality.			"

												so i've put a few hundred hours into it and decided its time for a review. so its basically diablo 2.5 only in a cartoony environment. right from the start you feel powerful and everything explodes when it dies and its just very pleasing if your a fan of arpg's. the combat is very fun and there are tons of unique spells that i have not ecnountered in other arpgs. yes there are generic fireballs and damage buffs, but there are also interesting spells like summon gunbots which is a little npc robot that follows your character for a short time and shoots enemies. one interesting thing is that your spells get more powerful with your level so a level 1 spell could have 50 damage at character level 1 and 500 damage at level 100. this is very useful when putting ""value"" points into spells. the multiplayer has some issues like random long loading times and with 3 or more players spamming spells at large groups of mobs it can cause your fps to drop, but overall a very solid experience. the mp community is on the smaller side but overall they are friendly and like to help you out. most of the higher level characters will just jump in a world and start passing out free gear to the new players if you dont bug them asking for frees. speaking of fps drops when playing single player it runs fantastic. almost non existant loading times and fps stays consistant. the overall system load is pretty minimal and should run on most systems. in the future if i ever get board of playing unmodded i can start downloading mods off the steam workshop like synergies that from what i've heard will completely change the game or maybe one of the custom class mods that mix and match spells of the vanilla classes into 1 theme'd class. i eagerly await the day a median xl style mod is made for torchlight. overall its worth every bit of the $20 price (current as of 5/2016) and if you can get it cheaper on sale it becomes a no brainer purchase.

												If you enjoyed Torchlight, you'll find more of the same in Torchlight II - and 'More' is pretty much the theme.Whereas Torchlight was a very concise game with one central hub and a very deep mine to explore, Torchlight II has expanded with several 'base hubs', themed areas and a whole host of new enemies to turn into gibblets. Personally, I found this to have it's positives and negatives.There were times that I missed the simplicity of Torchlight, of just digging down deeper to find tougher and tougher enemies the deeper I delved into the mine. I missed how all your essential services were kept together at the mining camp, and it was easy to navigate. There were times in TL2 where I had to bounce between several hubs to get back to the original base camp where the shared stash and personal stash was based to retrieve gems and items I had stored for later. While this isn't anything major, it did add up to what I felt was a lot of down time between turning monsters into blood stains.However, the expanded features of Torchlight 2 do add several themed areas which are you able to explore to a point (and in some cases contain hidden quests & secret rooms), and probably more important to some - hosted coop. Coop mode is fairly stable and somewhat easy to setup and join when it comes to finding a game. The game provides an in-game text box to allow for people to communicate.The main addition that I find as a huge bonus is the integration of the Steam Workshop, which has enabled several add-on mods and 'fixes' to things you might not like (such as mods which bring back classes that were removed from the original game). In short Torchlight II is worth playing, as it does enough to be different from the first Torchlight (like it or not), and it's one of the more polished dungeon crawler/loot games out there. Have a good look through Steam Workshop to see if there are any additions you'd like to add to the playthrough, and you should be able to create an experience you'll enjoy.			"

												It's made by the brains behind Diablo 1 and 2, and the music is done by the same dude as well. The game is not nearly as dark, but the feel of the game and especially the music has the Diablo vib. Cant say enough about the music. At some times you think you're listening to an unreleased Diablo track, which isn't a bad thing at all. It's something D3 was missing.Overall, imo the game has the Diablo spirit, but isn't as fleshed out content wise, or replayability as Diablo 2. Replay being an understatement, because there are tons of hours to be spent here. Just don't expect 1000s of hours that live up to the D2 experience.Overall the game offers a s*** ton of fun, whether playing sp or mp; tons of fun to be had if you can jam with a few friends.			"

												Torchlight II is a game very reminiscent of Diablo II in gameplay.  An action RPG with tons o' loot to go through and just enough playing around with skills and abilities to make a character that works to your liking.  No, it is not a deep or hardcore RPG in any way.  It just does a great job at keeping you entertained and coming back for more.  I got the game on a recent sale for $4.99 and consider it money very well spent.  I'm sure it will be a game that I will continually come back to long after I have beaten it.  Cannot wait to try out some of the content available in the Steam Workshop in the future to see what users have added to the game.  That will have to wait until I beat the game first of course.			"

												This is how an ARPG should have been made! Torchlight II offers fine tuning of your character as you level up that you just can't do in Diablo 3. Pets can travel to town and buy-sell items for you while you're explorin' dungeons. And mods, which add more content to the world. Though this game support 6-player co-op, I'd suggest you to play with your 2 or 3 friends only as things get very messy when there are 6 players on the screen.			"

												For the sake of this demonstration, I am an Embermage: you are a Varkolyn whelpling, an unarmed and mostly undressed little bat-person sitting up a tree. You've been sitting up that tree for a long time, waiting with your many brothers and sisters for someone to wander past. Suddenly, a stranger approaches! You leap down, snarl, prance about, and are almost immediately annihilated by five blind-fired bolts of magic that leap from my outstretched hands.Let's assume that, in those final moments, time slows to a tiny fraction of its regular speed. This is what you see: half a dozen of your siblings, stumbling into a purple patch of energy that slows them to a crawl. Six columns of flame bursting from the Embermage. A rain of firebolts. A storm contained in a vortex of wind that turns your nearby cousins to ash. Sometimes, when a whelpling dies, they explode into icy bolts that freeze nearby friends. Sometimes, the Embermage gets all its health back for no apparent reason. Sometimes, the ground shakes and a meteor falls from the sky, as if to drive the point home.You want to cry out, as the end approaches, but you can't. You've been magically silenced by a nearby raven, who has eaten an egg and is - temporarily - a crab. The crab-raven then summons a nether imp, five skeleton archers, and a zombie, before flying over and stealing your shoes and your money. The name on the crab-raven's tag is 'George Orwell'.I am gone by the time the first prismatic bolt hits you. The last thing you see is a familiar pattern of lights bursting beyond the treeline: me, doing exactly the same thing to those undead dwarves down the road. The last thing you think is this:""Oh, man. I'm not even special ."" It's fine! It's the good kind of fire!As an action-RPG, the best thing about Torchlight II is the way that loot, skill choice and chance bubbles over into a fountain of light and treasure at the whiff of a right-click, every single time, for as long as you can keep going. As an action-RPG, the worst thing about Torchlight II is the way that loot, skill choice and chance bubbles over into a fountain of light and treasure at the whiff of a right-click, in the exact same way, for as long as you can keep going.After more than 20 hours I've built my Embermage into a machine for the consumption and processing of monsters. My wands cast random spells when I kill an enemy. My armour reflects melee damage. I have a passive ability that randomly teleports attackers further away. My firestorm plants a fire vulnerability on enemies that my columns of flame capitalise on, explosively. Every point of damage I do fills my charge bar, which ultimately reduces the casting cost of all my spells to zero. When this happens I summon a duplicate of myself, just because I can. I've also got this raven. His name's George. I think you've met.As the difficulty rises, it's sometimes necessary to tinker with the machinery: to invest in new skills, or alter the opening moves of my combat rotation. By and large, though, the character I've made worked in act one and she's still working a campaign and a bit later.Your place in Torchlight II's plot is circumstantial: you're a hero, and that's about it. You're chasing down the villainous Alchemist - one of the original game's protagonists - for reasons that nobody in the game sounds especially concerned about. Character emerges as you settle on a playstyle: I'm a stationary death vortex now , but I could have specced differently - a teleporting, sword-wielding warrior mage, perhaps. Her love for skeletons is like a truck.Besides the Embermage, the other predominantly ranged character is the Outlander: a mobile weapons platform specialising in guns, glaives, and debilitating magic. The Berserker channels spirit animals to augment melee attacks, buffing allies and debuffing foes to build an advantage. The Engineer is a tank that can specialise in heavy weapons or sword-and-shield durability, with the option of swapping out for a massive handheld cannon and an army of robotic pets.They're a varied bunch, although the game struggles to communicate precisely how different they are before you start playing. I arrived at the Embermage through a process of experimentation: given the game's hundred levels of character advancement, I recommend you do the same before committing.Levelling grants you points to spend on attribute boosts and new skills. The two are linked: attributes determine the relative power of your weapon and magic damage, for example, impacting the usefulness of the skills you may choose to invest in. Unlike the original Torchlight, you don't need to invest points in a skill tree to unlock its late-game potential. Instead, new skills open up as you level, allowing for greater dabbling as you progress. The system is over reliant, as many action-RPGs are, on incrementing your power by tiny percentages every time you spend a point and each individual level up can feel inconsequential as a result. In the long term, however, there's a lot of scope for cleverness and creativity.Unfortunately, Torchlight II limits your ability to respec to undoing the last three skill decisions you made. This effectively prevents shifts in direction at high levels: even though I've built a character I like, I can't change her - and my skill trees are littered with discarded investments. If I want her to be perfect I either need to start again or wait for the inevitable respec mod, and both feel like a compromise. Certainly, it's a system where decisions have consequences: it's just that those consequences are a needless waste of time. In a year where multiple RPGs have figured out that freedom to change your mind actually results in more interesting decisions, not less, this aspect of Torchlight II's design sticks out as an unwelcome manifestation of its early noughties influences. Certain set pieces mix up the rules: in this section, you have to stay in the light.Other aspects are much more gratefully received. Offline play, six player co-op (both online and over LAN) and full mod support are all present, and Steam Cloud support enables the game to benefit from the best bits of modern online integration.In terms of features, Torchlight II has tremendous scope. The campaign is randomised from the overworld down, remixing environments and sprinkling them with events that keep the pace up even as you go about the busywork of map clearance. You might kill a sprite who drops a golden key, then go looking for the chest it opens. You might kill a phase beast and enter a pocket-sized challenge stage, or stumble across a hidden side quest that stretches across the whole game.When you finish the campaign, you can start over from where you left off or enter the 'Map Room', a nexus where you can use in-game gold to buy access to randomised dungeons with custom rulesets. A full set of difficulty levels are available from the start, along with a hardcore permadeath mode for the committed. The game bends over backwards to give you options, a limbo act that twists the rest of the way and swallows itself with the provision of mod support. This is a game with a long, community-driven future, one that scrawls an infinity symbol over your potential time investment in effortless freehand. Ever feel like a game knows exactly what buttons to push?It's less successful in terms of scale. There's very little sense of escalation to the environments or encounters: you start in a field, pass through a desert, visit a swamp and spend an awful lot of time in caves. You will be fighting level 1 rat-men at level 1 and level 40 bat-men at level 40: although it apes Diablo II's narrative and structure to a comical degree, Torchlight II doesn't up the stakes in the same way. The short fourth act changes the tone but is thin on surprises.The game's stock-in-trade is charm and detail: characterful animations that you'll zoom in to watch, witty item descriptions, the sound			"

												Alright, it's about time I give this absolutely amazing game the review it deserves. This game is honestly one of the best, my personal favourite, RPG games ever made. This game has everything that makes it entertaining and enjoyable to play. Just to put this out there, I've put in only over 30+ hours and I still haven't beat the story; so I won't be commenting on that just yet, I will hopefully edit it once I've completed it and give my final thoughts + opinions on it. So, to start off, I'll talk about the art of the game.This game is simply beautiful. Like, really. The locations that you visit are honestly some of the most astounding places I've been able to visit in a video game; and that's just the best feeling I've experienced within a game. The places fit their names perfectly, if the name is something drab and gloomy, the level makes sure to match the atmosphere it's trying to portray. If the name however is something cheery and pleasent, you can certainly expect an amazing looking level with many, many bright colours and just making it a downright beautiful level.The art for enemies is honestly so well done and it makes the game feel that bit more creepy and dark. The enemies all seem like they could fit into any serious and dark horror film. Enemies in this game are made perfectly from an art standpoint, like seriously. I know it sounds like I'm repeating myself but this game would give me nightmares if the enemies used were in a horror movie. They're just like nightmares except personified. The dark enemies can lead to some of the game feeling like an absolute hell, and the bosses are just.. Well, just as great as the normal enemies to be frank.Speaking of bosses, the art on them is absolutely top-notch and cannot be topped. I wish I could talk about the bosses without spoiling anything, but that just won't be possible, so I'm afraid I'll cut that there. Just know that the boss art is actually amazing and once again, using this horror movie bit, could make anything horrifying and downright terrifying. I think that to truly see what the bosses are like in this game, you should 100% get the game just to see the art of the bosses and enemies alone.Now, to talk about something that I adore in this game and something that makes this game seem like it's had years upon years of work put into it; the sheer amount of items in this game. Like, seriously. This game has weapons for everyone. Want a giant hammer to smash your foes? This game's got it! Prefer to use guns to shoot your enemies and inflict massive damage? Check! Want a massive amount of weapons which aren't limited to a certain class and can be used by any class? Well, this game has it! Yes, that's right, there are no class limitations on weapons (mostly!).The weapons in this game are so unique and there's almost no weapon like another. What I mean is, all weapons are somewhat unique compared to any other weapon in this game. The different types of which loot you can get (I mean like common, elemental, rare, etc!) are all a unique way of making sure that every weapon is so different and has it's own stats. Like, maybe it adds some extra fire damage or even some ice damage. Hell, throw some poison onto that bad boy and make it a real powerhouse of damage!Speaking of damage, don't expect all weapons that you get to be super-mega-hyper-ultra OP. Most weapons are actually pretty darn bad from a damage perspective;  but make up for it with an amazing damage OUTPUT. What I mean by that is, the damage may be bad but with the amount of leveling up you can do and the amount of skill points which can be contributed to each skill, you do end up doing more damage than the weapon claims. Say the weapon says that it does 60 damage, you may end up doing somewhere between 200-300 dependant on your skill points and enchantments.Something else this game does is enchantments. Each piece of equipment that you get can be enchanted by a special person in each town. This Racoon-type person will enchant all weapons or armour for a price. The enchantments can be great - or not so great - just because, well, it's an RPG so you can't expect a walk in the park! The enchantments are fairly basic but at the same time can really help you in a major way. From adding fire or electric armour to adding health stolen on hit!So, enough about the art and more about the actual enemies and bosses themselves. Each enemy in this game is unique and unlike the other, mostly. Some of the bosses are downright so enjoyable that I can't wait to fight them again when I start a Newgame+. The game does an excellent job of making you feel like the bosses are tough but beatable, and getting late-game you really start to experience that feeling. Some of the bosses may seem like they're easy at first glance, but damn do they get hard. Don't go to any boss expecting it to be an easy ride.The game allows you to experience it at your own pace, be you a slow player who wants to take it all in and explore all the areas that the game has to offer to you or maybe you want to ignore all the enemies and speedrun the game as fast as you want. The game allows you to play at YOUR pace. Once again, this is good for letting everyone have their own option in how they want to play. You want a game which doesn't hold your hand but somewhat lets you play fast? This game is PERFECT.In conclusion, because I can feel myself droning on and on, this game is honestly turning into one of my favourite games of all time - yes, all time! - This game has so much to offer me as a player and lets me want to play over and over and over. This game is down-right amazing and I cannot wait to keep playing and playing. Thanks for reading, and for sure get this game if you see it on sale - even if it DOESN'T look like your type of game.

												Every once in a while, I love to smash everything and everyone in sight - then I turn to a something like Torchlight II. Hack & Slay is the name of the game, and it feels just as satisfying as the rich booty from those battles. The enemies and surroundings are diverse enough, and some bosses look relatively awesome. I say ""relatively"" because overall, the graphics have not aged well. On the other hand, the music is still excellent. Dialogues are short and do not involve any important decisions or moral dilemmas, which is an advantage because the voice acting is mostly sub-par. Grim Dawn is superior in this regard and managed to create a lot more depth of atmosphere (e.g. the Steampunk setting with fireweapons side by side with swords and maces is more plausible in a post-apocalyptic scenario - Torchlight does not bother with giving you that kind of background). Also, it is four years younger and has better graphics. If in doubt which one you should play, I would prefer Grim Dawn. Nevertheless, Torchlight II is well done, it offers consistently engaging gameplay and character progression as well as several options for you to keep on playing after finishing the main story. The feature that you can use your pet as a connection to town markets is not realistic, but innovative and conveniently saves your hero some annoyingly repetitive errands, which is why I make this honorary mention here. I recommend this game to fans of the genre and give it a 7/10 in this comparison group.			"

												I never played action rpg before this. I have 140+ hours in this game and I still wants to play with it. I bought for 3,74 Euro in Summer Sales, definitely worth it. Steam Workshop such a good idea for this game, you can finish the story in like 10-20 hours( depends on difficulty), but in the workshop I found a lot good mods, like bonus classes( you can play as Dark Alchemist or with the original 3 class from Torchlight 1), bonus maps, bonus weapons class and much more. I recommend the play SynergiesMOD, its a complete balance to the game.I beat the Netherlord( Final boss) 5 five times, and the main story its repetative after completing 2 or 3 times. New Game+ is a good idea, but after New Game++++ the game wont be harder, everything stay at lvl 120. The game could beat you, if you dont know which skill is good, which stats are important for you. This why you play in Multiplayer( up to 6 player) and this make some good comps. I lvl up to 100 1 character yet, an Outlander, but a Berserker in progress atm. Every class has unique items/sets, and legendaries. After 140 hours of gameplay I got 3 legendary( all of them are the best in the class): shield, wand, and sword. My friend got 2 legendary in 80 hours: wand( same as mine) and a greathammer. Conclusion: I rate 10/10, I realy loved it, but lots of people said its a Diablo copy. Yeah, thats true, but the game still awesome. "

												Torchlight II is a worthwhile loot-fueled adventure that will soak up hours of your day without you even noticing.Fantastically designed hack-n-slash RPG.Totally like that the companion pet can now buy potions and scrolls for you in addition to selling your junk, you can stay in the action indefinitely.Fans of the original will be overjoyed to find that most of what they loved is still here, with lots more of it....

												I bought first part at GoG and I've enjoyed it so I ware really happy when I won 2nd part at steamgifts platform.It is said that developers team have some people that ware part of Diablo 2 developing team. In some way this game shares many of the Diablo 2 advantages and disadvantages, the whole list would be:Advantages:+ large amount of pets to choose from+ a cartoonish, quite unique and beautiful world + pistols, rifles, cannons next to ""regular RPG gear""+ diablo 2 loot system+ large skill trees+ different skills, resistances of the monsters, each world is quite unique+ alchemy, similar to Diablo 2 Horadric cube+ not using myself, but cooperation multiplayer+ steam workshop+ achievements and trade cards+ low requirements (my Intel build-in card handled this game)+ multiplatform system support+ some soundtracks resemble Diablo 2 soundtracksDisadvantages:- Diablo 2 difficulty challenge, on higher difficulties normal monsters rather easy to beat, while ""big boys"" are ranging from almost impossible to impossible. Taking a bar for hours is not fun and if the monster happened to get regeneration perk it could become invincible.- sometimes player character doesn't exactly act as the player is expecting, going to wrong direction- diablo 2 quest system, successful but not very deep.

												First time I played this genre so if you read this: it will be critiqued on the game itself rather than compared to other sources ( like Diablo series )... BASE GAME:  is interesting for a couple of completions on single player with 2 classes maybe test out the other 2 classes then quit... unless grinding for gear is what one seeks- and this game is HEAVY with trash drops to sell to vendor... anyway story is cute and enough- nothing special just decent and predictible so don't play this for the story unless this is the kind of story prefered. It should be noted that one completion of story stops at level 50 before recycling into New Game Plus levels beyond. Diffculty available to choose as they feel: Way too easy- Too easy- Easy- Tough with some OHKOs against user. At the highest levels- Veteran (the one I said felt easy at first) feels more fair since OHKOs don't seem to be a threat. Early in game: Elite feels more fair- until level 80+ when the damage received makes one feel that Enginners are best. Perhaps the biggest problem is that the game never does ephasize how important ""damage reduction"" really is... at level 120 ( Elite ) it becomes tragic if one ( easily ) misses out on farming the ""Eyes of Grell"" or ""Skulls of Limony""- don't forget to find the enchanter who sells sockets... in the mapworks... who MAY randomly spawn in some dungeons. Equipment will work against mobs... not good defense against level 120 Elite bosses- unless one has found ""Boris"" the enchanter who ( randomly ) sells big bonuses into user's gear that helps to max DEXTERITY and VITALITY to get a max of 75% block ( need shield ) and 75% dodge chance... don't forget a couple of special skulls that give 25% missile-deflect chance and a shield that also carries some of that as well... if using an Enginneer- Forcefield is an OP wonder that becomes a necessity- at that level... But none of that really matters- if playing on Veteran or lower- perhaps Elite without going beyond New Game Plus 3... If diffculty and balance are fine: Content becomes the next topic; Tarroch's Tomb only found on New Game Pluses and not availble in the Mapworks ( wish it was ) is the best dungeon ( maybe the only true waves of foe area )- otherwise after beating the story- the only option is to play Mapworks over and over... or farm for better gear- money- boosts. O = = = = = = = O = = = = = = = O If that's all this game was- I wouldn't be playing it that much- except... MODDED GAME: And this is where this game really shines: Synergies- Torchfun- Certain custom classes- Adventure Pack 2- and a soup of mods that help various aspects of this game ( it needs rebalancing for Elite ) or sometimes adds some really fun OP weapons ( Minigun Mod )... that can be fun to figure out how little power is needed to balance... Noddygineering or Brothers-in-arms if one wants some human partners that can wear gear... I mean just almost everything this game normally lacks is usually found among some mods... which do have a slew of problems between some of them- mainly not working well together ( that's another story )... If you manage to find the fun ones that work... they are worth it. However it is worth noting that games like Grim Dawn and Path of Exile will offer a far deeper experience than any Torchlight Mod can offer... nevertheless this is one game that has some impressive mods which will satisfy anyone who likes a decent hack, slash, and loot game.  O = = = = = = = O = = = = = = = O Ultimately I'm still playing this game after 2 years ago because of MODS... and I'm grateful to the modders who ( almost all who do this 'cause they like this game or modding and are students or have families and other work ) continue to make this fun and worthwhile for players like me... so a HUGE thank you to them and Runic for making this.

												A Diablo style RPG/Action game made by some of the creators of the games Diablo and Fate.  The music is also done by the guy that did the original Diablo music as well.  I am a huge fan of this game, because it is done so well.  It hardly misses the mark on anything and expands the genre very nicely.  Extremely tight action and controls with very few bugs and exceptional multiplayer make it go to one of my  favorites.  Everything has been expanded in the second one from the classes to the levels to the level of detail and if you have played the first one you can jump right in and be fine.  I am a big fan of Diablo 3 as well as this game, so you really can't go wrong with either of those choices.  Overall, if you are looking for a great multiplayer action rpg experience and don't mind not having very many cut scenes or a bioware style story to hold onto this one is very hard to beat.Graphics: 8/10 (Simple, but awesome)Animation: 10/10 (Buttery smooth, never lags ever.)Multiplayer: 10/10 (One of the best)Gameplay: 10/10 (Extremely tight and responds well)Story: 6/10 (Not going to win any awards, but your not playing this for the story)Fun Factor: 10/10 (Wait...what time is it?)Music: 9/10 (Very good and changes on the place or the mood of the area)Sounds: 7/10 (Not a lot of dialogue, but the various weapon sounds and creatures are all good.)Replayability: 9/10 (Has the right recipe to make you want to go back and play again.)Overall: 9/10 (One of the best on Steam, and even higher recommended if you have a couple friends to travel along the way with.)

												First of all I want to say that Torchlight II - great action-RPG, I would even say that it has surpassed its parent, Diablo III.Throughout the game, I had a feeling of euphoria, it's all due to a strong gameplay, beautiful picture, made ​​in the style of WoW, great mechanics of the game. The only thing that I was not really impressed - soundtrack. Playing co-op with friends (or strangers if you have no friends * foreveraloneface *) will bring you a lot of pleasure and fun, I checked it on myself. The only minus of the Torchlight II - no PvP mode. But there is one plus - Steam Workshop, it's really nice. In the end, I recommend this game to real fighters mouse and keyboard, for those who want to spend a fun time together with your friends by killing the tons of mobs and working as a team.			"

*Before beginning, I would like to give a special thanks to X Phantom for critiquing this review. 
Much can be said about the successes of dungeon crawling roleplaying games preceding the Diablo series. Torchlight, however, has lived up to, if not exceeded, the expectations of the genre has set throughout its creation over twenty years ago. What I call ‘colorful Diablo,’ Torchlight II is, as stated, a dungeon crawling roleplaying game set in a fantasy environment with various classes and subsequent styles of play. This title maintains a steampunk theme and a few fan-made overhauls may alter simple displays such as the health meter, but may range to altering the system entirely. I have played this title solo, with friends, and online-though this final occurrence can be rare due to the lack of an overall online community-and can honestly declare that any group size is adequate for play.Here are just a few things that I found of interest in this title:Multiplayer - Though Torchlight II can be played solo, the experience is enhanced greatly through cooperative play; the genre typically requires such. This title allows the player to create sessions for friends or strangers to play online or on a local network. A staple for dungeon crawlers can be seen in this game as enemy mobs become increasingly difficult with each additional player added, which also escalates the amount of loot acquired as well as the rarity of said items. As always, cooperation is key since monsters throughout the overworld become more powerful, adding to the play value of Torchlight II. In summary: garb your friends, or I will gladly play with you if your friends do not own this game.Gameplay - Torchlight II’s combat system is quite simple: click to move and attack, with the Number keys serving as a layout for implementable items and abilities. Other keys can be utilized for certain actions-such as holding down Shift to remain still while attacking-but the core combat retains the simplistic style of the classics. As players gain levels by instilling the ‘f*** up everything in sight’ clause, they gain attribute points which passively improve specific aspects of the character such as Strength and Defense statistics, as well as upgrades to level-specific skills such as the Engineer’s Spider Mines. New items in the form of loot can be obtained from defeated enemies. Said items add to character customization as well as developing a build in which players can utilize their own set of tactics within the game’s limits. The system is actually quite intricate with bonuses influencing the various class skills. Simple fishing holes are also scattered throughout each area, which grant another mini-game and new items to the players.Map Layout - Each area the player treks to has its own theme and general appearance. For example, you can expect the Blightbogs to assume a marshy look and contain enemies that are apparent to the given scene. These settings have simple background pieces that add to the landscape without distracting the players from combat and exploration, while the map itself is entirely nonsymmetrical-this presents a more realistic stage. Quests typical face the player across the massive span of each set-piece; I have found this to be quite entertaining seeing as though I, myself, tend to explore every inch of the map regardless. Secrets such as golden chests-requiring the defeat of a monster with the designated key to open-as well as mysterious portals to bonus stages are strewn throughout the world.TL:DR - I had wanted to mention several other functions of Torchlight II such as its dedicated Steam Workshop contributors and fluid graphics style. I have seen that, as a collective opinion by many of its players, this is one of the few games in which the story is disregarded, yet the game itself is highly enjoyable beyond its writing. I would highly recommend Torchlight II to anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers and roleplaying game character building because this game is just more Diable, and there’s nothing wrong with that.

												Good stuff.  I haven't played Diablo III so I can't compare, but Torchlight II has the loot grind you would expect coupled with a pleasantly candy-colored, WoW-esque esthetic.  I played as the steampunk engineer, which was enjoyable if a wee bit lackluster.  The story is pretty much nonexistent, so don't expect one--just come for the loot and the leveling (both of which are a little slow in coming for my taste).			"

												My english may be not best so beware . Anyway Torchlight II is such great game and probably one of best hack n slash around ( we cant forget about Diablo II , Diablo III , Loki , Torchlight I , Legend : Hand of God.So lets start : This game is continuation of first part .Now our objective is to defeat Alchemist ( protagonist of previous game). In this wonderful game we have 4 unique classes : Berserker ( aka mobile blender ) , Outlander , Embermage (aka Jedi ) and finally Engineer.Thing that is worth to remember is for sure GREAT soundtrack .Next is amazing sets , possibility of having pet ( many to choose ) , great co - op , few difficulty levels , 123 achievments wich arent that hard . Many cool bosses and quests and of course endgame thing - mapworks . About price its fairly good but I reccomend buing it on sale or other shops as rhino keyes  , GMG .Buy it I highly reccomend this wonderful masterpiece .			"

I love this feature! If I don't have internet, it doesn't matter, I can still enjoy the game and level up my character)-Multiplayer (The multiplayer is GREAT with friends, or even by yourself, very cool)-Different map designs-Pets (You actually bond with your pet on a personal, real life experience, I know that's weird, but its kinda cool)Con's-There isn't really any con's in this game, all I can really think of is that after a while, it gets a little repetetive, but not very.

												This is gonna get complicated. Ok, let's get this out of the way: the game is quite good. I've played 75 hours, Steam tells me, and I did enjoy them - at least modded. Unmodded, the record would probably be more like 6. There are some great mods that hugely improve what's already a solid base. The reasons I can't recommend it, though, are complex.First off, it's the feel. I do not like the game's aesthetic. It's very cartoonish and detracts from the feel I'd want. The story is forgettable at best, a confusing afterthought with no thought put into it whatsoever at worst, which I suppose you could expect from an ARPG, but... why? It's a spiritual successor to Diablo, right? Diablo 2 especially had a really interesting story. The setting was great, with Good and Evil both presented as Bad, some cool ideas and history, and even genuine characters! With personality! It was also very good-looking for the time, with a dark, interesting aesthetic, rather than the goofy one here that I personally dislike. Admittedly, that's a matter of taste, but this isn't meant to be objective. And the characters are just... nonexistant. The most interesting thing about the setting are a race that's left their bodies behind and are now just animated suits of armor, basically. Which are never really explored anyway.Modded, though, I'd say it's worth the price except for one thing: the existence of Path of Exile.In a vacuum? Sure, it's fun. $20 of fun, especially if you're looking for a time sink. Compared to Diablo 3? Yeah, certainly buy this. Compared to Path of Exile, which is free, incredibly innovative, gorgeous, dark, actually has an interesting story, and is simply more fun (in my opinion)? Why bother?And, frankly, even today I'd call it as much fun as Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction at best, at least if you care much about story, atmosphere, or aesthetic. If you don't, and just want gameplay and can seriously ignore all that, go for it. If you do, well there's Path of Exile, or... so how much is Diablo 2: LoD now?It should also be mentioned I rather resent the game because I preordered it due to the promise of the toolset, GUTS, being made available ""soon"" (and even, in one instance, ""very soon"") after release. Not relevent to you, dear reader, but it was not. And so my high-fallutin' plans fell to ruin as interest waned, until by the time it was released I was sitting by myself, eating ice cream, sobbing, and plotting my revenge. In addition, it requires you to make a Runic games account to use the online service. Not a huge deal, but the principle of the thing bugs me as it wasn't disclosed. So those are my biases against it. Grain of salt and all that. Hope it helped.			"

Why should you care?And then it dawned on you, whispering the answer as if in adaze. ""The gameplay."" Summer-Rain looks at you, thinkingher boyfriend now a mindless vegetable and she might needto knock on Runic Software's doors with her family sword.""I'm sorry...?""You look up at her as if you received divine revelation.""Summer... the game works on Souls logic. The gameplay,visual style and enemy variety will hold the player's attentionindefinitely, even if the story is told through the occassionalcutscene, sparse notes you read and the even rarer characterinteraction which is voiced... somewhat."" Summer-Rain heavesa sigh of relief and smiles a bit, putting her hands on her hipsand giving you another exasperated look.""What am I gonna do with you, Starboy...""You look at Torchlight II running, before you quit to the mainmenu. Summer-Rain looks on at what you are doing, beforeyou realize something that should have been a deal-breakerwith Torchlight II. ""Damn it, Summer. This game is good...but you're right. It should be a casual Diablo- no, it IS a casualDiablo."" You turn to Summer-Rain, who looks at you with aquizzical look, not knowing what point you are trying to make.""It's a very good game... visually brilliant, tight controls andexcellent variety from character design, loot and items, pets,spells, progression tree and enemy types... but you're right.The story is a bit lacking, even though it tries to be vagueand it can technically function without one."" You get up fromyour chair and stretch as you prepare to switch off the PC.""But the fact you have to create another 3rd-party accountdespite it being on Steam is pretty much a bummer for anARPG."" Summer-Rain scrunches her face, clearly disgustedby the practice of unneccessary DRM. ""Did the first Torchlighthave DRM like that?"" She asks. You look back at her as yougrab your towel.""No, Summer. The first Torchlight is on GOG, even."" Her jawdrops, as your give a few nods with a look of disappointment.She looks at the now-turned-off computer. ""Would you stillrecommend it to people though, Starboy?"" You nod back.""Yeah. A good game is a good game, you know. Peopleshould try it at least before anything."" Summer-Rain's mouthcurls slightly into a sly smirk. ""I tried it and didn't enjoy it...you did and I didn't see my boyfriend in class for a day andhe missed his lunch date with me."" She pouts.""Gimme 10 minutes. I'm going to take you to dinner to makeit up to you."" Summer-Rain rolls her eyes and shoves past you, stealing your towel as you struggle to run past her. ""5 minutes for you, Starboy- and I think that's more thangenerous!"" She smiles mischievously, before sticking hertongue at you.""Summer!""TORCHLIGHT II. "

												I loved Diablo I and II (Diablo III was quite the disappointment after a 10 year wait) so, naturally, I loved Torchlight. Great dungeon crawler and a great RPG. Fun to play lan with friends, although it can be a little tricky setting up.			"

												Runic Games, the developers behind the epic RPG Diablo 2 and it shows. Everything in Torchlight II feels like a Diablo game and that's a good thing.This is a game I spent hundreds of hours playing non-stop. One of the things I like in this game is the ability to create your own custom character. You can mix and match skills, stats, spells and weapons and gears to create your own unique character.Playing in drop-in-drop-out multiplayer is fun and it's more fun to school everyone with your unique character. Though the lobby is not quite as crowded as before you won't have any problems looking for someone to play with.You won't be disappointed with this game, a truly amazing game. A must have!			"

												Torchlight II was a game I passed over for like a year until this recent Steam Sale.  I remember the old days of Diablo II and this game very much reminds me of that gameplay.  Torchlight II adds a few new things such as fishing activities and pets (which you can send back to town to sell things for you and other things as well)  With the updated graphics (compared to Diablo II days of gaming, newer games as far as graphics go it holds it own but has a ""Cartoon"" look to it.) Install size is small and system demands are on the lower side.  If you like dungeon crawling/RPG style games and can pick this up for a good price, I would say give it a go, I am really enjoying it myself.			"

  Torchlight II vs Diablo review Nope, you know what? We're not going to go about reviewing this game that way - not because they're not comparable or not in the same genre, but because it's like pitting apples vs oranges, or Star Trek vs Star Wars.  Just because two games, shows, or fruits share a few features doesn't mean you can really place one over the other.So, where to begin...Torchlight II offers so, so much to fans of classic dungeon crawler ARPG's.  It offers 4 dynamic classes with 3 skill trees which allow you to mix and match skills at will; attribute points for stats that are all useful to every character in their own way; secret rooms usually accessed through puzzles; epic boss battles; gigantic world chests that require a key that drops from a specific mob; portals to other dimensions filled with loot; both shared and personal stashes; and - last but not least - pets. Pets are a really unique addition to Torchlight II that satisfy the loot hoarder in each of us.  While out adventuring, your pet will carry all of your unwanted loot back to town.  In addition to this, they will assist you in battle, cast spells, and go shopping for basic supplies.  No feeding necessary!Something else that's both unique and awesome about this game is its mod-friendly attitude.  It offers a very helpful mod kit for any who are interested in expanding Torchlight II's horizons, and actively supports said mods with online play.Speaking of online play, Torchlight II is an  excellent  game to play with your friends!  Don't forget, if you guys are playing a modded version of the game you HAVE to not only be subscribed to the same mods but have the mods in the same load order as well.Torchlight II is fantastic to play solo.  Nearly all of my 200+ hours in this game have been spent alone, tearing through the wilderness of Torchlight.  From level 1 to level 100, gameplay is fresh and challenging.  Difficulty can be changed as needed between 4 difficulty settings, and hardcore characters are an option.Before I end this review, I must add that the music is FANTASTIC.  It is by far some of the best music I've heard from an ARPG's OST.  Even if you decide not to purchase the game, definitely visit YouTube and give its music a listen - although, it is definitely better when experienced in the settings meant for it ;)			"

												The sequel to the game that brought back Hack 'n' Slash, or so I seem to believe. This genre was pretty much dead until the first Torchlight came out. If Torchlight I would have been released as the same time as AAA Hack 'n' Slash, it would never have gotten any attention and there might not have been a Torchligh II. Torchlight I was just an indie, but the lack of any other Hack 'n' Slash led people to praise the game a lot. Rightfully so, original Torchlight was a very unique game while maintaining the atmosphere from Diablo 2. Torchlight II very much picks up from there, it's a sequel that does everything right. Torchlight II is much bigger, has more characters, more loot, more enemies, more levels, more more more. The game also looks a lot better than the original, but has the same art-style to it, that keeps that atmosphere that made the original great. The armosphere will remind you a lot of Diablo 2, since some of the guys who made Lord of Destruction have been working on the Torchlight games. While the art-style is a new thing to the Torchlight games, the music and ambient sounds is what makes this game so similar to Diablo 2.One of the more important additions to Torchlight II was Co-op, which the fans were just screaming for. These type of games are best enjoyed with a cold glass of co-op to be honest, and the original Torchlight suffered from the lack of it. Up to 6 players can now join together and hack and slash together, gather loot, trade items and win epic boss fights. You have 4 classes to choose from instead of 3 from the original Torchlight; Embermage, Berserker, Outlander and Engineer. The Embermage is obviously a mage, the Berserker delivers fast melee combat, the Outlander is range and the Engineer is melee with a lot of damage output - but not as fast as Berserker.Thanks to the already interested fans of the series, the game did surprisingly well even though released just a few months after Blizzard's Diablo III. If the original game didn't do so well, this game would have had really hard to survive. The player base for Torchlight II has stayed strong for long and not until now it starts to disperse. Not sure what Runic Games are doing at the moment, but I am guessing that additional content will be added. A few minor updates have been released since launch, including Steam Workshop support for user-created mods. I would be really surprised if they didn't make a big Expansion Pack for it, considering how well it has sold.Personally I played through the game, not once, not twice but three times for a NG++ and a level 100 Embermage. I just could not stop, it was endless amount of fun, and I wish to return soon, maybe if there is new content. One of the few games that I completed, and so fast too. I am not a huge hack 'n' slash fan either I never enjoyed Diablo 2 for example.I highly recommend picking this up, alone or with friends - does not matter. This game is amazing! "

												torchlight II is the spiritual successor to honey boo boo's redneck racing, the popular action rpg classic for the snes. the story takes place thirty years before hbbrr with honey boo boo's mom making her way through hell to bargain with satan over the last big mac. however, something goes wrong and honey boo boo's mom ends up losing all of her powers at the beginning of the game like a dingus. for the rest of the game you play as lil' bill cosby as he fights his way through the armies of hell in a turn-based strategetic rpg like the first fallout game. i highly reccomend it for fans of maplestory and ride to hell: retribution.

												For £2 ( <3 Steam Sales) I have over 200 hours of gameplay. Absolute Bargain. Great Design for enemies, 4 Unique Classes (with differing skill trees to add further diversity), NG+ features, hard but fair difficulty level, and an amazing endgame dungeon that actually gives good rewards for fighting Super Bosses. Only real complaints is that the story is uninspired and flat, and most quests really just end up having the same method of completion (enter dungeon, loot everything, kill everything etc) except for one or two. Best part though? Full mod support. Buy if all this tickles your fancy.			"

												I'm playing 'blind' with the Synergies Mod (because I read so many good things) so my review is based on the game with that mod, as I've not actually played the Vanilla version.After playing the original Torchlight and hating it due to a massive number of design flaws, I wasn't expecting much for this game. But I am really impressed at the changes made. All of the problems the first game suffered with have now been fixed, and it's a really enjoyable experience.PROS- Fun as heck- Glorious loot!- Levelling system is simple but interesting- Nice and bright (why are ppl complaining about this? It isn't Diablo 3!)NEUTRAL- Combat is repetitive, but I haven't found this ruins the game- Thanks to RNGesus, you sometimes get better loot at the start, and the 'special' loot winds up worthless- Would be nice if your pet had a bit more storageCONS- Sometimes during a mob you CANNOT see your mouse pointer and/or character- Difficulty is weird. It can be too easy and then BAM. You randomly insta-die (RNGesus again?).- The game doesn't pause on inventory or levelling screens (note: I have a sneaky feeling this is the Synergies Mod, I don't know if the Vanilla version does this)Anyway, it's fun. I got it on sale for like £2 during a Humble sale, and honestly I probably would've paid full price for it.			"

												I won't lie; it took me a bit of time to actually get into Torchlight II; I didn't feel like it had a hugely compelling start to the game, the art style felt a little unpolished, the combat seemed a bit dull.  Nothing really jumped out at me, even for 11 levels of gameplay.Imagine my surprise when I actually upped the difficulty from Normal to Veteran, and installed the Synergies Mod.  Now, it's tough to put down!Torchlight II comes highly recommended.  The game itself is really pretty solid, and once you up the difficulty, the gameplay actually becomes compelling and fun.  You'll be on the edge of your seat when the fights get tougher and tougher, and it feels more rewarding.One downside is that the devs seem to have called ""mission accomplished"" on the game and left to start their next project.  Support it, therefore, nearly non-existent.  Fortunately, they released the GUTS tool, which allows modders a great deal of control over the game.  Synergies is one such game that has taken it to a whole new level.  With a total conversion that alters over 16,000 files, adds 3 classes, a new city, and tons of end-game content, it really shows that this game will have great longevity and replay value through the Workshop alone.Pick it up cheap, set it to Veteran or higher, and start playing around with some mods.  You'll rapidly get your money's worth, and then some.			"

												If you like Diablo style games, then you will love the Torchlight franchise.The game play is sound. The mechanics work well and are very well polished throughout.I cannot recall ever having a crash in this game. It's the most stable game I think I have ever played.The only dislike I have is the fact that the danger elements of enchanting items has been removed, so there is no risk anymore. The risk in the first game made enchanting a real gamble, which made it far more satisfying.			"

An incredibly simplistic Diablo-esque ARPG with Steam Workshop support to possibly enhance replayability.Before starting the game you're given the option to start the vanilla version and the Workshop supported version. You can move your vanilla character to the Workshop version however the character you save your progress with Workshop mods on will no longer be allowed back to the vanilla game.The game's difficulties range from Casual, Normal, Veteran, & Elite where the differences in these are that the gold drops are lower and enemy damage & health are increased the higher the setting. In Elite mode the game doesn't just feel harder, it feels like more like an endurance because I found myself constantly having to hit, run, heal, hit, run, heal, and repeat wasting more time than I should be wasting if I was on Veteran because everything on Elite can kill you in a flash and it doesn't help that the baddies take a hell of a lot longer to kill because of the artificial difficulty of increased baddie HP.There's a an option to check whether or not you want to activate ""Hardcore"" mode for the rest of a character's playthrough where all it means is that one death means you can't play that character anymore so this is really for those who like to be more pressured into being careful to stay alive.Unlike the first game you now have a choice of 4 classes however the previous classes have been removed though they all use similar & new equipment as the first. Each class has a handful amount of unique skills but I've found that I was really only putting points in an incredibly low amount of them all the way up to the end-game & max level, 100, leaving probably 80% of the skills without even a single point placed. Though effective this leaves the combat to show how simplistic its action is which all-in-all is just hit, run, & maybe heal. No matter how fancy the skills you've put the points on it's still just run, attack, run, and possibly heal up with a potion or a spell so should heavy damage be taken. You can only ""respec"" the last 3 skills you've placed points on so you can do a small bit of testing to find out what suits your preference.The controls for the game are typical isometric ARPG style with the all too likely-to-become problematic mouse-to-move and extensively rebindable keys with the exception of the mouse buttons being unrebindable. I found that the mouse controls can often be wonky; when I try to move to the opposite side of a crowd of baddies to get away from them for some reason the character would sometimes move to them and attack instead despite the mouse being nowhere near them. During critical situations it becomes an incredible nuisance.Though very diverse in skins, models, & sounds almost all enemy attacks are similar to one another so I found that fighting just became repetitive with the exception of having some new skills to toy with but still overall becomes the same hit & run rule in combat. Even the bosses are fought the same and the way they fight you feel hardly any different from mob attacks.The environment as well are very limited in variety. The general idea of different types of environment aside from the scenery with some different turns and slight elevations are ""don't walk on this right now or you'll get hurt"", some levers or switches you have to activate to progress the game, and putting items in environmental sockets to again further progress.Normally when anything dies in a map they stay dead. When setting your game to an ""internet"" session you can ""reset"" the entire world so everything can be killed again. Even all the treasure chests will be up for another round of loot.The multiplayer's functional & pretty basic; go to the lobby, make or join someone's session, and you just play from there either helping one another or doing your own things. Each person in a multiplayer session sees & gets their own loot from drops so there won't really be any stealing of items. If you and some other people have the exact same mods and sometimes load order of mods you can play the modded game with those people.Despite all its ""problems"" and for what it is the game works and does pretty well at what it tries to be even if there's not a whole lot new or special when compared to many other ARPGs like this. It can be good fun to just isometrically dungeon crawl seemingly killing endlessly especially with someone you know but because it lacks special things it can start to be incredibly tedious & repetitive incredibly fast where your only possible source of replayability is likely trying out the different classes, workshop mods, and/or the multiplayer.

												Do you like Diablo?  Do you like multi-player?  Hell, do you like good games?  If you said yes to any of those, then this game is for you.  Torchlight II accomplished everything a sequel should:  it took the original game and made it better in every way possible.  The length of the game, the locations, the story, the combat, the music, etc.  Everything is better in this phenomenal sequel.  Torchlight II is an action/ adventure RPG much like an offline MMO.  Your character levels, you choose talent traits, and you grow in abilities.  This game has figured out everything that was important and mastered them.  I had a blast playing Torchlight II both single player and with friends.  I would give this game a 9/10.			"

												Played on Linux. Stability, not so good. I had to disable a lot of eye candy for the game to not crash in certain areas. Even with graphics set to low there was the occational crash, but it happened for my friends playing on Windows too. Although this is very similar to games like Diablo, it reminds me more of the olden goldie Gauntlet more than anything else. You hack and shoot your way through hordes of lesser enemies and take on stronger bosses. In the process you get loot, XP and fame.The big gripe I have is a common misconception many RPG-type game developers seem to share, that game hours are more important than game content. Levelling up takes too much time. These are not quality game hours of exploring the world or different skill builds, it's boring grinding. The rigid reskilling/reallocation of XP/fame discourages experminenting with builds and the task of levelling up 10-12 characters to level 50 is unappealing, leaving you playing a fraction of the game content (skill trees) the developers put in there. What a waste.			"

												Torchlight II's story follows the events of the first game, although those who come into the game without playing the original will not be missing much. Players create their own hero from one of four new classes, and are tasked with preventing one of the original heroes, who has been corrupted, from bringing ruin to the world. The story serves its purpose of giving players a reason to head off for the next quest goal but for the most part is pretty negligible, with the exception of a few rare quests of interest.The options for character creation are expanded from the original; there are now four classes and each class has options for its gender, hair, and face. Pets also make a return, with a number of new creatures added. The pets are welcome companions, assisting the player by participating in combat, learning spells, being able to summon minions of their own, and even travelling back to town to sell loot and buy potions so the player doesn't have to.Basic gameplay follows the template used by other isometric and top-down action RPGs. Players move using the left mouse buttons and click on enemies to attack. There are a wide number of skills and spells available, with numerous ways to activate them through various hotkeys and on-screen icons. The game allows for a lot of variety in builds and play styles, with each level up providing points to add to attributes and to upgrade and learn skills. Also provided is a lot of variety in equipment with no class restrictions, with the exception of some unique loot, although a number of skills require a certain weapon type. Loot in the game is plentiful, but fortunately the game makes it very easy to compare picked up loot with that currently equipped and to switch it into the pet's inventory so it can be quickly sold. There will always be the occasional pause midway through a dungeon to conduct some inventory management, however, outside of these pauses the pacing is quick and keeps the action going at an engaging level.The dungeons are randomly generated in terms of overall layout, but specific areas like boss arenas are preset. This means that when playing multiplayer or a new game plus, it isn't a matter of simply retreading old routes, and the highly enjoyable exploration experience that the dungeons provide is always there. There is always a danger of such generated dungeons becoming generic and repetitive but it is pleasing to report that the danger has been negated as well as could be hoped for. A number of tougher enemies and special challenge zones litter Torchlight II's areas, providing fairly regular breaks from the usual fodder (who can still pack a punch if players aren't paying attention) and making sure things don't get too repetitive. The player character can become briefly stuck in a crowd that's difficult to maneuver out of, but these situations are rare and typically caused by charging in too wildly rather than through any fault of the game.With the exception of Hardcore mode, where death is permanent, players can respawn without too much consequence. A percentage of gold can be paid in order for the deceased character to reappear either where they died or at the map entrance. Alternatively they can respawn back in town for free. There are four difficulty options to choose from plus a toggle for the aforementioned Hardcore mode. The Normal difficulty is a decent, but not especially challenging, level for newcomers, so experienced Torchlight players will likely want to jump immediately into Veteran.Difficulty in multiplayer is handled well, with monsters increasing in toughness depending on the number of players. While it's certainly not necessarily to enjoy what Torchlight II has to offer, there can be no denying the enjoyment of playing the game with others and it adds a more than welcome dimension to the game. Those afraid of having their loot taken by comrades need not fear, as players get their own sets of loot visible only to them. There is plenty of postgame content for players to sink their teeth into after completing the twenty hour or so main campaign, either by tackling one of the main postgame dungeons or by starting a new game plus, which keeps the player's progress but levels up all the opponents to match. New game plus might disappoint some, as it isn't possible to notch up the difficulty, so those hoping for a greater challenge in the main story will need to start a new character. The game has also been created with the modding community in mind, so even if Runic's postgame options run out there will likely be plenty of fan-made offerings.Visually the game looks great, even on less powerful computers, and for the most part runs very smoothly. The art style is great, the environments are all nicely varied, and the UI is clear and easy to use. Even when hidden behind terrain, it's easy to see where the character is and to click on enemies thanks to a coloured outline that appears for any combatant potentially obscured. Spells and skills are all beautifully animated, and it's incredibly satisfying to see enemies explode upon being finished off with a critical hit. Voice acting is generally rare, but it doesn't feel like the game is missing much without it. The key quest givers and few animated cutscenes are voiced, and it's functional for getting the next task across, but there's not enough of it to have any major effect and can be easily ignored without anything being missed.For me Torchlight II was an immensely enjoyable experience from start to finish. The game is more than welcoming for both fans of the original and newcomers to the series and is high amongst the better gaming experiences I've had this year. It might not bring anything particularly new to the genre, but those who choose to pick it up will be provided with superb value for their money.Highly Recommended "

There is a nice art style to the game that's quite similar to World of Warcraft. There are plenty of enemies to slaughter and looks great when gibbed. As you would expect this game is full of loot to gather, sell or hoard. When on quests you are not alone, you have a choice of pet companions upon character creation, amongst them a headcrab from Half-Life... a headcrab!

TL;DRA great sequel to a classic hack'n'slash game.+ Lots of replay value (New Game plus, maps, mods, etc.)+ Classes (they might take a bit to get used to)+ Graphics+ Setting+ Exploration+ Loot+ Soundtrack+ Multiplayer- Repetitiveness (you don't say?:P)- Some skills are vastly inferior to others- This game is a time thiefREVIEWTorchlight II is a sequel to a classic hack'n'slash game developed by Runic Games. If you have played the original Torchlight, you know what to expect. For those of you who have not, the game is all about exploring, slaying, looting, and levelling.The story is pretty straight-forward: the world is threatened by the Alchemist and, oddly enough, the world needs a hero. You are the aforementioned saviour of the land of Torchlight. Quests require you to go to a certain location, get rid of monsters, grab a certain item, etc. A tried and true formula. The setting is an uncommon mix of medieval-influenced fantasy world (magic and melee weapons) and steampunk (firearms). Like in the original, a player can choose a pet to travel along. What also makes the game stand out is marvellous graphics which does not seem to age. It also has low system requirements. There are four classes in this game: Embermage, Berserker, Outlander, and Engineer. They are not as conventional as they are in the original (the classic trinity: warrior, sorcerer, and rogue) and may take a while to get used to. For instance, Berserker is great at dual-wielding, but, unlike melee-focused classes in most games, has low health. Nevertheless, they are well-designed and support a variety of playstyles. Interestingly enough, every class can learn up to four spells, so should anyone fancy, they can summon skeletons, cast fireballs, etc. while playing as any class. Some skills are clearly better than others, but I believe that most builds are viable.

												If you like crawlers if game might be one for you.Smashing through mobs,enjoying a challenge, lovely environments,great boss fight ,armor/weapon sets,lots of loot,powerful mod tools ,and offline/online co-op make this game a great crawler choice.It comes with all the standard dungeon crawler trimmings so you will be more than full.The game has lots of graphic options,key binding controls, and built in multi-screen support. You can play this game well enough on a laptop with an intergrated card or on a beefy desktop machine.Some have claimed they got it to run on their tablets as well.There are 4 classes each that are non traditional but play like hybrids of traditional classes melded together.Engie (Paladin/Warrior/bot summoner) ,Outlander(Gunslinger/Ninja), Beserker(Crazed Monk/Beastman),& Embermage (Element Assault/Support) sorry no dedicated healers in this game.You are free to pick and choose what skills(active and/or passive) you will use.Six player is the default online max,but mods can increase this.The game itself has an overworld and dungeons littered throughout it.Throughout it you will find tons of loot,mobs,champion enemies,bosses,traps,and hidden secrets to find. The presentation for the areas are well done and add to making your travels more enjoyable.You have a pet in game that has basic attacks,can be used to buy/sell things for you while you battle on.The story of the game countines from a small time after the ending of events in Torchlight 1 but you do not need to know anything of the story to get into Torchlight 2. The ending of torchlight 1 makes up the story of whats happening in TL2 which you will be told.The story is interesting enough if you wish to follow it , but not required to play through the game like most crawlers.A warning though, the online portion in this game can be either great or a bit laggy. This I believe due to the lack of dedicated server hosting.The game has a ingame lobby which is held on a dedicated server,but hosted games are pc to pc.So make sure whomever hosts has a good connection			"

												I originally got this game when I was fed up with Diablo 3 back in the day, but it's a lot more than yet another hack&slash Diablo clone. If anything, it's closer to Diablo 2 than 3 but it really is a great original game in it's own right. The modding community is also very active, especially now that the game has workshop support.

												That feel when Prussia will never exist again :'^(Prussia was a great amazing place near Germany.

												Torchlight is a nice hack and slay game with nice graphics. Prepare yourself for bleeding fingers, since the gameplay is mouse-focused.It is amazing that this game was released somehow since it is full of copyright infringements when you compare it to Diablo2, especially campaign-wise. It is a lot better than D2 in many aspects though. I love the pet/inventory system, which is really comfortable. The fact that the map stays the same after you log on, but can be rerolled and the travel options are nice. The different gaming mods are graded well. I really appreciated the detail of cosmetic items and  monster spawns e.g. werewolves jumping from roofs or crawling out of cellars. The quest markers are useful, but quite confusing in outposts sometimes. The skill tree layout is bad and could be way more efficient if you knew what skill supports another without researching online. The story itself is way too short, and the option too repeat it a mio times for additonal achievements only stresses the lack of content. When you play it for the first time and do everything incl. dungeons and cleaning maps the leveling is perfect for the primary quests. You start your NG+ at 50 - no matter what level you are. When you do only the primaries in the NG+ the leveling is not graded, but pre-set, which is really annoying. Although the mapworks enable you to do several extra dungeons and areas it is unclear and you can't seem to trace which ones you have completed and which ones you haven't. Overall it is a nice game, but don't expect it to be very entertaining for more than a few weeks in single player. But I would always recomment to play it in multi-player anyway.			"

TL;DRA great sequel to a classic hack'n'slash game.+ Lots of replay value (New Game plus, maps, mods, etc.)+ Classes (they might take a bit to get used to)+ Graphics+ Setting+ Exploration+ Loot+ Soundtrack+ Multiplayer- Repetitiveness (you don't say?:P)- Some skills are vastly inferior to others- This game is a time thiefREVIEWTorchlight II is a sequel to a classic hack'n'slash game developed by Runic Games. If you have played the original Torchlight, you know what to expect. For those of you who have not, the game is all about exploring, slaying, looting, and levelling.The story is pretty straight-forward: the world is threatened by the Alchemist and, oddly enough, the world needs a hero. You are the aforementioned saviour of the land of Torchlight. Quests require you to go to a certain location, get rid of monsters, grab a certain item, etc. A tried and true formula. The setting is an uncommon mix of medieval-influenced fantasy world (magic and melee weapons) and steampunk (firearms). Like in the original, a player can choose a pet to travel along. What also makes the game stand out is marvellous graphics which does not seem to age. It also has low system requirements. There are four classes in this game: Embermage, Berserker, Outlander, and Engineer. They are not as conventional as they are in the original (the classic trinity: warrior, sorcerer, and rogue) and may take a while to get used to. For instance, Berserker is great at dual-wielding, but, unlike melee-focused classes in most games, has low health. Nevertheless, they are well-designed and support a variety of playstyles. Interestingly enough, every class can learn up to four spells, so should anyone fancy, they can summon skeletons, cast fireballs, etc. while playing as any class. Some skills are clearly better than others, but I believe that most builds are viable. Speaking of variety, there are tons of mods available online, including Steam Workshop.The only downsides are that the game is repetitive and steals time like nobody's business. But that is to be expected, right?To conclude, Torchlight II is a worthy sequel with lots of replay value. If you have played the original Torchlight or you just like eviscerating thousands of monsters, I strongly recommend getting this game. Don't forget to bring your friends along!P.S.

												Power gaming, multiple playthroughs, easy to learn (but difficult to master) game mechanics, and a solid CoOp option?  What isn't there to like about Torchlight II?  It's an improvement on the original in almost every way, is very reminiscent of the older dungeon crawlers (I found it reminded me of ""Darkstone"" a great deal), and it will keep you entertained for days if you'll let it.It is a little on the easy side, even when you crank the difficulty up, so individuals looking for a challenge may need to look elsewhere; but if you're looking for a good introduction to dungeon crawling, or a distraction from a more competitive game, then Torchlight II will surely fill that need.

This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Torchlight 2 skip to Results and read from there.Runic Games provides us with an invigorating spin to your standard RPG game with dynamic evolving dungeons. Unlike most AI managers Torchlight II doesn’t just update enemy spawns, but also creates new terrain with each experience.Story:Torchlight II takes place in a time far beyond the reign of Ordrak the daemon who caused dismay to the little town of Torchlight; yet, despite his fall the corruption he spread was not lost. An evil alchemist takes up his power and destroys the town of Torchlight as your quest begins to bring civility back to reality. You progress through the various worlds of the Torchlight universe from various towns in unique environments from mountains, desserts, tundra’s, and swamps. There is no end to the evil that Ordrak spirit has spread.Campaign:Torchlight II is separated into four Acts: Estherian Steppes, Mana Wastes, Grunnheim, and Broken Mines. Unlike in the first Torchlight the second offers multiple towns which provide unique experiences that help evolve the game. Each town offers unique merchants that evolve with the difficulty of the game providing better items and new elements to the mix. The campaign, depending on your play style, can easily last up to 30-hours. The game has a good difficulty curve which allows the game to readily scale to the player’s level. Plus by utilizing the randomly generated experience the game offers players can also out-level their environments if they feel like they the game is too difficult. Gameplay:Torchlight II expands on the original by providing four rather than three unique experiences: The Engineer, Outlander, Berserker, and Embermage. The Engineer is a melee class which utilizes heavy armor and has abilities to summon various support style minions. My main complication with the Engineer is that this task is clearly designed around being a support/tank role, but has not taunting abilities. This essentially makes team work relatively difficult as you cannot get your enemies to readily focus on you.The Outlander similar to the Vanquisher is a rained base class that utilizes mainly dexterity based building. This class offers trapping, dual wielding, and high speed attacks. The design of the outlander makes it great for kiting and boss fights, but relatively poor against swarms of enemies.The Beserker follows your typical fighting class by utilizing melee weapons with high speed combat and not being reliant on armor. The unique playstyle of the Beserker allows you to summon wolves to your aid, throw down with massive melee damage, and utilize frost and lightning buffers to enhance your combat. The beserker does great with live recovery items and high health units, but can easily get swarmed by low hit point units.Finally the Embermage, which as you can tell is a magic class champion. Focusing on mostly magic attributes the Embermage utilizes spellcasting to defeat their enemies. This is the only class I didn’t beat the game with, but from my understanding they are incredibly useful for supporting roles and are as strong as they are in mana. Mostly focusing on mana stealing items and mana pots this class fights at range and doesn’t do well in swarms. Sadly Torchlight II did not adjust the control mechanics that are utilized through Torchlight I. The champion is still controlled entirely by the users mouse. Moving the character and attaching are both controlled by holding the left click of the mouse, rather than moving with the keyboard and fighting with the mouse. On Melee classes this is fine, but on ranged classes more than not you run into battle because you click next to an enemy; because your champion ran into battle they are then killed and your kiting has failed.  Hints:>Make sure to get the spell that allows you to drop a town portal, drop this in every dungeon to make sure you do not have to fight your way back due to random generated dungeons.>Once a player leaves a dungeon there is approximately a 20-minute timer before regenerating, Meaning if you are in a dungeon that has multiple floors you may have to fight your way back through if you die closer to the end without a portal to get you back.>Playing as a group causes more enemies to spawn meaning playing with your friends doesn’t change the difficulty.>Make sure to put items on your pet. Your pet can hold two spells, two rings, and a necklace.  By putting in the proper sockets and maximizing your pet effectively can make for a great tank and an amazing support. >I found the best spells for your pet are “Frost” and “Heal All” this allows your pet to slow enemies and heal the team. >Send your pet back to town when you get the chance, this sells the items it is holding and heals it to full health.Results:I personally played Torchlight II before completing Torchlight I. This game provides a unique experience somewhere in between Diablo III and Spelunky. Through randomly generated dungeons and it’s combat experience Torchlight II is guaranteed to provide your typical RPG style player with an enjoyable dynamic experience; although the generated dungeons don’t provide much replay value with the same class they are just a touch unique enough to make playing each other class fun and original. Even though I purchased this game on sale I would still recommend it at full price.Pros:+Four unique classes that provide diversifying experiences through their unique playstyles and skill trees.+Multiplayer cooperative experience+Pets which provide benefit to the player as either a way to sell items, a some-what tank, or even a healer.+Two types of leveling for a character: Experience and Fame. Fame allows you to level only your abilities, while experience gives you five points to level your characters base stats and a point to level abilities.+Dynamic environment that evolves and changes each play through.+Fun bosses that offer interesting battles that vary based on swarming, spell dodging, terrain shifting, and time management. Cons:-Character controls that sadly cannot be adjusted. You must control your character with the mouse for both movement and combat, which causes a lot of times where you die due to poor controls rather than skill. -Random generated dungeons occur on time base rather than if the player quits. This means if you are in an areas sub-dungeon it is possible the first floor regenerates. Ultimately this means if you die you must start over again.-Fishing provides your pet with cool skin/ability changes, but typically is more cumbersome than it’s worth. Similar to the first Torchlight you just simply wait as a circle expands and retracts until it hits the middle for a fraction of a second where you must click the reel in button.			"

												Really awesome. Has a lot of replay-value because there are 4 separate classes that each have 3 skill trees, so picking a new build path is as simple as picking a new specialization. The world changes when you make a new character, so things will be in different places which is fun as well. I've only played Berserker and Outlander and so far they have been super fun. It never gets old slaying hordes and hordes on enemies in dungeons. Overall I reccomend this game because it has online multiplayer, a good player progression system and a decent storyline.			"

												It's the Recommend Master here ready to throw down some raw ♥♥♥ shit on a game we all know and love, Shitylight II.  Let me get straight to the point, the reviews, and critic scores for this game is lead by the illuminati. Do not buy into the belief. This game is riddled with bugs, broken frames, choppy cut scenes, and lack luster game play.My first 2,0034 hours of DOTA 2 gameplay lead me to realize that the ideas here are oddly simular, excuse my language, but if you are a fan of DOTA 2, wich you are, then I assume you are already acquinted with it's original unique style of gameplay uncopiable, potintally mind numbing, and seizure inducing, all this mixed together is what creates this natural high that we cannot get enough of, thus the reason behind our massive gameplay hours, I would not recomend ♥♥♥♥♥shit II to even my closer of homosexual friends, who'm I've sucked many ♥♥♥♥♥ with before, stay far away from this game like the plague just play Diablo instead.My final verdict is: piece of ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥ this game no number scale will ever evaluate my utmost rage and anger.

												What can I say? It's good. It feels like the actual spiritual successor to Diablo 2. It's easy to play but there's enough options and nuance that when your third Embermage kicks the bucket you can make a fourth one that plays wildly different than the last three. Item stats are very interesting, like pistols that call down meteors.The bad? Critical hits are just too extreme. Map randomization while good still only has about six run throughs before act 1 seems like the same old same old. There is just a passing effort to try and communicate the story.All in all Torchlight 2 has plenty of replay value and is definitely worth the $20.			"

Runic Games upped the stakes and 3 years after the release of the first game they came out with a more ambitious, more colourful, more varied and more enjoyable sequel.Whilst the game features the same gameplay-style as its predecessor, notable (and brand new) elements are the availability of multiplayer and the extended modding capabilities.Also, the four playable classes introduced in this episode are brand new and those present in the first game do not return. These classes offer the options to create several builds so fully getting to know the characteristics of a class requires multiple walkthroughs. Pets also return (but with more options) and instead of the retirement of our characters we have the newgame+ mode. Also, a hardcore mode for die-hard fanatics.Torchlight 2 is a must for Diablo fans. But do bear in mind that this is similar to Diablo 2 and not to its latest installment.			"

												5/5 stars. They basically took everuthing from the first game, added an overworld, elaborated on skills, enhanced enchatments, boilstered quests with appropriate rewards. considering the gem socket upgrades and such its very reminiscent of diablo I and II. highly recommended.			"

												This is an absolutely excellent game. It's the kind of game that I can sit down and play for hours at a time, or leave and come back to with no problem.  I absolutely recomend this game to anybody who is interested.  Great for playing alone, or if you have people to join you. It's all awesome.			"

												Challenging game for everyone. Honestly the game is so much better with mods than without it. Sometimes the multiplayer didn`t work which annoyed me but can be a problem from myself. The elite mode is damn good for hardcoreplayers like me. People say Diablo is so much better cuz of graphics but in my opinion the gameplay is very simultaneously and I like both. Definetly a game to play with friends and to explore awesome mods and new classes. The achievements are great and doable after all. It just need a lot of time.			"

												If you've played Diablo 3, maybe the level of detail in Torchlight 2 might seem a bit disappointing. However, this wasn't made by Blizzard. The gameplay is very much engaging. A game that sure is worth your time (as I'm guessing a couple of thousand people who reviewed this as overwhelmingly positive would agree). Introduction of more classes would surely help in making it innovative and the story good as it is, can be more elaborate. Nevertheless, this game is a lot of fun and certainly would be one I'd recommend.			"

												This is top down action role playing at its best.  Its what D3 should of been.  There are 4 classes (more with mods) that are pretty fun to play, and you can play them in various ways.  There is not alot of restrictions on the classes and what they can use.  Each one has 3 skill trees, which you can use any tree as long as your the at the level requirement for it, your not restricted to 1 tree, you can put points anywhere.  The item drops are fun, you get plenty of rare items.  Story, I never follow the story line so I cant comment on that (same for all games).  End Game is either playing through the game again with monsters leveled up, or using maps in the Mapworks.   Maps you can purchase at a vendor and they all have stats, like +% Fire Damage, +% More Gold, and/or +% Damage for Monsters.  I've only played an Embermage lvl 100 NG++, and a 56 Beserker.9/10			"

												Alright so, this game has many pros and 1 con.Check it out:Nice story, one of the playable classes in the first game has turned into the main villian of this game. What a twist. And the general story of this one is pretty interesting.Nice gameplay, Instead of having a few infinite boring dungeons like the first one, this game offers an open world feel where you come across dungeons here and there. Really nice. The vanilla version offers 4 creative classes that you can play in many ways. A LOT of loot to collect and everything is just fun. AND this one has multiplayer where you can get kicked from games by people who don't speak English! I bet you're convinced now. But if the game itself doesn't satisfy you, there are countless of mods through workshop! Nice graphics, looks better than the first one and kind of gives a World of Warcraft art feel. I like it and you don't need an amazing system to run it. If my flea market 50 dollar can run this pretty much lag free, I'm pretty sure you guys can run it.What else is there to cover? Pretty much everything is great about it, one of my favorite dungeon crawlers.oh yeah, the con: 4 of the achievements are unachieveable, they're broken. Runic knows this and refuses to remove them purposely. IN FACT, they are using these broken achievements as a marketing tool. During one of the steam sales they changed the name of these achievements to ""Queued for Removal"" to draw in the completionist to buy this game. But right after the sale ended, you want to know what happened? They changed the name of the achievements right back to ""Unachieveable"". They could easily remove these achievements no problem. Damn you Runic and your..and your gay parties.But yeah that's about it, besides Runic being butt munches, this game is perfect and I'd recommend buying it.TL;DR: GG			"

												All the fun of Diablo 3, but with better lighting, and it's easier on the computer too!The Torchlight franchise is unashamedly a Diablo clone, but, in many ways, it manages to improve on the original; the characters are a bit more flexible, the setting isn't quite so grim and dark, and the pet mechanic (improved and expanded in Torchlight 2) is a workable answer to what to do with all the low level junk you find while diving headlong into another dungeon.

												I'm done with you, Torchlight. The endless grind strain that can last for hundreds of hours if you are going for a 100% completion is exhausting. But actually very much fun! It attacks your inner masochism of loot picking and Korean-level mouse clicking. Torchlight 2 as a cheaper alternative to Diablo III gets you a lot of bang for your buck. You get a finely stylized fantasy/steampunk world, 4 playable classes with quite original skill trees and Matt Uelmen's wonderful Diablo-esque soundtrack though it's not as unique and memorable as the one in the first game. Personally, I found the story of the village of Torchlight with infinite dungeons beneath it more satisfying than the global apocalypse of this sequel though the sheer scope of the story will grant you access to big overworld areas for you to diligently explore. The game itself didn't change much. You can still send your pet to town to sell stuff, now having an option of creating a shopping list of remedies and scrolls for the pet to buy. The form of the game changed satisfyingly enough with scalable UI, customizable character appearance and many new pets. If you have a few hours to spare, this game will satisfy your questing needs with perspective.			"

												It has been several years since I have finished a game (SP) from start to finish. I typically get bored somewhere along the way and walk away. Not so with Torchlight II. I have just loved this game. And I am not much of a ARPG fan, but this game just clicked for me. The skill trees and leveling system are cool with many options. Although I had no clue what I was doing with them, it was a great time trying to figure it out. The story is okay -- enough to stay engaged -- but the combat system is fun and easy. Just love it.

												Fishing Simulator Steam Sale 2016I wanted to have my first review for something I could write fairly, not too biased, not too unknowing. Torchlight II I think fits this description.There are a few cons to Torchlight II, but they do get overthrown fairly easily with this game. So let's start with the bad.|Cons|Bugs - Yes, bugs. Not the ones you'll be killing in game or transforming your pet into either. For how long this game has been out, I was surprised to have an almost game breaking bug happen in multiplayer whenever I levelled up. My partner I was playing with would be disconnected whenever I would level. This happened for about 25 levels in game. If became a joke about having to save a million times as I was getting closer to leveling up, but it was still extremely annoying. It could've been a mod we have installed, but it has since fixed itself and said mod is still there and hasn't been updated. Pet AI - Not the greatest thing sometimes. Many times have I had a pet get stuck in a corner and not be able to move until I go back and essentially force him to move the opposite direction and then slowly walk around the corner it was getting stuck on. This doesn't happen often, but it still is a bit annoying.Fishing Time - However much I love the fishing, I hate how sometimes I can catch one in less than 3 seconds and other times I have to wait almost 20 for the circle to go grey. It adds a bit to the immersion of fish don't all bite immediately or the same, but it's still a bit of a hassle sometimes, especially to get that covetted cheevo of fishing 1000 times. Voices - I can honestly say, I don't know much about the story of the game because I can't be bothered listening to the bad voice actors of the game. Yes I can read the story, but it's more fun to just click and get back to hitting things with my sword. Truth be told though, I have a really hard time sitting there reading something when they just add massive reverb to everybody important to make them sound like a ghost or the lack of enthusiasm in most of the character's voices. Now for what we really came here for... the good stuff...|Pros|Multiplayer - Yes, it sounds crazy, a dungeon crawler Diabloesque game without multiplayer? It happened... before I bought it... hence why I have it now and not then. Great game to play multiplayer. Loot System - If you're like me and don't like playing single player with dungeon crawler games, then you'll love the loot system. No dashing in to steal everything and then break friendships for life because you Tanked and did all the damage to said boss and friend runs in and grabs your legendary class drop and wont give it to you... FML for all the times that happened. Instead, everybody has their own loot drops. Wonderful system to have and keeping friends together since 2012.Pets - Although the pet AI can stink sometimes, it's great having something to kill with. Great for tanking or ranged DPS, pets can do almost anything you can. Seriously, you can even give them spells that they can cast. It's great. There's a huge variety you can ""transform"" them into as well for times ranging from 5 minutes to inifite. Fishing - Again, I had my hate on for fishing earlier, but only because I have done it so much and spent hours into just sitting there in town and doing the nasty... gutting a half dead fish. 60+ bucks to sell in store or great buffs for you. Can even have your pets transform from them. Giants are a pain to get, only about 1 in 150 fishing, but still great.Mods - THANK GAWD for mods. Makes the game greater than it already is. Not as many as I would like to see, but still a great amount. It's awesome seeing a modding community that's still active with a 4 year old game (at time of posting this review... 2016).|Final Thoughts|This is the game I feel Diablo should try to take over and implement into their already decent system. It's brighter than Diablo, but I think that goes without saying. This is a great game overall and even better with friends. Do I recommend buying it for CAD $21.99? If you have a friend to play with, then yes. If you're alone, I would wait until this puppy goes on sale.|Final Score|Graphics 8.5/10Stability 6/10Sound 9/10Voices 4/10Replay Value 9.5/10Fun 9/10Overall With Voices 7.5/10True Overall 8.5/1010/10 Would fish again			"

I haven't got much experience when it comes to Torchlight/Diablo style games (as you might guess from the fact that I don't even know the genre name), but from my experiences with this game I can tell you that yes, you SHOULD buy it.

												After the advent of Diablo came the copies and the knock-offs. We all know of them. HOWEVER, I am very happy to announce that Torchlight II is better then any of the Diablo games out there. This can be explained with several things: 1) Torchlight II accomplishes immersion without having to rely on a very dark universe, thus making it more accesible to all types of players2) Torchlight II has some very interesting class design ideas that allow both flexibility and hardcore focus3) The combat is frantic but meaningful, every movement means something ( dodging this spell, zoning this enemy, etc.)4) The items (especially the unique items) provide sustainance for the treasure-hunter hidden deep in all of usI could go on and on... but I wont because I would rather you try Torchlight II out, rather than continue reading a fanboys shameless confession.ENVOY RATED: 10/10			"

												Torchlight II is a lovely, well-crafted game. Its colorful and inviting world is a pleasure to explore. The eclectic soundtrack provides an alternately haunting and energizing accompaniment to your exploits. The classes are distinctive, and each has a terrific assortment of skills. To top it all off, this sizable and thoroughly satisfying game is a great value at just 20 bucks. The loot-driven fantasy-themed action role-playing game clickfest hasn't seen much change since the days of Diablo II. Torchlight II doesn't innovate and it doesn't surprise, and the genre may need an infusion of new ideas if it's going to stay vital. But Torchlight II serves up the old, irresistible recipe about as well as it's ever been done.			"

												I still often play Diablo III from time to time, and to say that Diablo III and this game are the same genre, their gameplay manages to be different. I found it fine switching between the two games, so no one should refuse to buy Torchlight II because they are already playing a similar game. If you do, you will be missing out on a fantastic title. The only real negative with Torchlight II is it does nothing new to the genre. Even so, Torchlight II is one of the best examples of a dungeon raiding, isometric loot game, and should be in everyone’s Steam list if you even have the slightest urge to play an action RPG.			"

												Torchlight II is the top fishing experience of 2012. In each town is a fishing hole where you spend most of your time. For some reason sometimes you get some junk like, a sword or boots rather than a fish. The main game entails searching through different areas to find hidden fishing holes. they have a limited amount of uses per hole and don't really hold any new fish so I guess the enjoyment is supposed to come from just finding these holes. One annoying thing is that weird animals attacks you and try to stop you from reaching fishing holes. It would make sense if they were competitors but they just don't fit in the game at all. You can get through those things easier if you use the junk you get while fishing and there some random abilities your character can learn to help. Another thing is you got this stupid animal following you around that doesn't do anything. All in all 5/10 fishing game that just focuses too much on unnecessary mechanics rather than the core gameplay.			"

												!!! TORCHLIGHT 2 !!!Torchlight II is incredibly polished though I’ve found a few bugs here and there. It’s quite apparent that Runic spent a lot of time making sure that TL2 was ready to ship, something an independent studio has the luxury to do. It shows but there is work to be done to ironed out. To be frank, Torchlight 2 brings very little that's utterly new to the scene. It improves what’s been done before and makes it damned fun to play, definitely a saving grace. The two terrific asides to the notion above is the addition of the Random Dungeon Generator and the modding tools (even thoughThe single biggest and best improvement in Torchlight 2 is the addition of cooperative multiplayer. Runic listened to its fans after the original was released and made sure to include it in the sequel. You can tie your Steam account to your Runic account, choose the Internet option and see a lobby filled with games of all levels. Games can be named and given a password for private play or they can be open for anyone to join. As with most lobby type games, you can create a friends list and even filter games to only see games created by your buddies. In addition, games can be created that only friends can join.Sad to say, but there just inst enough good things to say about Torchlight 2, even with the minor issues it does have. It is one of the most refreshingly fun action RPGs i've played in a very long time. Its predecessor was lots of fun too, But with the addition of multiplayer, the dungeon generator and the modding tools, the series becomes something special, something different on the scene and something worthy of your time and money to play.- XeroSyphon			"

It's probably not going to be comparable to Diablo 2, and it's not as deep as PoE for example, but otherwise it's a very polished game that does well in many areas. Compared to Torchlight 1, everything is better. + Skill system is better and pretty much all skills have some use now, no more overlapping skills between classes. + Areas are just better. Maps are larger and the smaller pieces that make them up are much more different and interesting. It's probably one of the game's greatest highlights. The minigames also add a lot to the randomness.+ Combat takes more effort than mashing 1 skill at the highest difficulty.+ Modding.It has cons but honestly still feels very polished for the price that it doesn't really matter that much.

True, the graphics are not all that, but I think this game is good in the fact that it keeps you very interested. That being said, it is not a brilliant game, due to it's lack of classes. You are limited to the few classes there are, and I think they should have tried to make more classes to vary the gameplay.Overall, it's a fun and interesting game with a good plot and backstory, although you are limted with the class selection. 3.5/5			"

												Not overly complicated and a lot of stuff to do, gives you multiple classes to choose from and hundreds of items, pair it with the Synergies mod for an even better experience.  This game has a lot of replay value due to enemy and item scaling and items that can only be obtained through replays.  Map Works is unlocked after the first play through and allows you to buy maps with special player and enemy buffs to customize the experience.All in all a good game if you like games like this, worth the full-price.

												All around excellent ARPG.  Great build variety between the classes.  You have control of stat point and skill point distribution making some level of commitment necessary.  Once you finish the story, you can do either NG+ which is similar to how Diablo used to handle Nightmare, Hell, etc, or use the random map room where you can open portals to random dungeons with random enemies with random properties scaled to your level.  There's a lot of replayability here especially considering some of the excellent mods available through the workshop.  I haven't tried PvP, but co-op is fun and easy to start up.			"

												I haven't played the first Torchlight, but I have always enjoyed a good dungeon crawler and Torchlight II is so much more! If you ever enjoyed Diablo II, then Torchlight II would be in my eyes its spiritual successor! I never felt during my 80+ hours of gameplay that it was at all too grindy, unlike Diablo III which starts loosing its charm after the first playthrough and item drops (good items) are non-existent. I would thoroughly recommend this game, either as a great Single-Player game, or where it really shines; in co-op.			"

												This game took me about 27 hours to finish, which is actually a good length. I picked the Outlander and loved her!After you complete an area of the game you can revisit them again, fight the bosses and such, because after you do a few  more dungeons the old dungeons gets rerolled. You could run the same list of dungeons, in order, over and over again if you wanted to gold farm or wanted to level from purely slaughtering stuff.Areas have random named creatures too which are like mini bosses with random abilities and a whole ton of health. When you kill a named monster you get fame which is like a secondary leveling system. Once you level this you get a skill point. Some of the names I enountered were weak while others were quite hard. A few times I faced multiple named things at the same time. Those were some good fights.Loot. Unlike other games Torchlight only has common, enchanted, magic and legendary rarity grades, which is a lot less then some games I've played. I always trashed commons and I don't recall ever using enchanted gear after I progressed a bit. Magical gear can spawn as set items which give bonuses in based off how many you have equiped of said set which is additional perks. All items have randomly rolled stats. I never played the Diablo series personally but everyone says its like that. In my mind I compare it to Borderlands though gear in Torchlight II is not as generated as robust as Borderlands. There is still a lot gear attributes to mix and match plus enchantments on weapons, set bonuses, and augments to your class/ skills. Gear all has their own models too so you will be getting new looks. At the end of the game I looked kinda ridiculous in my get-up. Each piece looked alright by themselves just it didn't go very well together.You also have town serives. Enchanting is a cool one: pay gold to get random rolls, pay gold to strip them off and reroll. Enchanters are also in the wild and offer special types of enchantments like fire or can put 3 enchantments on an item. There is a merchant where you buy items thatare complete gambles. I've gotten some GREAT stuff from him and a lot of rubbish too.Oh! Ya you have a pet and it actually does not suck. My pet was superemely helpful to me. Pets get 3 special pet gear items and 4 spell slots... there's also spells you can learn in addition to your class skills...You know what? I'm rambeling. Look it comes down to this. Torchlight II has a lot of features. A lot of enemies. A lot of areas. Tons of loot. The combat is good, balanced, well done and statisfying. I paid $2.99 for this during the summer sale of 2016 thinking I'd enjoy it some but maaaaaaan I totally understand why this game has an 'overwhelmingly positive' review. Steam points 'games like this' to Borderlands and in an odd way it is completely like that! but top down with randomly generated maps and a horbar.I enjoyed my time so much I will be playing this one again with mods. Porb the best action loot based dungeon crawl I've ever played. This one made it to my favorites list. I give Torchlight II a well deserved 5/5			"

An Underrated Action RPGRunic made huge improvements on the first installation of the series; it's a formidable ARPG in its own right. I got this around the same time as I bought Diablo 3 and ended up playing this way more. I always recommend playing online multiplayer games with friends but even playing with friends on D3 wasn't nearly as much fun. D3 gives off a gothic, eerie tone whereas Torchlight 2 has a lot more charm, the characters are memorable, and the game overall is much more simplistic. In this case, less is more. I also enjoyed doing the quests alone but it was still more engaging to play with friends.It has a Borderlands 2-like mechanic where you can play it again on an even more challenging difficulty with better loot. The story isn't very memorable but the soundtrack is good, the mechanics are fun, and there's plenty of whimsical moments. It's also got the best character customization I've seen in an ARPG with no terrible, stereotypical, and racist tropes like the Chinese wizard dragon lady *cough*Diablo 3*cough*! All the more reason to love this game. I strongly recommend playing this with friends.Be mindful of your skill allocation, especially if you're too lazy to get any mods. I had to start over because I messed up the first time.8/10			"

												In the world of Torchlight 2, everything outside of your friendly camp wants you dead. That rat tribe? Wants you dead. The lizard people of the desert? Want you dead. That blob? It also wants you dead. The world is blighted and has made the monsters rampant - at least, I think that's why everything wants to kill you. Maybe the world of Torchlight 2 is just really dangerous. Maybe you need to be a hero to go down the road for the milk in the morning, to battle all the things that suddenly want you dead. Anyway, the fact that everything is a murderous fiend is great because it simplifies life. Gone are moralistic questions of whether it's OK to take a life. There's no time to think of such things when you're defending yourself against all manner of creature. Just kill! Level up! Gain skills! Torchlight 2 is a great game in the genre of click-and-kill, and adds the ingenous innovation of having a pet that goes to town and sells your stuff for you while you're out doing battle (like the first Torchlight), it's mod-friendly if that's your thing, you can play online, the graphics and style are mwa! (kissable) Way better than Diablo 3 THAT'S RIGHT IT'S WAAAAYYY BETTER! If you enjoyed the first Torchlight, you'll love this.			"

Does Diablo better than D3!As an avid fan of Diablo 1 and Diablo 2, I was sorely disappointed by the gameplay and support put forth by Blizzard into Diablo 3. My search for a new hack 'n' slash RPG that I could sink my teeth into began. After sinking countless hours into games like Titan Quest (which was never fully completed and released with many bugs. Still recommended though!) a couple of former Diablo developers went and made Torchlight. The first game was great: well balanced, fun, hours of replayability...but it lacked multiplayer.Torchlight 2 brings together all of the same great elements from the first release, and adds multiplayer and even more replayability with Steam Workshop's player created content! With four classes to choose from, multiple playthroughs, the ability to switch difficulty settings at any time, and high character leveling capabilities, you can literally spend weeks playing this game by yourself or with friends. My only complaint about this game is that the Embermage appears to be a bit overpowered (OP). However, if you're new to the Diablo-esque genre of hack 'n' slash, loot-♥♥♥♥♥ gaming then you may like the prospect of making things a bit easier on yourself in the early-game.Ratings out of 8 bits: 1 bit = low, 8 bits = high.Graphics: 8 bits. Although a bit dated by 2015 standards, the game's lush and colorful landscapes are almost as enticing as the myriad of color effects for spells and attacks. On many occassions I found myself snapping screenshots of exotic locales as if I were on vacation.Sound: 8 bits. Coupled with the beautiful graphics of Torchlight 2 is an amazing soundtrack of intrigue with intermittent cries of enemies as they shatter and explode.Story: 6 bits. Even though effort was put into this RPG to give it a compelling storyline, it felt forced and overused at times. The cutscenes were lower-budget than the gameplay, and, although using a different art style than Diablo, the story smacked of the Diablo storyline. Seeing the evil mage fleeing into the desert reminded me too much of the wanderer from Diablo 2 always moving East. I would have liked to have seen more of a unique storyline than just unique artwork for the cutscenes.Gameplay: 8 bits. Nothing to complain about here. Lots of unique areas to explore, dungeons to conquer, baddies to slay, and loot to horde!...with the excitement broken up by quiet fishing trips.Execution: 7 bits. Although this title brings together everythings Diablo and Torchlight fans have come to love, I can't help but feel that not enough was done to separate this title as different than Diablo 2. A few things have been changed, many improvements made, but for everything that was added it feels as if something was taken away. The ability to easily modify powerful items was added, but set items were nerfed to the point of uselessness. There are more examples, but I feel one is enough here.Overall: 8 bits. This game is a must-have for any RPG/Diabloesque gamer! Highly recommended for anyone with loads of time to spare, or someone who just wants to work their way through a fun hack 'n' slash with a great story!			"

												A third of the cost of Diablo III for what is easily the better game.  As I write this I've played five or six hours of Torchlight II, but I expect I'll be playing many more, especially with co-op in the mix.  It's an interesting thing.  I always thought I'd hate this game's aesthetic when compared to Diablo III's fire and brimstone, and on top of that assumed Matt Uelmen's compositions were a better fit for darker fantasy, but it all feels quite right here.  And this really is to Torchlight what Diablo II was to Diablo, making it one of the best games to emerge from this particular tradition.			"

												Game: Torchlight 2Genre: RPG-AdventureDeveloper: Runic GamesSystem: PC (Steam)Total Score: 92/100Value Score: 9.2/10• Story: 7/10o Torchlight 2's storyline picks off where Torchlight 1 ended. The Alchemist which was one of the main characters from the first game ended up becoming corrupt thanks to the effects of the last game's villain's heart. Now you who will play as a new character will have to hunt him down and save the world from whatever he is planning to. You'll be going through several towns, dungeons and all sorts of terrain to find the Alchemist. The storyline overall is a bit generic but the side stories and side quests and their importance plays a interesting role within the overall game.• Characters: 7/10o Characters from the first game do appear in this game but barely do you interact with them, other than that all the enemies in the game and the characters you meet afterwards are all new but do not hold much substance like other RPGs however the amount of characters especially when it comes to enemy designs is quite huge. The player themselves can also create their own character, choosing the gender, skin color, hair appearance and color amongst other tidbits though you would not probably notice a difference due to the fact the armor you get in the game would make it to where you probably would not care about how you make your character look.• GamePlay: 10/10o Torchlight 2's gameplay is very similar to Torchlight 1's with a few new additions. For one, you have the choice to play as 4 different classes: Berserker which is best for close quarters combat and has insane speed, Mechanic is which best as a support character and as a secondary attacker, Outlander which is best with long range attacks and finally Ember Mage which is the equivalent of a Wizard in TL2 which is pretty much self explanatory. Depending on what you choose for skills and equipment you can build your character up to different builds and uses such as having a offensive ember mage instead of a magic user. The user interface is very similar to TL1 which is heavily inspired by Diablo and World of Warcraft. You have access to different features in towns and throughout different dungeons such as the ability to gamble for items, power up items through enchantments (which do not break or de-enchant anymore), to fuse items. Along with that the usual item shop, weapon/armor shop, and the special item/magic shop as well. There are a lot of side quests along with the story's main quests. One of the biggest additions to the game from its predecessor is Online Multiplayer, many people have anticipated this feature and wanted so much from the first game will now get to enjoy it in this game as up to 6 players can connect to each other on TL2's public servers or make their own private server via LAN. All items are exclusive to each player, no player will see another player's item or treasure (this is to prevent any disputes for loot).• Graphics: 10/10o Torchlight 2's graphical interfaces, environment and character sprites designs are similar to the first game but further improved with using current technologies making it one of the best looking 2Dish helicopter view games ever made.• Sound: 10/10o Torchlight 2 uses voiceovers throughout the majority of the game's main storyline, there will be instances where you will hear voices from other npcs and from yourself during dungeon raids. Torchlight 2's sound effects are both a combination of new effects to the game and uses some effects from the first game. The voiceovers are pretty well done for the characters and the sound effects go nicely with the environment and during the action sequences of cutscenes and battles.• Music: 8/10o Torchlight 2 uses similar style of music that the first game used, calm soothing orchestral type music is used mostly in the game, most of the parts of the game it has that unique Star Wars like epic feeling in the background whenever you travel the terrain or go through a town conversing with the NPCs. The developers were also kind enough to allow players to actually have access to the full OST of the game via the Game's folder on the PC, so enjoy the whole OST of Torchlight 2 on your portable mp3 player.• Length: 10/10o Torchlight 2's length is possibly its second greatest aspect if not the gameplay, the game's main storyline by itself should take you no more than 20 hours and additional 5-10 hours' worth of grinding and side questing on the side. If that isnt enough, you may do multiple playthroughs with friends or with other characters to see the world of Torchlight through different experiences which of course adds massive appealing value to this aspect.• Replay Value: 10/10o One of the best things about most western games is the replay value and TL2 is no exception. The Online multiplayer experience by itself adds great value to the replay value through different experiences and difficulties available for you to choose from. Once you finish the game, you get access to a endless random dungeon which takes you to random environments so you can explore thoroughly for additional treasures and other items. Along with that to add even more value, they added a New Game+ which allows you to play the game all over again using the same character but with a more difficulty twist to the gameplay.• Player Value: 10/10o Overall Torchlight 2 expands over the first one and improves in pretty much in every way, despite some network issues it may have from time to time, players will surely enjoy the multiplayer experiences and if not they can dabble on the single player experience which like the multiplayer can be experienced through different difficulties. You have a pretty decent customization options for your characters and can easily build up any class in any possible way. The graphical details have improved from the game, the sound effects and music are kept the similar to the first game. Pretty much TL2 consists of all the good aspects of TL1 plus more.			"

												I felt that Torchlight was a very unique game, with an interesting plot and well developed characters. True, the graphics are not all that, but I think this game is good in the fact that it keeps you very interested. That being said, it is not a brilliant game, due to it's lack of classes. You are limited to the few classes there are, and I think they should have tried to make more classes to vary the gameplay.Overall, it's a fun and interesting game with a good plot and backstory, although you are limted with the class selection. 3.5/5			"

Many great mods to further make this game funner and harder and also able to play with friends makes this game able to replayed over and over. I don't see myself playing this game ever again since I finished the main story but for others this game can be played until you actually feel you are powerful enough. 6/10  "

												Overall it was a fun hack and slash, Diablo style game. Like the borderlands games, I would recommend that you play this game cooperatively with friends. If you played the first Torchlight game, the second is much more polished and fun to play. If it goes on sale, order some pizza and drinks, grab some friends, and pool some money together for the 4-pack and have a good time. Pros:-Good color color pallet choices for the cartoony art style-All classes felt unique and fun, all were very viable in single player and multiplayer (a huge improvement from Torchlight 1) [seriously, this felt like one of the best class balances I've had in a long time]-Compared to Torchlight 1, there was improved UI customizations, runspeed/navigation tweaks, etc. (generally more user friendly and comfortable to do various things)-The music choices were generally decent (though I haven't played in a while and may not remember this aspect the best)Cons:-Storyline was sparse, but was functional/adequate. There weren't nearly as many cutscenes as I thought there would be or would have liked there to be. The written dialogue wasn't very engrossing, but it set the premise for the character actions in the game. -If you liked the darker/grittier visual styles of Diablo, Path of Exile, or The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, the cartoony artstyle may be offputting to you "

												Very tight game for its price. It's probably not going to be comparable to Diablo 2, and it's not as deep as PoE for example, but otherwise it's a very polished game that does well in many areas. Compared to Torchlight 1, everything is better. + Skill system is better and pretty much all skills have some use now, no more overlapping skills between classes. + Areas are just better. Maps are larger and the smaller pieces that make them up are much more different and interesting. It's probably one of the game's greatest highlights. The minigames also add a lot to the randomness.+ Combat takes more effort than mashing 1 skill at the highest difficulty.+ Modding.It has cons but honestly still feels very polished for the price that it doesn't really matter that much.

												Torchlight II is the top fishing experience of 2012. In each town is a fishing hole where you spend most of your time. For some reason sometimes you get some junk like, a sword or boots rather than a fish. The main game entails searching through different areas to find hidden fishing holes. they have a limited amount of uses per hole and don't really hold any new fish so I guess the enjoyment is supposed to come from just finding these holes. One annoying thing is that weird animals attacks you and try to stop you from reaching fishing holes. It would make sense if they were competitors but they just don't fit in the game at all. You can get through those things easier if you use the junk you get while fishing and there some random abilities your character can learn to help. Another thing is you got this stupid animal following you around that doesn't do anything. All in all 5/10 fishing game that just focuses too much on unnecessary mechanics rather than the core gameplay.			"

												Possibly one of my favorite games, this action-RPG is Diablo-like as people say, but has its own taste.People compare Diablo II/III and Torchlight II, but a lot of the developers that made Diablo also were part of Runic Games, and they share a lot of the same DNA, but they are their own different games.The storyline is interesting, and has enough gameplay for at least 20 hours from beginning to end. Even though I didn't play the first Torchlight, I catched on quickly.The amount of weapons and armor you can have is endless, although after a while it can make you crave for more powerful weapons.Another key point to this game is the multiplayer/co-op portion of this game, it allows all the players to get their own loot. It allows offline and LAN multiplayer, and allows VPN programs like Hamachi or Tunngle.The only complain I have is that you can't respec in this game, you can refund your last 3 skill points invested, and can screw up some characters.For the insanely low price of $19.99, its more ""refined"" compared to Diablo for the price, and in the future they will hopefully continue this series.

												Probably the best hack&slash style game available on the market. Diablo III changed up too many things in my opinion (and made the combat and character advancement much less engaging), and Path of Exile just isn't polished enough graphically to provide that sublime experience.Torchlight II has all the strengths of the genre, and very little of its faults. It's an easy to get into game which can be made more difficult if you wish, it has a plethora of weapons and armor, it has a very robust skill system in which you can try out very atypical builds if you so desire... and it also has a strong, recognizable aesthetic to it, which helps.All the minor gripes I have with it are made inconsequential when compared to all the things this game does well. A must play for any hack & slash fan.			"

												In the world of Torchlight 2, everything outside of your friendly camp wants you dead. That rat tribe? Wants you dead. The lizard people of the desert? Want you dead. That blob?

Maybe you need to be a hero to go down the road for the milk in the morning, to battle all the things that suddenly want you dead. Anyway, the fact that everything is a murderous fiend is great because it simplifies life. Gone are moralistic questions of whether it's OK to take a life. There's no time to think of such things when you're defending yourself against all manner of creature. Just kill! Level up! Gain skills! Torchlight 2 is a great game in the genre of click-and-kill, and adds the ingenous innovation of having a pet that goes to town and sells your stuff for you while you're out doing battle (like the first Torchlight), it's mod-friendly if that's your thing, you can play online, the graphics and style are mwa! (kissable) Way better than Diablo 3 THAT'S RIGHT IT'S WAAAAYYY BETTER! If you enjoyed the first Torchlight, you'll love this.			"

												I absolutey love this game! I have only done one play through so far, so havent even hit the level cap, but yet I know I'll play this again and again.The great thing that I find is that you can quite easily play the game on your own with it being fun, looking at all the loot, building your characters stats etc... :). Of course playing with others the mobs drop better loot and that loot is all for you, which is good for the little greedy gremlin inside us all.One of the exciting things is getting to the level of a skill and trying it out, there's a pretty nice variety. You can chose to focus or spread them out still feel pretty powerful.(Not gonna go into too much detail with the level skills, dont want to ruin it for you lol) :D10/10			"

												One of the biggest problems with these Hack 'n Slash / Dungeon Crawler / Lootpocalypse games is the huge piles of loot that you (or at least I) feel compelled to lug back to town every five minutes of combat to sell. And where Dungeon Siege solved this problem with pack mules in singleplayer and ignored the problem in coop, and where Diablo 3 'solved' it by making all the junk loot worthless (people just like seeing lootsplosions, right? They don't like it for the money its worth, that would be silly!), the Torchlight games solved this with an awesome/adorable ferret with goggles that takes your unwanted gear back to town and sells it for you (and I guess they have other animals that can do the same thing or something).Besides solving the one flaw of the genre, Torchlight 2 does everything else right (or at least right enough): Online or LAN coop, ferrets with goggles, crazy explosive spell effects, ferrets with goggles, tons of cool loot, ferrets with goggles, random dungeon layouts and ferrets with goggles.As if all of that wasn't enough, they also have ferrets with goggles!

An Underrated Action RPGRunic made huge improvements on the first installation of the series; it's a formidable ARPG in its own right. I got this around the same time as I bought Diablo 3 and ended up playing this way more. I always recommend playing online multiplayer games with friends but even playing with friends on D3 wasn't nearly as much fun. D3 gives off a gothic, eerie tone whereas Torchlight 2 has a lot more charm, the characters are memorable, and the game overall is much more simplistic. In this case, less is more. I also enjoyed doing the quests alone but it was still more engaging to play with friends.It has a Borderlands 2-like mechanic where you can play it again on an even more challenging difficulty with better loot. The story isn't very memorable but the soundtrack is good, the mechanics are fun, and there's plenty of whimsical moments. It's also got the best character customization I've seen in an ARPG with no terrible, stereotypical, and racist tropes like the Chinese wizard dragon lady *cough*Diablo 3*cough*! All the more reason to love this game. I strongly recommend playing this with friends.Be mindful of your skill allocation, especially if you're too lazy to get any mods. I had to start over because I messed up the first time.8/10			"

												While Diablo is obviously the leader of this game genre, Torchlight 2 is a much more affordable option and acts as an entertaining alternative to the bigger title. In truth I've invested many more hours in Torchlight than I have in Diablo 3. Perhaps its not as shiny or rainbow-encrusted, but it makes for a fun experience.			"

The classes are better, the loot is better, the pets are better, the UI is better, and the entire design of the game world is much better. It has more of a Zelda feel with its overworld and underworld settings, and this brings a much richer, more varied feel to the experience when compared to the first game.

												My first gaming experience was given by an RPG, back then (1999), a curious 7 year old me didn't know that much about what it was or what it represented, but I liked it and wanted to know more and more about it...why does it die if I click on it ? why does stuff drop from it after it dies ? back then I thought most of them just go to sleep after they stop interacting with you, but after seeing the first blood pool I soon realized that wasn't the case. Growing up with the golden age of '90s cartoon from CN, you start to understand pretty quickly when something is what it is, and not something else, if it doesn't want to be something else that is. Back to the game, I came back to it again and again as the years passed, understanding more and more about it, until one day I got to finish it and said to myself, ""this was nice, but is it the best ? "". A few more years passed and the first news of Torchlight started to appear in gaming magazines and online media, so of course I liked a reimagining of the first game that made me love gaming. This time though, we're talking about Torchlight 2, and how it improved on the initial formula, keeping the main cast from the first game, and making them a part of the story in T2. I personally love this game, and have played it quite a while before buying it on steam. I think everyone should have a go at this game, not because it's fun, not because it's cartoonish, not even because it's a great experience, but because it's that type of game that can really show you the amount of dedication the people who made it managed to put into something that you can't even hold in your hand; from the artwork, to the soundtrack, animations, and even the small things, like fishing and moving boards away to find loot, this game shows that true dedication isn't something only present in the first title, but something that can and is transmuted in time, from one game to the next. That and the fact that I can never get tired of seeing my panda pet get on two legs and start fisticuffing from the largest to the smallest enemy. :)Also the modding community did a great job making the game more diverse and fitting to the likes of everyone.In the end, my initial review for Torchlight 2 still stands, but I just felt like some back story would make it more recognizable to some of you gamers that are like me, and enjoy playing a game that shows of the dedication of some amazing people. So to conclude, T2, great RPG experience form the creators of Diablo 1 and 2. :)			"

												I remember the day when I had bought this game when it was on a Steam sale. I had a couple of dollars left and I wanted to spend the money on something that interested me. I had bought Torchlight II and haven't touched it for quite some time, since I was not an active Steam user back then. When I first played it, I immediately regretted not playing this sooner.Torchlight II is, to put in the simplest words, an amazing game. The product is a highly polished game with many surprises hidden around every corner.  The world is randomly generated every time you start a new character/start New Game+ on an existing character so every experience will be a highly unique one. The game really gets to the point; you can immediately delve into the fun of clicking on monsters and annihilating them with your weapons/skills.As is said in many other reviews, the story is definitely lacking. I had attempted to follow the story when I first started playing but ended up not caring for the story at all. If you are into an RPG with a rich story, this game is not for you.Gameplay-wise, this game tops it all. You'll be mashing your number hotkeys and your mouse trying to rid of the monsters trying to swarm you. There are many random traps and surprises lurking in every dungeon and area you face. The skills for each character are also special and will leave you wanting to upgrade all your skills. As said before, each dungeon and area is randomly generated, providing a unique experience everytime you play. You will feel a great sense of accomplishment as you finally knock out the final boss of the game. This then leads to the Mapworks, which you can buy with your in-game currency and play special dungeons. Or you can start up NG+ and start your whole adventure again, keep all your character stats but buffing all item drops and monsters.All in all, Torchlight II is definitely a game that anyone should check out, even if you do not like RPGs. This game is a must-have on anyone's game list.			"

Besides that, we can see a mix of: good visual style, large customization options, decent gameplay and decent multiplayer. I definetly recomend it, but i understand why some people dislike it: the core gameplay is just ""click on monsters see them die"" lol, and its really just a matter of ""i like or i dislike that"" . You will have to see it for yourself if you never player a game like this one or Diablo, but its at least worth giving a shot :)			"

												I played Diablo 3 when it first came out and after completing the game it then got very repetitive and it just got boring very quickly, it was my first game as a Hack and Slash style, after searching for games of a similar style i bought Torchlight 2 because it was on sale so I didn't have much to lose. I had the game in my library for a while and only just started playing it but wow it is such a good game, the style of graphics and the gameplay is very addictive and loads of fun and i expect many more hours to come from playing this game			"

												In my opinion, the aspect where Torchlight II really shines is the UI(User Interface), that makes you truly enjoy the experience, making the game feel smooth. Besides that, we can see a mix of: good visual style, large customization options, decent gameplay and decent multiplayer. I definetly recomend it, but i understand why some people dislike it: the core gameplay is just ""click on monsters see them die"" lol, and its really just a matter of ""i like or i dislike that"" . You will have to see it for yourself if you never player a game like this one or Diablo, but its at least worth giving a shot :)			"

https://www.facebook.com/5-Minute-Gaming-334929540238322/Rating 8.0/10If you are like me and always on the lookout for a good dungeon romp to play with your pals, then look no further than Torchlight 2. If you missed this gem of a game, then rest assured it is just as fun as ever, and when played with friends, rises to the level of – wow, I got this for the price of a burger and fry? Cool!I put in 35 hours into this game, and my partner Thulgar and I will probably do a full playthrough again at some point as we never beat the game in its entirety. It is worth the time invested. In fact, my son and I played this together and enjoyed it more than Diablo 3.Happy Gaming!			"

												Torchlight II is truly a great ARPG.  The base game contains hundreds of hours of game play.  Then there are challenges galore to seek!  The multiplayer is spot on with low latency game play and tons of loot.  You can have fun playing with friends or total strangers in Torchlight II.  There are randomized maps so the fun never gets stale.  And lots of difficulty mods with the option to reroll your character and start all over again!Then there is full Steam Workshop mod support.  You can alter the game into any fashion that you want.  Want to try a full set of badass armor?  You can enable it.  Want more maps?  It's there!  Want a pet that's not in the base game?  There's a mod for it.  Hell you can create it if you like!  This is truly a great game that should be in your Steam Library.  It has way more content than Diablo 3 developers could dream of in a thousand years because of the dedicated modders out there.  And it all runs seamlessly without bugs.  The code for this game is airtight!What are you waiting for?  Get Torchlight II today!			"

												Mechanically, Torchlight II is a fine Diablo 2 clone, and is loads more fun than Diablo 3.  That said, though, it never quite makes enough of an effort to advance the genre, and it sticks a little too close to Diablo 2's formula for comfort.  A little more originality in its storyline, areas, and plot, and this could have been great.  As it stands, it's a decent, unspectacular loot-driven romp.			"

												Builds upon the first Torchlight game in every way.Played on Windows 7, iMac (2009) Yosemite, and Linux Mint 17.3. Runs great on all three OSes.PROS:+4 distinct, versatile, and fun-to-play character classes: Outlander (ranged), Berserker (melee), Ember Mage (mage), and Engineer (heavy weapons and support team).+Wider range of Pets, which will assist in battle, sell off unwanted loot, purchase needed potions, and can be taught spells.+HUGE open world, composed of three main areas and tons of side-quests and unlockable areas.+Looters' paradise. Loot is diverse and plentiful. Loot can also be sold or traded when playing online.+Fun in single player, with alot of replay value beyond the initial playthrough via NG+.+Online co-op with up to 4 other players.+Enemy types are extremely varied, cool looking, and fun to battle.+Gorgeous graphics and an inviting visual aesthetic.+Windows, Mac, and Linux versions available.+Very modest hardware requirements, especially considering the amount of content in TL2.+A steal at only $20, and often on sale for even less.CONS:-Weak story. -Online co-op isn't as streamlined as other online RPGs.

												A quick preface:I extremely dislike Perfect World Entertainment. After having worked with them many years as a consumer attempting to enjoy some of their products, I find it difficult to recommend anything that they oversee. This is a word of caution, stranger.With the negativity out of the way...! Torchlight II is a sublime game. Colorful and vivid visuals mesh with professional sound quality and gameplay design features. I have put plenty of time and effort into the game and can easily recommend it to gamers looking for a 'classical' experience.Torchlight II is an action role-playing game not unlike the Diablo franchise. Immerse yourself in a fantasy world rife with conflict and unique people, places, and ideas. Play one of four classes and then embark on a journey to customize your character even further with three skill trees for each of the archetypes. Bring friends along, tackle procedurally generated dungeons, and advance in the engaging storyline as a casual gamer or passionate 'min-maxer'.Torchlight II is an exceptional game that can keep you occupied for hours, if not days.... perhaps weeks!

												Torchlight II is a really good game, but not a great game. It has an endearing art-style that's easy on the eyes, and the gameplay is addictive enough to keep you playing 'till the end (I played about 50 hours by the time I beat it). However, there is nothing about this game that is exceptional or raises the bar. The story isn't deep or engaging, and the world lacks depth. Had the developers expanded the towns and added sub characters to strengthen the plot, then this game could have been a bench mark. The loot drops are well-balanced and look decent, the world is visually appealing, even interesting in some places, and the monsters are well-designed. But beyond the relentless grind, there's nothing much motivating you to keep collecting and throwing away loot 'till the next boss fight, except more loot and boss fights, that is. If you're just looking for a game to help you pass the time without being bored, then it does its job well, but don't expect an engaging story to justify the 50+ hours you may waste playing it. In the end, I feel like I got my money's worth, but only based on what I already kind of expected.			"

												It is inevitable to compare this game to Blizzard's hack 'n slash RPG. I would say this would be the poor-man's version of Diablo III, but the truth of the matter is Torchlight II holds it's ground and could even be considered a better game overall, depending on what you're looking for.Torchlight II brings better loot, better progressions system, mob variety and arguably a better 'end-game'. The only two thing it lacks, compared to Diablo III, is the graphical fidelity (although since the game is done in a cartoonish art-style, it is not immediately noticable) and story.While Torchlight II manages to win points in the atmosphere department, the story of the Diablo universe offers a much more expanded lore and world to explore. Voice acting, cinematics and sound design are far better than what Torchlight II has. Which is to be expected from a series that started it's roots in indie gaming. Experience sharing in multiplayer could use some tweaking, but loot is instanced for every player and trading is fully functional for all items you find. A big plus for the game is also mod support, something which Diablo III lacks. The Steam Workshop is sure to increase the life-span of the game, and enchance the experience according to your taste buds.Despite some of it's shortcomings, it is still one of the better hack 'n slash RPGs out there. Definitely worth your time!			"

There are so many similarities to Diablo but so many other interesting things as well. I've listed them down in the PROS and CONS.TL2 is slightly below Diablo in terms of content quantity... 4 levels are really, really fast to finish.... But for the price, it was worth it.... I am also very annoyed with the creation of another Runic account to link to my Steam account. I would like to be able to transfer my game to another Steam account not the one I bought it with. Another pet peeve (which can't be helped) is the feeling of repetition deeper into TL2. You can see copies of Ratlings, skeletons and Brutes appearing over and over again. They just come back with a different name and different skin.$4.00 SGDPROS1. Great map designQuests and story rolled into one. Not all the quests are in the town, some are hidden away in the map, so it makes you want to explore. However, the downside is that you might miss some of these quests as you don't know where they are. E.g. Zephari Envoy2. SecretsThere are lots of interesting secret areas. One memorable one was ""It puts the lotion in the bucket"" (obvious reference to Silence of the Lambs). I shouldn't spoil how to do it but let's just say it will be interesting to find the lotion.3. Skill treesI like the way you can upgrade your skills and that there are so many skills to work with, per character. Each skill is tiered into T1, T2, T3 with a special upgrade at each tier. There are a lot of way to play your character.4. Semi-Live NPCsThe NPCs give you information on current events which are related to your quests and they don't function purely as lamp posts. I think they could have made it better by making the NPCs come alive even more though.5. Train TravelAlthough a cut-scene, it was cool. I was hoping to interact with the train though. I think that it would be better if we could go onto the train and do stuff on it.6. InteractionQuite a few items but not everything. You can break urns, rocks, explosives and barrels but those are a given. Lighting the braziers to provide light was most innovative. I think having levers or switchs that moved big bridges would be quite cool.7. Knocking creatures offThere are some ways to knock off tiny land creatures, off the terrain and into a pit. Very cool, much better than an invisible ring. Of course, you can be knocked off as well.8. Pack mule / PetI love my pet and the ability to sell items without going back to town. 9. Spider MinesI can't believe there are spider mines that seek out enemies.10. Alternate weaponsPress W. Switch from range to melee. Great move. Change playstyle instantly. *Star star*11. NPC huntingYou can get more NPCs to help out in the town if you go out of your way to do side quests. Again, a potential pitfall as you might miss them totally, but it's okay. The similarity to Suikoden's hero collection is great.CONS1. BugsCan't pick up items that fall onto ledgesCan't shoot creatures who are no more than a few feet above or below you.2. Murder HoboAlmost everything is still mass murder. Kill, kill, kill, kill and more killing for any quest. I'm a mass murderer in this game. I've yet to come across a quest without premeditated murder.3. Stupid thingsYou are face-to-face with an enemy. However, you can't reach him because of a crack that runs through the floor, dividing you and the enemy. Most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I think a jump would be great.4. Runic Account creationMost annoying. I have to create another account just to play online. <------ This here pisses me off.5. Spell keys1,2,3,4 are easy to reach. 5,6,7,8,9,0 extremely hard. Would have been better with 1234QWER.6. RepetitionRatlings, goo, skeletons repeated. Just with a different colour palette and skin.7. FameWhat does this do?8. ContentOnly 4 levels. I breezed through them. It didn't feel like there was enough interesting stuff. Just lots of similar level bashing.NEUTRAL1. Trash dropsI am not so certain about trash drops that just keep on generating a lot of junk for me to sell. Perhaps, something else can be done about trash drops?SUGGESTIONSI saw ladders in the game. Could Runic code an interaction with ladders?			"

												I will echo many other reviews and start by saying: If you liked Diablo 2, you should really enjoy Torchlight 2.In fact, at times I felt this game was almost too derivative. Both games have 4 Acts. Each Act has its own hub town, bosses, unique geographic setting and a narrated cinematic at each Act's beginning. Even the storyline has a lot of similarities. With all that said, Torchlight 2 clearly wasn't designed to be novel. Instead they set out to do the dungeon crawler genre really, really well. And they succeeded.The gameplay is fast paced, addictive, loot filled fun. Everything about this game is user friendly. It's easy to get to and from town; your pet can easily be sent to sell off your unwanted spoils while you keep adventuring; even playing on the Veteran difficulty I almost never had to buy potions or magic scrolls; quests are clearly marked on the map, never leaving you wondering what to do next; when you die you have the option to respawn in town for free or lose gold but respawn near where you died.My main criticism is likely to be experienced differently by each person who plays Torchlight 2. I started to get bored with the game about 3/4ths through the story mode. This is common for me with games of this type. I should note that I played to the end of the game fully in single player. Your mileage may vary particularly if you plan to play online with friends.I'll close by saying if you did NOT like Diablo 2, or other highly rated dungeon crawlers, do not be swayed by all the positive reviews this game has gotten. Trust your gut; I suspect that the type of person that will enjoy this game already knows that they will enjoy it.			"

The rewards just keeps getting thrown at you, and you never know what loot may be around the next corner. Wandering around and exploring the map almost feels like when you were a little kid and searched your house in hope of finding your hidden presents.

												Do you like Diablo I & II? This game is true Diablo III. I'm not saying that Blizzard failed to deliver good game, but this one is just as much Diablo-like as you can get. Everything from music to combat mechanics just feel like Diablo. Well, music on its own is beast. You can hear same tones as in diablo I & II. Game itself is quite long and has huge replayability, but combined with full mod support it's nearly unlimited. I recommand using Synergies mode as it makes game a lot more difficult as well as adding many new enemies, locations, items, very hard raids and recreates some of existing classes as well as adds some new. In fact only bad thing in TL2 is that it's not really hard, even on highest difficulty it's bit easier than Diablo II. 11/10, would buy again.			"

												I'll put it simply. Unless you've absolutely hated every hack-n-slash action-rpg from Diablo to Titan Quest, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.While Diablo 3 tried to reinvent the genre with World of Warcraft design philosophies, Torchlight 2 takes an entirely different approach; They have taken all of the elements people loved about previous games in the genre, such as character building, generous piles of loot, and fast action-packed gameplay, perfected those elements and expanded upon them. The result is a true spiritual successor to the games many of us sank countless hours into.Strapped for cash? It's only $20. Lousy internet? There's Offline and LAN play. Crummy computer? It's so well optimized, you could run it on a laptop. Anything you don't like about the game? It FULLY supports modding and the steam workshop.			"

												I guess people might say this is just more of the same, but in my opinion, it's way better than the first one. Maybe it's because of it's open world nature, or the better loot, I'm not sure. After having played Diablo 3 I can tell you guys I had more fun playing this. The graphics are colorful and dark at the same time, which looks extremely good in motion. There are a lot of sidequests, more diverse and usable loot, fishing (of course), pets, skill trees, secrets, randomly generated levels, you name it. So yes, in a way it's more of the same, but at the same time it's much more polished and has a higher fun factor than the first one, and D3.Finishing everything could take you 20+ hours, but most of us will probably finish it around 14-16 hours. And then there's New Game+...What I basically mean is; Torchlight II equals fun ![Rating: 89/100]			"

												Torchlight II reminds me of a couple of other typical ""looter"" games such as ""Diablo"" or the latest F2P game ""Path of Exile"". However, a few features ultimately standout from these other games which is why I highly recommend this game over the others. First, you do not have to be a diehard gamer in order to play this game. There are 4 difficulty tiers, and even the second tier (normal) feels relatively easy to an experienced player, even if you have never played another looter-type game. Second, since it is mainly a point-and-click-RPG game, one may believe they would get tired of the game after but a few moments. This is hardly the case as all the little features and nuances work beautifully together to bring you an experience that is immediately rewarding and highly addictive unlike other alternatives. Lastly, while it is a relatively fast-paced game, it seems to be more manageable in the gameplay department across the board for any player in comparison to what I have seen from Path of Exile. This just further demonstrates that just because it is free, does not mean that is better for you in the long run. Oh, and the best part is...I've only been talking about the single player experience. This game also possesses a co-op feature so you can play through the story with several friends, or even random strangers. Player trading is also included, so expect hours to pass by if you play this game with people you enjoy being around and love killing creatures with them. Now Torchlight II does have a few odd in-game features to it I've noticed. For one, the blood animations do not seem even remotely realistic (even by fantasy standards). You could kill an enemy and they would first explode followed by the entire wall being entirely covered in blood...which the wall could be 10 times your size and your enemy's size, so this makes absolutely no sense. Also, the enemies sometimes get stuck in the most random places, which allows you to easily snipe them and pick away at their health continuously if you like utilizing a ranged character and those style tactics. I've already done this with a few mini-bosses and laughed all the while. Lastly, I honestly wish I did not have to click for every attack. I wish there was some auto-attack feature after you have targeted an enemy, but this is just me being nit-picky at this point. If you notice, these are just minor issues as well. I have seen no major problems or adversities to mention from this game so far as you can plainly see as well.Ultimately, Torchlight II provides a unique, personalized, open world experience which gives games such as the Diablo series a run for its money, especially when it is on sale in the steam store. I highly recommend picking this game up when it is on sale, as you will not be disappointed with the many hours you will invest into this game alone or with friends. Now, excuse me as I go bandage up my index finger for the next extensive click-fest that I am about to perform in this game.			"

Product received for free
What Is Torchlight II?Torchlight II is one of those wildly popular Steam games which hardly requires any introduction for fans of isometric-style action RPG's. Developed by Runic Games in 2012 as a more polished and refined version of its previous incarnation (Torchlight), it is widely hailed and beloved by scores of fanatical gamers (well over 3 million+) for its many favorable similarities to the equally popular Diablo series.The true hallmark of this title however, is that the sprawling world it offers to you on a very reasonably priced silver platter is a gorgeously inviting one awaiting to be explored to its fullest....tempting you with countless secrets to uncover & treasures to collect. In fact there is more loot to be found hidden within its myriad of locations than you could possibly wrap your mind around. It's easily one of those gems with which you can sink hundreds of hours into, since it offers level randomization for enhanced replayability inside of its open world system...one which includes weather as well as day/night cycles incidentally.GameplayFeaturing a very tight local + online co-op mode (in addition to solo offline play), you'll soon notice that you will be introduced to a diverse bounty of seemingly never-ending quests & side-quests given to you by those who require your assistance in one way or another. And fortunately, you'll have a ferocious pet by your side to help out in battle as needed, one who even possesses its own inventory!  In addition to the exploration and loot collecting, your primary objective will be to battle against a wide assortment of variously menacing monsters as you gradually level up your character with more skills, gold, and gear during this compelling campaign. Action is very fluid, brisk, and energetic...with a satisfying number of both weapon upgrades and weapon types (including melee & guns) to keep you more than entertained.Both your mana (ie. energy) and health bars will be depleted during combat, and must be replenished as necessary with collected vials which can be used up at any time.Character customization is present, although somewhat limited and basic in scope I felt. It's probably the most glaring aspect of the game which could have been improved further still. Nonetheless, it is still present at least, and you'll have your choice of either male/female characters spread across 4 distinct classes: Embermage, Outlander, Berserker, Engineer.Level design was quite impressive & varied in an overall sense, with some specific areas like the dungeons being especially atmospheric. It was quite a joy for me to explore every single nook & cranny of each individual section traversed as I hunted around for items to collect between waves of enemies....who themselves were sufficiently unique enough throughout the campaign so as to not feel repetitious in any way.There is just so very much to do in the game, and even after investing a few quality hours into it, there was an undeniable feeling that I've still only barely scratched the surface as to what awaits me further into its story.GraphicsWhat I especially appreciated about the presentation, is that this world is surprisingly vibrant in color as opposed to being dreary & muted looking in appearance as some other such similar games are. Which is then reinforced furthermore by the distinctly cartoon-style graphics found here. This in turn is all neatly tied together by a very well-done lighting system which somehow breathes a sense of intriguing realism into this magical place. All in all, it is quite pleasant on the eyes and sports a unique charm to it. And best of all, there are an ample number of graphics options available for fine-tuning your display preferences.AudioVoice acting was definitely above par, and sounded quite slick for the many varied characters present. (Although at times I felt that your character's obsession with his depleted mana levels was a bit overly-repetitive!). Whereas music itself was mellow & symphonic in nature...wonderfully balancing out the mood of each particular scene in an appropriate manner. And finally, sound effects were more than adequate in accomplishing their task of enhancing immersion...especially so with delightful effects such as thunder reverberating through the rainy night, for example. Steamified?It fully is, and includes both trading cards and a whopping 119 achievements to be unlocked.DLCNone available.ModsThe vast collection of available mods via the Steam Workshop is where this game truly shines like no other. There are literally hundreds of them to choose from in every possible category imaginable, and quite honestly you could find pretty much anything your little heart desires here.Verdict - 9/10Torchlight II has to be one of the best values out there in ARPG's...because while it only costs a fraction of what its pricier triple-A competitors do, it nonetheless very much competes as one, and more importantly, feels like one with its overhauled & redesigned user-interface which was a breeze to use. Accessibility is fantastic here as well, showcasing a streamlined and mostly straight-forward character leveling system which I greatly appreciated. Because being hopelessly confused inside of skill trees is not my personal idea of a fun time, and here, they most certainly get it right in steering the focus onto actual gameplay instead. And along with its multiple difficulty settings, just about anyone can enjoy what it has to offer...from the very casual side of the spectrum for those who simply wish to explore its scenery, all the way up to the no-nonsense hardcore setting for those veterans out there who wish to master its more subtle nuances. All in all, Torchlight II has underwent quite a lot of refinement to date, and runs at fantastic framerates even on less than cutting-edge hardware. But most of all, this is an exciting world to step inside of and one which you can very much have a great time with since there is always something interesting to do along with an accompanying sense of accomplishment felt as each goal is successfully completed...and that is why...I'll gladly rate this one a 9/10Pros:- Many hours of fun with lots to do and much to explore- Impressively designed & vast isometric world with vibrantly colorful aesthetics- Wonderfully implemented dynamic zoom camera- Nice selection of weapons + gear- Can play as both male or female- Great value for the purchase price- Rebindable keys- Impressive amount of adjustable graphics options- Local/online co-op + offline single-player - Steam achievements + trading cards- Countless mods available via the Steam WorkshopCons:- Character customization system could be more robust- Some of the character speech is repeated a bit too often For similar reviews and great giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com "

												*This review will be downvoted to hell by fans*Summary:Torchlight II clings to its Diablo series heritage like no other. It tries to be, at the same time, both fresh and familiar to fans of the genre. In the end, It’s just a cartoony Diablo II clone with elaborated gameplay mechanics. Both gives a mixture that seems appetizing but in reality is just stale and plain boring.6/10The Good :- Many, many weapons and items- Pets- Overally polished- Good musicThe Bad :- Very repetitive gameplay, even for hack'n'slash- Bland atmosphere and plot- Feels like cartoony clone of Diablo II- Dated graphicsI did not finish the game. My review follows these situations rarely. Even more rarely, I’m struggling to like something. This time, it’s Torchlight II.As serious as I can be, this fight ensued the moment I started the game and ceased when it ended up in a virtual dump. Don’t get me wrong, I adore hack’n’slash RPG’s.I absolutely loved Diablo I and more so, Diablo II. First part created the genre with gloomy atmosphere and revolutionary gameplay. The sequel had the magic to keep you clicking so many times, one would believe you’re testing mouse manufacturer’s claims of billion click durability. Torchlight II has neither. And here’s why.Right of the bat, Torchlight II shows resemblance to Diablo II. Made by the same author, the music is unmistakable. At first, I was glad because I really enjoy these notes but at the same time it prevents Torchlight to be unique. Several sounds, like opening a teleport, are basically cloned from Diablo II. Even the sequence of worlds and it’s hubs in TL are the same as Diablo II – wilderness, desert, dense forest, hell. And just like in Diablo II, our nemesis is a mysterious traveler that we’re always one step behind from. All of this takes away from Torchlight II. It’s just too familiar to call it a world of its own. It’s a copy with cartoony overlay which makes it neither dark and gloomy, nor light-hearted.As years passed, hack’n’slash games had to mutate it’s formula to remain fresh and attractive to gamers. Happily, Torchlight II has some tweaks and non-standard ideas, one of which is company of your pet. Essentialy, it’s your coop friend. There are several pets to choose from, all of which can pick and store items for you, wear accessories, fight, cast spells and last but totally not list, do a little shoppin while you bash evil’s head. You can also fish for, well, fishes that for reasons unknown, can transform your pet into a killing beast.As It goes for Diablo clones, you have a lot to choose from to do that. Beside leveling, getting a good equipment is the core element of action RPG’s. Torchlight II gives you –collecting sets, enchanting, socketing and putting in gems. Unfortunately, beside collecting and buying spells that can be used by any class, I can’t find anything that discerns Torchlight from other ARPG’s. Speaking of classes, I didn’t play every class. I focused mainly on Engineer. What I found out, is that I played through majority of the game using only 4 out of dozens. I’ve tried more variety but I’ve always ended up coming back to previous skills as they work best. So it all came down to getting the right equipment. Though you’ll encounter or buy many, many stuff it’s not that easy to find an upgrade. I’ve completed 3/4 of the game using just 3 ranged weapons with a single tactic. Single tactic, because even though monsters seem to vary much, the’re all killed the same. On hard difficulty I didn’t though that Tourchlight II is challenging, not even for a wihle)That said, it was hard to not get bored. Accompanied by generic maps, plot that isn’t worth mentioning (which I won’t) and repetitiveness with no challenge, I was struck with remorse while playing Torchlight II. Remorse that told me, that time with Torchlight II could be spent way better or at least on a superior game. Torchlight II is an OK ARPG, that excels in mediocrity. If ARPG’s are your thing, you could bite the bullet, especially that it’s dirt cheap now, but don’t say that I didn’t warn you. "

												Works like Diablo 2, feels like Diablo 2, awesome as Diablo 2. A whole lot better than Diablo 3 Vanilla xDPlays alot better if you install it with the Synergies MOD, which is an awesome overhaul of the entire game [Has Raiding! XD]. You will definitely sink alot of hours into this if you like dungeon crawlers.			"

												After getting to the point where i was forcing myself to play it, just to see how far i could get, i finally decided to take a break from this game.what it get's right, it really gets right. the music is amazing, in these types of games i usually throw on my own music, but i had NO problem listening to this for hours on end. the graphics are stylish, and overall the presentation is pretty great.but i have one major problem, abilities. OH. MY. GOD.in other games of this type (diablo, PoE, Marvel Heroes) there are a plethora of abilities, and each one adds to the game in some way. there may be certain ones that are better than others, but you can work your build into a fun playstyle.this game treats abilities as an after thought. right now ive got an engineer that pretty much just swings his hammer over and over. now it might sound like im nitpicking, but in other games there is usually a variety in combat. there is nothing new here at all. a bubble. flame hammer. electric aoe.my other characters have similar problems, the abilties are flashy, unoriginal, and just plain boring. you will find yourself playing for hours on end, using the same boring moves over and over, and as you level up you don't unlock anything that really gives you that ""now im a badass"" feeling.now this is all personal preferance, but i felt like making a review because i find this game to be so much more boring than any other dungeon crawler ive ever played.get path of exile, it looks good, it's free, and most importantly IT""S FUN.very dissapointed in this promising game.

												For those of us who are against Blizzard (or even if you're not) and enjoy diablo style gaming, this would be a great choice for you. The character options are pretty straight forward, and the gameplay is quite fun in multiplayer. If you're in the market for a point and click rpg with steampunk elements, you should buy this game.

												Torchlight 2, simply one of the best addictive  hack and slash ARPG  that I've ever played in a long time. Especially after you go through the vanilla Torchlight 2 and you're deciding on which mods to get  I would highly  suggest on picking up the synergies mod which basically  revamped the whole game with new enemies,stronger loots, endgame contents and  additionally new and old classes you can choose from. Torchlight 2 is a game where you can play with your friends and explore multiples of dungeons and contents. The price for this game is worth it and I would recommend getting this game and giving this a shot.                                                                                               "

												An awesome game if you can get a friend or two to play it with. These kinds of games, to me, are only fun when you have others to play with. If not, they seem kind of empty and dull. One of my friends that I bought a copy for stopped playing after a short while and never got through the first half of Act 2. I played for a bit, but lost interest shortly after because of it. Online multiplayer is a coin toss as servers hosted are either private, specific mod enabled, or cheatery. However, the game itself is great. I played by myself for a bit and got to Act 3. There's a good variety of mobs and bosses. Also, the replay value of the game is decent too. The layout changes when you create a new character or re-roll the world making it seem pretty new. New landmarks appear or move around a bit. The items and shops are great in-game. The balance is pretty reasonable but can be broken by using certain items together. I had a lower level 20-ish ranged class with dual pistols that would roll over anything up until around the 40's because of certain sockets that were stacked thanks to being able to transfer items between characters. Hardcore mode and mods from the steam workshop fix this up pretty quick.If you don't mind playing solo, this game is great. It can be compared to Diablo 2 styled gameplay. The graphics are a bit more colorful and less grim, but the feeling is there. If you have some reliable friends to play with, you'd probably have a much better time and get to the fun bits that really start happening around the end of Act 2 and into Act 3.			"

												Torchlight's actual storyline and most major quests can be completed in ~15-20 hours. However, the extra content that takes more grinding is the real meat of this game. Acquiring end-game loot to make yourself a raidboss is the final destination. My experience with this game is that at first it's quite disorienting, however with more gameplay it gets better, but also becomes very robotic . I do like the graphics and the storyline of the game as well as the variety of different settings and monsters you face. However, if you don't like grinding this game may not be for you. I would recommend this game if it's on sale, but if it were bought for full price I don't think it's worth it.I like the fact that you can Co-op, however in co-op worlds the max amount of players is 4 and whatever you accomplish in that co-op world isn't translated over to your singleplayer, so it's best to keep quests finished in singleplayer first. My impression of the community is that there's a bunch of super dedicated players and keep to themselves a lot and if you're not dedicated you can't break the ice with them. Another awesome feature is that the workshop really brings out a whole new environment for the game. Extra classes, extra abilities,the workshops are a must visit if you want to experience this game fully.Some downsides do include that the combat interface/system isn't explained at first and you're just dropped in a place and you're expected to know how to fight. Maybe a tutorial at first wouldn't hurt. With this being said, the learning curve isn't actually that great if you've played any RPG before. There are 4 basic stats each helping a certain feature and beneficial for certain classes.In summary, I think this game has some great features, the main storyline replayability isn't that high, but the workshops and the extra after the storyline quest grinding will be what you spend most of your time on. I rate this game a good 8/10 for $5.49, maybe lower if it's going for $21.99.			"

												I've not played a hack and slash rpg for a long time and had felt the itch recently. 34 hours later and I think the itch is scratched for now.Torchlight 2 is a fantastic game if you have fond memories of Diablo 2 and in a lot of way it is a superior game. It is very streamlined and well paced,  the soundtrack is really atmospheric and the skills system was fun for me as a Berserker, having had the most fun in D2 with the Assassin.It is so much more polished, but that is sort of what I think kind of detracts from the game. The economy is so tight, that money was always a concern even in the late game. It makes purchases even later mean much more, but I just didn't like that aspect of the game.The way set items and uniques are distributed also never felt as satisfying as I think they should have. This might be me misremembering how it was in D2, but a lot of uniques were not as good as just some random enchanted items.Lastly this is the first time where I have skipped the story entirely. I got the gist that there's guardians and an alchemist and a netherlord, but from the opening cinematic I was not hooked. The simply shaded cartoony style just didn't click with me at all. I almost feel like a Warcraft 3 in game cinematic might have been better.Despite those things, I recommend this game to fans of the genre and newcomers. I think they did a good job of streamlining the formula, but I kind of missed some of the broken tropes of it's predescessors.			"

Hack & Slay is the name of the game, and it feels just as satisfying as the rich booty from those battles. The enemies and surroundings are diverse enough, and some bosses look relatively awesome. I say ""relatively"" because overall, the graphics have not aged well. On the other hand, the music is still excellent. Dialogues are short and do not involve any important decisions or moral dilemmas, which is an advantage because the voice acting is mostly sub-par. Grim Dawn is superior in this regard and managed to create a lot more depth of atmosphere (e.g. the Steampunk setting with fireweapons side by side with swords and maces is more plausible in a post-apocalyptic scenario - Torchlight does not bother with giving you that kind of background). Also, it is four years younger and has better graphics. If in doubt which one you should play, I would prefer Grim Dawn. Nevertheless, Torchlight II is well done, it offers consistently engaging gameplay and character progression as well as several options for you to keep on playing after finishing the main story. The feature that you can use your pet as a connection to town markets is not realistic, but innovative and conveniently saves your hero some annoyingly repetitive errands, which is why I make this honorary mention here. I recommend this game to fans of the genre and give it a 7/10 in this comparison group. "

												Torchlight II is easily one of the best Action RPGs that you can play right now and that has been released in recent years. It also happens to be one of my all-time favorite games. With the FREE play event going on now through Sunday 1PM PST, you owe it to yourself to play this great Runic game and see why its so highly rated. One awesome feature is that you can play this game in Offline Mode, a great way to pass time when having internet issues. It contains great character classes, very fun skills to use, and so much shiny loot to pick up that your head will explode. Also don't forget about the fishing. :)It just gets better with the addition of Steam Workshop now that there is a great amount of content that has been converted and updated using this format. While it does suck that you can only run the game with a total of ten active mods, you can have steam workshop track and auto-update fifty mods in total.Thankfully, skilled users have become quite successful at releasing compilations that help bypass this limit and enhance your gaming experience with lots of active mods such as the fantastic work done by Bandit in his ""Combine Them All"" mod. :)Another great feature Runic added is that the game separates your original-stock and workshop-mod characters into different save folders and cloud saves. This makes it very easy for you to play your high level stock characters online with others for those purist out there. Then you restart your game in mod mode and play with your friends online using your modded characters. If you're modded toons are like mine, they will be custom classes such as ""Necromancer"" and ""Warlock"" from the SynergiesMOD by Salan or ""Ninja"" and ""Ronin"" from the Far East Pack by Zyph.I can recommend a nice list of workshop mods that play very well together and enhance your game even further once you have beaten the standard version of the game. It's what I use when playing online or offline to help me relax, unwind, and clear my head from design fatigue. One of these days I'll get around to posting them as a Collection in the Steam Workshop when I have more free-time between designing games. TIP: I highly recommend that if you play modded games on-line with your friends that you synch your game mods and the order they are loaded beforehand to eliminate most on-line problems. The easiest way we found to do this was share a zip file of all the mods we would use with a text file listing the mods priority when loading them if anybody joining didn't have them. We would not include large and popular mods such as SynergiesMOD, Far East Pack, and Enhanced Retex, but we would note the version number in the text file. There are a few mods that don't work well together or on-line, but we've been able to play the majority of them in different combinations as long as we followed this tip.TIP: While the Steam Cloud synch tends to do a good job overall, sometimes it can fail and override your local copy of your saved game with an outdated one from the Steam Cloud. What I've done is keep a secondary backup of my saved games so when that happens, I can easily replace the cloud copy with my current local backup. The default location for the Torchlight II saved games is at ""My Documents\My Games\Runic Games\Torchlight 2\"". You want to backup the ""save"" and ""modsave"" folders regularly especially if you play the game frequently in offline mode.Hopefully someday we will get a remastered HD version of the game but I will settle for Torchlight III. =)			"

												You can't talk about Torchlight 2 without talking about Diablo 3, and I can't talk about Diablo 3 without feeling morose and amused. Blizzard have developed a lot of my favourite video games, though they are not the developer that I once loved. Diablo 3's release was a joke and shows the folly of imposing always online in a game that does not need it. I find it worrying that Blizzard, Activion Blizzard now I suppose, are helping set this precedent of very heavy handed DRM.Torchlight 2 is fun, cheap, can be played in offline mode and has a lan mode. I like that hoarding ember has been discouraged in the game and I like all of the classes. It was pretty silly that I had to use autohotkey in Torchlight as key bindings for abilities could not be changed but thankfully this is different in Torchlight 2. Mod support has vastly increased the life of the game for me. I've not even progressed past the second area as I've spent so much time playing around with community created classes and such in hardcore mode.I'd reccommend purchasing and playing this video game, especially when it is on sale for <£10.

												Torchlight II is a game for anyone who likes RPG, hack and slash, diablo 3 type games. It has plenty of quests to keep you busy, big areas to discover and plenty of achievements to try and get! It will keep your butt hooked on the computer for hours. Plus, adding subscriptions in the workshop helps play with different classes such as the Elemental Blade Dancer, or have Navi from Legend of Zelda be your pet! Fun to play on your own or bring friends along for the ride! Normal get's you ready and prepared to play harder difficulties. It is challenging so buy mana and health potions!

												I would recommend Torchlight 2 before the recent patch and subsequent expansion of Diablo 3. Now I'll do the same not because it's a better game but because of the price and reliability of Steam Workshop. If you want an experience much more bright and somehow less serious this is the game for you! If you like hack-and-slash games you should not miss this one by any means. Hours of fun in Vanilla and possibly another hundred exploring the vast Workshop library wanting new ways to play the game. Some mods offer total immersion, new classes, new weapons and new skills.  The only thing that can ruin the experience is the fact that vanilla characters and mod characters can't interact, but of course for obvious reasons.Go ahead and play it! And if possible buy it with some special discount (seriously steam does that very often).			"

After you beat the game, you get to buy maps in-game that you can explore quest-free, and that's when the multiplayer gets fun! This game is a great continuation of Torchlight, and I would definitely suggest getting both!			"

Upgrade your armor armor and weapons in a million ways. Make your character an elite killing machine. Teach your pet spells and watch him make monsters explode in clouds of red mist and gore.

I cannot wait for the 3rd installment, so much replayability, plenty of great end game content, soooo much fun on hard difficulties, a lot of mods made for this which can spice up another play style.  For the price of $20 and even cheaper on special you would be stupid to pass that offer up.  It really is it's only genre of RPG, fast paced, rotating maps, awesome features, a huge talent tree with so many possibilities and so many bosses as well.  I'd seriously agree that it's metascore is 88/100!!  Must Buy!			"

												WARNING- I have only played up to part way through act 2 of this game, but I have experience with all classes. I have not played the multiplayer.If you like ARPGs, you have probably already bought this game, so do not need to to recommend it to you. I don't. For what it's worth, Torchlight II is much better than it's predecessor, consisting of better, meatier combat as well as multiplayer and better difficulty. As an ARPG, it is near perfection, but as a game I find it somewhat lacking. Weapons like the shotgun and cannon could be meatier, and fighting with a melee character seems to lack impact. The game attempts to seem open world, but considering that I would have to clear out every area simply to keep up with levels, it misses the point entirely. In my opinion, the point of open world is that things are OPTIONAL- you could explore the nearby cave, or you could not. Removing that basically makes the concept useless. Mobility is done well, with dodging a powerful blow feeling very satisfying and fun, however there are some attacks that simply curve around to hit me again, removing the satisfaction. Bosses are similarly very satisfying, but also very dangerous and difficult to avoid- with a great feeling when you beat them.The skill system is not innovative, but generally well done- nothing more to say here. The dark music provides an interesting contrast to the cartoony art style, but I feel that the story simply isnt dark enough to fully support that contrast. However, most of the problems mentioned before are nitpicking, and the main game is stellar for its genre.If you like ARPGs, you will love this game, but it wont turn you onto the genre if you hate them.

												I've been wanting a Diablo style game that runs natively on Linux for quite a while and I'm very happy I found this.  Diablo players will be right at home with this one as the interface is very similar (and better in some ways).  After playing only 15 minutes of it I was hooked, this game really nails the hack and slash style.  I like how when you kill enemies with a critical they explode in to a bloody mist.  The combat really feels brutal at times, and the game is quite challenging, even on Normal.  As one of the other reviewers said, this is what Diablo III should have been, and the fact that they've added native Linux support is amazing.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone, especially at $21.99, with the amount of gameplay and the quality of the graphics and level design, it feels like a steal.			"

												If you liked Torchlight I then you'll LOVE Torchlight II. Everything that made the first game good they've expanded upon greatly! One problem I had with the original game was the dull worlds, it felt like another Legend of Zelda style ""here's the five elemental area type"" worlds, I don't have that problem with this game whatsoever! Vast landscapes that are pretty different from one another. This game definitely gives off more of the open-world feel than the ""this dungeon is way too big"" vibe that Torchlight I and Fate had.

												Defnitely fun, especially now that you can group up with friends.  I love the graphic artwork.  It's cartoony without being silly.  Controls and learning your way around the game mechanics can be a sharp learning curve, but it becomes real easy when you've had a little time with it.  Item management can be a chore, but having your pet able to sell items while you continue to run around makes it much easier.  Much better than Diablo, imho and definitely can't go wrong with the price.			"

												Everything and more!Torchlight was one of the best hack and slash RPG's to come out between the release of Diablo II and Diablo III. It had us turning our head, if even for a short time, and (if your a fan) rejuvenated our love of the genre with its colorful graphic's, epic loot, and random dungeon generator. While it was fairly generic it hit all the right notes, and except for multiplayer, was the perfect game to play till the release of Diablo III. Then Diablo III released....... Well while some did enjoy it, LOT's of players hated it (not a fan myself) and quickly Torchlight's predecessor was to the rescue.Now with a full multiplayer mode, modding capability, and overall improvements to the gameplay, Torchlight II is a fantastic sequel to the colorful h&s RPG from a few years ago. However there are some problems. Multiplayer is great to have if you want to play with friends, or have a small group on the net that regularly play. However if you expect the multiplayer to be as fully featured as games like Diablo III, Path of Exile, or hell even Diablo II you may be hard pressed. Its pretty much just a list of people playing and if you want to play with them you can, however most games are locked with a password and the games that do have people playing don't allow you to chat with them or anything before joining to find out what there doing. In fact you can only chat in game which kinda sucks if you want to set up quick runs or do any kind trading. As of late the multiplayer is pretty much dead. Overall I have to say that Torchlight II's multiplayer is not going to be the biggest draw for most fans of the genre. If you play games like Path of Exile or Diablo III for multiplayer Torchlight II may not be for you.However the overall improvements to the gameplay overshadow some of the multiplayer woes. Simple little improvements and details are what make Torchlight II's gameplay different from other's in the genre. While it will feel familiar to anyone who has played a h&s RPG, things like being able to equip not only a sword but dual wield it with a gun or any other single handed weapon give you the need to experiment with you character. Other things like your pet, make life a little easier for your dungeon crawling hero. Your pet can buy items in town, sell loot you find in dungeons, provide extra storage, and even help you in combat. You can also choose what pet you would like (including a freaking headcrab!).But the crowing achievement of Torchlight II is its just downright fun gameplay. You will never run out of things to do in Torchlight, Literally. While the games story is fairly generic (pretty much taken straight from Diablo II) the colorful environments epic enemies, fun boss fight, and funny cameos and homages make Torchlight II's story campaign all the more worth it. What most will love however is what you unlock after beating the game. You can just go ahead and do a (New Game +) which allows you to start the game over at your current level and fight tougher enemies throughout. Or you can decide to stay in the Mapworks which is the final hub world. It has all you need with every type of shop and merchant and one particular merchant that gives you random dungeons to buy. You can play these dungeons pretty much forever collecting loot and fighting bosses. This give Torchlight infinite playablity. Modding is also a big part of Torchlight II. Some people have already created epic mods that act as entire expansions to the game giving you plenty of more hours of gameplay. Modders have also fixed some of the issues with the game like, not being able to re-spec your character at will. While I have not done really any modding I am looking forward to playing some mods later on.Overall Torchlight II is well worth the 20$ price tag (oh did I forget to mention it's only 20$). Its somewhat lacking multiplayer cant overshadow the excellent hack and slash gameplay. If your like me and mostly play these kind of games for the singleplayer, you owe it to yourself to buy this game. At least give it a chance and get it when its like 5 bucks, trust me its worth it.Thanks for reading!			"

												If you enjoy the kill-fest that is the likes of Diablo II and Borderlands 1&2 then this game is up your alley. It has interesting classes to choose from, in depth skill trees, and is a challenge, which is rare this day and age.I logged well over 100 hours into the first torchlight and will definitely do the same with this one. They refined and improved upon the original formula to make non-stop fun. Implemented new features that are gladly welcomed by me. I wholly enjoy the mod support that this game has, even though i haven't installed any yet.The art style is such a welcome change from most newer games. The bright and solorful enviroments are fun and striking to explore. You won't be tired and bored of playing this game like so many other games here recently.They added new pets ( mostly pack mules) to the mix which aren't as weak and useless as the previous installments. The new game plus feature is also a great addition so you don't have to retire a character to start over now. The loot variety seems to also be increased so you don't come across the same item as much.Pros: Enemies, gear, gameplay, visuals, and enviroment.Cons: Targeting system is sometimes wonky, skill trees are unforgiving. That's pretty much my only two faults.			"

												  Bear in mind i haven't played the first one, Torchlight 2 is a absolute blast to play. The visuals/setting is stunning, the different colours are lush and vibrant and the characters designs are great. Sadly, there is not much lore in this game, maybe some background knowlage would be nice so i could find out why the zeraphesh people wear those golden face masks, aside from the obvious.  Gameplay is nothing special, as i played the game and finished my playthrough using nothing but clicks. But it's what you expect from a genre like this, so i'm not complaining. The pet system was excellent, as it saves me the trouble from having to run back and forward to the nearest town. Playing with a friend was great, and had a very minor exception of a connection issue, but that easily could have been on my part.A very great game to have overall.			"

It doesnt matter on which difficulty you play. The Enemies will get hard to kill but you dont get more EXP it just takes longer and you can make the achievements, also the drop rate doesnt encrease so if you just want to play the story then normal or easy is enough.The Story is just there to fill the breaks between the towns nothing special.ConclusionIt a awesome game with nice graphics and good animations for the skills. The maps can be always new generated so you dont have to move with every class on the same map. But if you want to make all 100 lvls then do it on the easy difficulty.			"

												Crowborn's Review of Torchlight II-Ever since I was a boy, and got my hands on Diablo 1, I have been a fan of the hack-n-slash game-genre. Something about the game strung a cord inside of me, and I played it almost non-stop for years. Same with the sequel - it kept me busy through highschool and sane in the awkward years following when I was rampaging through life, trying to figure out what the 'eck I wanted to do. And so arrived the highly anticipated 3rd installment of the Diablo genre - to lackluster reviews. I picked it up immediately of course, but I were never able to enjoy it. It just seemed off to me, seemed strange, like an orange growing on an apple-tree, trying to fit in with the smooth green skinned fellas around it. But for me it failed at the deceit, and I put down the game after playing it for only a few months. Dissapointed and bereft of one of my favourite genres, I started looking around for substitutes. That's when I heard about Torchlight II.I had noticed the series before, but for some reason never gotten around to trying it out. It was supposed to be a fairly good diablo-clone, and while I liked the genre, it wasn't until one of my dear steam-friends gifted me the game, that I actually managed to sit down and play it. I felt obliged to, so to say. And my were I pleasantly surprised!Torchlight II is a really well made game. From the steam-punkish world, cross the interesting skill-sets, to the actio-packed maps - this game just breathes fun game design. Granted, the game is 'very' much a Diablo-clone, and anyone who ever played those games will immediately find everything intimately familiar. But that's not a bad thing. In fact, I find it darned good. I didn't have to read a bible of game-guides before daring to venture out in the the world of Torchlight, and hack and slash my way through the first pack of monsters I came across. It granted me immediate satisfaction and loads of fun.It feels to me like the devs of this game did right, what the guys at Blizz did wrong. Torchlight II follows to a point the tried and true old recipe of hack-n-slash. They don't try to reinvent or alter the genre, but instead stick to what works and 'has' worked for the last two decades. You got your attribute-points, your skill-points, random loot, runes and enchantments to upgrade your gear, rewarding exploration, and a story-line that doesn't distract you from your dungeon-delving fun.The game hearkens back to the good old days, and gives the players exactly what they expected - and a little more. It deserves a top grade, but due to an at times non-transparent stat-system and unbalanced characters, I have to subtract a few points. I give it:8.5/10			"

												This game is a little different than the standard 3rd person action RPG. It takes the best of the genre and puts an original spin on it, giving the player the option of very unique classes and weapons. The universe is very quirky and somewhat irreverent, which is something I absolutely love about this game. The mods available are numerous and help make the replayability extremely high. To top it off, the mechanics, graphics, and menus are all very well done! I highly recommend it!			"

Love the music, love the fast paced gameplay and the fact that this game is not afraid to reward you. There is so much to do in this game, and so many ways to customise your build. This brings me back to Diablo II where you could play however the hell you wanted and not completely gimp yourself, thats build diversity.If you want to play an action packed dungeon crawler, this is it.

												Although this game at first impression doesn't look much excitement but once you played it. It's freaking awesome! And also the community is great. One of the best way to enjoy this game is always play online because it's so much more fun killing mobs together with other player. I just started playing this game and never had much experience but it's easy to learn. Definitely recommend this game!			"

												Holy Smokes,I knew this game was gonna be good, but it far surpassed my expectations. I've spent around 20 hours so far on this game just looking for treasure. Now I'm a real sucker for ""dungeon hunter"" style games; and I have to say this is beyond satifying. I, as a player, am encouraged to uncover every inch of the map, I kill every enemy and open all chests to see what they have to offer. The pets feel like companions, not just second inventories, they help you fight and you can even teach them spells (my hawk can summon skeletons and shoot fireballs). It also has fulfilling side quests and achievments. There are also many references to other games and movies; so far I've come across what I believe to be a Minecraft reference and a reference to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Bottomline this is a great game that's enjoyable in both single player mode and co-op mode; it has plenty to offer and for a ridiculously low price for what it's worth.Highly Recommended			"

												I would like to preface this by noting that I have not played Torchlight 1. Due to the fairly close release dates, comparisons to Diablo 3 are inevitable.Torchlight 2 is basically Diablo 2 with more kiddy/cartoony 3D graphics. The game uses a fairly similar skill tree system to D2. For better or worse, investing points become permanent, so you'd best be committed to a build. Fortunately there are some mods that enable one to redo choices without triggering the cheating flag, but it's still something I'd rather avoid altogether. Meanwhile Diablo 3 allows you to 'respec' at will, which to be honest, is quite nice.I dabbled in all the classes, but I mostly played the Engineer and the Archmage. The class balance isn't too bad, but on higher difficulty levels, I'm not sure how one is expected to survive as a melee character. I even tried pure Vitality builds, and monsters still whack you down fast. In D3 melee characters are surprisingly sturdy.Leveling speed is pretty good. Every time I start a character it feels like I'm blowing through levels. Even in D3 with an exp gem in the helm, a Hellfire Ring and 10 Monster Power, leveling doesn't feel as fast as T2.Multiplayer T2 has been... iffy. Even months after release, I found desyncs happen, even with their servers being far less crowded. Somehow Diablo 3 manages to be playable despite all the nonsense that goes on the screen.I'm sad that Torchlight 2 had very little story. I was expecting this grand quest of discovery, only to be met with staple busy work. The quests were largely ""kill monster, get reward."" Heck, I already forgot what the game was about. Even if it's not the point of the game, I'd still like more compelling reasons to play.When you reach the end, you get to play New Game Plus, which mainly just ups the level of game and you retain everything. To be honest, this did not interest me at all. D3's approach is to go with an extra 100 bonus character levels, which also is not appealing.The verdict? If you had to choose I'd have to say Diablo 3 is the superior game, especially if you can get it on one of their 50% off sales. D3 offers more classes, considerably more spells, better graphics, sound, story, even replay. Biggest downsides are the 10 character limit and permanent online status. "

												Torchlight II is cheap, fun, and addicting what's not to love about that?+ Beautiful Visuals: Torchlight II probably offers one of the most broad color palettes of any game ever with maybe the exception of Borderlands 2, the visuals are simple yet beautiful and stand apart from most other games in their own way.+ Wonderful loot system: Being a huge fan of ARPGs (Diablo in particular) I can't help but love any game mechanic that showers me with items whenever I make something explode, this is a game that makes you work hard for those hard to find items but when you finally get them it makes it all worth it.+ Multiplayer: The multiplayer in Torchlight is wonderful and features a drop in drop out system so regardless of what level or what part of the campaign you're playing you can join your friends at any time. The game's single player is fun so throw in three buddies (Seven friends with a mod) and it's a blast a little hectic but still alot of fun.+ Accessable difficulty: I personally hate games being overly difficult that's just my personal opinion, I don't play games to be frustrated I play games to have fun so I was quite pleased when I found out that Torchlight has multiple difficulties ranging all the way from easy to rediculous there's something for everyone.+ System requirements: PC has a TON of great games, running all of them is a different story and the variety of great games with low system requirements grows smaller by the day it's nice that a game that is as much fun as Torchlight is can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone with a PC.+ Mods: Since it's release Steam has opened the Steam Workshop to it which has infinitely expanded it's gameplay it's options at this point are rather limitless.- Visually messy multiplayer: I personally don't have this problem but I've read about people complaining that multiplayer becomes visually 'messy' with multiple players so it's something to keep in mind if you're buying this to play with other people.- Sometimes loot drops feel slightly disproportionate: Sometimes it feels like loot drops from average enemies are just as lucrative as boss loot drops.- Story is pretty weak: Not that Torchlight is known for it's outstanding story but yeah it's pretty weak here.Torchlight is a wonderful bargain and overall an enjoyable experience that I suggest everyone try at least once.8.5/10Reasonable Price Point: This game has been a bargain since day one and it has a wonderful development team I would say at least $30 USD.

												Like a lot of people, I found myself constantly going back to Diablo 2 and replaying it. Hours of clicking away at monsters, building characters, etc. This managed to re-capture a lot of that fun for me. The game does have a cartoonish art style which may turn off some but definitely doesn't detract from the game. I found the story to be fun and was happy when I completed it. It took me around 30ish hours or so to complete, but I do explore as much as possible and kill as many monsters as possible. The character classes all have 3 different skill trees to build out. I played through with the engineer (support, utility) myself. There is also the berszerker (warrior), outlander (ranger), embermage (caster). If you check out some of the stuff on steam works, you can also get additional classes through mods. End game you get the option to start over via New Game + (ala Chrono Trigger) where the game scales to a level range based on your level. They also have the mapworks option where you purchase maps from a vendor (with gold in game) which can be fun and have various buffs/debuffs to them. On top of that, this game still supports both internet and LAN play which is great. Definitely a solid buy for the price.			"

												I'm VERY impressed with Torchlight 2.  As far as ARPG's go this one is definetly my favorite. The world is huge, there are plenty of monsters to fight and TONS of loot to be had. There are up to 4 classes you can play, You also can have a pet companion or a minion and there are a few to choose from. There are also a fantastic amount of skills you can pick  from to help you along in your slaying. I was sold on the fact that there is offline single player, but you can play multiplayer co-op as well if that suits your fancy. Graphically the game is cartoony but is well done and looks good. The interface works very well and everything is bindable so no problems there either. The music compliments the game very well, adding a good amount of atmosphere. The price is $20 which is incredible for the amount of polished game you get,  so by all means grab this title, you won't be disappointed.			"

												So far, my time with Torchlight II has been great. The system requirements are not high so I can run it rather easily, which is rare for me nowadays. There are also a lot of mods for it which can really change the game to your liking; for instance, if there are new things you want in the game or things you simply don't like and want to remove, you can do that. This game could be even more fun if you play it with your friends. However, like most ""Diablo-esque"" games, it gets repetitive, but much like Borderlands 2, the loot keeps you coming back for more. Something TL2 lacks though is an engaging story, so unlike Borderlands 2, the loot and online multiplayer are really the ONLY things that make you ignore the repetitious combat (i.e. 80-90% of the game, if not more); where as in Borderlands 2 the story was at the very least funny with loveable characters, the story in Torchlight II feels like a formality. The characters are just there so it isn't a game where you literally just run around and kill stuff. The story is similar to any average MMO storyline, if not worse. And while the voice overs from the main quest NPCs are a nice touch, the story is honestly not good enough for me to care about what they have to say.That said, Torchlight II has great character growth. Not only do you notice your character's strength increase, but you can build your character in many different ways. Each class has 3 unique skill ""pages"" (They aren't really trees because you're pretty much free to spec into any skill provided you have the appropriate level), each with a bunch of abilities both passive and active, all of them interesting. My one nitpick with this is that not all skills are available to put skill points into from the get go. You must level up to unlock your skills. I suppose this is kind of the incentive to respec your character later on in the game, but I guess I'm lazy and don't like that idea. Hue.The combat system is nothing super amazing, it's pretty much faceroll keyboard smashing with little rhyme or reason. After all, the difficulty is strangely low for this kind of game. Maybe it's not fair to say that purely based on what I've heard about some difficulty levels in Diablo, but in my 13 hours playing this game, I have not died; even when I played the top tier of difficulty (not hardcore mode).Pros:-LOOT, BABY! LOTS O' LOOT!-Variety of weapon types and weapon sub-types-Medium replay value -Good character progression-Pets-Pets fight with you in combat-Pets can do basic shopping and selling for you-Online Multiplayer is fun-Low system requirements-Good graphics (not high tech, but nice to look at)-Can respec your skill points-Many different character builds-There's a class everyone will be interested in, despite only having four. And if you don't like them, find a mod that adds one that you do like!-Loads of mods to change your experience-Ravaging bosses with your friends is really fun-Loot is given out to you and you only; your friends don't see the loot that you see on the ground, but you can pick it up and drop it if you wish to give them the item.Cons:-NO SCYTHES. WTF MANG?! (Fo real doe, where did you put the scythes)-Pets are not really that useful; in combat they just basic attack your enemies unless you feed them fish, which can change them into a creature with better combat skills temporarily. Other than that, pets are just there for aesthetics.-Combat is not really skillful-Combat is repetitive, although not always boring-Story is a formality-Main quest related NPCs are forgettable even with voiced dialog-Vanilla inventory UI is just bad.-AI isn't too smart-The game is slightly overpriced (But I got it when it was on sale for 5 dollars hue hue hue u jelly bruh?)-With mods installed its kind of hard to find an online game room that is compatible with you (if the room leader doesn't have mod x active and you do have mod x active, you cannot see that room, at least as far as I'm aware)Overall, I'd say Torchlight II is worth buying, but wait for it to go on sale unless you have to play it right now/have extra cash laying around in your gold palace.**Disclaimer** I'm reviewing this game based almost entirely on my own likes and dislikes, not necessarily how it stacks up to other games in the same genre, which is probably bad but I haven't played many games like Torchlight II, Diablo, etc/don't give enough damns.

												Why do I enjoy this game soooo much more than Diablo 3? Because it is awesome!! Easy to pick up and play, fun to get through, even more fun to run through again with the Essesintails Mod Pack. Held my attention way better than Diablo 3 did though It doesn't have much in the way of story, WHO CARES HACK STUFF TO PIECES!! Great fun WoW style graphics, helpful pet item selling and buying for you, have yet to run into anything I don't like including any bugs. An amazing addition to the series and to any click-fest lovers library!			"

												Torchlight 2... What can I say about this game. Well one, Its good but not great. It has flaws like all games but its a mindless Hack'n'Slash game. Well maybe not always mindless.Much like the first torchlight its amazing when it comes to what the games does right, With a load of improvements and the addition of supported multiplayer (what players of TL1 wanted in the first place) makes the game a blast to play. The mods make it even better with adding new items to adding full additional maps and campaigns to the game.The diablo style gameplay makes it fun and easy to learn while keeping the player of edge with that ""next champion enemy"" always around the corner.The game dosn't lack loot either. What can I say? It has a lot of shiny stuff. People like shiny stuff. Its great, if you got some friends around you will enjoy it more or maybe you like single player more. Give it a shot.			"

												Torchlight's actual storyline and most major quests can be completed in ~15-20 hours. However, the extra content that takes more grinding is the real meat of this game. Acquiring end-game loot to make yourself a raidboss is the final destination. My experience with this game is that at first it's quite disorienting, however with more gameplay it gets better, but also becomes very robotic . I do like the graphics and the storyline of the game as well as the variety of different settings and monsters you face. However, if you don't like grinding this game may not be for you. I would recommend this game if it's on sale, but if it were bought for full price I don't think it's worth it.I like the fact that you can Co-op, however in co-op worlds the max amount of players is 4 and whatever you accomplish in that co-op world isn't translated over to your singleplayer, so it's best to keep quests finished in singleplayer first. My impression of the community is that there's a bunch of super dedicated players and keep to themselves a lot and if you're not dedicated you can't break the ice with them. Another awesome feature is that the workshop really brings out a whole new environment for the game. Extra classes, extra abilities,the workshops are a must visit if you want to experience this game fully.Some downsides do include that the combat interface/system isn't explained at first and you're just dropped in a place and you're expected to know how to fight. Maybe a tutorial at first wouldn't hurt. With this being said, the learning curve isn't actually that great if you've played any RPG before. There are 4 basic stats each helping a certain feature and beneficial for certain classes.In summary, I think this game has some great features, the main storyline replayability isn't that high, but the workshops and the extra after the storyline quest grinding will be what you spend most of your time on. I rate this game a good 8/10 for $5.49, maybe lower if it's going for $21.99.			"

												Coming from somebody that did play Diablo 2 back in the day (and wasn't as fond of it as other people), this game takes the typical frustrating aspects of that game and throws them out the window. While it's possible that Diablo 3 does some of these things as well, I'm afraid I haven't played that game yet. First, you can load up your pet with unwanted loot and send it back to town while in the middle of a dungeon to sell for you. Generally returning after two minutes. You can even have it purchase stuff in town for you, like potions or scrolls. It's so nice to not have to constantly port back to town to empty out my inventory. You also don't have to click on gold to pick it up. You just have to walk over it. I may never play Diablo 2 again after getting used to such a nice feature. You get a hotbar for skills. You don't even need to have potions take up space on it because pressing Z or X automatically uses your best healing or mana potion. So I can press 1 for a firestorm, press 2 for fire pillars, press 3 to summon a ghost, etc. It kinda feels like playing an MMO. You can find ambiguous spells on any character that you can have four of equiped at any time, offering some variety into your gameplay. Like a spell that summons a horde of zombies, or a simple fireball, or a passive buff to your EXP and gold earned. The really cool part is that your pet also gets four spell slots and will use any spells automatically when you get into a fight and they're off cooldown. I have my pet set to summon two hordes of zombies AND some skeleton archers, with a passive spell that increases his damage and shortens the time it takes for him to get back from town. There's so much this game does right that it makes me kinda disappointed that the devs have moved on to other projects and don't plan to update Torchlight 2 anymore. But still, the game has easy intigration built in for the modding community. Totally recommended.			"

												A nice ARPG. Has four distinctly unique classes and a decent length of storyline. I loved the diverse builds you can come up with and also the unique universe the game takes place in. Enemy Mobs are varied as much as the players are.I disliked the overpricing of in-game items though and the difficulty early on of earning money aside from grinding in Fishing Holes. Overall a nice game and well worth the price be it on sale or not.			"

With a very similar top-down style to Diablo, your gonna be reaping in all the rewards of fighting, exploring, and leveling up your character. It's even multiplayer!

												Experience of playing as 2-handed engy on Veteran Act III: ""wtf just hit me I'm dead""This game is good. From the soothing string music to humorous weapon descriptions, there is a lot to see and play.  Loot drops rate are just right. Game mechanics are tight and well done (aside from the armor system) You don't have to go crazy on grinding for a proper weapon. Unique-tier weapons look pretty cool and have great descriptions to boot. Their damage and stats also fit your requirements for reasonably long, unlike that one FPS where your purple-rarity gun does ♥♥♥♥ damage 2-3 levels later. Apples to oranges. I don't care.The inclusion of ""Arcane Stats"", where you can see your actual damage output, proc chances, actual armor after bonuses factor in, etc, is really, really useful. This helps a lot in planning your build, and you don't have to do convoluted calculations to find your optimum loadout, and try to figure out whether a particular bonus is additive, multiplicative, applied post-multiplication, blahblah.The UI is very well built, comparing gear is easy, organizing items is easy, weapon damage is listed in DPS (honestly, why the hell not).However, when it comes to the really-high difficulties (NG+ Veteran, NG Elite, Mapworks), the armor system starts to show some bad problems if you play a tanking class. Armor damage reduction is calculated point-by-point rather as a percentage. Meaning if you have 800 armor, you will reduce an incoming attack by 800 damage. To play a serious build during Elite NG++ levels, you will have to farm for damage reduction socketables if you plan on consistently not dying when a mob so much as breathes on you.To quote Cthon from the TL2 forums:""Armor is basically meaningless. Not only is it badly outscaled by monster damage, but its effectiveness is also reduced by any damage reduction you have. To be as charitable as possible to armor, it's reasonably effective early on before monster damage scaling really gets going. A player who only did the first playthrough and did not do mapworks or NG+ might not encounter very many situations where no feasible amount of armor makes a meaningful difference.""^This applies to anything above normal difficulty.Again, nobody cares about the story. Play on veteran mode if you've played RPGs before, normal is kinda easy.			"

Чудесная игра которая затягивает на часы.Игра вышла примерно в одно время с D3  для одних потерялась в тени старшего брата, для других - заменила его на троне.Классическая Action RPG (оно же Hack 'n' Slash) в стимпанковском сетинге.Здесь присутствует практически все за что любят жанр (по сути игру Diablo 2)+Толпы монстров, горы лута, инкрустация камней в оружие и броню, зачарование, простая и вариативная система прокачки, не обязательные\дополнительные подземелья, хардкорный режим с одной смертью. Система карт для высокоуровневых героев.+ Игру нужно проходить лишь дважды - ""Новая Игра+"" включает в себя несколько дополнительных подземелий, вполне себе интересных. В отличии от той же D2 с ее постепенно открывающимися 3 сложностями.- Чего тут нет, так это продвинутого мультиплеера. Сетевая игра работает по старой механике серверов, ни сезонов, ни лиг, можно поиграть вместе, обменятся мпредмметами и все.			"

												I don't play games 24/7 but I must say I was waiting day by day for the release of the new Torchlight, since I enjoyed the original so much. Forget the story and any role-playing, this is all about shooting monsters with an increasingly complex and bewildering array of weapons and skills. There may be only four classes but there are many ways to build each one, thanks to the enormous skills tree. Levelling is fast and furious in the beginning, but I do feel things bog down once Act III comes around. It can take a long time to improve your character, and I found I stuck with armor and weapons I had found a long time ago. With skills only incrementally improving, this is a bit dull. But still! there are always new monsters to kill. And I haven't even played multi yet. By the way, I recommend Veteran difficulty for the right blend of challenges.			"

												This is a pretty fun game in the vein of ""Diablo"": a good, solid RPG/Action title with a skill tree where you move your character around and click the jibbers out of various people, monsters, and so forth. The boss battles are intense, and I love the design of the world overall. It's got great art, the creature design is nifty, and the class concepts are pretty cool, too.I appreciate the pet, who, let's be honest here, you may be more concerned about its capacity as a pack animal than anything else. Yes, it works like that. You can even tell it to take what it has in its inventory back to town to sell. You don't always get the best price on things, but hey - what do you expect out of a bulldog/ferret/spider/whatever-the-heck you decided to pick? It also sometimes helps in combat, so it's not useless.Overall, I say this game is a sturdy 7.5/10. If you enjoyed the first two DIABLO games, definitely buy it, and if you find it on sale, then what are you waiting for? Get that game!			"

												Bem, vai ser um pouco dificil falar sobre Torchlight 2, já que é um jogo no estilo RPG, o meu estilo favorito de jogos. Então, sempre tenho muito a falar, mas dessa vez, irei dar uma breve resumida do que se trata o game.Não tem como falar de quaisquer jogos no estilo de RPG, sem mencionar o grande e poderoso Diablo. Pois bem, esse jogo aqui, em alguns quesitos, bate de forma relevante o Diablo 3, jogo mais atual da franquia. Como por exemplo o preço, Torchlight 2 é muito, mas muito parecido com Diablo 3 e o preço é bem mais baixo. Também ganha do Diablo no quesito de que não necessita de internet 24hrs para jogar, já que o jogo dispõe do modo offline que pode ser totalmente divertido, embora também tenha o modo online, bom para jogar com amigos, porque se você não tiver amigos para jogar numa party, dificilmente vai achar alguem sozinho nos servidores, porque o jogo está praticamente sem ninguém jogando os modos onlines. Se tiver interesse no jogo, pode comprar que não irá se arrepender, mas não tenha a intenção de jogar online, a menos que já tenha amigos para isso.Torchlight 2 tem um mundo gigantesco para ser explorado, com milhares de missões primárias e outras toneladas de missões secundárias. A ação é muito frenética com MUITOS inimigos dentro do mapa, não só nas INSTANCES. Dificilmente irá achar apenas um monstro numa area do mapa, você irá achar muitos e a matança, nesse caso, é frenética.Por fim, o que se espera de um verdadeiro jogo de RPG? Muito conteúdo de personalização? Torchlight 2 tem! Classes de personagens criativas? Confere também! Milhares de itens e sets? Torchlight 2 também tem! Cara, esse jogo é perfeito. Tá esperando o que pra fazer a melhor aquisição de um jogo RPG da sua vida? Você vai ficar extremamente viciado. Embora eu tenha poucas horas aqui no jogo da steam, acho que já tenho mais de 200 horas no pirata, (fora da steam, quando jogava a uns aninhos atrás).Esse jogo, é o jogo que de todos os outros que ja joguei, é o que mais recomendo. Garanto pra você que se comprar, não vai querer sair desse mundo nunca mais. Vale comprar em toda época do ano, com promoção, sem promoção, dar de presente pros amigos, não importa, o que vale é expandir esse jogo pra todo mundo. Garanto que o investimento gasto nesse game, tanto para si mesmo como para presentear alguém, será muito bem feito.			"

												Sometimes a game of this type comes along and does so many things right, that it's hard to say anything bad about it. If you like Diablo style fun this game will blow your mind! The Dungeons are fun, the classes are great and the world is fluid and lovingly crafted. Immersion never feels forced in Torchlight 2! You'll find yourself playing this game to realise your characters maximum potential for your chosen style of play/build, and then putting it to the test. Personally I get a giggle every time I send my pet to to town to sell the crap I've laden  it's bag with, such a great feature that, which means you can get on with your killing (if you dare going alone!).  And when you're done, you can get content from the Steam Workshop to extend your game play, and even add 3+ more classes, more dungeons, and even raids! Hell, if you're into content creation and a little know-how, you can get the GUTS tool and make your own!Once you're set up to play on-line you can play your game either on LAN or Internet, and your friends can join you in your adventure, and trade goodies to each other! There is a small hassle setting up an on-line account and linking it to your steam account on the game website, and then add friends so you can play on-line with them. It's nothing hard, but I've heard the picky few complain xD. If you're playing in Mod Mode (Steam workshop addons), you have to make sure your friends are running the same ones, in order to play together, otherwise it's pretty straightforward :DPersonal Rating: Great Game, worthy of any libraryScore Rating: 92% - Nearly a Classic!

With a very similar top-down style to Diablo, your gonna be reaping in all the rewards of fighting, exploring, and leveling up your character. It's even multiplayer! There's always something for you to do, so I definently reccomend buying it, especially if it's on a sale.			"

												Experience of playing as 2-handed engy on Veteran Act III: ""wtf just hit me I'm dead""This game is good. From the soothing string music to humorous weapon descriptions, there is a lot to see and play.  Loot drops rate are just right. Game mechanics are tight and well done (aside from the armor system) You don't have to go crazy on grinding for a proper weapon. Unique-tier weapons look pretty cool and have great descriptions to boot. Their damage and stats also fit your requirements for reasonably long, unlike that one FPS where your purple-rarity gun does ♥♥♥♥ damage 2-3 levels later. Apples to oranges. I don't care.The inclusion of ""Arcane Stats"", where you can see your actual damage output, proc chances, actual armor after bonuses factor in, etc, is really, really useful. This helps a lot in planning your build, and you don't have to do convoluted calculations to find your optimum loadout, and try to figure out whether a particular bonus is additive, multiplicative, applied post-multiplication, blahblah.The UI is very well built, comparing gear is easy, organizing items is easy, weapon damage is listed in DPS (honestly, why the hell not).However, when it comes to the really-high difficulties (NG+ Veteran, NG Elite, Mapworks), the armor system starts to show some bad problems if you play a tanking class. Armor damage reduction is calculated point-by-point rather as a percentage. Meaning if you have 800 armor, you will reduce an incoming attack by 800 damage. To play a serious build during Elite NG++ levels, you will have to farm for damage reduction socketables if you plan on consistently not dying when a mob so much as breathes on you.To quote Cthon from the TL2 forums:""Armor is basically meaningless. Not only is it badly outscaled by monster damage, but its effectiveness is also reduced by any damage reduction you have. To be as charitable as possible to armor, it's reasonably effective early on before monster damage scaling really gets going. A player who only did the first playthrough and did not do mapworks or NG+ might not encounter very many situations where no feasible amount of armor makes a meaningful difference.""^This applies to anything above normal difficulty.Again, nobody cares about the story. Play on veteran mode if you've played RPGs before, normal is kinda easy.			"

												This is a pretty fun game in the vein of ""Diablo"": a good, solid RPG/Action title with a skill tree where you move your character around and click the jibbers out of various people, monsters, and so forth. The boss battles are intense, and I love the design of the world overall. It's got great art, the creature design is nifty, and the class concepts are pretty cool, too.I appreciate the pet, who, let's be honest here, you may be more concerned about its capacity as a pack animal than anything else. Yes, it works like that. You can even tell it to take what it has in its inventory back to town to sell. You don't always get the best price on things, but hey - what do you expect out of a bulldog/ferret/spider/whatever-the-heck you decided to pick? It also sometimes helps in combat, so it's not useless.Overall, I say this game is a sturdy 7.5/10. If you enjoyed the first two DIABLO games, definitely buy it, and if you find it on sale, then what are you waiting for? Get that game!			"

Diablo 2 one of the best hack & slash video games out there.This game has a very extended story mode.You can slash en loot your way hours after hours finding your perfect items as gear.There a couple of classes to play with and these have a lot of skills you can choice to make the character your own.All heroes have a pet to choice they will help you in battle and you can store extra items with them.The game looks very good if you like you can run it on a very basic PC and still enjoy this great game.It support up to 6 player co-op fun for you and your friends.Fight togehter and clear all the main and sub quest in the game.This game will give you 100% fun for you money and I can not recommend this game eneugh to every person who like hack & slash video games.I give this game a 10/10.

												This is a contender for the worst game in this genre.There's no drive, everything can be cheated/modded. The online play is horrible, you and your friends will most likely get bored after 5 minutes because it takes 10 years to load an area for some reason if the host doesn't go first.Not to mention the severe lack of end-game content in this game, want to get gear? oh just farm gold and reset your shops a bunch of times constantly until you either get what you need or run out of money. And either way you'll just be getting an item only to upgrade it at the shop 5 levels later.At least in Diablo 3(which is a million times higher in quality then this game) you used the Auction House and you knew what you were buying ahead of time rather then just gambling away for hours and hours on ends in Goldlight 2: Vendors Edition.Personally this game should be used as an example of what not to do for your dungeon crawler if you ever wanted to create one. No fun, no build varitey, no reason to play.Wouldn't stand a chance against Diablo 2 or Path of Exile.0/10*Save yourself the time and money and just play Path of Exile(Completely free and far above this game in quality and content).

Mindless entertainment!Emphasis on mindless, but it is still entertaining. It can be fun if you want to level up frequently without having to worry about such petty concerns as a challenge. Personally liked tanky engineer; seems indestructable on hardest difficulty (unmodded).Mod selection is pretty good. Some 'must haves' there, but I haven't gone nuts as yet. Reasonable number of extra class mods, but most of them reuse character models and skill icons. It may not bother other people but to me it feels really cheap, and puts me off using them.And yeah I'm doing this largely for the Pillar of the Community badge, but hey I might as well write a half decent review.

												Torchlight II really succeeds at being a Diablo II clone in that it takes a lot of the good aspects of the game and changes a lot of the old technologies that were annoying way back when. It plays very similarly to Diablo, with some great new mechanics introduced. It has it's own feel and story and the classes have their own uniqueness too. The thing that sets Torchlight II apart from the first one the most is the ability for online multiplayer; a crucial part of what makes this game fun in my opinion.			"

												Sometimes a game of this type comes along and does so many things right, that it's hard to say anything bad about it. If you like Diablo style fun this game will blow your mind! The Dungeons are fun, the classes are great and the world is fluid and lovingly crafted. Immersion never feels forced in Torchlight 2! You'll find yourself playing this game to realise your characters maximum potential for your chosen style of play/build, and then putting it to the test. Personally I get a giggle every time I send my pet to to town to sell the crap I've laden  it's bag with, such a great feature that, which means you can get on with your killing (if you dare going alone!).  And when you're done, you can get content from the Steam Workshop to extend your game play, and even add 3+ more classes, more dungeons, and even raids! Hell, if you're into content creation and a little know-how, you can get the GUTS tool and make your own!Once you're set up to play on-line you can play your game either on LAN or Internet, and your friends can join you in your adventure, and trade goodies to each other! There is a small hassle setting up an on-line account and linking it to your steam account on the game website, and then add friends so you can play on-line with them. It's nothing hard, but I've heard the picky few complain xD. If you're playing in Mod Mode (Steam workshop addons), you have to make sure your friends are running the same ones, in order to play together, otherwise it's pretty straightforward :DPersonal Rating: Great Game, worthy of any libraryScore Rating: 92% - Nearly a Classic!

												Crowborn's Review of Torchlight II-Ever since I was a boy, and got my hands on Diablo 1, I have been a fan of the hack-n-slash game-genre. Something about the game strung a cord inside of me, and I played it almost non-stop for years. Same with the sequel - it kept me busy through highschool and sane in the awkward years following when I was rampaging through life, trying to figure out what the 'eck I wanted to do. And so arrived the highly anticipated 3rd installment of the Diablo genre - to lackluster reviews. I picked it up immediately of course, but I were never able to enjoy it. It just seemed off to me, seemed strange, like an orange growing on an apple-tree, trying to fit in with the smooth green skinned fellas around it. But for me it failed at the deceit, and I put down the game after playing it for only a few months. Dissapointed and bereft of one of my favourite genres, I started looking around for substitutes. That's when I heard about Torchlight II.I had noticed the series before, but for some reason never gotten around to trying it out. It was supposed to be a fairly good diablo-clone, and while I liked the genre, it wasn't until one of my dear steam-friends gifted me the game, that I actually managed to sit down and play it. I felt obliged to, so to say. And my were I pleasantly surprised!Torchlight II is a really well made game. From the steam-punkish world, cross the interesting skill-sets, to the actio-packed maps - this game just breathes fun game design. Granted, the game is 'very' much a Diablo-clone, and anyone who ever played those games will immediately find everything intimately familiar. But that's not a bad thing. In fact, I find it darned good. I didn't have to read a bible of game-guides before daring to venture out in the the world of Torchlight, and hack and slash my way through the first pack of monsters I came across. It granted me immediate satisfaction and loads of fun.It feels to me like the devs of this game did right, what the guys at Blizz did wrong. Torchlight II follows to a point the tried and true old recipe of hack-n-slash. They don't try to reinvent or alter the genre, but instead stick to what works and 'has' worked for the last two decades. You got your attribute-points, your skill-points, random loot, runes and enchantments to upgrade your gear, rewarding exploration, and a story-line that doesn't distract you from your dungeon-delving fun.The game hearkens back to the good old days, and gives the players exactly what they expected - and a little more. It deserves a top grade, but due to an at times non-transparent stat-system and unbalanced characters, I have to subtract a few points. I give it:8.5/10			"

												Not having much experience with point-and-click RPGs, I came into Torchlight II warily and was pleasantly surprised by an immersive and well-polished game. Although the story is not as intense and dark as others, the light atmosphere and cartoony characters are some of its major benefactors. You will get as much out of the RPG-aspect as you are willing to put in. The characters are designed to be unique in skill-sets, and the dungeons are jam-packed with puzzles and tons of loot to keep you busy for a long time. I've just started the game, and I am already thoroughly enjoying the captivating environments doubled up with fun character customization. Definitely would recommend!   "

It doesnt matter on which difficulty you play. The Enemies will get hard to kill but you dont get more EXP it just takes longer and you can make the achievements, also the drop rate doesnt encrease so if you just want to play the story then normal or easy is enough.The Story is just there to fill the breaks between the towns nothing special.ConclusionIt a awesome game with nice graphics and good animations for the skills.

												My first Action RPG game so no comparisons to D3 here. As it stands on its own, it is a pretty solid game. Good graphics, visuals and sounds create an immersive environment. While the story may admittedly be paper thin and i did not feel there was much of a plot besides the standard ""villain threatens the world. save us!"" feel, it was functional.On the gameplay end, i would comment that it is quite enjoyable. Each class has many different styles and weapons and there is immense flexibility. A problem though was that i felt that many of the rare drops could have been more accessible towards the end. this problem though it easily recitified with mods, of which Torchlight 2 is quite friendly towards. There are many mods that range from simple UI tweaks to better loot drops to an entire revamp of the game. Torclight 2 thus becomes what you make of itA solid game on its own with very strong replayibility and customisation with its countless mods			"

												One of the best games I have ever played! Its always fun to run through dungeons or the landscape, and kill enemys, minibosses, and bosses. The game is not to easy and not to hard. its just very good balanced. However, the bossfights are sometimes really hard and depressing :D but you feel very proud and happy if you accomplish them. The fight system will not get boring. It is also fun to collect new items, and sell, equip, or enchant them. Also, in this game, there are 4 playable classes, which are specialized on different weapon types, which is also fun to discover.Conclusion: If you like games like this, it is absolutely worth the money! Have fun!			"

												Torchlight II is a truly gorgeous game, I made my friend buy it and we finished it in a mere 18 hours. Hoped it would've been longer. There is new game+, yes, but it really sounds not so nice to play it all over again, knowing already what to do etc. The art style is beautiful and the game mechanisms work very well. We though noticed that the devs had become lazy towards the end since we started finding more and more invisible walls. And the game was really too short.Maybe not worth 19 euros, but surely a must-buy for a 50% sale!			"

												Some times you just want to play a game that lets you kill stuff and grab loot.  Torchlight 2 is a game that lets you do those things.  As some one who has spent many hours playing isometrical kill fests like Diablo 2 and tried various knock offs released since then (like Diablo 3) it was nice to finally play one was fun enough to hold my interest, and this game certaily has.This game has all the monsters, magic, skills, and especially loot that one comes to expect from games of the click stuff til it dies genre.  Torchlight 2 also has added Steam Workshop support and I would highly reccomend this feature.  Since the majority of the time I play this game is in single player, easily adding mods that increase drop rate while cranking up monster power is very usefull in saving my time and preserving monster difficulty.  There are plenty of workshop mods out there with additional classes, pets, or endgame dungeons that you may crave.So if you are a fan of Diablo 2 and think you can look past the cartoonish graphics this game is the perfect game for you.

												I really enjoy this game. Of course, like any hack'n'slash game it gets a little repetitive every now and then. But I've played thousands of hours of Diablo II and was extremely disappointed with what they did with D3. Torchlight 2 is for me an improved and modernised version of D2, and I love it.			"

												Enough of the Diablo 2 comparisons - the genre has evolved enough to......wait....ha ha who the hell am I kidding. Torchlight 2 is something like Antje Traue; it's silently risen to the apex of its genre (or in Traue's case, she's climbed over the plastic American bimbos from Hollywood and has become the most attractive woman in the universe). I was never too interested in the first TL game, but this was mostly because I was ingesting too much morphine and I had a serious porn addiction. What immediately grabbed me about its sequel, however, was its foundation in the Steamworks system. It's so simple to download and install mods, and while it's technically limited to ten active at any one time, it's quite easy to combine mods in the GUTS editor. As of the end of 2013, I really have no idea why any developer wouldn't want this implemented in their gaming environment. It extends playability by an infinite margin, and the only excuse I could think of from ""big-time"" publishers is that they really couldn't give a ♥♥♥♥ if people play their game - they only care about sales. (Insert TORtanic joke here.) But okay, enough soapboxing. Is it worth buying? If you're even remotely intrigued by the isometric hack-n-slash model, this game is a godsend (remark about religion). It's visceral, bloody, fast-paced, and there are so many different ways to play. I don't remember how many vanilla classes there are, but if you get off your soggy ♥♥♥ for two seconds you can find about twenty new classes in the workshop. There is so much to offer in this package, and you should buy it. 10/10 would play again			"

												Holy Crap! Torchlight 2 is better than Diablo 3! and a 3rd of the price. The original dev's for diablo know what they are doing. Runic games will be a serious contender for these other huge companies with unlimeted budgets. This game is FAST! Love the speed of the game play. Loot system is awesome! and did I mention CO-OP! I havent tried it yet, but I cannot wait! Highly RECOMMENDED 10 out of 10!			"

												I was headed towards a dungeon to complete a quest, ended up exploring the whole map, killed all the mobs, searched for the golden key to open the golden chest, went through a random portal which reserved me a side mission and finally started the dungeon. Seriously you won't see the time pass in this game, there is a lot to do. Pros:-Interesting bosses/monsters.-Complex itemization (many stats, enchantments, etc).-Multiple things to do (quests (dungeons, secret rooms, bosses), sidequests (mazes, mini bosses, etc) and other random stuff to do (fishing, gambling,etc). -Fun game to play with friends (if you're playing with multiple friends, play on elite or else it will be too easy).-Good combat system. In general, you can't simply spam click to clear mobs, the game pushes you to dodge abilities, manage your mana pool and react to different scenarios (use abilities to trap big guys, use your escape ability to..well escape,etc). Cons:-The story is bad, this is definietly not the game to play for its story. To be honest, I stopped caring about the story very early on.-Can get a bit repetitive. -Okay character custimization (character creation allows you to play very little with your character's features).8/10, great game to pick up when it goes on sale.

												Torchlight II is an excelent old school RPG action. Has everything you need, awesome bloodthirsty action, reawrding loot (tons of it), great development of your character, Steam Workshop support for great mods, that load as a seperate game so you dont mess up your original game. Game that is worth your money.			"

												Torchlight 2 is fun in anyway I enjoyed playing and it is worth the money and time think of it as Diablo 3's clone but a good version of it you can sometimes get carried away the punishment for death is you lose gold everytime you use it to respawn same location and Torchlight is brutal with it's bosses it throws at you unless you have a pet then you can easily navigate through the levels I recomend this even at a ful price very addicting story and gameplay			"
