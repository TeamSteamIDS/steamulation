												Ahhh, DeathSpank!  The final game in the trilogy.  Like some action RPG's?  Like Diablo games?  This game is for you.  Absolutely fantastic dialog.  Funny stuff.  I've completed all 3 games and still wanting more.  Very fast paced and can be unforgiving at times with it's long range enemy projectiles, but damn worth it.  Come.. stay awhile.. and enjoy THE BACONING!			"

												Being a fan of the first two deathspank games, I've always had an urge to purchase The Baconing when it came out on the xbox 360. After seeing many negative reviews on the game, i decided to hold off. Playing the game now on pc, i don't see what the whole fuss was about. This is the same tried and true deathspank formula packaged in a new adventure. The only concern was the difficulty of the game. I died many MANY more times in this game then i did in the first two combined. This game is a little bit more linear when it comes to paths to take, but this may be a positive or a negative to some. Game length was fair, seeing how this was a 15 dollar arcade game. I believe i beat the game in about 8 or 9 hours, and this is attempting every quest and collecting everything possible. If your a deathspank fan i would recommend this game to you in a heartbeat. Do not let the negative reviews sway you.			"

												A very fun and sattire saturated game. This is basically a mix between a hack&slash and adventure game (not point&click, rather Rayman type).The main point of this game is an absurd storyline that is too wacky to describe here. Go and play it, you won't be disappointed if you like Monty Python like humor.Pros:- very nice gameplay, I just wanted to complete this game to see how it ends- parodies many tropes, movies and games- graphics are cartoony which supports the overall tone of the gameCons:- it gets too easy to early - basically you have loads of bombs, medkits or other support items that you can use anytime- some riddles are just too wacky- later in the game there is one stage with lots of backtracking - fortunately it's not too longI really recommend this game, it's fast, it's fun and you can have a good laugh when playing it.One hint - don't buy DLC if you just play singleplayer, because it's just a different character for the second player and that's all it is in this Roesha DLC.

												I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews - Game 20The BaconingPurchase Date: 10/17/2014I picked up The Baconing as part of a Humble Bundle.  I didn't realize until after I had played that this is actually the 3rd of a series of games featuring DeathSpank.   Looking back I could see where the game was making reference to prior games, but at the same time it isn't strictly necessary to have played the other 2. Gameplay reminded me of Diablo II, but simpler in nature.  Actually I think Torchlight would be the better comparison here.  There is a huge emphasis on combat, and you will be frequently swarmed with enemies.  Expect to die a lot.  I started playing on Normal difficulty, and even at that level I was dying really often.  In some ways it was kind of annoying because enemies would shoot ranged weapons at me from off the screen, while I'm also getting attacked at close quarters.  Fortunately dying has very little consequence in this game; it just zaps you back to your last checkpoint minus some cash.I really liked the art style of the game.  Everything is cell shaded, which reminds me somewhat of Borderlands, but things are also drawn in this psuedo 2d style, like everything is a cardboard cutout.  When you look at things from the front they are drawn in, but as you get close and see from above everything looks like a cardboard cutout.  I'm not really doing it justice in the way I describe it, but it looks neat as you are running around.I mentioned the gameplay being compared to Diablo II, not only because of the constant combat, but also the emphasis on loot.  As you win fights you are constantly picking up loot.  Rather than having to sell loot you can just use your 'grinder' to grind the items down for instant cash.  Also there is an option to auto-equip armor that is of higher level.  It definitely keeps you from having to spend too much time on inventory management.Another interesting aspect is you'll come across fortune cookies which you can use in your quest log to get hints if you are stuck.  That said, the quests were really simple in the hour that I played.  Perhaps the game adds more puzzles in later, but I get the feeling they are keeping things intentionally simple.I say this because DeathSpank is an idiot.  Playing DeathSpank reminded me of watching Inspector Gadget as a kid.  But that's really the whole point of the game, and it's what will make or break the game for you.  The game is full of humor all centered around what a complete doofus DeathSpank is.  DeathSpank is also voice acted, and I think they did a really good job here.  But if you like your games a little more serious or don't get into the ""bumbling idiot who still manages to win the day"" kind of humor, then you won't really enjoy The Baconing.One small complaint I have is the game did crash on me at one point after I clicked inside of my second monitor which caused the game to minimize.  When I tried to restore the game window it crashed.  I only had it happen the one time, but it makes me think this game may be not very alt-tab friendly.  Also, I played the game with mouse and keyboard, but it's pretty apparent that you are better off playing with a controller.My main concern about the game is how (or if) the gameplay evolves as you progress through the story.  I had fun for the time I played, but I can see where it would get old if all you do is grind your way through the game.  While the story has it's humor and charm, it's also very simple, and the quests I played were basic fetch quests.  I hope the game offers a little more variety or puzzle solving as it moves forward.Even with my concerns, I still liked the game enough to recommend it.			"

												This game attempts to follow up the prequels of Deathspank and Thongs of Virtue in the same spirit. The gameplay lacks here, since enemies often use ranged attacks out of frame to kill you. Where two two earlier games allowed the story-telling to be in focus and the dialogue options felt more interesting than just progressing The Baconing fails. However, it is still good for a few chuckles and while I loathe when achievements are tacked on for playing games on the hardest difficulty I can still say it's worth a playthrough. Fans of the earlier games may be somewhat disappointed, though.			"

												Meh.I can't say it's a terrible game, because I've spent the 15-16 hours required to beat it, but it's certainly nothing special.  I don't know who thought the idea of ""mouse buttons move unless you click a target and then they attack"" was a good idea, but every game I've played just shows it's awkward.  It's only saved by the reflection system and the ability to abuse the hell out of the very basic game play mechanics (rewarding in its own way).As to the actual scripting, the voice acting is good, and Deathspank himself is of course hammy, over-the-top and very entertaining.  Good, silly dialogue.  You can really tell it was never meant for PC by the layout and style.  Still, if you're looking for something funny but mindless you could do much worse.			"

												The Baconing is a RPG-ish and hack'n'slash-y adventure game with hilariously stupid and funny dialogues, revolving around the justice-loving hero DeathSpank.In typical RPG-manner you acquire main- and side-quests as you fight your way through the varying and - thanks to the graphical art style of the game -really good looking areas of Spanktopia.During the course of the game you constantly find new equipment in the form of weapons, armor, potions and gadgets to assist you in fighting hordes of mad turtles, dinosaurs, aliens, roboters and other enemies. The levelling system (up to level 20) also awards you with more health, damage or other perks upon reaching a new level.The game can be played both alone and in local co-op (one player with keyboard and mouse, the other with a controller) and has a playtime of around 8-9 for a complete playthrough, probably a little less when playing in co-op.Either way, I highly recommend The Baconing as it is great fun and well worth its money!

												Alrighty. I'm a big fan of those Diablo 2 type games., which the Baconing is. The humour of this game, with the dialogue all being hilariously fully voiced by talented vocal actors is a real joy. It's a heavy dose of parody, with a good dash of genuine wit. The second wonderful thing about this game is the art. I'm not one to get gushy about art, but the quality and the variety is really stunning.The cons are this though; The gameplay, specifically the difficulty (through awkwardness/poor design choices) , does not match the game style. I can see Futurama watchers firing up this game, perhaps after taking a long pull on a ...cigar. This will not go well for them: the combat is brutal. Ranged attackers can brutally kill you from off screen in less than two seconds with their homing bulets, which to withstand requires shielding the *instant* the projectile would hit. Melee combat is not helped with click to move. Get this only on sale.			"

												Really liked the original Deathspank.  The second one was not as good, but still okay.  The Baconing I just do not like. The first two games are basically casual with their playing style.  Something you can just pick up and play as a good time killer.  Unfortunately this time out they have introduced grinding for some reason.  Monsters go from being a good fight to killing you repeatedly until you can get decent equipment to face them with.  Another problem is the fact that other monsters will be ""shooting"" you from offscreen, causing massive damage plus slowing you, PLUS causing damage over time with poison.  It just completely wrecks any enjoyment that you could have playing.  A disappointment all the way around.  Unless they can bring back the entertainment value of the first game, I hope to never see Deathspank again.			"

												The Baconing is a sequel to DeathSpank. It's a cartoony, colorful action adventure game with gruesome humor. Fart jokes agogo as Deathspank fights an army of undead cyborgs to destroy some sacred thongs. It's absurd, it's ridiculous. It's also colorful and fun and reminds me of some fo the more twisted cartoons of my youth like Ren and Stimpy, Invader Zim and The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. The Baconing is a pretty simple game at its core, but has more complex equipment and item systems than what I was expecting. On the one hand it's kind of a button masher, but some fo the mechanics are overly complex for such a game. It might be your thing if you like hack and slash adventures with sophmoric toilet humor, but it just didn't do it for me.			"

												Pretty much the end for the sadly underrated DeathSpank series. While I don't feel that this game is quite as strong as the second, Thongs of Virtue, it still has plenty of entertainment to be experienced in this game.The third game in the DeathSpank series tasks our hero DeathSpank to save the world from another one of his mistakes. Throughout the game you go through many varied and nicely detailed areas, fighting many types of enemies and gaining new loot to play with and show off.The Baconing fixes some issues that the earlier games had, such as giving you the ability to grind gear into money with one button instead of dragging it through your inventory. Like the earlier games, every weapon, item, and set of armor has some entertaining dialogue waiting to be read once found. Just spending the time to read the description of everything you find easily adds extra minutes to the entertainment. Every weapon and armor set is fully rendered too, changing how DeathSpank looks with every new piece of gear.If you like Diablo-esque games, especially if they are set in a very Psychonauts-esque universe, then you will probably have a lot of fun with this game. The sound track is great as well, and really fits the whimsical world it's set in. The two earlier DeathSpank games are also worth picking up, but it's a shame you can't get them bundled, and they never go on sale anymore.			"

												If you want to screw the story, crank up the hilarity, and spank the death out of your enemies on a planet-sized log, THIS.Deathspank 3: The Baconing takes place in a world conquered by Deathspank, who managed to screw things up and created an unnecessarily evil archnemesis by simply wearing six pairs of underwear. To fix his mistake, he has to finish the legendary quest that he refused to complete in the last game, causing death and mayhem across various continents FOR JUSTICE!And yes, it gets weird. Er.I miss Squidi's dialogue script and unique missions, but this story manages to paint Deathspank in various hero patterns as the smarter yet gullible hero that hacks his way through every problem (except structural engineering, long story). Fun stuff, fun weapons, pretty challenging actually.			"

												Excellent dialog, story, and charming graphics make up for what can only be described as mediocre mechanics, it's a hack and slash that will frustrate the hell out of you with collection quests and side missions that add little to the overall game and serve only as a comedy tool. The co-op feature is not much to write home about, with a number of sidekicks available with a sort of reduced functionality, no gearing for sidekicks limits this a bit and minimizes loot fights. The game itself is rescued by its pacing and story and on the whole I would recommend it at a lower than usual price. not worth the £10 tag it puts forward.			"

												The Baconing is an isometric action game with very minor RPG elements. The graphical style of the game is somewhat unique. Many background objects look like props in a play and the game overall has a bit of a cartoonish look. The world is a bit weird and it looks like you're moving on roller, because the land is always crooked.The gameplay is very combat heavy, but the combat isn't that much fun. You die quite fast on the harder difficulties and you have to block a lot. You can also reflect projectiles the enemies shoot at you with the shield, but you have to time it right. You have 2 weapon sets and you can quickly switch between them anytime you want. Each weapon set has two weapons that you can choose yourself. I used the other weapon set for normal weapons and the other one for Justice weapons. Justice weapons have a powerful special attack, which can be used when you fill your Justice bar by hitting enemies and blocking at the right time. The game also has a local co-op so you can play with a friend. One player is always playing as Deathspank, but the other player can choose one character out of 4 (5 if you have the DLC). The few RPG elements the game has consist of collecting gear and leveling up and then choosing a hero card that boosts damage, health or some other thing. The levels mainly enable you to wear better gear and that's pretty much it. The gear system is pretty stupid, because you almost always get a better gear set when you go to a new area and then the old gear set becomes useless. Same goes for weapons and few consumables.The game has an economy system, which doesn't really make sense. You get money from enemies and also by grinding your useless items and the only thing worth buying with the money is more consumables, because the weapon vendor only sells you items you've previously had. I only had to buy a few potions during my playthrough, so I had lots of money that I had no use for.The strongest part of the game and the reason I liked the game, despite all its problems, is the humor and dialogue. The characters are quite funny and a lot of the dialogue consists of silliness. There are lots of somewhat random moments as well like en. So if you like that kind of humor and don't mind the somewhat dull combat, I recommend playing the game. The combat isn't that bad, if you have a friend to play with.			"

												TL;DR don't buy, it's brokenSo I enjoyed the previous two DeathSpank games a lot and got The Baconing. And I regret it so much... Before being able to actually play I had to verify my game cache because it crashed on launch. After close to 1h I ended my first playing session and the next time I wanted to continue (weeks or even months later) ... same thing again, but this time, I had no internet connection, so I couldn't use the verify game cache fix. NICE!Well today I wanted to play again (it's been months since I played last time), this time it actually worked - for 10 minutes. Then it crashed again. This game is a pain in the ***, it's totally broken and not enjoyable at all.Not worth even worth 1€ as the developer doesn't care at all (multiple reviews stating that it doesn't work for them, no updates since... I don't know, there has never been an update after my purchase). IF it would work, it seems to be a nice game, if you liked the previous titles, but it doesn't so skip this.			"

												I can't recommend this one. The story is ok in an over-the-top ridiculous kind of way, some of it is sort of funny. The RPG elements are super light, the loot system is very shallow to the point that you can essentially ignore it. After the first zone you realize that each zone is going to follow the same exact formula. Some quests have you running back through areas you already cleared, which at times can seem like an annoying way to extend the hours the game has to offer. The worst part about this game is that the combat is extremely clumsy feeling. You must be quick and have timing down with your shield bash to win in the encounters, but the inputs feel laggy and you often miss the enemies for no good reason. Its the main part of the game, and it is implemented badly. This makes the game pretty challenging at times. Challenging is fine, but challenging because the controls are bad is not. Overall, everything feels rushed. I had heard good things about this series, but this is not the one to get into.			"

												This game could have been so much more than it ended up being. The gameplay is really mediocre, the stat system and the way you get good gear is kinda dumb, and the difficulty curve between regular enemies and bosses is WAY too high.The writing is pretty phenomenal, though.			"

												Picking up after one of the endings from the previous game, this sequel cut out most of the annoying crap from the second game whilst upgrading the combat mechanics. It plays quite differently, but much better than the previous two. This one is also much more linear with less side quests (I liked the sidequests) but the story remains funny as you fight against the anti-Spank. Sadly while lots of space is left around the end game area for upcoming DLCs, the company that made it is no longer making PC games.			"

												If you liked the two previous Deathspank games do not buy this game. The original writer of the first two didn't work on this one.The gameplay mechanics are roughly the same but the real reason to play a Deathspank game - the humor - just isn't there anymore. The game tries hard to imitate its two predecessors but falls flat in camparison.While Deathspank and Deathspank and the Thongs of Virtue where genuinely funny and at times even clever in their own way this one almost always is childish, crude and without a trace of wit.

												Man these games are too funny. I own all of the DeathSpank Games and I must say this one was the funniest out of the three so far. Tim Burton really out did himself on the story and dialog xD. If you really like playing games that are sorta like a movie then get the DeathSpank games, they're funny as all hell. I mean you get to become The God of All Orphans. If that doesn't make you wann a play this game then I don't know what will >:(			"

												Bought on one of the Humble Bundle for 2$. This is my first game in DeathSpank series and its simply awesome! Playing this game is a pure fun! Worth more than 2$ actually. Funny dialogues, MANY easter eggs, many pop culture references (game industry too). Light gameplay, simple HUD and interaface, but the battles are very hard. First time in few years i have been forced to lower difficulty from medium/hard to easy.			"

												The shortest, and probably both the most difficult and the easiest in the series at the same time.  The game is split up into five major sections, of which all quests are confined too, so you don't need to worry about backtracking or getting quests too early.  Of course, to compensate, combat is considerably more difficult so it requires a little more thought than normal.My personal favourite in the series so far, but play the first two before this one.  There is a major story arc.			"

												Thsis game is one of those games that somehow manages to capture your attention and makes it hard to leave. Until you start getting smoked time and time again and have to navigate back to where you were killed to get all your stuff and then they just gang up on you again. It really is a cool game but the difficulty curve is way too high, even on easy. Very interesting graphics and characters.

												The Baconing is a simple and short action RPG with a humorous setting and plot. The settings are mostly interesting and they change at a decent pace. Humour is derived from decently written dialoque as well as absurd enviroments, items and creatures. Main gameplay revolves around killing numerous amounts of baddies.Though the visual aesthetic is generally appealing, the simple gameplay gets really repetitive quick. Unfortunately, same goes for the humour. RPG's are really good targets for parody, but it seems like the Baconing misses the point on occasion and when it hits the target, it doesn't quite have the right delivery. The voice acting of the main character gets really grating by the end, even though the game isn't that long.On top of that, the Baconing was clearly made for a controller in mind. Though playing with mouse and keyboard is serviceable, it is occasionally clunky and can get annoying in big group fights.			"

												I don't know why The Baconing ended up in my inventory, but I can definitely tell you I'm glad I didn't pay for it.Apparently The Baconing is a sequel, which is surprising since they don't mention that at all anywhere on the storefront. But because it's a sequel, it expects you to know how to somewhat know how to play from past experience. I did not. It also expects you to be familiar with a bunch of characters from the previous games. I was not. This kind of ruined the entire first level for me, since it consisted of nothing but going around to characters I had never seen before and reminiscing about events I was unaware of.			"

												Yes, it's still DeathSpank, but Ron Gilbert hasn't been part of this game. The humour suffers a bit from that fact, but there's still a fun funny moments when you meet some of the known characters from the first two games. However, this game works a bit different from the other DeathSpank titles because of their blocking system - expect to die a lot, especially in the beginning.			"

												Terrible, through and through.  No redeeming qualities.  The gameplay is so flat and repetitive I'm not even sure it deserves comment.  It has that kind of terrible writing that thinks it's really funny.  Like someone who really enjoys quoting Monty Python, but doesn't quite understand *why* the jokes are funny.  There's a line between ""homage"" and lazily referencing or quoting other people's actually funny work.			"

												The game is incredibly simplistic in an already simplistic sub-genre. That's not to say that hack-and-slash, loot-driven action RPGs don't have depth. Instead, I'm saying that the game makes the act of clicking on monsters a tedious chore. The humor is juvenile at best and poorly delivered at its worst. The combat is completely monotonous and never feels engaging beyond the act of ""click a monster a bunch and its dead."" The skills are uninteresting and the map layouts are boring and basic.Games in this genre, at their best, are frantic, engaging and can provide a lot of depth in the development of your character. They often create very immersive, interesting worlds and playing them is often an extremely addicting activity. The Baconing has none of these qualities and can pretty much be dismissed as a time-waster, should you ever find it for the right price ($1.99 or lower would be my suggestion).Don't bother; there are plenty of far better games in this genre on Steam that offer a lot more for the same or a lower price.

												This game plays like Diablo and Torch light... you are reading this? go back to does games. This game is not fun and it dosn't really have any tutorial on how to play or how to do things. It's lacking feedback and a generall good game play. I did not enjoy it and feelt generally confused and yes, I only played 8min, take that in consideration when you read this. 8 min, wasting my time, when I could play Diablo 3 and not waste time... directly =)			"

												I had fun with the silliness of the game, quite humorous and balanced. I got killed, but then I got better. Definitely enjoy the series, and the improvements made in this one, like shield bash.			"

												The storyline to the Baconing IS funny. What isn't is the ""local co-op"". Something that doesn't really appear on all those trailers touting the extra playable characters and sidekicks to the main character. What makes it worse is the amount of searching you have to do just to get a straight answer as to what EXACTLY ""local co-op"" means for a game whose amuzing storyline and colourful, action-packed gameplay makes it seem like the perfect game to play with a friend....What it means is, should you buy this game on Steam with plans for a co-op playthrough, your friend will either have to (somehow) share the keyboard with you OR (more likely) bring a console controller along to plug in.Yes, that's right, after the fans of previous games clamouring for a better multiplayer option that could only have increased sales, the company have allowed this game to become little more than another trouble port, while not making it clear from the get-go that one of the game's main selling points is severely limited. Unless you are looking for that info specifically while researching the game-- and even then --you will likely not realise this suspiciously brushed-under-the-table piece of info and will likely purchase the game before realising the issue. A shame really, since all it serves to do is remind PC gamers that the game is JUST a port, and harms future sales of what can easily be a fun experience, as many gamers have and will continue to swear off any of the developer's future products. In reality, it only shows how that last little bit of effort to really make the game great was either too much effort for the developer or something they saw as not worth investing in, for their customers. As I said, a shame for a product that otherwise could have been easily recommendable.			"

												Funny, cartoony, feel-good RPG game.If you like these kind of games, the likes of Psychonauts, you'll like this.Leveling up, new armors & weapons as upgrades with each level, health potions & such. The ususal RPG stuff.I haven't played the previous 2 installments of DeathSpank, but I've read The Baconing is very similar to those. So take that into account.Good, entertaining game. "

												Another Great Death Spank. Maybe not as funny as previous ones, but still awesome fun. They could have add up some improvents, for example transfering character to ng++ and continue on insane lvl if wished to get all achievements, but unfortunately you have to start it all from the beginning. And that's sad. But I would definitely recommend that great game. 7.0/10			"

												This is the third of the Deathspank series. So comparison is inevitableArt, animation, graphics are better while humor, jokes and ridiculous action are in the same spirit.Story, gameplay and quests are looses a little but is still enjoyable.As its predecessors its rich on loot: Many armor, weapons, potions and stuff. Many quest and many monsters to slash. The vanquisher of the evil on probably his last mission			"

												More of exactly the same. Still excellent dialogue & voiceover but doesn't add anything new. Harder than the first two. Combat is still the weakpoint; not being able to block multiple attacks, but being attacked from all sides..			"
