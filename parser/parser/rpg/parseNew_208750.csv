												I'm a long time Mythology nerd who's looking into an archaeology major and reads about ancient history for fun. I logged into steam, saw this game on sale, and resigned myself to buying it.It was amazing.Media accurately depicting the Greek Gods is hard to find, and doubly so for video games. ""Someone is god of the wrong thing"" is a square on my mythology movie bingo card. But Apotheon completely nails everything. This game wasn't written by people who read through a couple wikipedia pages and called it day; literally everything about the Gods is correct, from their attitudes to their ironic demise, and even their allegences. One of the most telling moments was having Dionysus on the side of humanity; someone who'd only done cursory research wouldn't know that he'd lived among mortals for years before joining the gods.And don't even get me started on the art. This game is one of the most beautiful things I've ever played. Everything is stylized perfectly down to the creases in a character's chiton, and the color changes in the different realms are beautiful and perfectly fit the tone of the area. The architecture is accurate, as are the items and decorations. The NPC dialogue and major themes of the story even parallel important values of Ancient Greek life.Basically: the devs for this game researched the hell out of Ancient Greece, and I kind of want to kiss every one of them for it. 10/10.

												Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!In the beginning there was presumably chaos; the cosmos swirled violently, endlessly. But the gods, lazy control freaks that they are, swept all that chaos under the proverbial universal carpet and called it a full, rich day. Eons passed, and little of consequence was done: multicellular organisms developed, terra rose from beneath churning primordial seas, and the very first Waffle House opened to middling reviews. At some point (post Waffle House), the gods grew bored and reached out to indie game developer Alientrap. In a booming and unified voice, they decreed that a game be made – a sidescrolling, puzzle/platform adventure game that would do them honor. Little did the gods know that this particular genre of game would be pumped out with such regularity in the indie community that titans CoD and Madden would blush empathetically. Alientrap, like Sysiphus before them, faced an uphill battle.They succeeded, and did Olympus proud.Apotheon is the aforementioned sidescrolling puzzle/platform indie adventure game, and it tells a story as old (and as metal) as time: the gods of Olympus have forsook the cosmic “oopsy daisy” of mankind, and it's up to brave Nikandreos to save what little spark of humanity remains. Sure, roll your eyes. “Didn't God of War do this a decade ago?” Well sure, technically, you stick in the mud. Homer also wrote stuff in this vein nearly 3,000 years ago, and whoever the ♥♥♥♥ wrote Gilgamesh 1,300 years earlier than Homer still! And for what it's worth, the story is very fun. It doesn't break the ancient mold, but the ending still left me surprised and satisfied. Nikandreos sidescrolls his way up  hub-world Mount Olympus on his quest in stunning black and red figure style as seen depicted on all the best Ancient Greek pottery. Watching people stroll the market, guards brandishing their spears, and satyrs getting drunk is mesmerizing. But at some point you'll have to get to the gameplay, and what gameplay it is. You'll have an array of archaic weapons (purchased or picked up), a variety of shields, a torch, potions and the like. Weapons and shields shatter after prolonged use, so the game regularly forces you to fight in different styles. I was initially put off by this feature but found that it forced me out of my comfort zone, requiring me to learn the unique swings, reaches, and speeds of each weapon. You'll pick up money and crafting items after combat and by shattering crates and barrels, though these activities can bring unwanted attention from Olympian guards.Over the course of  three acts you'll deal with eight major deities (four optional), and each offers starkly different, fun, varied gameplay. For example, Demeter, Goddess of the Harvest, pities humanity's plight, and would provide bounty. Unfortunately her daughter Persephone currently dwells in Hades' realm making it impossible. You'll have to descend to the underworld, cross the river Styx, and proceed to cross the lesser rivers Acheron, Lethe, Phlegethon, and Cocyctus to be granted an audience with the Lord of the Dead. Each of these rivers provide different platform gameplay tropes that keep things fresh, exciting, and entertaining. And that's just for one “quest.” Dionysus, Hephaestus, Poseidon, Athena... each and every deity provides different gameplay mechanics so the game never gets stale. All the while you'll visit shops to upgrade your attack strength, defense, and resupply on favorite weapons.And for those of you with a multiplayer itch there's local multiplayer combat, allowing you to test your skills against a friend. This is pretty fun, and the combat (singleplayer and multiplayer) is deceptively deep and tactical. The multiplayer won't keep too many people distracted for long, but between the three difficulties, metroidvania-lite gameplay, beautiful soundtrack, stunning graphics, and varied gameplay, you'll sink at least 10 hours into this little indie game.This is AAA quality on an indie budget, and you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing out on this one. Apothoen has accomplished its 12 herculean tasks, and is deserving of a place in the pantheon of gaming.			"

												This game is rad. So many melee combat games have tried to find a satisfying balance between simplicity and granular control, and Apotheon absolutely nails it. Being able to toss a javelin, roll between the legs of an opponent, then send a slash up his back while his shield's still facing the other way makes me buzz like nothing else. Weapons feel distinct from one another and satisfying in their own ways. Though it didn't take long for me to discover my love of heavy-headed polearms, I'm always pleased when a situation calls for something different and I'm rewarded with an entirely different (though no less enjoyable) visceral interaction. There's something to be said for the intimacy of shield + knife.The world is pretty big, with a solid variety of enemy types and challenges, but what I thought was the coolest is how all if it was informed by Greek mythology. I was tickled when I realized I had to stab a certain enemy in the eye to bring him down.Also, if you've got a buddy on hand, the local arena mode makes for a fun time. They can try to kite you with arrows all they want, but all it takes is one well-placed javelin... (or a quick roll and slash combo... or a mighty leap with hammer in hand... etc.).All in all, if you like combat platformers with a dynamic rhythm, Apotheon won't disappoint. Strong recommend.			"

												I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews - Game 10ApotheonPurchase Date: 6/13/2015Long ago on my Commodore 64, I used to play a game called The Return of Heracles, which had a similar Greek myth setting.  So when I saw this game, I was pretty much immediately sold on the setting and the art style looked awesome.  This is one of the rare games I bought on Steam that I ended up playing almost right away.The game starts with some quick cut scenes explaning how Zeus has turned his back on mankind, and things are looking grim.   After that I found myself in a town being invaded by raiders, which is where the tutorial kicks in.The controls are pretty simple.  I didn't check if the game supports a gamepad or not, but I played with a keyboard and mouse.  The keys move you around and perform actions, and the mouse is used for aiming.  I've played other games with this control scheme; it's not my favorite, but it does feel familiar, and isn't difficult to pick up.Given the controls and the platform nature of the game, I was expecting the combat to be pretty simplistic.  Instead I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of weapons at my disposal.  Even better, the weapon differences are not just purely cosmetic.  Each weapon feels different.  Knives are quick and do small amounts of damage which add up over repeated strikes.  But after too many quick strikes I found myself gasping for breath.  Larger weapons do more damage but are slower, and can be trickier to hit with against a moving target.  A variety of ranged weapons are provided as well.It isn't long before I am introduced to the crafting options in the game.  I got a couple of recipes, one to make a 'fire bomb' of sorts, and the other for making a 'healing potion'.  The components for making these can come out of random crates or from killing enemies.I occasionally struggled with the map.  The map overlays the screen with a transparency effect that I sometimes had trouble distinguishing the map from the background.  I wished I could have had some control over the transparency here.  Otherwise though the map did a good job of highlighting the location of my current objectives and helping me find my way around.One thing I appreciated was the run speed of my character.  The longer you run, the faster you get.  So for those times where I needed to run far across the map, it doesn't feel like it's taking forever.As far as difficulty goes, the game starts out pretty easy.  The earliest fights are very simple and gave me a good opportunity to try out the different weapons.  At the end of the first area, I got into my first boss fight, where the game starts to ramp up the difficulty.  As I progressed into the next area, I started to encounter more of a variety of enemies, and I definitely noticed a continued increase in difficulty.  I found myself having to evolve my combat strategy as well.  Early on it was sufficient to simply stab enemies a few times before they could respond in kind.  But as the game progresses, I found myself leaping to dodge attacks, and having to approach combat more methodically, especially in some of the later boss fights.The graphics options are pretty basic, but that makes sense given that this is a 2D platformer.  I did see the option to change my resolution, which for me is always the most important.I ended my first hour of gameplay continuing to explore the forests of Artemis.  The game definitely gives you a decent amount of exploration.  It reminded me a little of Metroid in that regard.  Overall there really wasn't anything about Apotheon I didn't like.  I expect I'll be enjoying many more hours of fun in this game.  I can recommend this without hestiation. "

												I just finished Apotheon, and wow, did I enjoy this game!  It's such a great game.  The art style is obviously awesome.  Unless you hate orange, in which case steer clear.  It's a wicked beautiful game and they nailed the Greek Pottery aesthetic.The game focuses primarily on combat, and don't let anyone tell you it's anything less than stellar.  Yes, it takes some getting used to.  This is a style of 2D combat that in a league of it's own.  1 part Terraria, 1 part Dark Souls, and yet totally unique somehow.  Once you get the hang of it, properly dodging and timing the perfect devastating blow is incredibly satisfying.  This really should be played on a keyboard and mouse, though, as precision is a big factor in combat.  Also, it's much safer to switch weapons by going into your inventory by pressing ""i"" instead of hitting a number key and scrolling, while trying to dodge enemies.The music is perfect, The voice acting is good, and I love the story, because it minds me of all the time I spent reading Greek mythology for fun when I was a kid.  I think the ending is just freaking perfect.It's got plenty to do.  I spent 10 hours playing, and didn't spend a lot of time exploring and many sections I ran and dodged by dozens of enemies.  So there's plenty of time to spend here if you look for everything and do all the side stuff.My only real complaint is that there are just too many weapons that you hang onto all at once.  I would have preferred just 2 or 3 melee weapons, and 1 or 2 ranged.  As it is, I just had a lot of stuff that I never needed to use, so there was no sense of urgency.  Also, I realize they were going for an ""ammo"" feel by having weapons degrade and breakdown ... but I'm not sure that helped the game.  It seemed like an unnecessary convention, and the only time it remotely effected me was when my assassins dagger broke, but I just ran and bought a cheap one from the black market dealer.Anyways ... I highly recommend this game, and that you take the time to learn and appreciate the combat.  I have a feeling that this'll be a sleeper-hit, and once online multiplayer is up there will be renewed vigor for Apotheon!			"

												Great animation, visuals and artwork. Superb soundtrack and very good voice acting and effects.The gameplay is not that easy, as you have to coordinate your attacks and where to look with the mouse at the same time and it becomes really difficult at large number of enemies or crucial boss fights.The story is interesting and some of the maps are very fun to play. I also loved the various ancient Greek names and the mythology references.Recommended game.			"

Tl'dr version:  As a classicist and avid reader of mythology I consider this a hidden gem of the metroidvania genre. A good story and decent combat, coupled with the most immersive and unique artstyle I have ever seen seen makes this a must buy for anyone who wants to put a toe into Greek mythology or metroidvania games. A Controller is highly recommended however.Elaborated version: As stated above, I consider myself a individual well verse in Greek myth and it's Aesthetics. I say this in regard to why I think this game is probably the first of it's kind to seamlessly blend Greek iconography into a video game. The art is immediately distinctive, and go's beyond just a pretty backgroundThe art work is a stark reminded that this is actually how people; circa 500-300BC did ART, with some of the darker levels (Hades' realm for example) styled in old Athenian ""BlackFigure' style, while the majority of the game plays in different palettes. The God's themselves are the stars of the show; with some being monstrosity tall and the ability to deal gigantic damage to boot, or the more cunning Gods, which use cunning or subterfuge to try and stop you.I won't go into the story too much. The simple plot remains that the Gods have turned against humanity and Nikandreos, resident Greek villager turned Epic Hero must stop them from wiping them out. If this sounds cliche, that's because it is, but only to the modern eye. We live in a society where most media have butchered much of Greek Myth. This is not one of those pieces of media. Apotheon  reflecting a far older brand of storytelling. Unfortunately, players will probably notice the game shares many of its narrative threads with God of War, but the differences pile up quickly. Where God of War sticks to video game tropes, Apotheon is content to ground itself in ancient myth. I find this to be a strike in Apotheon's favor.In gameplay terms it's 2-parts Castlevania or Metroid, and 1-part Legend of Zelda 2. During this side scroller you'll forced to engage in combat and a little bit of platforming and open level design which scrolls in all directions. Each of the game's areas contains various objectives that must first be completed, then usually conclude against  the realms master as a boss, or trial.The common pit falls of it's genre show through however. Too often you'll find yourself wailing on an enemy hoping that a good hit lands, or that you're weapon won't suddenly snap in two and you'll be left with only a dagger to poke at the giant Cyclops roaring for your nu**s. Another common problem I found was that sometimes, when both parties were melee focused, we'd be hacking at each other with neither hitting because the hitboxes didn't register super close hits. Everything else seems to be good however. You can use a multitude of different weapons to kill your enemy's with including Spears, Bow&Arrows, Swords, Maces, Glaves, Hammers, Rocks, and explosives.Soundtrack wise; it's passable. I found myself mildly surprised that a game with such insane visuals would have such a mediocre OST. To be fair however, soundtracks are often one of the harder development processes for Indie devs.Final thoughts: An exceptional oddity in our world of graphical powerhouses' like Crysis and Battlefield. This game to me looks better than all of them simply due to it's art style. The combat is rock solid to, and the game boasts a fun story for you to keep you invested.Slightly harder to justify at Retail price, but under any discount this becomes a steal. A definite recommendation to anyone with a passing interest in myth, Metroidvania, or looks for a fun distraction.• Good Combat, If a little clunky• Good Story• Gorgeous and Unique visuals• Reasonable length.

												Apotheon~~~~~~~~  Apotheon is a well structured 2D platformer based on Greek mythology.  You play Nikandreos and you have an epic fight ahead of you against the gods. The Greek artwork is really well done and the atmosphere will captivates you in this frantic era.   The levels are fairly large, therefore you will find it extremely useful to use the local and world map to pinpoint where you are. You can also use the map to find ancient writing. You will be able to gather plenty of weapons like spears, arrows, swords, axes and much more.  In terms of protection, armours and shields are pretty much it. Mind you, you can find upgrades for your armours which are often in chests. Crafting, health potions and fire bombs (Greek fire in the game) are vital to your success.In regards to the combat interface is actually good but it will take you a little bit of time to master all the different aspects of it. Be prepared to use all buttons on your gamepad. It can be challenging at times. Positives:~~~~~~~~ -	Great artwork and atmosphere-	Large levels-	Challenging-	Stacks of things to collect  and do-	Achievements-	Trading cardsNegative:~~~~~~~~ -	Controls a bit challenging at the start (Gamepad)Apotheon is a little gem. If you enjoyed Guacamelee you will love this game.9.5/10MORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HEREFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE "

												There is something really satisfying about Apotheons fighting system.  Swapping through weapons to try new tactics out is a blast.Also, if you happen to find a really big rock you can pick up at some point, do yourself a favor and huff it at someones head.Pair this up with well drawn, greek pottery inspired art, a powerful soundtrack, and some pretty solid voice work, and Apotheon comes out as a quality title definitely worth checking out.

												A preface: I'm very reluctantly not recommending this game. It was a gift, for one, and secondly I really wanted to like it on its own terms. I'm a Classical scholar, and the concept is all kinds of wonderful. But I feel duty bound to be honest to anyone thinking of buying the game, so here we go:Pros:+ The art style is superb. I feel like this game could have been a top-notch animated film. It's not only beautiful but steeped in the iconography and lore of the ancient Greeks. Could not be better.+ The music, likewise, is evocative and well suited to the gameplay.+ The concept of an ancient Greek themed platformer inspired by pottery is fantastic.Meh:= The story was simplistic. This is something that could appeal to some but not all gamers. = If you're familiar with ancient Greek epic, religion, or myths at all, you might have some moments of frustration. I knew the hero was making some really poor choices but, as with any linear game, you have to go along with it. Some might find it a refreshing twist on the old stories.Cons:- What other reviews have said about the combat is, sadly, true. The controls are terrible on KB and mouse.- Combat feels floaty. There were several moments when enemies killed themselves, threw themselves out of the level including an elite. It is also possible for one boss battle, at least, to become glitched if a required item is knocked out of the level by the boss.- Boss battles have neat gimmicks but are implemented poorly. Each boss has been less about challenge and working out a strategy, or being skilled, but simply having the patience to grind it down.  "

												Apotheon is a real gem of a game from a very involved developper. The fact that this game managed to pull me in and provide a memorable experience despite the fact that I don't generally like side-scrolling action is a testament to its charm. While Apotheon shamelessly borrows from Capsized (the dev's previous release, which I also highly recommend BTW), it still manages to offer something special. The fabulous atmosphere created by the original art style and music, the highly responsive technical real-time combat, and surprising variety of scenarios and playstyle options make this an overall above-average game, especially for a smaller developper.   PROS:-Great ambiance with unique graphics, excellent music/sounds and real voice acting(!)-Engaging story and lore delivered in a non-interfering way-Simple and responsive controls with high freedom of movement-No real frustrating/annoying puzzles blocking your progress-Tactical, real-time combat is fast-paced and satisfying-Boss fights are well designed and require some quick adaptation-Huge selection of historically accurate weapons allow some playstyle options-Good amount of optional content (secrets, extra locations and ""side quests"")-Nice variety of locations, objectives and scenarios-Involved and dedicated dev who actually cares about the productCONS:-Fairly short campaign (CAN be a PRO if you're busy and like actually finishing games)-Limited replay value-Late game balance is real cake-mode unless switched to higher difficulty-Some boss encounters can be frustrating until you figure it out-Somewhat lacking crafting/inventory system feels a bit incomplete  TL;DR - There is very little I can say against this very original and well-executed game: 100% worth the price and time.

Posted: January 9, 2016
Summary:Apotheon is a metroidvania platformer with really unique combat and visual style, combined with great soundtrack. Combat style revolves about proper timing and aiming, even with melee weapons - your enemies dodge your attacks pretty often, don't expect anyone going easy on you. But melee fights aren't everything, you'll have to be prepared also on ranged combat - you can shoot arrows and throw javelins or just any weapon you're just holding. Combining the right attack strategy for fights make a huge difference.What excels on Apotheon is the visual style of Ancient Greek, where also the story goes. These graphics might not be winsome for everybody but it's nice to see the level of details developers put into it. Anyway, it's not their first platformer (as you may already know Capsized, for example), so it's great to see how they are getting better and innovating the genre.Pros:- Combat system that requires to be precise. Spamming attacks will not get you so far here.- Two difficulty settings. The second one is great for those who want to make Apotheon more like Dark Souls experience. The enemies won't be only stronger, they'll also interrupt your attack if they slash first.- Ancient Greek environment. Made to the eye candy level of graphics, just great to watch all the details.- Nice soundtrack. Cons:- Beware, if you have a GPU combined with integrated GPU, you'll have to manually switch GPU in your driver settings.			"

												If I could give this a recommendation somewhere between yes and no, I would definitely be doing it. However, I'm saying yes because it's worth a playthrough, BUT only if you can get it on sale. To summarise why:Pros:- Gee golly this game is beautifully designed when it comes to the art style.- It doesn't pretend to be something innovative. It's a sidescrolling action/adventure game and it knows it.- The stamina system makes for an interesting combat mechanic, making you choose when to strike a little better instead of just flailing away until things die.- There's actually quite a large array of weapons in this game. Bows, spears, swords, maces and shields all come in many varieties. Just enough to keep things interesting, anyway.- Really easy achievements if that what you're in to.Cons:- The controls are terrible. T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E. I've spelled it out for you, just in case. Plain and simple it's just a nightmare to aim, swing a sword, jump from ledge to ledge.. Hell, just about everything.- Tedious. It's mainly fetch quests with some puzzles thrown in every now and then. It is fun for the most part, but can get a little tiresome in a long session.It's also very short but I wouldn't know which section to put it in as it could be seen as good or bad, depending on your views of the game anyway.So in short. Buy this game if it goes on sale. If it doesn't, you should probably avoid it.			"

												This game, simply, is amazing and great. A nice break from blockbuster games like Far Cry, GTA, Skyrim, etc., the game took me roughly 10 hours to beat and obtain every single achievement (except the ""beat the game a second time"" achievement, which can be acquired using a small glitch). The music is very nice and adds to the overall feeling and emotion of the game. There is plenty of classic ""Greek/Roman"" music--what you would imagine playing in epic scenes of Greek/Roman Movies. Gameplay-wise, there is some room to be filled. Controls are totally fine on Keyboard, but there were many small times where I wish there was some better ease of controls (i.e. I had to manually go into inventory to change weapons. You can hotkey Primary/Ranged/Tertiary/Potion, but within each of the slots you need to manually go into inventory to switch). Hitting enemies is also sometimes hit or miss (pun intended?), as if the enemy is layered on top of you, your attack might not register as hitting them. However, there is lots to explore and enjoy throughout the entire game. If this game looked interesting to you, do yourself a favor and pick it up during a sale if you need that little boost of incentive. Overall, a solid 8.5 out of 10. Although marred by a few problems that can be easily overlooked, this game appeals to the senses and really executes what it set out to do in a brilliant and spectacular way.			"

												What's the first thing you think of when you think of ancient Greece?  No, not that!  Get your mind out the gutter, you degenerate!  Okay, what's the second thing?  Right!  The awesome myths of heroes and gods!  You think of Odysseus blinding the cyclops, Zeus overthrowing the titans, and... uh, Heracles mucking out some stables!  Yeah, that's the ticket.With all these feats of heroism wouldn't it be sweet if there was a video game that took place in ancient Greece, so that we too could test our mettle against these gods and monsters?  What's that?  God of War?  No, no.  That won't do at all.  I'm talking about something that wasn't pushed through the filter of what thirteen year old boys think is cool.  Something that's got fun gameplay, sure.  But something that keeps it classical, you know?  Preserves the tone and character of the myths.  Fortunately for us, we've got Apotheon.Assuming you've at least looked at the screen shots, I don't need to sell you on Apotheon's visual aesthetic.  It just looks great.  Bold black character models, flattened in profile, placed on warm background colors and intricate patterns do an excellent job of making you feel like you're playing an ancient Greek vase come to life.It's clear a lot of work was put into Apotheon's visuals, but I'll admit, I almost passed on Apotheon, since I was concerned there might not be any substance behind the style and very little was said about it when I first had a look.  It's too easy to fall into the ""art game"" trap, these days.  I grew still more concerned in a different way when some of the voice acting for the early game's enemies intruded on the stately visuals with an out of place cockney sounding accent.  And still more worried when it introduced the main conceit of the game as ""the gods have taken their gifts from man and it's up to you to overthrow them one by one.""Ugh.  Groan.  Spit.  We're really doing the God of War thing?  We're really giong to treat the Olympians as one big boss rush?  No concern for all the gods' benevolent qualities?  No mention of the heroes they helped, the customs they preserved?  Just gonna treat them as absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥♥all the time?  Ladies and gentlemen, I will confess that I was genuinely worried that upon my descent into Hades I would find the big man himself putting on his best James Woods playing Hades-as-the-Christian-devil before a meat-head slam down as the hero against an irredeemable evil.But, mercifully, for its couple of worrisome first impressions, Apotheon never went that route.  Yes, you do play as the mortal hero, Nikandreos, on his quest to conquer Olympus and steal the gods' powers.  And, yeah, that concept's a little off-base from the mythology, but Apotheon always manages to treat the source material with a great deal of knowledge and respect and it gets all of the points for that.  Aside from the odd intro enemies, the voice acting is good and, I would say, necessary for presenting the extreme personalities of the Greek gods.  Most importantly, their characters are preserved.  Oh yes, your encounter with Ares will be a slaughter-fest bordering on supernatural Hulkamania, but that's befitting the charcter of Ares.  Your meeting with Hades on the other hand is one of a number that pass without violence and with a lot of understanding for your plight.  And just to ensure that the fight-the-gods premise is pulled off with panache, Apotheon makes sure to vary its gameplay to suit the gods' realms and keep each climactic encounter with the gods themselves true to their characters.  I knew, for instance, that I was in for something special when my showdown against Artemis took the form of a demented game of tag, with the role of hunter and prey switching as I navigated the level.In Poseidon's realm you get to ride a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ horse!  People who know about mythology just came!Sorry, I got excited there.  The fundamental gameplay for Apotheon is fairly simple.  You can attack with an absurd variety of ancient weapons: spears, swords, axes, pitchforks, bows, javelins, rocks, the power of love, an arrow that's three arrows, a flying saucer, a sword on fire....  Look, it's a big list, okay?  And you can block with a shield if you have one equipped.  You can adjust the angle of your attack with melee as well as ranged weapons to sneak blows past enemy shields.  But despite the extreme variety of weaponry, your equipment will break on you mid-battle.  Normally, I'd question the setting's decision to make equipment out of paper mache, but it was the bronze age, I guess. Combat gets fairly frantic as you and your opponents are smashing each others' shields and you dodge roll around like Sonic the effin' Hedgehog while you scramble to pull out your next favored weapon.It's gets a bit metroidvania-ish with you being able to explore large areas of Olympus right out of the gate.  There are lots of secrets to find and reasons to backtrack, athough the game is about as good at rewarding the player as someone saying ""open your mouth and close your eyes.""  More on that later.  It's also a bit step platformer-y, with movement focused on jumping and climbing around on your environment.  Nothing really unique, but it works.There are some RPG elements where you can buy upgrades to speed and damage with various weapon types, but it's minimal.  You start with everything you need right out of the box.But it wouldn't be like an ancient urn without some cracks in it, would it?  The core gameplay is weak when it comes to precision.  I found that the arrow telling me where I was aiming with my ranged weapons only had a token resemblance to where my attack was actually going and that made a few puzzles that relied on that precision tedious.  The sheer volume of weapons can also quickly become a hindrance.  Yes, you will need a lot of weapons since they break quickly.  But it sucks to cycle through your huge inventory looking for the next spear weapon in the heat of the fight, especially since they aren't placed next to each other for some reason.  It also makes one wonder why Nikandreos can't drop some swords and axes to hold more spears if you happen to have been giving him more proficiency with them.On the huge inventory note, there's also a crafting system that feels a bit gratuitous.  Yes, the potions and things you can make are useful.  But so often, I found myself overburdened with materials that only had one or two specific uses, I couldn't help but wonder, ""Is this necessary?  Could you maybe have just given me the final product instead of making me go through this extra flow-breaking step.""  And as I've briefly mentioned, Apotheon doesn't seem to know how to reward questing and exploration.  I did one side-quest for an optional god and ended up with something that increased the duration of poison damage.  There aren't any weapons that do poison damage. No, really, I didn't find any and I found everything.  You also get a grappling hook for another elaborate sidequest that allows you to explore absolutely ♥♥♥♥-all you couldn't without it.  Generally, there's very little reason to go after all the secret treasures.  Odds are you've found one or two weapons you really like and that chest is going to contain those special sling bullets you are already maxed out on because you never use them or a backstabbing dagger in a game without real stealth mechanics.But for its flaws, Apotheon's gameplay feels shield-shatteringly epic and suits the mythology well.  I'm always happy to pick some nits, but the broad strokes are exactly what they need to be.Indeed, short of including butt-stuff mechanics, I'd say that Apotheon has everything you need to get the full experience of epic Greek mythology.  It's certainly the best take on the subject material I've seen to date and it's just good fun.			"

												Apotheon is one of the best side-scrolling games I have ever played. The gameplay is solid, including both combat and puzzles; the artwork is beautiful; and the story is a fantastic take on the mysterious Dark Age of ancient Greece. As a Classicist myself I found this game pleasantly familiar and the depictions of various Gods and Heroes are incredibly true to the mythology, something very rare in games based in the ancient periods. Furthermore, players can learn more about the mythology they are immersing themselves in by reading little passages from ancient texts located around the areas. I cannot recommend this game enough. I really enjoyed my time playing it, and truly felt by the end that I had achieved Apotheosis.And who doesn't want to be a capricious ancient Greek God?			"

												It's fantastic, lot's to do in this game. It's actually very long, 10+ hours to get through most of the game. I missed a few things so I'm going back to complete more. There are heaps of boss fights and each level provides something unique to the world. I'm happy that not only does this game look amazing, they've spent a lot of time on the levels and is a complete game.Combat is not hack and slash. You are going to need to block and time your attacks, and can get challenging at parts. Almost like a 2D Dark Souls. Except without the punishing difficulty because it still lets you Quick Save. (Although there are difficulty options that can make it way way harder for those that like that)So other things that make this game awesome:+ Fun challenging combat becoming more satisfying as you grow stronger. ENDING IS GREAT+ Switch between weapons easily, carry more than 10+ weapons at a time because why not.+ Weapons break after too much use, which forces you to rethink your combat strategies. Keeps the game fresh.+ Works great with Keyboard + Mouse, gamepad works fine too. I decided to use Keyboard and Mouse as I prefer the precision of a mouse when using long range weapons.+ Quick Saves, and multiple save slots.Things missing for me, - NEWGAME+ mode would be great - Greek Language voice audio would complete the immersion.Thank you AlienTrap for this fantastic game. I wish there were more games with Ancient Greek Mythology.			"

												Apotheon, the game that is most well-known for its looks. The style mimicking the one of  ancient greek pottery feels strikingly unusual and memorable. If only ancient greeks knew. Or maybe they did, but you surely won’t know it from this game. As predictable as it seems, the story revolves around killing gods in order to take their godly powers from them; and as revenge on them for being sadistical mass-murdering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The olympic dwellers had decided that the mortals are “not worthy” anymore and all quit their god-jobs. There’s no more sun rising and setting; the soil has lost all its fertility. People are starved. As a result there’s banditry. So you find your hero in the midst of a raider attack on his village. Nikandreos fights them off effectively and makes it to the high ground, where the Hera's temple is originated. She offers him assistance in solving his people misfortunes by killing Zeus, who is portrayed like a constantly horny idiot making all of this just on a whim. Not that it isn’t accurate according to myths. After all we’re talking about a guy, who turned himself into a ♥♥♥♥ing swan to♥♥♥♥♥♥a daughter of king of Sparta, right?So you’re sent to Olympus and there’s all that familiar jazz dating back to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. There’s a map where exact locations of where you should be going right now are marked with your goals noted; usually it’s something like “acquire the aegis of Athena”. Sometimes it  doesn’t even involve killing another god, because of course there are those among deities who are sympathetic to humans, but can’t do anything except provide you with tasks of going to dangerous places and doing all that fighting along the way. The map isn’t uncovered initially though, so these arrows are just indicators of general “right” direction. Somewhere you need to go, rather than can. What you can is to start wandering around uncovering secrets and hidden areas, secret caches with upgrades and weapons or even vendors selling some potions or recipes for summoning stuff. As far as optionality goes you don’t even need to acquire all the gods’ powers available in the game but can instead stick only to mandatory ones, those with tiny arrows attached.If not in terms of amount of such content, but in a sense of proportion of it in the core experience Apotheon surely took notice of what first Dark Souls did. Same is true for combat mechanics of the game. You’ve got a stamina bar which is used for blocking with left trigger on the gamepad and attack on the right one; there are combat rolls and tons of weapons with different attack animations. Cautionary exploring is rewarded and smart tactics can save you a lot of trouble. Knowing your weapon, its speed and reach is a must; handling it properly is even more so. To keep things spicier there’s need to actually target your weapon with a right stick, which takes place of the positioning depth of 3d games. You can just try to mash attack facing in general direction of a nearest surprisingly tanned ancient greek god or his eternally respawning minion, but if would be hardly effective. Enemies try to dodge, block and reposition themselves as much as you do, so catching them mid-flight with a pointy tip of your weapon at least sometimes would be life-saving. To make things even more complex the game throws in an ability to use ranged weaponry and even throw your main equipped one right in the surprised face of another evil cyclops. On top of that there’s traps, armor system, health regeneration system, environmental weapons like big blocks of stone lying around here and there. Upgrades apart from gods’ powers are bought with gold and either are pieces of armor or static bonuses with percentage of attack speed and damage added to certain types of weapon. This works for a world where weapons break all the time, and those “repair kits” don’t actually repair anything, but just fill up that armor bar. Thankfully you’re not really limited around in what you can bring to another fight. You can’t have two of one weapon type for a few exceptions, but you can carry all your armory within their respective limits in those non-existent ancient greek pockets of yours. Axes, lances, swords, arrows, throwing rocks — everything can be used considering you’ve dealt with controls while dodging all those life-threatening stuff.Of course finding those ingredients for potions and refilling a stock of preferable spears takes some time. In a few hours breaking all the boxes and looking for them outside of a scope of main adventure will be usual. Wandering around and exploring actually helps, so it becomes natural. In the middle of another house break-in when another citizen of Olympus will offer to you “take what you want and leave”, you may even question yourself what is a real motivation of our hero is. Revenge? Hope to help mankind? Lust for power? Isn’t robbing wrong? But then the game throws in another factually correct retelling of another myth, and you can see who’s the real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ here. A musical contest with a mortal for any wish where the obvious winner wishes to flay the loser alive — how does that sound? In the script of the game that stands for some stabbing and acquiring Apollo’s lyre. Making a way through the game’s world while engaging in interesting combat and enjoying the view accompanied by a good symphonic soundtrack is engaging. As for the story, it focuses more on epic battles and general translation of a end-of-times feeling. That is enough to make a great game.			"

												I like this game, the art style is unique.The game can last for 8 hours, although the story is satisfying it does need some improvements.- Gameplay is alright, variety of weapons but the weapon merchant is pointless. You can just pick those weapons up from the ground.- Story is mixed, you don't have a connection with the people you are saving. It's just a ""Save me!"" and you go off to be the hero. No background about the character that I can see. However the personalities of the Gods are brilliant, the majority of boss fights were fun, but not as challenging as say Dark Souls.- I was a bit disappointed there was an option for playing co-op local, but not online.- Game is early (or at least when this review was made.) So there are crashes, I encountered one just before the finish which disappointed me. Especially when having a satisfying end.But what surprise me was that there were some pretty good puzzles and levels, as I mentioned earlier the boss fights were fun and the change of scenery was nice. Also the lore, quotes and sources that were used in the game is an excellent touch. Would I recommend this game? Definitely!			"

												After playing this for almost 20 hours during the mid-late beta, I can't help but recommend it. Easily one of the best action platformers I have played in recent memory.- Immersive, unique style - but more than just a pretty face.- Satisfying combat that can be very rewarding on higher difficulties. - Encourages varying fighting styles, with heaps of unique weapons. Fight up close with sword and shield, keep your enemy at a distance with spears, or attack from afar with a bow. - Unexpectedly varied gameplay. Every area offers something new, in both visuals and gameplay.- A fun 2-player battle mode (just remember to bring two controllers). "

												When I was a kid, I'd go through photos of Greek black-figure pottery and get stoked about how action-packed it was. I was also a fan of Greek mythology. NOW IT'S A GAME!I've played a few hours of the campaign mode so far, and it's fun. Cool weapons, bloody kills, fluid movement, beautiful artwork and sound. Also - YOU CAN THROW ALL YOUR WEAPONS which is a good laugh, especially when they connect with a dude's neck.I've been streaming a few hours of gameplay on twitch.tv/w0lfrock if you haven't seen any Let's Play video yet.Using an xbox360 controller and the controller support is good. I can see how using a mouse / keyboard would be a little easier with aiming, but I'm happy using a controller.Local arena mode is a little like Nidhogg, but with a variety of weapons and boulders. The arena mode is NOT ONLINE, which would be awesome if they had it but would probably add quite a bit to the dev budget. Solid game, easily worth it at full price. Especially if you're buying it in CDN$ (Steam games are cheaper in Canada right now than in the USA because of the horrible exchange rate, shhhh!)			"

												All you really need to know going into Apotheon is this:Mount Olympus is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. You are Nikandreos, humanity's last hope against Zeus and his family of mongrels. In case you missed the thumbs-up, I like this game. Consistency is an oft-overlooked aspect of game-design. Apotheon's art-direction is essentially patterned after ancient Greek paintings. If you ever looked at some pottery and wondered ""What if someone made a side-scrolling action game out of this?"" this is about as close a result as you could imagine. Going further, Apotheon's art-direction affects how the game is played. Everything animates in a very stiff manner. It's off-putting at first, and likely won't gel with fans of franchises such as Castlevania. This is what makes consistency such a double-edged sword. This game couldn't have its unique visuals AND the mechanics/animation of a traditional side-scroller, it would look weird.Combat is all about commitment. Your defensive options are varied and effective at any moment. However, when you swing your sword, stab with your spear, or fire an arrow, you're going to be extremely vulnerable. Aiming & timing are essential; if both aren't true, you're going to take damage. While your skills can be upgraded, attacking is never instantaneous. Most of the time, you have to give your attack half a second to connect, and button-mashing is futile. Encounters tend to be short, as enemies can be killed in a few solid strikes. Furthermore, certain techniques (such as aiming for the legs) can force the enemies to crumple, leaving their head exposed to a critical strike. The other interesting aspect of combat is that weapons are fragile. While it's expected that players will find armanents that suit their play-style, it's also common that they'll have to make do with what's available. This tends to keep every encounter fresh, since the player can't afford to exhaust their favorites. Thankfully, Apotheon is balanced in the sense that bosses or other tough enemies don't require the ""best"" weapons. The boss-fights are mostly unique, and tend to involve unexpected events. In short, intuition and reflexes are the weapons you should rely on. In my play-through I got by relying almost entirely on common weapons. In true Resident Evil fashion, I saved all of my best stuff for...that time after I beat the game and realized that maybe I should have used some of it. Perhaps on the harder difficulty I'll be a little less frugal. Hades, I didn't even touch the ability-boosting potions. Sure they provide temporary boosts, but that's still better than nonexistent. Exploration is also a common element of this game. Each area has numerous secrets, most of which are hidden behind cracked walls and floors. Rewards are typically in the form of gold, weapons, and sometimes even God-granted powers. However, one aspect that is a bit disappointing is that there really aren't any powers that assist in exploration, or allow you access to new areas. Aside from bombs -- which are acquired as early as the first dungeon -- there aren't any techniques that allow Nikandreos to jump higher, fly, or reach areas he couldn't before. A side-quest unlocks a weapon called the Caduceus. It has a grappling mechanism that can be used on faraway objects, or even as a makeshift weapon. It's even possible (if a little finicky) to grab ledges to pull yourself onto. Unfortunately, this weapon can't be used to find new areas. Basically, this game is less Metroidvania than I expected, which is a little disappointing.Apotheon shares innumerable commonalities with the genre, but it does just enough to stand out. Keep in mind though that the art-direction and its resulting combat is *sigh* not for everyone. Some gamers will discount it as clunky and cheap, and that's fine. Everything immediately clicked for me, so I had a pretty good time with the game.			"

												I'm not sure about the label 'platformer' for this game. To me, a platformer game is a much more basic, even simplistic game genre. Yes, Apotheon has a basic platformer layout but the game doesn't consist of jumping from platform to platform, timing each jump carefully to avoid things or to avoid falling to your death. There are only two instances where Apotheon really felt like a platformer but one of those is completely optional (Dionysus) and the other is a very original take on platforming (Athena). If Apotheon is a platformer, it is to modern platformers what 'Gods' was to the SNES and Sega Megadrive (Genesis) consoles. Fun fact: both games are set against a background of ancient Greek mythology, but I digress...I would rather like to describe Apotheon as a 2D action adventure game with basic roleplaying elements, reminiscent of 'hack and slash' games. The game is mainly about combat. Although not perfect, the combat system in Apotheon is pretty decent. There are several types of weapons, each with advantages and disadvantages (speed, range, damage). You can use a shield to block. There is a stamina bar to make you think about your tactics, as opposed to allow you to just spam the attack button. Weapons degrade over time and break pretty quickly. At first, I didn't like this but soon I came to realize it had two important advantages: - if you woud be able to use the best weapon throughout the whole game, it would be way too easy and therefore no fun - this way, you're forced to use different weapons fairly often, making the game more varied and therefore more funThe story: you are Nikandreos, a warrior whose home town gets destroyed because Zeus (king of the gods) thinks it's time to eradicate humanity because its creation didn't turn out the way he'd have liked. So Hera (queen of the gods) suggests you take up arms and go to Mount Olympus to usurp the powers of each of the main gods, either by proving yourself to them or by defeating them, in order to defeat Zeus. That's it, the whole story of the game. This is no game you play for its elaborate, deep story. The fun is exploring the realms of the gods, each satisfyingly different enough and each with one or more boss fights, which are mostly well-thought-out and exciting fights.About the RPG elements: - there is an extremely limited skill system: you can purchase training for 4 levels of skills for the weapon types (sword, axe, spear, mace, bow) - more importantly, there are quite a lot of side quests. Even though they are pretty basic (explore, kill or loot), they are varied and interesting enough to pursue. Here I have to specifically mention the Steam Achievements. There is an achievement for each sidequest. This makes doing these quests feel rewarding. Also, you can start from the achievements and see them as a 'quest log' if you want to make sure you don't miss anything.- there are 'quest hubs' with merchant npcs, with npc houses to explore (and loot!) and with guards who will attack you if they see you you steal or attack anything or anyone.There is also some crafting of utility items (health potions, armor repair hammers, bombs to throw, ...) to add to the mix. Yes, the art style is 2D and looks very simplistic, but it's actually quite easy on the eye and it fits the game and its settings perfectly. The length of the game is perfect as far as I'm concerned. I estimate it took me about 20 hours and by the time I was about to take on Zeus, even though I was never bored with Apotheon, I felt the game shouldn't go on much longer. All in all, I'm positively surprised by this 'simple platformer' and would certainly recommend it.			"

												Highly addictive game! The soundtrack and visuals are stunning! Voice acting is also well done. For an indie game, it has high production values. The combat (especially with ranged weapons) takes some time to get used to but I think is unique and sets the game apart from other games in its genre. Boss battles are definitely one of the highlights of Apotheon!The freedom to explore every nook and cranny is phenomenal, you can go from emptying houses of valuables to diving to sunken ruins for treasures. Plus there are many ""hidden"" and optional objectives well worth investigating.Last but not least, Apotheon makes exceptional use of ancient Greece mythology and history and stays true to the Olympian gods' portfolios and their supposed disposition towards humanity.

												This is twice now that Alientrap has tricked me with a promising game spoiled by bizarre, floaty combat. Capsized was a beautiful little odyssey on a hostile alien world, but the enormous cluster♥♥♥♥ that battles inevitably became in every level turned me away. The saving grace of Apotheon is that there's a lot more going on than awkward swordfights, enough to keep me invested and poking through the ruins of antiquity. It's a testement, in fact, to how interesting the world and its secrets are that I can continue to put up with this awful flailing to see it.The Greek pantheon has turned their back on the mortal world (as they so often do in games), and you just happen to be the lucky stiff who gets to sort them out. With the aid of Hera you travel to Olympus to steal back the divine powers that keep Earth spinning and hospitable, but don't expect the gods to take this lightly. You'll need plenty of weapons, armor, potions, and gizmos to survive in their domains and overcome the unique challenges each god presents.Apotheon carves out an interesting niche where games like Zelda II and (funny enough) Journey to Olympus existed so long ago. It's not a metroidvania, but rather a side-scrolling adventure with a whole world to explore as you gain the power and resources to explore it. Olympus serves as a hub for shops and services to spend the gold you find, and then depart into the realm of the next god on your hit list. Major story beats open up new sections of Olympus and new deities to challenge, and there's an appropriately epic tale to carry you along.You may be surprised at the variety of environments you face when you seek out the power of a god. Each realm is cleverly designed to represent their patron and also provide an experience unique from the others. In the forest of Artemis you'll find wild animals to hunt and neutral hunters to compete with. Hades is a land of darkness and lost souls that constantly hound you. And Apollo's realm is a lavish palace that you'll take a very unexpected route through. Each of these areas includes tons of secret rooms and stashes to uncover, as well as unique secrets like special NPCs to meet or legendary vaults to raid.Most realms will have you turning to combat at some point or another, and this is where the game stumbles almost as hard as its goofy combatants. Apotheon takes a stab at 2D tactical melee combat, complete with facing, blocking, locational damage, and stamina. There's even rolling if the comparisons to Dark Souls haven't already made themselves. However, this is all taking place in a realm of platforming where you and your opponents can run like Sonic and leap three times their own height. If combat were somehow slowed and grounded (or even just had player collision) it would work as intended but what you end up with is an insane gaggle of bounding, stabbing bodies flailing at each other until you get enough lucky hits off. Even one-on-one duels devolve into leaping and swiping and missing like spastic, jousting field mice.As bad as the combat is, strangely enough the boss battles almost make up for it in how creative and challenging they are. Not every realm ends with a boss battle but the ones that do have themes just as creative and diverse as the realm itself. Your quest to overcome each god is incredibly faithful to historical legend, with hunts and epic voyages and deception pulled straight from epic poetry. There are labyrinths to escape, seas to sail, and pitched battles between dozens of soldiers, each adhering perfectly to the myths surrounding the deity they fall under. And it's worth mentioning that the ending is spectacular, both in spectacle and stakes.The further I got into Apotheon the more I found myself drawn into its clever world, and not just for the brilliance of the realms. There's a wealth of items and secrets to discover, owing to the transitive nature of the gear you'll use. Your weapons all have durability and break once it runs out with no recourse, so you'll need to constantly be collecting new ones scattered liberally around the world. There are dozens of potions, bombs, and gadgets to help you as well, either found or crafted using easily-gathered materials. You can upgrade your armor and your weapon skills permanently for gold, so accumulating wealth is another driver in the quest for secrets. And then there are legendary items like burning blades and radiant shields to recover and make use of.All this happens in a world that's surprisingly open to how you want to approach it. Hub areas have locked doors and guarded treasures to explore if you choose to challenge the guards. Unique keys and clues access side quests and hidden relics throughout the realms. There are breakable walls, secret switches, and special characters to find as well. By the end I felt like Apotheon had more fascinating secrets than most proper metroidvanias, and my curiosity still has not abated. There's so much to compliment about the game without even touching the incredible art style or sound design that the shoddy, floaty combat seems almost an afterthought. Not many games nail the feel of epic mythology like Apotheon, and fewer still build such a quality game on it.			"

												Apotheon is a 2D action platformer with some (elementary) puzzle, adventure/exploration and RPG elements. It is set in an ancient Greek-like world. Visuals/Graphics: Fantastic concept art, the strongest aspect of the game, hands down. Audio: Music is beautiful, SFX are good and the voice-over is very good as well. Gameplay: Combat is fine but I believe that there's room for improvement. The physics engine is a bit ""floating"", for an action platformer game. Story: Quite predictable, with some twists, but good overall. Of note is its very ""correct"" treatment of the mythology it draws from. Well done!I played the game with mouse+keyboard, on normal difficulty (the lowest), and it took me ~18hrs to complete the game and get all the exploration-related achievements. I don't see me replaying it, unless it gets an important update or a DLC etc. I especially enjoyed the design and challenge offered by the boss fights, which was always tailored to the mythology/lore in question. The game played smoothly and I encountered no serious bugs nor crashes. My only gameplay-related concern was that the physics engine sometimes felt weird, with the hero getting ""rag-dolled"" when hit by enemies; I can't exactly describe it, but sprites didn't feel as ""robust"" as they should.In overall, I believe Alientrap made a huge step forward with Apotheon, compared to their previous game, Capsized. I recommend this game.			"

												Apotheon is an astonishing game in its own way but also depends on a single requirement to you appreciate the same:- Have an appreciation for Greek/Hellenism mythology and culture.Art:An impressive detailing in matters related to  Hellenistic culture and myths of the same, the developers took that to heart of this game, as you clearly notice since the design of a catchy 2D world that pass itself entirely in an ancient Greece pottery, the game wants in a way  to make you see how, in your own eyes, how this civilization, thousands of years ago, saw their own history, education, society and religion, one of the few ways of communication they ever had at disposal, to pass knowledge and learning, just like we have google and digital libraries nowadays to do this kind of work  and they were strictly loyal to that matter. For example: If you goes to Hephaestus temple inside the game and take a close look to the representation the same outside ,you may notice Doric columns, that were usually dedicated to male gods, so the developers did their homework in that point. Gods like Poseidon or Apollo, since their own respective domains appear much more in the game set in comparison to Hephaestus may be better to notice this kind of level details.History:'Grand Theft Auto: Mount Olympus’.In resume you are Nikaendros Vercetti, the badass of Dion and have to show to the Olympus, who is the boss. (That also means to continue serious during your quest while have a drunk Satyr talking of your back at some point).Combat:Ever went  while a kid to a museum and for a while wondered those Hellenistic, thousands years old pottery images of heroes, their tales of great deeds at the side of the object , giving a small historical description and some information of the object and how they actually managed to triumph over almost impossible odds? This game delivers that quite a lot with a few of the boss fights, like the Cyclops and to manage hitting the same eye not just over that part but how remarkable accurate it is the animations over the vast Hellenistic arsenal you have at your disposal fighting other soldiers and mythological creatures.----------------------- Positive------------------------------------------------Art style.-Faithful game background with Hellenistic world that includes combat style, music and amazing atmosphere.-Huge variety of weapons, potions, armor all delivered straight from ancient Greece offering an extremely versatile combat system, kill in the way you want and be happy with your own pottery carnage.-Easy and simple craft system.-Funny dialogs in their own way across several moments over the game.-Astonishing and rewarding exploration, the game really takes your curiosity to explore every corner of the map you are set and prove to not let you down most of the time while finding hidden treasures, notes or keys to even more secrets.---------------------------Negative-------------------------------------------- It may feel repetitive at some points with combat but nothing that you can’t make up with different weapons setup for a change.-  Mechanics itself may feel a bit the lack of polish and wonky sometimes.----------------------------------------Overall--------------------------------There are games out there we say that is more than just for fun but also a piece of art, Apotheon is a clear example of this, a precious hidden jewel,10/10 would definitely goes into pottery graffiti again!

												Apotheon is a 2D game about Greek mythology. Apotheon means “exalted to the state of godhood.” The Ancient Greek gods that we know from Greek mythology and their powers are on display in this game. The storytelling feels quite accurate and would make anyone with knowledge of Greek mythology feel welcome to play this game from the beginning.The protagonist is Nikandreos. Nikandreos means “victory of a man.” Combine Apotheon with Nikandreos and you can imagine what direction the story of this game will be taking. As Nikandreos you will traverse the map ascending to Mount Olympus and be asked to topple Zeus, the father of the gods. The art direction is quite impressive for a 2D game, which includes patterns, shapes, and figures known to be found on Greek pottery. There are diverse weapons and armor that appropriately reflect Ancient Greece. The weapons and armor tend to wear out from use, so you must find or buy new weapons and armor. This is when marketplaces such as Agora and Acropolis come into play. Agora and Acropolis are marketplaces that include weapon merchants, armor merchants, and black market merchants are selling their items. Black market merchants sell the rare weapons, weapons you will find that have unique properties.There is a world map and a local map, both of which will make it very difficult to get lost. The objectives are always well laid out and do not have to be complete in any order. There are Olympian guards in the various towns who will fight you if you try to pick any locks. There is a lot of freedom to move around from town to town. You can try to fight specific gods or goddesses, but you can spend time exploring areas for lockboxes that contain valuable weapons, armor, lockpicks, and potions. You can also complete side quests for other gods and goddesses to gain other powers.I had read from some players that the combat mechanics were clunky. It took me some time to get used to the controls for combat, but the learning curve is not too steep. I used the keyboard/mouse control and I managed to play to the end of the story. The biggest problem that I had with the keyboard/mouse scheme was when I faced three or more enemies at once. This is when your rolling ability is put to the test. Rolling and jumping are the key to winning battles against any enemies, including Olympian guards and gods or goddesses. There is the feeling of using proper tactics against different types of enemies. Simply mashing your buttons will not consistently help you win battles. Every battle, great or small will require tactics to minimize health damage and for victory.It feels disappointing when you lose weapons and shields due to wear and tear, but there will always be new weapons and shields available to replace the old ones without having to pay too much in coins. There are also enough nectar potions and repair kits to help with your health and armor. There are a few difficulty levels such as Warrior, Champion, and Olympian. Olympian is unlocked only after beating the game once. Olympian will not allow Nikandreos to regenerate health after the health is extremely low.As entertaining as this Greek themed game is, it feels like it could have used a little more polish. There were times when I received an error message when trying to reload a save game. It was not much of a big deal, but a more polished Apotheon would have prevented the error message from happening. There was also an apparent bug at the Refuge of Athena, a place where Athena challenges Nikandreos to find keys in a labyrinth. Saving the game where the platforms are always moving then reloading the game caused me to fall to my death every time. I realized that I had to save the game at the beginning where the platform is not moving at all. I believe that a more polished game would have led to a more accurate and less awkward combat system.There is a multiplayer feature for Apotheon, but there is not option to play with the mouse/keyboard scheme. It requires two controllers, which I found strange. There is co-op play, which was included in a recent patch. However, I think that the crux of this game is single player.I found Apotheon to be a decent game with excellent art direction, interesting story, and satisfying gameplay. I firmly believe that with a little more polish this game would have been a classic one. I still recommend this game to anyone, including those with lots of knowledge of Greek mythology and those with casual knowledge of Greek mythology.My Score: 7/10				"

												Very fun and engaging gameplay, excellent art and music, a pretty long single player campaign with much variety in the levels, enemies and boss fights. You get to visit the deities of Olympus, align with some, fight others or beat them in their challenge in a story that is faithful and respectful to elements of the greek mythology. You will find many weapons, fight lots of enemies and mythic monsters while seeking to complete your quest. And there are also lots of side objectives and secrets to discover.Highly recommended!			"

												Overall, this felt a little shallow to me.  The plot was pretty thin (gods have abandoned humanity, so go kill them all), the combat was floaty and imprecise, and the level design is sprawling and a bit directionless.  I found myself mindlessly following the objective arrows, usually running straight past enemies that I couldn't be bothered engaging with (and didn't need to, as they're so slow).I gave it a few hours, but it didn't seem to be getting any better so I dropped it after a few bosses.On the plus side, the art style looks great, the music fits nicely, and the voice acting is fairly good.  But ultimately, it didn't engage me.			"

												I have finished the game, and let me tell you, I really liked it. This game is the epitome of an indie quality product. The amount of inmertion thanks to the background music and, of course, the outstanding artstyle, makes this a game worth trying. I took 10 hours, wich for the price of this game, is pretty fair. Also, I haven't done all of the game's ""sidequests"", so I still have more to do.Something important that I didn't expect from this game (because it isn't stated anywhere in the store page) was the fact that it's open world, therefore, those ""sidequests"" exists. Altough some are just are kind of dull, they give a change of pace to the game if the player ever wishes for one. But either way, the game changes the pace by itself. For example, getting to Athena is very diferent from getting to Poseidon. And in a related topic, let me tell you, I was surprised by the amount of creativity that the boss fights have+Pros1.-THE ARTSTYLE. You can see that the artstyle is not only unique, but well crafted and incredible. It's what convinced me to buy the game, and I wasn't dissapointed. You really feel like you are one big piece of ancient art, and it's amazing.2.-Greek mythology. Many games think that just because God of war succeeded with Greek mythology, it's easy to abuse it. That has been proven wrong. But in this case, they nailed it perfectly.3.-The controls. They are very responsive, and once you get a hold of the weapons, you find your own fighting style naturally. 4.-Level design. Once you finish the first level (which works as a good, non-boring tutorial) they give you a bit of freedom to do as you please (but thread carefully). In the levels themselves, the enemies feel in place, and the moments without combat generally serve a purpose, and last just long enough.5.-Boss fights. If you are like me, and like a good, creative, brutal and old-fashioned fight against amighty, fearsome and satisfying enemy, then this is the game for you. The classic feeling stays there even with the large amount of creativity that most boss fights have. Rarely are two boss fight the same, or even simlar, which is impresive.6.-Pace of the game. The ""tutorial"" is fun, and gives a good taste of what's to come. The difficulty curve is very smooth (unless you try to go too crazy and go, for example, to Hades before Apollo, you may have a bit of trouble). And as I said before, every boss is different, and also the common enemies tend to vary, so you must change strategies from time to time. This prevents the game for getting tedious at all times.-Cons1.-Hitboxes. Sometimes you are sure you hit somebody (or that you got hit) but nothing happens. If youlike close combat, you may find a strange and maybe awkward combat situation now and then. And this is way more common that it should. Most times it is actually funny, but when the game gets harder, it might end in a frustrating moment.2.- Map design. It's not bad by any means, just that sometimes is a little too simple, and relies on changing ""areas"" to keep the flow of the game. The again, the inmersion of the game makes it hard to noctice sometimes.Veredict:9/10 Highly recomended.A fine piece of an indie game at a low price, with an artstyle that has never been seen. The fun factor is always present in this enjoyable experience.			"

												When I bought this game I wasn't expecting it to be so good. Even if you aren't really into these kinds of games, Apotheon is definitely one to try out. The story is interesting and the trials are engaging. The characters are great and I was sad to see the game end. I was never taught about Greek mythology in school, so I was very interested in reading the different plaques which gave information on the different gods and goddesses.The gameplay is engaging and the different upgrades and weapons keep the game changing in a way that makes you feel supreme when you visit a previous area with advanced weapons, but still challenging in current stage bosses. Speaking of which, not all boss moments are fights. Some are tests, some are puzzels, and some are games (in the case of Dionysus, a drinking game!). Although the fights are slightly challenging on Warrior difficulty, I suggest playing the game on Champion for the full experience. The directional combat may get a bit annoying from time to time when Nikandreos swings with a mind of his own, but it's still fun!Of all the aspects of the game, the artwork is probably the best. And I'm not just talking about the nudity!. The art style, and the illusion that the whole game is painted on a stone wall, give the game a very epic (meaning story/legend) feeling and a very epic (meaning awesome/cool) look.I really had fun playing this game and, as it is now nearlly 6 am (after being up all night playing this) and I have a lecture at 10, I am going to need to wrap this up. Overall a really good game and definitely worth getting. It is worth more than the price paid for it. Trust me. I'm just some guy you met on the internet!9.5/10			"

												This is the first game I've played in as long as I can remember where I kept playing after I finished the main story just to collect all the items, do all the sidequests, and explore the world. Having the entire game look like the artwork on an ancient greek urn was an inspired decision and it really payed off. Just walking through the different areas and looking at all the statues and characters and enviroments is a lot of fun, and that's a big part of what made me want to keep playing.The combat takes some getting used to but can also be a lot of fun. I think a big part of what makes it difficult at first is that a lot of weapons have a long wind up time before the strike, whereas in most platformers the strike happens almost instantenously. I can see why some people don't like this but to me it made it feel like the attacks have real force behind them which makes landing a blow a lot more satisfying. The other unusual part of combat is that you aim your attacks with the mouse. This probably adds more depth for players who want to really dig into the system and develop their skills, but to me it often felt overcomplicated. However, if you play with a controller your attacks will automatically go in the direction your charcter is facing, so that was a good solution for me. You can still aim your attacks with the right stick if you need to.The story is interesting if you are interested in Ancient Greek literature and mythology. They did a good job portraying all the gods and had some interesting takes on their characters. A touch I really liked is the signposts around the game with quotes from Homer and other Greek authors about the parts of Greek mythology you're currently playing through. One problem I have with the story (and this is a pet peeve of mine that happens in a lot of stories like this) is that the characters all speak in that weird, formal, pseudo-Shakespearian register. It doesn't make sense to do this just because this is set in an old time period. These characters are not English people from 400 years ago, they're based on Greek people from 2,000 years ago. It would have been cool if the writing was more like Stanley Lombardo's translation of Homer, which uses mostly modern language but still sounds appropriately epic.Despite a few drawbacks though, I highly recommend this game. Its a fun and engaging platformer with a good story and a unique and beautiful artstyle.			"

												This game is one of those games that you find, you start up, and you instantly know it will be awesome. Apotheon has a stunning art style, mimicking ancient Greek art perfectly. The story is not the most creative thing but the mission layout is really well made - each zone has tons of variety and there are always multiple ways to conquer them. And the boss fights - don't get me started on those. Each is unique requiring skill and strategy to beat and they have they're own little mechanics to them as well which can make for a nice change. It has some basic platforming elements which admittedly can be tedious, and usually involve jumping, climbing, jumping, climbing and more jumping - followed by climbing - but the rage boiling inside me is let free when I get to massacre a group of enemies at the next area.The combat is reliant on player skill, not character skill, and you constantly need to be switching back and forth between your doru and your xiphos and rolling behind your enemies and lobbing jars of greek fire at them. Despite this, there is a nice system of character progression, and you can upgrade armour, purchase skills etc. Apotheon has basic stealth mechanics built in, and its nice to sneak into someones attic and steal their coins or shoot a satyr in the back from the shadows. I did find myself lost and the map can be confusing. Unfortunately, a lot of time is spent figuring out where to go, but the reward makes up for the painstaking navigation. All in all, despite its flaws, this is a beautiful game that deserves your money. Go get this. NOW. 9/10.			"

Posted: April 18, 2015
												It's been a while since I wrote a review, but I find this game deserving of one. Since this is a story-driven experience:***SPOILER ALERT***Spoilers will be properly marked with tags such as this: Spoiler text read them at your own risk.With that out of the way, let's begin.This 2D sidescroller brawler/platformer is in my opinion a strong contender for best game of 2015 (as of the time of this review, at least). It does pretty much everything right.The first and most noticeable aspect of the game is obviously its art style, which is based on ancient greece pottery painting and links nicely with gameplay elements: enemies units have red markings on them so you can identify them right away, for instance. Nice choice of color for the backgrounds and effects (foam, blood, smoke and so on) and excellent music as well.Gameplay feels very complete and fun: Your character can walk, jump, swim, climb certain slopes (and even the ceiling in a few cases), roll, block with a shield and wield a variety of ranged and melee weapons with their own unique properties. There is some enemy variety, but it isn't the main point here: combat is. While simple, it allows you to perform a variety of attacks, depending on the weapon such as throwing projectiles, upper and lower slashes and thrusts. It is essential to know these in order to attack enemies, specially ones carrying shields. It has some degree of realism to it. For instance, the slow, but long Sarissa will only hurt enemies that are at the tip of the spear just like in real life and that can take some getting used to (althought it is well worth it once you do get used to it). In short, it feels satisfying and controls very well (I used an XBOX 360 controller).Combat also includes several boss battles and this is where the game really shines: This game probably has the most creative set of boss battles I have ever seen. The Olympian Gods you face are not limited to simple brawls: The boss battles really go hand-in-hand with their unique personalities. Good examples are Artemis' Hunt, Hipparchos' horseback battle and  Poseidon rocking your boat .Platforming sections are also well made and creative with sections such as Athena's Maze being one of the most brilliant pieces of level design I've played through in a good while (again, going hand in hand with the Gods' personality).Gameplay also includes certain metroidvania elements such as the big overworld with several subsections, but don't expect a whole lot of hidden secrets and any form of item progression (I.E. this item allows you to access this area which gets you a new item for a new area and so on) here. It has a simpler approach, as the focus of the game is the combat. A small market and extremely simple (I mean it in a good way) crafting system provide a small degree of RPG elements to the experience, giving you some choice regarding the direction you wanna take your character in without feeling complex to the point that it detracts from the action. Like I said before, just right.The story is pretty much what you'd expect from Greek Mythology:***SPOILER ALERT AGAIN***Arrogant, capricious Gods, stern heroes, the strength of men, clashes for power, betrayal, vengeance and lots of blood.The ending moments genuinely surprised me (in a pleasant way, actually), but this is probably because I was sure it was gonna go down a certain way (and it didn't). Again, a mention to the boss battles being able to truly deliver a perfect and satisfying experience that's fitting with what's going on, story-wise. Speaking of the campaign, the game lasts just the right amount of time without feeling too short like a sudden ending and without dragging on to the point of becoming boring and causing the player to go ""ugh, get to the point already!"". Again, just right.All of that I said above refers to the campaign mode: There is also a fun duel minigame that can be played locally with a friend and an online mode which I can't comment on here, because I couldn't find games as of this time (Then again, I haven't really tried and it's still in beta, so some problems are to be expected).Anything bad I could say about the game would be nitpicking and would not harm the overall experience in any way (the only thing I can think of right now is how slopes slow you down as you're getting momentum to start running... feels just a bit frustrating. A very minor complaint indeed.)So this is my long review for this game: A fun, satisfying experience that integrates gameplay, story and art perfectly, featuring fun and interesting characters and brutal, bloody 2D action.Buy it!

												I've played it here and there throughout its alpha and beta and continue to be really engaged by the aesthetic and controls. Though you can certainly button mash to get the job done, I appreciated that an effort has been put in to give finesse and skill to the melee combat system. The combat depends on timing and knowing your weapons, which you figure out intuitively by using them. Switching between weapons to equip ones you already have, picking up weapons from defeated enemies and throwing whatever weapon youre holding either in desperation or for that tactical final blow, all work seamlessly as you fight your way through the world.  The dialogue, voice acting and story is unobtrusive or engaging, depending on whether you care for such things (I rather do). The art style is consistent and striking. The music is foreboding. All in all a well crafted game.			"

												It's sure to capture the attention of anyone who sees it in action. Thankfully, the game more than backs up its aesthetic prowess with rewarding combat and exploration systems in place. While the combat hardly changes over the course of the adventure, Apotheon asks the player to apply their knowledge in such a wide variety of ways that it constantly feels fresh and exciting. The ancient Greeks valued balance and harmony in their art, and Alientrap has accomplished just that.http://www.destructoid.com/review-apotheon-287100.phtml "

												Overall I like the main idea of the game. This game is based - Greek. Art style of this game is amazing and really incredible, counting I'm an artist and wannabe' future designer.Same on its own, Greek culture and art, is very interesting and likeable.I love Greek Culture myself, and this makes it even more thrusting.Apotheon is an awesome, I could say, Greek game, in which you play as a Warrior/Fighter, Nikandreos, who lands to find Dion in more ruin then before, with the wrath of the Gods now extending to physical aggression on Earth.People with difficulties through combat, sligh' issues with speed of the game, and FPS, ... That's agreed by me.The game's fighting experience is kind-of too fast, but its perfect in the same time. The FPS issue, not much people have it, as it is, depends on your internet speed/memory or your computer. As im experiencing FPS Issues, to my belief, I know its my Computer itself.I hope this review helped you with the decision of what'd you want to do 'with the game' or what didn't you?Rate: 10.6/10			"

YouTube™ Video: Apotheon: Intro 

			Views: 20		

			The epic journey begins… http://www.apotheongame.com/		

I preordered Apotheon back in May, 2014 for $9.99 and got the game few days before released, as soon as I saw the trailer, I was instantly hooked and pretty satisfied when first playing it.This is the best adventure game I've ever played, even though it's in 2D, the ancient Greek art style is just stunning and I don't think there's any 3D games could deliever this kind of atmosphere.Although sometimes frame rate would drop a bit, there's lots of stuff going on in the background, fire, running civs, enimies and allies fighting etc.Apotheon combines RPG elements with a variety of weapons(all are throwable to attack), shields, training to be more powerful, upgrading your armors, crafting system for potions, traps, and allies(wolf, hawks, undeath... and more).The game also contains rich Greek Mythology, very interesting to learn about the Gods you're fighting with.Apotheon comes with local multiplayer with 1 v 1 death match; online multiplayer hasn't in it yet, but according to developers, it's a possible feature.The story is full of length with lots of stages, side quests, secret passages and maps.To me it worths every penny so I definitely recommend this game!

												Recently I've been looking for less graphics-intensive games to play on my mac laptop.  I wanted something fun with cool artwork that would look pretty on my retina display and this game knocks it out of the park. The ancient Greek style artwork is really cool and well done, while the gameplay is exciting and addicting. I really did not expect to like games such as this (2D, platforming, sidescroller) because I mainly game on my desktop and play all of the huge, popular RPG's and action adventure games. But I'm really glad I gave this a shot so that I can game on my laptop when not at home. Apotheon is great and I look forward to playing more games like it.**Update post completion of gameIn my initial review I focused mainly on the pretty graphics and artwork and the fact that I could play this on my macbook, which in my opinion is not intended for gaming. Now that I have finished the game, I thought it warranted a second review of the gameplay and story.As stated before, this game exceeded expectations. The gameplay, while simple, is subtly complex in ways that I did not realize until I was further into story. My favorite thing about this game is that it has many of the classic action-rpg elements, albeit a slightly simplified version. There are a variety of weapons to find/use, including ""special"" weapons for which you must complete side quests that are not obligatory in the main story. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the game encourages the use of all weapons and items in order to overcome different enemies. Sometimes I found using a spear the best option as it gave me range when fighting multiple enemies, while other times I used swords or hammers for speed or damage. Sometimes, I would lay traps while luring enemies to their doom. Furthermore, all weapon damage can be upgraded using gold at weapon trainers in markets. Armor upgrades come with increased defense, as well as cosmetic changes. When I found the Strategos helm, a large Spartan type helmet, I was elated. You are also able to craft various items and use them to different effects. These range from a simple health potion or firebomb to summoning animals and the undead to fight alongside you. Finally, the movement in this game takes a little getting used to, but once comfortable is very fun. I found out late in the game that in the air you can press the dodge/roll button to do a front or backflip that came in very useful for avoiding projectiles and accessing hard-to-reach places.As for the story I was pleasantly surprised. As far as plot, it is nothing new or unique but is still very well done. Whenever I beat bosses (typically greek gods) I felt a sense of badass-ness, and the final boss fight was as epic as I expected it to be from a mythic Greek hero story. I found the voice acting surprisingly good, which always elevates the story and game for me. Add in the beautiful art style and I was pretty impressed. For a 2D sidescroller that I picked up for 15 bucks, this game was more complex and fun than I thought it would be. It provided me with 20+ hours of gaming, and a very fun experience. I highly recommend it whether you just want something to play on your non-gaming laptop or high-performance gaming rig.			"

												BUY THIS GAME 10/10A long wait for this game but so far I'm very impressed. I've also edited down below where I talk a little about the controls. Where to start?-Level design: big sprawling levels, with various ""missions"" to complete in each one at your own pace and order. A good variety of different environments and I've barely seen anything yet. Also there is a good variety of missions too, the gameplay is not repetitive.-Weapons: Very large variety of different weapons. Melee weapons can be thrown and picked back up. Arrows and javelins can be retrieved as well. Really gives you a lot of options when fighting enemies. I even picked up a boulder and threw it on someones head crushing them. Each weapon breaks and discards after so much usage, but they last a good while before they break. And you find them all over, so you're never unarmed scrambling for a weapon to use. For weapons that you can only carry one of(like the sword), when you pick up a new one, it will discard the old one and not allow you to pick it up again. I like this feature because it's one less thing to manage or think about(Whether or not the sword you picked up was the same one that was about to break that you just dropped) I recommend use a weapon only good enough to beat the opponent in front of you, save the best weapons for the bosses.-Crafting: There is a crafting system, whereby you collect plants, fangs from dogs you kill, etc. And you also get recipes from characters throughout, some they will give you others you will have to buy. You craft healing potions, ""Greek Fire,"" bombs, powder to summon wolf companion, powder to summon Eagle companion to hunt for you. The crafting system is simple, easy to use, and yet there are so many good features it brings to the table(Like the wolf companion). I can't wait to see what else you can make.-Mythology: Stones are placed all over the world with quotes from Ancient Greek literature. They seem to be relevant to where you are in the world as well. By this I mean they inform the creatures and gods directly around you, so you never really feel lost if you are not a scholar in Greek Mythology. I'm learning and it's fun!-Various: Gameplay is great, controls are responsive. I've seen some reviews that think the controls are clunky, but this was not my impression. BTW I've only used a 360 controller. There is certainly a learning curve, but after an hour I had the hang of it though and never looked back. There is an endurance bar in bottom left that will drain if you button spam the melee weapon, and it will take you longer to swing slower. You really need to use your shields and time your strikes. Don't just rush in after a group of enemies, but rather strike from a distance, set up traps, and rush in when numbers are thinned.  Really creative and unique boss fights(like Artemis, Apollo, you'll see). Voice acting, music, and sound effects are great. There is even some humor in the game(the satyrs made me laugh).These are just some of the key points I wanted to highlight. I can only imagine the blood sweat and tears that went into making this. Alientrap did an amazing job. I don't want to say anything definitive about any game before I finish playing but this game has quickly become a favorite, leapfrogging hundreds of games in my backlog I've been meaning to play that will now have to wait even longer. I think we may have a masterpiece here.			"

												A fanstastic and fun to play 2D platform RPG with ancient greek pottery art theme. I spent about 9 hours to complete the game in ""Warrior"" difficulty (Including doing some sidequests).Pros:- Fantastic music.- Loads of different weapons with different stats.- Good voiceacting.- Exploring and pillaging.- Shops for improving skills and armor, and for buying potions and weapons.- Good variety of maps and enemies.- Excellent map system.Cons: - Awkward final boss.- Game crashed a couple of times, due to updates (I think).- Difficult to switch between the different weapons in battles.- Lot's of small details you can find irritating.

												This game is actually very refreshing. It's a platforming hack-n-slash that requires well-timed blocks and a good eye for where to swing. You do navigate obstacles, but the game focuses more on combat. You're often put into situations where you need to juggle between fighting at range and up close. Enemies demand that you overcome their strengths and exploit their weaknesses. The AI is pretty decent, it will strike at you if you leave yourself open, wait for you to drop your guard, and even dodge projecticles if you hurl them wildly. There is a progession system, you upgrade your armor, buy new weapons (which degreade and break after use), upgrade your damage/attack speed with certain weapon types, and purchase recipies for brewing potions (health and buffs mostly). There's a surprising amount of weaponry for an indie game, over a dozen choices. The story is interesting, and while it's not what drives me to play it, I'm definitely interested when the NPCs begin their dialogue. The atmosphere, music, and art are absolutely fantastic; the game does an amazing job aesthetically. The art style is what attracted me to it, but I can say I genuinely ended up enjoying the game; i'd give it a solid 8/10.			"

												An incredible 2D-Platformer with a glitchy but funny combat system.Pros: The graphic style. Greek art at it's finest A really good and driving soundtrack Small but good and well thought crafting system Greek mythology! Great gameplay Free savesCons:  The Combat System can be a bit difficult to master, especially when you are dealing with multiple enemies and must quickly switch between melee combat and archery / granades.  The inventory system is quite hard to manage. Switching between weapons in combat can be really hard. Boss battles are a bit too easyConclusion:As a big fan of Castlevania / Metroid games and the likes i really enjoyed this one.I recommend a controller for this game!This game is highly recommended for everyone who likes ""Metroidvania"" games.

An indie title which seamlessly melds the platforming and RPG genres, and does so without pretense or haughtiness. Apotheon will have the player tackle the twelve Olympians, endeavours culminating in the apotheosis of our Champion. Jump your way through complex 2D levels and collect a myriad of weapons in the realms of the Gods. Solve puzzles in the underworld while escaping from the fires of wrathful Phlegethon. Battle the Gods themselves in some classic boss encounters.Overall, the complexity of mythological narrative coupled by all-too-familiar platforming mechanics make a wonderful addition to the plethora of ""Indie"" titles released daily.

												Learning isn’t really a popular theme for video games these days it seems. I find that a real shame, as there is not much that can be more immersive than a well-made video game. Being dropped into the middle of a strange culture, and absorbing every aspect of it is supremely satisfying for both spirit and mind. As someone who knows quite a bit about Greek mythology, it’s quite obvious that the team over at Alientrap has done their homework as well. The weapons are all standard fare for the time, and can each serve a different purpose. There are ranged and melee weapons, but in a pinch your can throw your melee weapon with the middle mouse button. Just try not to break them all before you find a replacement. The durability on weapons adds greatly to the survival aspect of this game, but is really only the tip of the iceberg. There is a lot here to be excited about, so let’s get into it and take a deeper look at Apotheon.The story revolves around a Greek warrior named Nikandreos, who has been sent by the goddess Hera to kill her god-husband Zeus as punishment for abandoning the people of Greece. Along the way you will fight Zeus’ brothers, daughters, and sons. As you defeat them, you will be powered up. Artemis’ Bow will allow you to fire arrows faster, Apollo’s Lyre will illuminate the dark so a torch isn’t a complete necessity. Before you fight the gods, you will need to complete objectives within their realm. These usually consist of “find this” but some are a bit more thought out. Stealthing around a Satyr party to smash all their wine and make them leave is bliss. Make good use of your Assassin’s Dagger, which does 600% damage from behind. It might also be a good idea to craft some stealth potions… Or you can craft a bunch of explosives and healing salves, and just go Rambo on them. The choice is yours, and adds quite a lot to the replayability.On top of using a different loadout of weapons, there is also an advanced difficulty mode. Enemies have more health, swing faster, and hit harder… I wouldn’t recommend it to start with due to the quick nature of the combat. The aesthetic in the game really captured me, it is all based on the Greek art commonly seen on all manner of decor of the time. When the game goes extremely dark, you might notice that the dark nothingness appears to be made of stone. Major kudos to the guy who thought that one up. I just wish the music was able to keep pace with the graphics, but unfortunately, to me it falls a bit short. It’s not that the music breaks the mood, or isn’t enjoyable. I just found that the songs didn’t really stick with me. Still, the multitude of creatures and heroes and gods that you meet along your path towards bloody revenge would be enough for me to want to complete the story, even if there were no music at all.There is very little criticism I was able to find in Apotheon. Some of the hitboxes are wonky, which can lead to a comical mid-combat moment of both characters flailing their weapons wildly and hitting nothing but air. The music is also a bit bland, as I stated previously. Overall though, I love everything Apotheon has to offer. The endless struggle to find a useable weapon and shield, the crafting of potions capable of amazing feats, and the terrific speed of the running and combat. The entire game feels very fluid, and comes together to form an experience that I’ve never had before and doubt I ever will again. While you won’t be able to write an essay on the rise and fall of Greece, Apotheon is a great game to brush up on your mythology. Or you can just enjoy it for the experience it is, which is great. But I think the tidbits posted add a great deal. Who doesn’t want to read a little passage about Apollo? And once you’re done learning about him, you can murder him! Huge thanks to the folks at Alientrap for developing something that is so much fun, and even slightly edifying.Summary: Greek action-adventure peppered with survival elements and lessons on mythology.Final Score: 8/10 for aesthetic, story, replayability, and education.Full text/photos: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-apotheon/Video review:

												Apotheon is an action adventure that even casual fans of Greek mythology can appreciate. I’ve always had a relatively cursory interest in Greek mythology. The plays and stories are important for literature because they are the stories we continue to tell. I could easily get lost in the family trees and names, but I love the stories that I can remember, and that’s more than enough to appreciate Apotheon’s setting. The black-figure pottery art style is delightful and timeless. It translates the action and feel of the game incredibly well. It effortlessly brings to life all the classic mythos and godly figures of Greece. The music pairs together nicely, but the visuals steal the show. While other games can plunge further down into the uncanny valley, Apotheon can relax comfortably in its mountainside estate.The main plot is that Zeus is having a bad week and tells all of his many children/inbreeds to stop blessing mortals with their gifts which include just about everything they need to survive. Hera enlists our protagonist Nikandreos to fight the Gods of Olympus. The story is predictable in its major points, but I suppose that’s just how classic tales go. The game really shines in its attention to mythos, or so I have heard from those more versed than I. The pacing of the game works in the narrative’s favor as I never found myself listless: I was either enjoying the ride I was on or I was hopping on for another to hunt down secrets and side quests.The gameplay all around is really enjoyable. The game has a good sense of adventure, and Apotheon is willing to commit to the feel of the various areas and scenarios, which makes them all the more satisfying. Having to find a buried treasure sans waypoint, fighting a master huntress as both predator and prey, traversing a spinning labyrinth to lead a small squad against the goddess of wisdom are just some of the many great moments of the game. While it may average around a dozen hours for some, those dozen hours feel expertly designed. Almost every new area I went to felt like an enjoyable spinoff of what was already a fun game, and that’s what makes Apotheon so engrossing: the boss fights and various areas are constructed so well that they can stand on their own but easily fit into the rest of the game.With all the praise out of the way, it’s time to strain out some of the weaker points. While the situations that the game throws you feel fantastic, the game itself does not really grow. You get some new abilities, but otherwise your armor increases and weapons feel the same. There is not much to tweak around with apart from special weapons, there are not skill points and the like. This game keeps the mechanics simple and then surrounds the player in exciting scenarios. Along with this, the main narrative takes a backseat against the different deities the game showcases, which can be a downer for some. The game is not stuck-to-the-rails linear to where you just move forward through set pieces, but rather the player is free to explore the game. These are rather small details that I would not call negatives, but notable qualities.While players should not go in expecting the visceral, veiny phallus of vengeance that is God of War, Apotheon is a delightful action adventure.

												I have never felt the need to write a review on Steam, but this game deserves one.Where do I start...Apotheon is a side-scrolling action & platforming game. The story in short, something is wrong/corrupt on Mount Olympus, and now you have to whoop some a** to find out why. It is much more in-depth than this, but I do not want to spoil anything. If you like reading, there are also several ""vases"" scattered around the world to really flesh out the story and even educate you on some of the myths.Do you remember studying Ancient Greece Mythology? Remember those finely crafted vases? What about the Disney movie, Hercules? Remember when they had segways and story-telling on the side of a vase? That's the art style of this game. In fact, the gameplay is as such as well. The animations completely capture the feel of those vases. It almost feels clunky at times... a good clunky... a clunky that makes sense in this art style. If this is turning you away, don't let it - it needed to feel this way if you ask me. Plus, the enemies experience this as well.After 10 minutes, you'll realize that this is probably one of the most highest quality Castle/Metroidvania that has come out in a long, long time. You find weapons, buy weapons, pick up weapons off the dead bodies of your opposers. These weapons include: (Melee) Sword, Clubs, Spears, Hammers, Shields (Projectiles) Arrows - many different kinds of them, Javelins, Bombs, and Greek fire. Armor is upgradable. You get special powers from defeating bosses.  There are probably tons more as well, I'm only about 2-3 hours in right now so I have a lot more to see.The game also covers many popular mechanics of today as well. Like crafting? It's in the game, and it's actually useful. They didn't complicate this game with recipes that require TOO MUCH reagents. Want to make a bomb? You only need 2 items. Potion? 2 items. Not a fan of potions or bombs? You can make traps. Hate traps? You can summon companion ravens and wolves. Hate companions? WHO COULD HATE A COMPANION WOLF?Anyhow, I think I'm done writing this review now - because I want to play some more. I'll update this is I find anything else that NEEDS to be noted.TL;DR: Buy it.

												If you really mind good art directions this is totally your game. But the art is not the only big deal about this game, the fight system is lovely realism of the good ol' traditional weapons like blades, shields, bow and arrow, and bombs. But you have variety of weapons, javelins, blast arrows, knifes, tridents, etc. The game Has little details in the gameplay that make the game a lot more realistic, even though it haves a really ""not realistic"" aesthetic, and i think that's the eprfect combination.Totally worth the buy, it's so weird to see games with historical concepts, so it's really cool. Pretty much my first fav of 2015. I'm so picky with games i get frustrated because i don't want to play anything, then apotheon appeared <3.			"

Apotheon is one of many 2D platform games, but with its visual style, it creates an unique experience for all gamers to enjoy.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.Note: I played this game when I was on vacation with no internet so playtime and achievements were not registered for some reason. It was a nice vacation, though.What is happening in the game:Greek Gods have abandoned the humanity and it's up to you to fight against the gods, take their power and ensure the humanity to survive.Pros: It will be the first you'll notice and the best thing you'll notice: how the game looks. It's just like those ancient vases and amphorae that you see in museums. I never expected this style to fit this well into the game, but it really looks perfect. The combat mechanics are really enjoyable, you get to try a lot of different weapons like swords and spears (those really long ones). The music is really nice, it fits the environment well and kind of sets you to ancient times. Really nice. Another thing I did not expect in a game is the way it shows spoken text. It shows you the entire thing someone is going to say and it colours the letters as they are spoken, just like in karaoke. You can smash mostly anything you can come across, all the boxes, vases and stuff like that. They can sometimes include coins or other valuables, so it's a good idea to smash everything. There are not only weapons in this game, but it also has a pretty nice shield system. When you hold right click, a large shield pops up in from of you and you can direct it with your mouse. Unique and very useful. You get a lot of weapons and other things in game and this game manages your inventory extremely well. You can keep everything you pick up with no limits, but most of the things ""expire"" after you use them for some time. Linux and MacOS support. Just the way things should be.Cons: Combat system is great in my opinion, but it takes a bit of getting used to it before you master it. I know this is bothering to most people, so I'm listing it here. Sometimes, I feel like there are way to many things on the screen or at least the rich visuals give that feeling. It's not that bad, though.The final verdict:This game is awesome, no questions about it. The visual style itself is almost worth the price, but with the story and music, this is not a game you want to miss. I enjoyed it a lot (again, my playtime did not count, see the note at the top) and it definitely has replayability potential just because it feels so good when you play it. Take a look at the screenshots and you'll know what I'm talking about.I know 15$ is a lot to some people, but really, consider buying it or at least grab it when it's discounted. It's a really unique and charming experience.Greetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

Posted: November 23, 2016
												I first encountered Apotheon through an article on IGN, and was immediately surprised that a developer had been both bold and creative enough to craft a game with such a distinct look. I soon purchased it and began playing in the company of my partner who, like me, is fairly interested in the history of art. To begin with then we were both positively biased towards it simply because of the art direction, and for most of our playthrough that was enough to keep us somewhat engaged. However, after making it through the majority of the game, our opinions had both turned towards frustration, and we decided to abandon the playthrough.Needless to say, the presentational aspects of this game are top quality. It possesses a fantastically idiosyncratic visual aesthetic within the annals of gaming, and the animation imparts a sense of movement to the player-avatar and enemies that sits well within this aesthetic. Indeed, the game has a great sense of design unity between its gameplay, aesthetic and story elements that many games fail to achieve. What's more, the encroachment of cut-scenes and other non-interactive elements is pleasantly minimal.Having said that, there are a few essential areas of design that are so disappointing that I cannot wholeheartedly recommend Apotheon. Firstly, if you are going to play it, do not use a keyboard and mouse configuration, as it renders the otherwise interestingly designed combat mechanics infuriating to use at times. Unfortunately, I was stuck using such a configuration for the majority of the playthrough as I had no access to a console controller, but I grinned and bore it as I recognised that the developers recommend the use of a gamepad. As others have also pointed out, both combat and traversal can sometimes seem floaty, and occasionally movement will glitch in irritating ways, but these are far from the designers’ biggest failings.No, far less forgivable is the overall quality of game and level design. As a massive fan of Super Metroid, I expect certain standards to be met by Metroidvania titles. These include decent variety across level designs, a good degree of depth to exploration, and a reasonably high frequency of being surprised by what I encounter and uncover. Whereas other indie gems of recent years such as Cave Story, Guacamelee! and Axiom Verge triumphed in these regards, Apotheon severely lacks: level layouts are hugely uninspired and often seemed arbitrary; the breadth of discoverable items, treasure and upgrades is disappointingly limited; and there were next to no moments when I felt delighted, excited or impressed by a hidden/hard-to-find game element. By the time I reached the maelstrom of tedious traversal and bland level structuring that is the Poseidon portion of the game (no water-temple/IGN allusion intended), enough was enough. In other regards the game wasn’t quite so disappointing. The narrative is suitably light and no more superficial than what I’ve experienced to be the general standard of game writing. However, unlike the visuals, the story-based elements did seem to lack ‘soul’, but I'm not the sort to be bothered by such things as long as the gameplay is well designed. In regards to audio, I recall not being induced to fits of unintended laughter or rage by the dialogue or voice acting - which is always a pleasant surprise given examples elsewhere in the industry - and I remember being suitably impressed by the semiotic aptness of the music. Ultimately though, Apotheon lacks any great sense of charm or character outside of its aesthetic elements, and it doesn’t possess the level of game design polish or nuance its art direction seemingly suggests. The game is a triumph of visual style over gameplay substance, albeit in a way that differentiates it from AAA titles that could be described in the same way. Historically, it will likely become noteworthy for its experimentation with a unique visual design at a time when popular games were mostly polarized between pseudo-realistic hi-fidelity graphics and nostalgia-tugging pixel art. In the here-and-now though, if you're looking for something to scratch that 2D action-adventure game itch, I'd suggest you look elsewhere.			"

Posted: August 21, 2016
												I'm giving this game a positive review despite everything here being negative:8 hours in and I'm not sure how much more of the game I have left - and to be honest I just can't bring myself to finish this. After playing for about 20 minutes each session I just have to stop. I feel that the mechanics are not varied enough and I'm suffering from an epic Metroidvania travel fatigue. The levels are very large, and each God has their own area which requires a lot of back tracking. The distance between the objectives are lightly spattered by very similar human enemies with different weapons or animals trying to lunge at you. Once you have an optimal set of items, it's hard to move away from them. There are some standout moments, such as an interesting battle involving alternating between being hunter and prey, but other than that I'm not a fan. Having said that, why I'd recommend this game is that the art style is nice, the mechanics while I personally feel aren't varied enough, are pretty solid. And I think I'm a minority on the reasons why I find the game boring. Get it on a sale, give it a go. It's decent enough. Oh and everyone saying it's 2D God of War.. it's a stretch. Thematically definitely a borrowing heavily from Greek Mythology, but style and execution not quite there.			"

												This is one of these games you do not forget easily.I bought it for the brillant graphics, but discovered that there is so much more.The gameplay is fun, although it takes some time to get used to the fighting controls. Most fights are head-on, though, with only few opportunities for stealth. The boss fights are among the most memorable I have encountered, I especially loved Artemis. So many good ideas with masterful execution. It just does not get old.The storyline is simply immense (saying 'epic' would be redundant, since the story is packed into an ancient epic style), with interesting twists and great storytelling. Also, the music is great.Apotheon is a masterpiece, I loved it and would recommend it to anyone.			"

												This is a beautiful, well crafted and engaging gem of a game.An amazing atmosphere is created by the fantastic art style, excellent voice acting and fabulous soundtrack. The various levels are well designed and the game makes exploration really enjoyable. As you progress, Apotheon continues to offer new challenges and this keeps the game-play fresh and engaging. The combat is satisfying and the puzzles in the game are fun to complete. I love how each area has some unique ideas specific to certain aspects of Greek Mythology. I have really enjoyed exploring in this game and coming across the various gods that I have read about in books. I love how you are able to read occasional excerpts from Homer and others when you come across them as you explore.  Apotheon is an enjoyable side-scrolling action RPG. I feel that its awesome style and its subject matter elevates it into being a truly excellent game. I really enjoyed my time with Apotheon and I definitely recommend it.			"

												Man, this game is just really cool. The art style is very unique, as if the whole game is being read off of Greek walls or pottery. Music is great and ties in nicely with the intense atmosphere of the game. Voice acting is top notch (Ricepirate voices Ares, if you don't know who that is look that beautiful man up.) Combat is smooth, and you really feel the weight behind each hit you deal and take. The story is simple, but believable and awesome. The game itself is free roam once you get to Olympus, with fast travel. There are a few sidequests that will require you to go to areas you've gone through before, but never in a way where you feel like you're backtracking or wasting time. All in all, every moment of this game feels like a lot of time and love was put into it. 19 hours and two playthroughs in and I only have two small qualms. Firstly, the game has randomly crashed on me twice, though a reload fixed it and I could go on playing with no problems. Secondly, a sensitivity option would be helpful. I tried playing with my 360 controller for about an hour, and though the controls were fine targetting in combat was rather difficult because it was hard to make precise hits. The sensitivity is pretty darn high with a controller.For $15, yes. Get this game. It's worth it.			"

												Game Overview•	Unique art style is complimented by lively game world and fulfilling environments.•	Characters and enemies fill every corner, never a boring moment.•	Exploration is rewarded and actually quite enjoyable, that is a definite rarity.•	Challenging experience that provides a sense of satisfaction after completion.•	Combat heavily reliant on skill and strategy.•	Lack of item management leads to clustered inventory.•	Barebones (local) multiplayer mode, might as well not have been included.•	Well worth the time spent playing.•	Tremendous variety of items and weaponry.•	Aiming is restricted.•	Unrefined control of mechanics, but they work well nonetheless.•	Amazingly executed concept that is fun to play, which is the point of video games.These facts are snippets of my video review of the game, if you would like to see a more in depth evaluation, watch it.

			Have you actually ever been interested in Greek Mythology? Well, obviously some of you are but I know I haven't been, and this game didn't sway my interests. I still like it though.

												The first thing to really notice about Apotheon is the art: the aesthetic choices for the game are truly superb.  The whole game looks like it's taking place on the side of an ancient Greek vase, and the lines and composition are frequently beautiful. The soundtrack is quite good, and the voice acting is above par to boot, making for a great experience overall.  The game incorporates snippets of Greek mythology, from the writings of Homer to various Orphic hymns, producing an unusual atmosphere for a video game, let alone one of this category.Mechanically - well, it's a side-scrolling 2-D platformer.  That isn't one of my favorite genres by a long shot (in fact, I usually avoid them).  This category inevitably means a bit of frustration for me with the de rigueur boss fights, the lack of any choice in how the story plays out, and so on.Apotheon got quite a bit better for me, though, once I moved from keyboard-and-mouse to Steam controller to play, with a minor exception (as I'll explain below).  With mouse and keyboard, it's just too hard to be facing the right direction when fighting, but controller play deals with that considerably better.  Except when you need to, say, aim down a long tunnel to hit a target with an arrow.  Then I pretty much had to go back to mouse and keyboard for that specific trick - no amount of fussing with my Steam controller settings could get the aiming to work with any amount of sensitivity, and there is no way to address sensitivity in-game at all.(It's worth noting that I have played other 2-D side-scrollers with mouse and keyboard without this problem and I have played other 2-D side-scrollers with the Steam controller without these problems.  These issues seem to be something very particular about how Apotheon works, and it is the worst aspect of the game.)Many players also complain that the combat is clunky, and I can honestly say that I find it terrible - but that is with the caveat that I frequently find the combat in these sorts of games terrible, so I can't tell if it's genuinely wonky, or I just do not enjoy this sort of thing and since I am only trying to get through the silly boss fights to see where the story actually goes and what the next area looks like.  Just know that in Apotheon, strikes must be aimed and they must be relatively precise; meanwhile enemies will dodge - and will often spring around crazily like mad frogs - which I found to be somewhat disconcerting, and which did not seem to fit well with the game's other artistic choices and tone.  Bottom line though: if you're looking for someone to appreciate unusual or varied combat in game of this genre, it's definitely not me, so take what I say with that grain of salt here.I got best into the game by floundering through the opening level, mashing buttons until I had (slowly) sublimated attacking, dodging and rolling, and switching weapons, and then I started over in order to pay attention to the story and scenes instead of being focused more on ""Oh damn it, I didn't mean to throw that! Bwah! Why am I facing the wrong direction?!?""  That generally provided a better experience for that secondary start and subsequent play.Otherwise, though, the game is an interesting experience, and looking around provided me a ton of entertainment.  I'd definitely buy and play follow-ups to this game in the vein of Egyptian, Japanese, Sumerian, Aztec, and so on just to see the art and experience the mythology, honestly.  It's worth the admission price for that alone.			"

												Apotheon contains the main ingredients needed to produce an astonishing game!It has a great combat system- The combat system might seem simple but it actually has a cheeky trick to it... Heavier weapons (eg: Sagiris) take longer to swing whilst lighter weapons (eg: Dagger) are quick and nimble-The combat allows for free aim no matter what weapon is equipped-Combat is influenced by the ""Stamina bar"" this prevents players from aimlessly swinging at beasts with full force defeating the difficulty of the game.. instead allows for players to strategically parry , block , and attack in a violent dance with the opposing foeApotheon has quite an accurate depiction of Greek/Hellenic Mythology and plays this well into a character driven storylineThere are many upgrades that can be made : such as-Armour upgrades-Weapon purchases-Alchemy (Health Nectarys and Greek Fire bombs etc...)-Weapons TrainingOverall Apotheon is an excellent game with quite an extensive and gripping storyline! Combines upgrades to the Character and a Clever combat system that produces an addicting and fun game... I highly reccomend purchasing this game <3			"

												Apotheon is an unique game for its art style. If you enjoy fighting/platforming games in beautifully crafted worlds go ahead the Greek Mythology awaits! My only complain goes to the physics, in combat, soldiers feel like paper, they feel ""happy wheels""ish. I'm all in for games that innovate, platforming games have been around but not with this kind of visuals.If you wish to see it in action you're more than welcome to check this video:

												Art style is literally ancient, absolutely beautiful and fresh in the industry. This is why i bought this game.Gameplay is your typical platformer with a lot of combat. There are cRPG elements: new weapons and armor, training melee proficiency. Game is short, it took me 20h, with all but one achievement.QA was very good; glitches are rare, have not seen any errors. Only the multiplayer is in beta, with mostly empty lobby.Story is present, but it is not the most important element of the game. It is linear, however, you can choose the order of taking challenges. You can revisit places. There are a lot of static quotes from ancient greek texts. They provide background for what you are fighting with, next.9/10			"

												I wish I liked this game more. I like the art style and the aesthetic. The gameplay, however, is very loose, moreso than I expected. The jumps are floaty and the combat feels haphazard and slapdash instead of the tight 2D combat that I prefer. The analog stick leaves movement less desireable instead of giving me more control.It does not feel good to play this game.			"

												Apotheon is a gorgeous 2D side-scrolling action game where you are a hero battling or gaining favor against the mythological gods and gain their powers. The art style and graphics are outstanding along with the music and sound. The platforming and the combat is a little clunky, however if you can get over that you will have a lot of fun, if not the game can be somewhat frustrating with the slow and clunky fighting. There are plentfiul of weapons to choose from and a wide variety of areas you will explore. If you are a fan of mythology and enjoy 2D side-scrolling games then you will have fun with this one. The game took me about 12 hours to complete everything which for this game feels like the right amount of time.			"

												Gorgeous art style and direction aside, Apotheon is a game that I highly recommend.  The premise is really intriguing, and the manner in which you go about achieving your goals isn't really repetitive, a healthy mix of combat and puzzle solving, while exploring the domains of various Greek gods.  Even the optional powers (Aphrodite, Dionysus, Hermes, and Hephestaus) aren't boring and don't really feel ""tacked on.""  The other various sidequests in which you look for stashes of weapons or other secrets with hints from notes found around the game are really cool as well, allowing you to explore the various areas with an objective, rather than ""just because.""

												REASONS TO BUY+ Art style that perfectly imitates Ancient Greek art.+ The story actually caught my attention because it was quite an interesting twist on Ancient Greek mythology and the finale was fantastic.+ Plays like a bit like castlevania but with a consistent variety of gameplay mechanics.+ Lots of items in the game that all present unique combat interactions.+ Lots of interesting optional side quests and and plenty of secret areas.+ A full run is about 8-10 hours on the starting difficulty; it ends before its stale.+ Items have durability but can be purchased again, Even the rarest items are available for repurchase on a black market NPC in case you're favourite weapons break.+ Relatively easy to earn achievements (you have an opportunity to obtain anything you missed before the game ends) but a second playthrough is required on a harder difficulty for 100% completion.REASONS TO RECONSIDER+ Many of the seemingly minor mechanics seem intended for the harder difficulty that only unlocks after beating the game. For instance, there is a crafting system that is perhaps too generous on your first playthrough+ Some merchants upgrade skills and armour so make sure you break everything to pay for the upgrades+ Certain items cannot be purchased and may block your ability to advance such as Picklocks so it is vital that you break absolutely every box you can+ Combat is only interesting if you switch weapons a lot which is why I believe items have durability in the first place - to encourage variety. If you have a favourite weapon type and try to stick to only using it then you may find the game tedious so try to experiment+ Combat can feel clunky at times but only if you'reon top of each other+ Hold left or right to gradually transition from walking to run but for some reason the character slows his pace if the terrain changes. I found myself jumping to extend the speed I was running before the slower pace began again.CONCLUSION+ It's an experience that I really enjoyed. I adored the art, it was absolutely stunning. It's just a completely well executed and polished game from beginning to end that merits the purchase for anyone even considering it.			"

												Apotheon.I still dont know what to say after playing it for a while.It is a good game but not the best I have ever played. It is certainly enjoyable and easy to play but it can be very confusing at times as well.I bougth the game, when Jerma said that he was voiceacting for it and I just wanted to hear it ingame myself. Now even though that was the main reason, I dont regret buying it at all for other reasons.The Artstyle is beautiful and the voiceacting is on point. Fighting in this game is a little bit tricky but the player has enough chances not to die on various occasions. Like you can get knocked down to 1 health, and if you are quick and roll away you can heal yourself with a potion and head back into the fight.The bossfights range from puzzles to actual fights. The puzzles take some time to understand and the fights themself... Well I found them a bit underwhelming. Even me, being decent enough to have no problems (or not many), managed to get thrown all over the place when fighing Neptune or the Giants. Other enemies didnt make it easier either. In the end it comes down to you being more spamhappy with the weapon than actual skilled combat, but that comes down to the 2D style of combat.So do I recommend this game? Yea. Its enjoyable and you can surely waste a lot of time with it by figuring out its secrets and hidden rooms and of course by playing its main game.			"

												Absolutely blown away by this game. It deserves way more attention than it has. I don't even know where to begin..The art direction, sound design, combat mechanics..everything is just fantastic. I haven't been surprised by an indie game like this in...I don't think..ever! If there's one game that it reminds me of (from a gameplay perspective) it would have to be Medieval for the PS1.The only thing keeping it from being perfect is the sometimes clunky targeting system when faced with several opponents, and sometimes you can get stuck in corners or the game will simply stop, both causing you to have to restart, but each level is so fun to play you probably won't mind having to do it over again.If you are a fan of video games of any kind, at all, even if you only play Goat Simulator, this is still a MUST buy, it's an absolute blast from start to finsh and you will not be disappointed.P.SFor those of you playing with the steam controller, be sure to set your trackpad in the options menu to ""joystick"" or you will have camera and targeting problems.

												Spoiler Free Review: I was super excited for this game when I found it, but after playing and earning all of the achievements, I'm not quite sure what to think of it.  I'm reminded a lot by the PS3 games God of War, which maybe what I'm trying to compare this too, which is not fair.  Apotheon is a stylistic side scroller for one.  The graphics are excellent - nothing realistic mind you, rather what you'd see on ancient vases which provides an excellent ascetic.  The story is nothing special, simular stories have been told in a variety of settings. The controls on this game are what bring me down.  Playing on a keyboard maybe the issue, instead of a controller.  Be prepared for tons of dodging.  I wish after earning of few of the gods powers you could take more of a stance, however that is not the case.  As the game progress you'll find yourself spamming the dodge keys more and more, until frankly it feels like that is all you ever do.  I ended up starting to run past enemies to get to doors or other key points to help speed the game along.There is no multiplayer or DLC available for this game.  I played through the game twice, which the second time was quite a chore, but required to earn an achievement.If you like the genre like I do, then I'd recommend purchasing it.  If however you could care less about ancient culture, then I'd suggest looking for a different game. Rating: 5 out of 10. Barely recommended.Playing on i7-6700, 16Gb Ram, GTX1070			"

												A visually and mechanically interesting action platformer. Combat can be a bit frustrating at times when enemies are either hugging you (causing hit detection to fail) or trying to stay out of your reach, but once you conquer the learning curve the game becomes quite fun. As you progress through the game you'll gain new abilities and weapons and empower your character. The campaign took me about 10 hours to complete on my first try, going for 100% item collection, which is a good size for a game like this.Worth checking out, but as mentioned earlier, the combat mechanics will take a bit to get used to.

												Apotheon is a very enjoyable indie title bringing a welcome innovation to action platformers.Although the concept of its story is not directly ""original”, its great storytelling and simply breath-taking audio-visuals ensure you will be amazed - after all, it is like living a story from an ancient Greek amphora. It might sound strange, but the game piqued my interest mainly because of its graphics and presented mechanics, its story was less important to me at that time.The game brings fluent combat with hints of tactics (brute force is seldom the best option) and it is challenging, yet enjoyable part of the whole. Additionally, you can choose from wide variety of weapons to deal with your enemies. As for exploration – well, I am not sure how the developers achieved it, but I simply loved exploring most of the levels and reading all the texts quoting antique authors. It is not like I learnt anything new, but it further intensified the overall feeling of the game.If you like ancient Greece and/or action platformers, you should definitely give this game a try. It is worth it.			"

												An awesome indie side scroller about an interesting period in ancient history - the bronze age collapse.The graphics are inspired by pottery & other relics found by archaeologists. Lots of greek mythology.I enjoyed it. I saw there is a free to play apotheon multiplayer version which I've yet to try. It seems fun.Try Apotheon , it's a good game.			"

PROS Art Style - The biggest hook of Apotheon (IMO). The ancient greek clay pot style is very well done. I was initially worried if it is one of those styles that looks amazing only in screenshots but it looks great even in motion! Music - Both the combat music and the mellow BGM are fantastic. The soundtrack has everything you would expect from a game like this - cheesy greek chanting goodness and everything. Combat - Takes a bit to get used to but after I got into the groove of things I was switching between melee, ranged, potions and utility items in combat as the need arose. Everything feels very satisfying with the graphics and audio adding to the effect. Gameplay Variety - The meat of the game is the stabbing and running as you would think but there are some levels in the game (Especially the ones where you appease/antagonize the various Gods) that really explore the other aspects of the game that are supported but not the focus like stealth, platforming, and puzzles. I picked up a sarissa (long spear) and realized how amazing I look with it along with a large round shield and greek helmet. Alientrap, you hit the ""feel"" of the game right out of the park!CONS Tutorials - I had to learn about the different swings on a melee weapon in a third party forum after some hours in the game. If I missed an obvious tutorial which taught this I redact this CON, but I wish such a essential mechanic was shown. Armor - I LOVE the look of the armors in the game but after you max out on armor upgrades the satisfaction of finding a piece of armor dropped off. I actually reloaded an earlier save when I realized that the gold I spent on armor upgrades were only unlocking the look of the armor (After maxing out) Mute Protagonist - It didn't affect me much at first but when Nikandreos made big story decisions on his own without any real explanation it really stood out. It only happens in a couple of places but those really felt off. Even if a narrator explained Nikandreos' motivation or reasoning it would have sufficed! IT ENDEDRecommended For: Those who want to play a fun, tight, and exciting action game and who either are mythology enthusiasts or those who love the old ""One mortal man versus the Gods"" trope. Even though it took me ~11 hours to finish the game on the normal difficulty the time really flew because I was having such a blast. A+!			"

												This game has an awesome art style heavily influenced by the artwork of the Ancient Greeks. The gameplay is similar to other MetroidVania titles, so nothing much to complain about there. Also, the announcer of Super Smash Bros, Caitlin Glass, and Jerma provided some of the voice acting. Need I say more?			"

												Super stylish metroidvania with a whole controller full of buttons and moves.  It is as fun as you would expect from this type of game - and as an added bonus it has multiplayer, nice. And I have to say how much I love learning about the Greek gods as I playing through the story. (Stupid Zeus neglecting poor ol' humanity).The first minute or so of the campaign is super laggy, but apart from that it is all good. It reminds me of Mark of the Ninja with how well this metroidvania is excuted, except of course this is greek themed. Buy it now or wait until it is on sale if you are unsure.			"

												Apotheon is a very enjoyable indie title bringing a welcome innovation to action platformers.Although the concept of its story is not directly ""original”, its great storytelling and simply breath-taking audio-visuals ensure you will be amazed - after all, it is like living a story from an ancient Greek amphora. It might sound strange, but the game piqued my interest mainly because of its graphics and presented mechanics, its story was less important to me at that time.The game brings fluent combat with hints of tactics (brute force is seldom the best option) and it is challenging, yet enjoyable part of the whole. Additionally, you can choose from wide variety of weapons to deal with your enemies. As for exploration – well, I am not sure how the developers achieved it, but I simply loved exploring most of the levels and reading all the texts quoting antique authors.

												It's hard not to recommend this game, and i feel it may be semi biased since I really think it did a lot of things right, however i think at the core of the game, I am just bored and have no desire to continue playing.The music and atmosphere are there for sure, the voice acting is even pretty decent. But maybe this is just me, but the visual style was just not my thing. I see what they were going for but it sorta just becomes the mess of black on black, breaking pots and smashing everything just to replace weapons that break in 10 swings. Its not entirely engaging that every soldier looks the same (for the first hour i played) and the flash animation style leaves something to be desired, the characters just feel so lifeless. The physicisy felt so awkward getting randomly thrown. I suppose many may not feel this way, but I was simply not having fun.Also Something about breaking weapons in games has never settled with me. It's an annoying mechanic that once i shuffle through my crappy weapons i finally find one i like and then its gone again.  Strangely I'm ok with the dark souls way of doing it, durability and repairing them, but i feel like i get my fair use of the weapon before its broken.  Even then it is a bit annoying.  But here no, once it's gone, it's gone.Level design is quite... tediuos and unmemorable. Most outside area's don't really have any outstanding features that make them memorable, and i suppose for me thats partly on the visual style. Most indoor atmospheres feel very samey. Plenty of exploration with very little reward in big environment that feel more daunting to explroe than exciting. Lastly the combat simply feels awkward to me. Maybe I am doing something wrong but It doesn't feel like i'm making meaningful combat choices, i'm simply running up and trying to chop at something with an awkard hitbox that can miss even if i'm standing next to them because the tip of my weapon extended slightly beyond the enemy. I realize that 1 hour is probably not the most fair assesment of a game, and you may enjoy it, but for me, im sitting here thinking that i'm genuinely bored with a genre i'm usually enthralled to play , a few design changes could have made this game in my personal experience far more enjoyable.

Introduction:Apotheon is an action adventure platformer based on ancient Greek mythology.  The gods have turned their backs on humanity, and you play as Nikandreos, a mortal warrior who takes up arms against the gods in order to save mankind.  Choose your weapon and get your war-face on, because it's about to get bloody divine up in here!TLDR Highlights:++ Artwork++ Level Design++ Challenging Combat+ Voice Acting+ Music- Combat Controls- Inventory SystemReview:PROS -- For starters, the artwork is amazing and really gives this game that ancient Greek mythological atmosphere!  It seriously amazed me the whole way through the game, because all of the different characters and monsters and maps kept bringing something new to the table.Speaking of which, the level design was incredible.  Each level and location had it's own style and theme, not to mention it's own challenges and puzzles and combat strategies.  Not once did I feel bored or think to myself, ""Oh, this again....""  because Apotheon keeps mixing it up and throwing something new at you every time you turn around.As for combat, I found it to be quite a challenge, especially in the beginning when it took some getting used to.  Enemies are really good at dodging and blocking your attacks and putting themselves in great positions to attack you.  You'll need to master blocking and rolling, but also how to press an attack.  There are so many different weapons and fighting with each one can be a completely different experience.  For example, keep your distance and be sure to hit the enemy with the point end of the spear, not the shaft.  Use maces and clubs to break shields faster.  Hit enemies in the legs to take them to the ground, and use the momentum of a jumping attack to do more damage.  All these things matter!  Simply diving into the fray and mashing buttons won't be very effective.  In fact, it's more than likely going to get you killed!After all of that, it's the voice acting and music that breathes life into Apotheon, making the game that much more immersive and exciting.CONS -- Admittedly, the first hour or so of the game was a bit of a struggle for me, thanks to the controls, which were somewhat difficult to master.  This made combat even more challenging too, at least early on in the game.  There was a point near the beginning when I questioned whether or not this purchase was a good one.  If you ever feel the same way, take a deep breath, and keep trying, because it won't take too long before you're a force to be reckoned with!Sort of related to combat controls is the downside of the inventory system.  As I mentioned earlier, there are a ton of weapons to choose from in the game, which means there's a lot to cycle through when you're changing weapons.  And it's an even bigger pain in the middle of battle.  Honestly, I'm not sure how it could have been done any better, but you do learn to plan ahead (where you can), selecting your main melee weapon, ranged weapon, potion, etc, before charging into battle rather than after it starts.  Still, it's a constant struggle regardless.OVERALL --  There's not much debate to be made here.  I'm extremely pleased with the game and even the early struggle with the controls can't come close to changing that.  If you are thinking about trying the game out, DO IT.  Apotheon is a real gem, and I highly recommend it!			"

												Wow what an awesome game.  I have been meaning to pick up Apotheon for a while now but never have gotten around to it for some reason.  This steam sale I happen to notice it on sale for less than $4 and snagged it finally.  At 74% off it it a total steal.  So far I have less than 2 hours invested but they have been a fun two hours and I have enjoyed every minute.  The artwork is beautiful, the gameplay is very nice (using 360 controller) and heck I even am digging the music which I rarely leave music playing while gaming.  I am a big Greek Mythology fan so I am enjoying the lore in the game.  The game is a very good Metrodvania type platformer and I very much wish I had picked it up earlier.  I highly recommend.  This is going to be one of those few games that I can already tell that I will actually finish instead of collecting dust along with hundreds of other games in my steam library.			"

												I studied Latin and Greek hexameter poetry at university so I normally hate games set in ancient Greek mythology, but I liked this - they clearly give a damn about making it authentic and have bothered to look up some black figure pot art!Their grasp of ancient Greek theology is a bit squiffy in places: a definite tendency to turn the gods that we find sympathetic nowadays into goodies, and the inscrutable, all-powerful type ones into baddies. The controls are really really floaty which put me off playing on hard. Easy was loads of fun though. The level design is absolutely world-class and they always used the engine in creative ways, whether it was racing in a hunt against Artemis in stag form or frantically trying to chuck invading dead people off Charon's barge. The music and voice acting are excellent throughout. Lots of pertinent quotes from Homer scattered about and every NPC is a name-drop... I just wish they could have been a bit more restrained with the overall plot, which is sadly pretty similar to God of War. The fact Zeus doesn't clobber humanity in a fit of divine grumpiness is sort of the point of him.			"

												A clever, well made Metroidvania with a distinct art style, unforgiving combat focused on timing and precision, and a slew of content makes this an easy recommendation to anyone who enjoys the platformer/action game genre. While there's not much in the way of puzzles, the game is good about moving you from content to content, and no area ever feels ""too long"". Hidden areas and out of the way places abound, and you're constantly rewarded for exploring out of the way with a new weapon or piece of armor to use. Combat is fast and hectic, but button mashing can and will get you killed. Careful use of blocking and dodgerolling and counter attacking wins the day. Bosses are a variety of types and encounters. Upgrades are for the most part fairly minor - nothing so game changing as a double jump or a crazy new weapon tech. Most of it tends to be things like faster bow reloading, more effective potions, a small light aura so you don't need torches as much, and the like. The story is about what you would expect from an ancient Greek saga - but it stays true to those roots faithfully and respectfully, and presents time honored stories in a fashion that keeps them feeling mythic and heroic, rather than worn out and over-tread. A full set of well done voice acting for all the dialog helps a great deal as well.This isn't even mentioning the fact that there's multiplayer arena in the mix, which makes the game even better, if you're into that sort of thing. I'm not, personally, but I could see how it'd greatly extend the life of the game.Great game, would definitely recommend.			"

Never before in a side scroller has the art style fit the game so incredibly well. Each time I play it really makes it seems as though the story of Nikandreos is playing out on some sort of Ancient Greek art (pottery perhaps) restored to its full former glory. Occasionally the mouse directional combat can have you a bit confused but overall the game plays well and is an absolute pleasure to gaze upon.			"

												I fell in love with Apotheon at first sight. Of course the first thing I noticed is how gorgeous it looks, I love ancient Greek black and red figure pottery, and this is the perfect style for a 2D game about Greek mythology, which I also adore. Everything from the backgrounds to the characters is lovingly crafted. The switch in colour palettes works very well to give different moods and personality to the different levels. The music is fantastic aswell.The immersion is completed with superb writtng and voice acting. The inscriptions with actual texts from ancient authors from Homer and Hesiod to Apollodorus or Euripides are a beautiful detail that tells you the developers really did their research.Now to the gameplay. The combat is based in timing and momentum, the longer you run, the faster you run and if you hit an enemy with a running uppercut, it's joyous to see him flying away offscreen. I played with kb&m and managed well enough although sometimes I wasn't sure where my mouse was and couldn't turn or aim my blows effectively. The enemies can use the same moves, weapons and tricks you use, they switch between ranged and melee, they sometimes heal themselves, block, dodge and are generally competetnt AI. The weapons are varied and feel different, and you'll have to get used to different weapons because they break, even the special ones (they're not unique, only rare). Not usually a fan of weapon breaking but here it's done well. You always have other weapons you can use, even if they're not your specialty but you're never defenceless, and it won't be long until you can loot new weapons. I don't think I bought a single weapon from a trader in all my time ingame. Every item that's for sale you can find in the world (not so for training and crafting recipes).The levels have their own mechanics and each one feels unique and original. Same goes for the bossfights.As a negative point, the inventory management is not very good. Scrolling to select weapons gets a bit annoying when you have many and are looking for the right one. The shop inventory and the items description boxes can run off of the screen. But that's about it, I don't have any other complain. This is one of my favourite games of 2015, and if it's not THE favourite, it's because of The Witcher 3.			"

												Really great game.The action of the game starts in an ancient Greek town and works its way to Olympus where you go with the intention to save your people. By the end of the game you actually start feeling like a true hero, even if the ending is slightly unexpected.Boss fights are engaging, and there's a few bosses indeed. Not all are about fighting 100%, for some you solve puzzles or take trials which makes the game actually seem engaging. Even for the bosses themselves, each have their own abilities and at times you need to perform several tasks before you can even start the battle.Furthermore, through the plaques sitting around you learn quite a bit about the actual myths and stories of real life ancient Greek gods, which is an awesome bonus.The artwork is amazing, it feels as if you're actually a mural on a greek wall/vase making your way and seeing the story being drawn so to say, and the artwork is really amazing in my opinion.The sound is nice, the music fits the moment and the athmosphere.You have different upgrades for your charater, weapons that do different things, both melee and ranged that you can upgrade by getting new and improved ones.One small problem is the attack direction, with melee weapons your character attacks depending on where your mouse is in 3 directions, direct attack, upwards attack and downwards. That being said it's a bit hard at times to actually get the attack you want. This will be mostly evident at melee bosses and at the last boss. Overall, an amazing game that I'm glad to have bought. Interesting, great story, great gameplay, visuals and music. Truly worth playing.			"

												I studied Latin and Greek hexameter poetry at university so I normally hate games set in ancient Greek mythology, but I liked this - they clearly give a damn about making it authentic and have bothered to look up some black figure pot art!Their grasp of ancient Greek theology is a bit squiffy in places: a definite tendency to turn the gods that we find sympathetic nowadays into goodies, and the inscrutable, all-powerful type ones into baddies. The controls are really really floaty which put me off playing on hard. Easy was loads of fun though. The level design is absolutely world-class and they always used the engine in creative ways, whether it was racing in a hunt against Artemis in stag form or frantically trying to chuck invading dead people off Charon's barge. The music and voice acting are excellent throughout. Lots of pertinent quotes from Homer scattered about and every NPC is a name-drop... I just wish they could have been a bit more restrained with the overall plot, which is sadly pretty similar to God of War. The fact Zeus doesn't clobber humanity in a fit of divine grumpiness is sort of the point of him.			"

												Wow what an awesome game.  I have been meaning to pick up Apotheon for a while now but never have gotten around to it for some reason.  This steam sale I happen to notice it on sale for less than $4 and snagged it finally.  At 74% off it it a total steal.  So far I have less than 2 hours invested but they have been a fun two hours and I have enjoyed every minute.  The artwork is beautiful, the gameplay is very nice (using 360 controller) and heck I even am digging the music which I rarely leave music playing while gaming.  I am a big Greek Mythology fan so I am enjoying the lore in the game.  The game is a very good Metrodvania type platformer and I very much wish I had picked it up earlier.  I highly recommend.  This is going to be one of those few games that I can already tell that I will actually finish instead of collecting dust along with hundreds of other games in my steam library.			"

												Finished this game off-steam. Loved it so much that I picked it from the winter sale for barely 4 bucks. Would have payed full price if I was not poor :'( If you love greek mythology and want to play an action-packed side-scrolling adventure rendered beautifully on greek pottery, this game is for you.Pros -  Amazing artwork, decent story, lots of upgradable armor sets, period-accurate weaponry, AMAZING soundtrack, LOTS of weapons, fluid combat and pacing of story. PS - The FREE multiplayer is pretty great.Cons - The FREE multiplayer needs some more polish and game modes, sudden framerate drops and ocassional stutters.10/10 would recommend			"

												This a VERY fun, very good looking game that I recommend heartily.It looks fantastic, it plays well, it has a decent variety of fairly smart enemies, and a good selection of interesting toys and playstyles to mess with.There's a surprisingly intricate... well, if not a physics system as such, at least a degree of interactivity.Cons or suggestions for improvement:The game could handle alt-tabbing better, as the moment the game sound keeps going in the background, and your map is likely to be ♥♥♥♥ed up when you come back.Some of the items are way too rare (having a chance to play with the skeleton warriors outside the designated levels would be a treat) or far too useless (the hawks are both nearly impossible to get outside of a particular store, and absolutely worthless in combat)The online multiplayer basically has no players, which is a shame, as matches are fairly fun. Once again, despite the minor quibbles above, I entirely recommend this.			"

												If you want to play something stylish and simple - this game is for you!It has great visuals, pleasing gameplay without any hard parts and awesome soundtrack. The plot based on Greek mythology is kinda usual for such type of stories. But overall game makes you want to read about all this things again.. And that's another plus :)I highly recommend you to buy this! But if you are not sure, you can try the multiplayer part absolutely for FREE, just search Steam for Apotheon Arena. It's pure deathmatch without any story, but can give you an understanding about game's battle system.			"

												Just finished the campaign, on champion difficulty.What a special game.One of the greatest metroidvanias I've ever played.Among the many Apotheon qualities I think combat is the highlight.2D games use to be frantic rapid-fire / button mashers, but not here.Apotheon's stamina-based, weapon-shield, defense-counter-attack mechanics are very well done and require some strategy. Sorry by the cliche, but at the time it's the closer to a ""2D Dark Souls"" we can get.About the art style and soundtrack... well, see for yourselves.Alientrap, I praise and thank you for the amazing work.

												TL;DR - Great weapon variety, level design variety, and beautiful art. A bit clunky combat where you never feel totally in control, and occasional glitchiness.The game's got beautiful art and an impressive array of level design, with combat-heavy areas, puzzle-solving areas, exploration-based areas, some minor side quests, it's great. The story is pretty hands-off, but it works. Feels more like you are exploring and choosing where you want to go next, it's nice. There are tons of different weapons to use. I sort of wish the weapon drops were less plentiful, as I felt like I never had a shortage of weapons. In games where there is weapon degradation/breakage, you want to save the best weapons for after the crappy ones have broken, or for important parts. The crappy ones just keep coming though, so you never switch to the good ones when they run out, cause they don't. Bit of OCD annoyance there.The one notable negative to the game is that the combat feels awkward. I think they designed it to seem realistic? There's no true combo system, making it an exchanging-blows affair in the end. However, you can zip around super fast, switch weapons super fast, but regardless of those unrealistic factors, the weapons never feel like you can wield them effectively in comparison. Slow clunky stabs/slashes, and the idea that you have to be a certain distance from an enemy (ie, if you're too close, it won't hit) with weapons like a spear ends up making combat awkward, especially against multiple opponents on the higher difficulty modes where you flinch when being hit. You get used to it after a while, but it's sort of aggravating. Moreover, there's a dodge roll, but no invulnerability frames on it. What's the point?It's kind of glitchy sometimes. Enemies that throw you wind up the throw with you in hand, and if you're near a wall when grabbed you'll for a moment phase through the wall. This instant-kills you. Extremely annoying, happened to me 3-4 times in the playthrough. There should never be instant death on going out of bounds. That's lazy.Aside from those two issues, the game itself is fun to explore and experience. Collecting and trying out different weapons feels good, the soundtrack is suitable, with a couple of somewhat memorable fanfares amidst a mostly atmospheric set of audio tracks. The level design variation is probably the best aspect, regardless of which God's area you enter, there's always a different setting and gameplay style to experience. Great stuff. In the end, if you can get over the combat, which does get a bit more enjoyable at the end due to upgrades, it's totally recommendable.			"

												Artisticaly and technically speaking, this is one of the best games I have ever played. That's one hell of a phrase to throw around, but this game really earns it. This game went out to create the experience of being the hero greek myth and everything in the game goes to painstaking lengths to make sure you feel that way. The art is designed to look like it was painted on the side of a greek pot, where myths are so often seen painted, and everything seems to move that way as well. The voice acting is as good as one can ask for in an indie game and the music is brilliant. Youcan hear in the audio the epic and godly feel everythig is supposed to have. The combat feels very good and the need for skill is evident. Pulling off successful rolls into backstabs or taking down an dog as it jumps at you by throwing a well timed javelin is really rewarding.But the best part of the game is by far the level design. A lot of research and love and a truckload of creativity went into the level design. It is perfect in that every area works by precisely the same rules but still feels entirely unique.  Your job is to gain the power of that god by fulfilling some task in their place on olympus and confronting them. Each area is desgned to reflect the god who lives there. For instance, Artemis lives in  a grove where hunters slay game all day and in order to be allowed an audience with her you must become the greatest hunter by slaying dangerous beasts.  Ares, aways the bloodthirsty, lives in  a giant kill dungeon where people slaughter eachother in an endless rage and you must slaughter Ares' enemies to see him.  And Hades is built so be a sad, unsettling place where those you kill come back to life so as a result,  the undead horrors you find there respawn soon after re-dying,  this gives the player the feeling that they don't want to be there long and forces them to run through the land of the dead for fear of joining them.There are 7 different houses each with their own distinct feel which is what makes this game truly amazing and truly worth buying. The game was certainly not perfect and had quite a few flaws in terms of the execution of some of the fine points but artistically and design-wise, it is a masterpiece.			"

Posted: July 13, 2015
												I never write reviews, but this game was so good that I had to. Here are the most important points:1) Graphics/art - I've never seen anything like it, unless you want to count the ancient Greek art it's based on. Seriously, just watch the preview video - its beautiful. Very crisp, with interesting uses of color and good detail. The creators even include readable stone etchings in the game that have real passages from ancient Greek literature, further adding to the atmosphere. The best way to say it, I think, is that the game has a feel of authenticity about it. You can really tell that the creators did their homework, and I think they did a fantastic job of giving the Greek mythos life. 2) Music - Also fitting in with the setting, you will feel like Odysseus while you're listening to this soundtrack. War drums, chanting, full orchestrated scores - it's got it all. The tracks for the boss battles have a very epic feel to them; they really lend to the idea that you're fighting Gods.3) Gameplay -  Probably the other ""best"" from this game besides the art/music. I've never seen another game in this genre implement such a wide variety of weapons so well. You will have at your disposal quite a few ancient Greek weapons, including spears, swords, clubs, bow & arrows, javelins, greek fire, and a lot more. You can wield most weapons with a shield as well as throw them, and you can evasively roll back and forth to try and manuever into a better position or get behind your enemies. When you combine all of these elements, combat is very engaging and fun. Usually in games of this type, I find myself using one or two weapons that are clearly superior to the others, but that isn't the case here. I can honestly say that I used every weapon class in the game effectively, and I think that using all of the different weapons is part of what makes this games so fun. I can only speculate that the creators realized this early on, which is why the weapons have durability that runs out decently fast - it forces you to experiment. The other aspect to the gameplay I wanted to mention is the scenario variety. Each boss battle, especially, and to a lesser degree, each quest, presents different sorts of challenges to the player. There is almost always more to it than ""hit this enemy until he dies"" or ""go to this location and pick up this item."" The level designs themselves are very unique, so often just getting through the level can be the most interesting part. 4) Collectibles/side quests - Some games suffer from having nothing else to do outside of the main questline, while others suffer from overloading the game with collectibles and time-consuming sidequests. In my opinion, this games walks the line well. There are 2 achievements for collecting - 1 for getting all of the unique weapons in the game, and one for opening all of the chests(lockboxes) in the game. The weapons, however, are often found in the chests, so really you can focus on just finding the chests, which are not terribly difficult to find if you are constantly looking out for breakable walls and making sure to explore every area thoroughly.  The sidequests available range from simple tasks to fairly complex series of events that require trips to multiple areas. I didn't find any of the sidequests to be frustrating, which is a mistake a lot of games make. 5) Minor points:- Each piece of armor you get permanently increases your total armor points, which basically acts as a second pool of hitpoints. However, you keep all of your old armor pieces, and since the increase is permanent, you can freely switch between armor pieces with no penalty. I found this to be very progressive and pleasing.- There is a multiplayer mode, though I cannot comment as I haven't tried it- A 3rd difficulty unlocks after you beat the game, Olympian Difficulty. Beating the game on this difficulty earns you the last achievement. 6) Negatives: not many for this game.- I did have one save become irrevocably corrupted at one point, and it crashed the game whenever I tried to load it. Luckily, the autosave saved the day for me. Hopefully this isn't a widespread issue.- The character movement can be a little clunky & hard to get used to, and I hate that the character stops running whenever I hit stairs. I highly recommend playing with a gamepad, though this may vary if you're used to using a mouse/keyboard all the time.			"

												Apotheon is a 2d sidescrolling platformer taking place in Greek mythology. You play the role of Nikandros, a human whose civilization was forsaken by the gods. Seeing your city in ruins, you make an alliance with an opportunistic Hera, who guides you through your quest of assassination and dethroning. The graphics for this game are themed entirely around ancient Greek paintings such as those found on pottery or tapestries and it has a really neat look as a result. The soundtrack is also set along the same theme and various obelisks detailing actual Greek scripture can be found in each level. The weaponry mirrors that which one would find in ancient Greece and just about any other obvious reference you could make is accounted for.If I had to pick one beef in this game, it would have to be the controls. The control scheme in this game is very similar to terraria in that you have to both face your character towards enemies or items as well as “aim” him. Combat can be kind of tricky at first and combined with knockback effects, downright awkward. I found myself struggling just to land hits against an AI that instantaneously switches to the exact counter to my current weapon. Thankfully the game has potions and other items which can be used to easily resolve combat, although with the added detriment of a cheapened accomplishment when one uses a potion of invulnerability to cheese a boss battle. Additionally the quests can be both tiresome and predictable (come to an area, 3 sub-quests, rinse and repeat).In the end I didn’t think that Apotheon was a great game, but it wasn’t a terrible game either. If you can grab it for under $10 you’ll probably get your money’s worth on this one. "

												Dark themed Grecian Metroidvania.If the above sentence piques your interest then look no further than Apotheon!Set in the wildly creative ancient Grecian times where Zues and his fellow gods and goddesses rule over the kingdom of man. You play as Nikandreos, a simple peasant armed with the responsibility to protect his beloved home town of Dion. Hera is there to meet you at the city's temple and tells you to vanquish the gods of Olympus. Thus begins an epic quest of godlike conquest. Mount Olympus can be seen as the world hub where you can explore different parts of the city, visit markets, break in to houses and even uncover a long buried secret or two.The primary structure of the game is to enter a God's domain through one of the game's two main hubs. Inside each domain is a vastly unique set piece where you must display skills related to the god at hand. For example, in the Forest of Artemis you will be tasked to hunt legendary beasts and possible become a beast yourself in your ultimate quest to take on Artemis herself! Likewise, in Poseidon's realm, you will have to brave the seas that the old god controls himself to calm the spiteful deity's wrong doings. Each area really does have a life of it's own even if it uses the same art style throughout. Another piece of conversation of its own is the art design.I have never seen anything like this game's visual design. It's a 2D-open world-sidescroller at heart but the way it is presented just bursts with originality. It is hard to explain but just looking at the screen shots gives you an idea of paintings come to life. The breathing vivid colors of these pieces come to life give a sense of wonderment and otherworldly experiences like no other metroidvania. The different domains of gods use this visual style by shifting color palettes perfectly to suit the environment you are in. From the warm orange glows of the central hub Agora to the soft off-white blues of Poseidon's sea palace to the muted dismal tones of Hades, the worlds are brought to individual life from this masterful design. The gameplay is engaging and does not get old even to the very end of Nikandreos's arduous quest to become one with the gods.The central gameplay element is exploring the realms of the gods and combat. Combat is simple yet intuitive as the popular deterrent to the norm of button mash is once again ill advised. Nikandreos attacks in concentrated swings, swings that drain a stamina bar which will cause him to take large amounts of breath in order to wind up another attack if he is not given some time to rest. Enemies do the same, where the have timed attacks and can shield/roll/fly/backpedal/ and charge at their opponent with little hesitation. While the combat is rather easy, I found the reactive style to be quite satisfying all the way through. Spear pieces flesh, sword slashes at sinews, and clubs bludgeon skulls. The instant ragdoll and sound of your foes dropping their weapons as their last breath leaves there sorry bodies is something to take in again and again.The other side of the game resides in the player following certain laid out quests in order to gain audience with the god of that domain. You will encounter secrets, puzzles, and platforming challenges as the game plays out. Each challenge is presented in some unique way that never makes you tire of the formulae at hand.There is a multiplayer that is both local and online, and while this is always welcomed I can see this being only a quick side interest to the major deal that is the single player campaign. There are also two difficulties with the last being unlocked after completing the game. I am curious to see how the increase challenge plays out and could easily provide more replay value for the hardcore Apotheoner.I can easily recommend Apotheon at it's full asking price of $15.00 USD. If you love metroidvania games then you will NOT be disappointed with Apotheon offering to the table!			"

I wasn't in contol even at the end of the game and I am not saying that as a rookie gamer (I played with keyboard mouse combo. I don't know how it is with a conroller)- Inventory system... There are many items (melee weapons, ranged weapons, consumables, throwables) and no way to get rid of the unwanted ones. After a while it becomes too cluttered.

												As student of the Classiscs I found this game to be wonderful. The first thing that pops out to a player is of course the artstyle. The artstyle is inspired from blackfigure painting during the Classical Greece in 7th-4th centuries BCE. The use of this style creates a visually distinct game that is pleasing to behold.In regards to story, it is somewhat comparable to God of War where you are ultimately fighting against the Gods. The major difference though is the respect that is taken to the actual mythos surrounding the divinities. The modernized view of many of the divinities is taken away. Hades is not Satan, Apollo isn't Mr. Perfect. Additionally there are many homages to classical myth scattered throughout the game that should put a smile on any fan of Greek Mythology. Gameplay is fairly solid. Combat is focused around on both aiming and timing attacks intandem with blocking and dodging oncoming attacks. There is a large variety of weapons both ranged and melee to be found in the game along with special weapons with unique properties. The weapons have durability which is a nice touch, altough I found that weapons break too quickly sometimes. I found a sword that I could not purchase in the market, so once it breaks I will be lucky to find another one. There is a hubworld system in the game that encourages exploration. You will end up saving a lot of money by doing this on armor and weapon purchases. Finally there is a crafting system that allows you create potions and tools to help you on your quest. Controls works but take some getting used to, I would prefer to have more hotkey options for the PC version.As other reviewers have noted, this game is easily a hidden gem. It's a shame that this game didn't get more attention on release. This game is a must have for fans of the Classics and a high recommendation for people looking for a new Metroidvania experience. 10/10			"

												Apotheon is a game based on Greek Mythology, with its art style derrived from Ancient Greek Vase art. The story revolves around Nikandreos, who wakes up in the ruins of his home vilage. The gods have abandoned the humans, and are activley acting to destroy them. You must ascend Mount Olympus and strip the gods of their power to save your people. Some will capitulate, others will have you take it by force. The game is a side scroller, with a decent assortmant of weapons and armor. Basicially, its a great game with a unique art style, great combat and overall appealing story. 9/10.(btw Apollo is a♥♥♥♥♥♥lol)			"

												CONVENTION: The masculine reproductive organ will be called 'pn' for now on.This game is completly awesome! 9/10. Very nice characterization of the gods, they truly feel like the ancient greek gods, with all the characteristics, in the way they behave and interact, the way their temples look. ETC... VERY well placed and intresting dialog, you will never, ""jesus i know already that, just skip it"", exepitional writing, O.K voice over, the main characters are kinda good voice over but the normal peasants/NPC have 3 sentences max. Awesome graphics and aesthetics. And the thing that impressed me the most is the maturity they addressed sexuality, the greek society was one of the first to have the vision 'men should be fit viril and smart', not brutes, the 'mind and body to the perfect' kinda of thing. And, a lot of their art, (one of the most well known greek caracterictics) relflect that vision, i bet you already seen a photo (or the actual one in a museum) of a greek statue, 6-pack, big abs, pn out, ""no fu*ks given"" expression. (if you didn't, this[www.goddessgift.net] is what I mean), their reflection of the greek society is just, simulator grade, they aren't afraid of showing boobs and pn where is needed, and they aren't childish about it.  Level desing is very good. Look awesome, (like I said you always have immersion you are in a greek world) and are also awesome to navigate through. And the gamplay is fabulous, challeging, fair and  scalable to be very hard. it's physhics/hack'n'slash/timing based. People seemed to like the music a lot. Personally I not even noticed.			"

												Apotheon is a great side scroller combat game. If you are a fan of Greek mythology you will likely find yourself quite interested in the story this game has to tell. Never before in a side scroller has the art style fit the game so incredibly well. Each time I play it really makes it seems as though the story of Nikandreos is playing out on some sort of Ancient Greek art (pottery perhaps) restored to its full former glory. Occasionally the mouse directional combat can have you a bit confused but overall the game plays well and is an absolute pleasure to gaze upon.			"

												A clever, well made Metroidvania with a distinct art style, unforgiving combat focused on timing and precision, and a slew of content makes this an easy recommendation to anyone who enjoys the platformer/action game genre. While there's not much in the way of puzzles, the game is good about moving you from content to content, and no area ever feels ""too long"". Hidden areas and out of the way places abound, and you're constantly rewarded for exploring out of the way with a new weapon or piece of armor to use. Combat is fast and hectic, but button mashing can and will get you killed. Careful use of blocking and dodgerolling and counter attacking wins the day. Bosses are a variety of types and encounters. Upgrades are for the most part fairly minor - nothing so game changing as a double jump or a crazy new weapon tech. Most of it tends to be things like faster bow reloading, more effective potions, a small light aura so you don't need torches as much, and the like. The story is about what you would expect from an ancient Greek saga - but it stays true to those roots faithfully and respectfully, and presents time honored stories in a fashion that keeps them feeling mythic and heroic, rather than worn out and over-tread. A full set of well done voice acting for all the dialog helps a great deal as well.This isn't even mentioning the fact that there's multiplayer arena in the mix, which makes the game even better, if you're into that sort of thing. I'm not, personally, but I could see how it'd greatly extend the life of the game.Great game, would definitely recommend.			"

												I fell in love with Apotheon at first sight. Of course the first thing I noticed is how gorgeous it looks, I love ancient Greek black and red figure pottery, and this is the perfect style for a 2D game about Greek mythology, which I also adore. Everything from the backgrounds to the characters is lovingly crafted. The switch in colour palettes works very well to give different moods and personality to the different levels. The music is fantastic aswell.The immersion is completed with superb writtng and voice acting. The inscriptions with actual texts from ancient authors from Homer and Hesiod to Apollodorus or Euripides are a beautiful detail that tells you the developers really did their research.Now to the gameplay. The combat is based in timing and momentum, the longer you run, the faster you run and if you hit an enemy with a running uppercut, it's joyous to see him flying away offscreen. I played with kb&m and managed well enough although sometimes I wasn't sure where my mouse was and couldn't turn or aim my blows effectively. The enemies can use the same moves, weapons and tricks you use, they switch between ranged and melee, they sometimes heal themselves, block, dodge and are generally competetnt AI. The weapons are varied and feel different, and you'll have to get used to different weapons because they break, even the special ones (they're not unique, only rare). Not usually a fan of weapon breaking but here it's done well. You always have other weapons you can use, even if they're not your specialty but you're never defenceless, and it won't be long until you can loot new weapons. I don't think I bought a single weapon from a trader in all my time ingame. Every item that's for sale you can find in the world (not so for training and crafting recipes).The levels have their own mechanics and each one feels unique and original. Same goes for the bossfights.As a negative point, the inventory management is not very good. Scrolling to select weapons gets a bit annoying when you have many and are looking for the right one. The shop inventory and the items description boxes can run off of the screen. But that's about it, I don't have any other complain. This is one of my favourite games of 2015, and if it's not THE favourite, it's because of The Witcher 3.			"

												Apotheon is one hell of a Metroidvania game. Really great execution, for the most part!Look at the game. I don't think I need to say much else. Sure, the game itself is awesome, but the visuals are a big part of what makes it stand out.The biggest strength in the combat is how the game is physics driven, but not like most of the lazy games that use a default physics engine with no consideration for gameplay. No no no, Apotheon uses physics almost perfectly, making the combat feel very impactful, and the general game is very satisfying to play. Platforming is cool, but above that is how you can break virtually everything, and the corpse ragdoll effects are really fun to play with!Beautiful lighting system! Simple, but it's still very nicely done. And it's used as a gameplay tool as well, so it's not just something to look pretty.Regarding the visuals, I think they went a bit overboard with the visual effects. Most of them were unnecessary and actually taken away from the whole ""ancient pottery"" aesthetic it has going for it. Looks a bit too polished and sparkly for pottery. But hey, it's still really unique!I was a bit disappointed with the story... It was very linear, and... ""original"". In this case, however, original isn't good.Drawing for mythology, there are tons of stories worth telling. What they've done, is simply to draw from the pantheon and some of the Gods' relationships, and made a betrayal/revenge story of their own, about a human who kills Gods... meh. Honestly, I expected things to be a bit different. Oh well.The combat can be a bit clunky, at times, because physics. Still feels very nice to send corpses flying around and throwing javellins at innocent Gods.Definitely give this one a go! Could have been better, story-wise, but the game itself is brilliant. Lots of different approaches and little mechanics that are barely used, but that you're free to explore. Awesome game!			"

												The first thing probably everyone will notice is how amazing this game looks. It's certainly a main reason why I've bought it. And what makes it even better is an amazing soundtrack which breathes with mythology and epicness. The one thing that could and should be better visually vise is terrain. At least some parts, like the thin ones designed for vertical traversal. Those are just thin black lines and it looks really weird.But what about the game mechanics? Well, they are ok.It's a 2D game and the maps are usually both very horizontal and vertical. The traversing through the map isn't always without problems. Sometimes when you for example jump on a ladder the game won't notice that it's a ladder and you won't be able to climb it. There are these slim terrain parts which are there for you to change your vertical position (I obviously don't know how to explain it), by jumping while holding the Down key. Which isn't really that responsive, especially in combat.The combat it self is just a click fest, even though you have a stamina which will deplete quickly. I think that they imagined the combat to by more tactical but I don't think that they've managed to do it. Main reason is the problem of the enemy AI with navigation on the map. If there is a vertical traversal or a jump sequence then they'll run around like crazy (especially the animals). You can block, use different types of attack based on the mouse movement and roll around. It certainly can look good if there isn't too much of a chaos. But more often than not I had to just click attack button like a mad man.The item progression is a particularly good one. There is a ton of different types of melee and ranged weapons, shields, armor parts, and special items like bombs, creature summons, healing and invisibility potions, the list goes on. There are a lot of special, mythical, weapons.The way the armor works is kinda weird. You have few armor parts which increase your maximum armor. When enemies are hitting you, the armor goes down and after it reaches zero they'll start to attack your hit points. Then you can either fix your armor with Repair kit or destroy items (boxes, vases, whatever) and find armor points like this. There are limits for how many of each items you can carry which honestly I don't understand. The main problem with items and combat is that the weapons can break down. And they'll break down really fast. It's not unusual that while you are fighting with few enemies three of your weapons will break down (because all of them were used previously) and you'll just see how every few seconds you have different kind of weapon in your hand. One moment you have short knife so you are right next to the enemy and suddenly you have 5 kilometers long spear in your hand and you can't hit him. I really don't understand reasons for this. And I don't think it fits with the mythology theme. There is a book written about you, great hero fighting gods and every third sentence is about how you have to switch weapon because another one had broken down?I don't know if I'll ever finish this game (I have played it for 7-8 hours so far, don't look at the hours steam is showing, I was waiting for trading cards:D) because Dragon's Dogma just came out and I don't find the story of Apotheon interesting. There isn't much of a story telling. You'll get few objectives and you can read few lines here and there about the gods. In the few lines of monologues, you can see their different personalities, and that's great. And I have to add that some of those objectives are really creative or at least interesting. So you are just playing around with these average mechanics while looking at a beautiful piece of art.It's an interesting, beautiful looking game. I would like to see more, but with fleshed out mechanics. The UX could be better, the fighting system should be better, the map traversing should be better, the story telling should be better. Then it could really be an amazing experience. Now, if it would be without its visuals it would be an average game, with those visuals it can't be average but it isn't that much fun to play for a longer time.Buy it on sale.			"

You could screenshot any given moment of this game, and it'd look great. But the fighting feels shallow. You stab and block blindly against foes that feel incorporeal. You can switch to other weapons, theoretically, but it's so cumbersome that I'd prefer not to.  And your weapons wear out, which everyone loves in their metroidvania games, right? And of course there's no controller support. Why would there be?A for the art, C- for everything else.			"

												REVIEW 2. (playtime 4h)I had only played the intro. After that the difficulty goes up, and you get to choose between Warrior and Champion (if you want to go even more difficult). The game explains very little about what the goal of some boss/mini-boss battles is exactly, but it's easy to find out and you always just restart before the battle/mini-game without penalty. (so losing a few times isn't that frustrating, wasting arrows can be frustrating though)I'm still in the ""OMG, the pottery graphics are beautiful""-phase, and it is a very enjoyable phase. The story is not very interesting, but it doesn't have to be (at least for a philhellenic like me!), the environment and the quotations as well as the broad range of challenges keep the game interesting.Negative points:This game definitely suffers from AITKS (Arrow-In-The-Knee Syndrome) some of the NPC lines get really annoying when hearing them for the umptieth time. It's mainly the Agora market voices (since that is where I have to return to all the time)REVIEW 1. (playtime: 0.5h)Only just got this game.It's absolutely beautiful.The beginning was really easy (too easy), maybe I just need to find the difficulty slider (haven't searched yet).			"

												This has been amazing. From the very beginning it feels a bit like a giant hand reaches up from history to drag one down through space and time and out of dimension. The art work is so well researched and reapplied it really gives you a feel for the mindset of the ancient greeks. The story unfolds like an classical epic, telling the story of a man defying the gods, but it has some elements of surprise. Also the soundtack and voice acting is excellent.The gameplay isn't too easy and there are two difficulties and one to unlock at the end. I recommend using controller, because with keyboard it is very hard not to become frustrated. There are some features that work much better with controller. There have been a few bugs, that appeared and vanished with every restart, but the game is totally worth the trouble if you enjoy something new and different from all the other games. I will certainly play it again just to study all the details.			"

Posted: June 25, 2015
												Apotheon is a platformer with an ancient Greek theme.  It is a very unique-looking game with an art style matching ancient Greek pottery.  You play a regular person, tasked with defeating the gods (led by Zeus of course) who have chosen to destroy humanity.  It's one of those games that shows how well thorough theming can work.  Everything about it is ancient Greek and well-researched to provide the best experience possible.While the game may be a platformer, it deviates quite a lot from the norm.  You have a wide range of ancient Greek weaponry to choose from with various melee and thrown weapons as well as quite a few types of arrows and sling ammunition.  Weapons are realistically modeled so you must actually hit enemies with the blade in order to damage them and both you an enemies can use shields to block attacks.  While it may feel clumsy at first with long attack windups, you quickly get used to it.  The one major problem with the combat is that attacks are performed either overhead, underhand, or stabbing, but the game selects one at random when you attack.  This can cause a lot of incorrect attacks that miss your target and lead to some frustration.The other major annoyance in the game is the movement.  While for the most part the platforming works fine, and the game even provides a ledge-climbing mechanic for when the jump is slightly too high, maintaining speed while running across a map is nearly impossible.  You speed up as you run but any time the slope of the ground changes, such as when you start climbing stairs, you lose all momentum.  In some places you can actually skip the stairs by jumping and land on another piece of ground of the same slope as you jumped from to maintain speed but very few locations offer that opportunity.  The game would have been better served by leaving out this feature altogether.The game is structured in a non-linear way with several hub areas branching into areas with multiple objectives you have to complete before continuing.  It gives the game more freedom to allows for mini quests that take place across several areas.  It also allows easy access to go back to previous areas to find secrets you missed and complete achievements.  Each area is themed for a specific ancient Greek god while the hub areas act as towns, complete with town guards who will attack you if you break the law.I was greatly surprised when I discovered that this game which I thoroughly enjoyed was made by the same developers as Capsized, a game which I found frustrating and poorly designed.  I hope they continue to make games of this quality in the future.			"

												Swords and Sandals clash with Metroidvania style gameplay! From the moment I started playing the game I was into it.Greek mythology is ripe for good storytelling. With its unique artstyle, crafting and intense combat. Apotheon is a game that deserves far more attention then it is getting. Now that isn't to say there isn't kinks in the armor of Apotheon. The game didn't detect my Logitech controller. Also the game has some minor annoying bugs to squash. However these bugs are miniscule in comparison to the game. Like Zeus on top of his mountain. I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												What i liked:The story (a little bit nichilistic but not bad, God of War like).The art (exept the fact you always have the shield in the hand facing you, they could have keept the left hand for it)The gameplay is not bad but i don't like the fact you can breathe underwater and the weapon damage system. Nor i liked that my character  could carry so many weapons, i prefer the multiplayer system in wich you can have a weapon at time. Some weapons coud be more fast and when running you should not slow down so much at stairs.The combat could be better and more accurate, maybe allowing to chose between point or slash or allowing to charge the hit (Mount and Blade like, but 2D)What i didn't liked: Crashed sometimes (but savegames were ok). There is only campaign and multiplayer, something more would have been better. There is almost no reward for exploring, or doing sidequests, or killing a strong enemy. What this game needs: mod support and a War of Troy mod. I would have preferred some moral system and some choices in this game. I mean, you can be chaotic or almost good (until you start killing the gods), it would be nice to see some different outcome, according to your behavior.I hope the 2 will be much better, since for now i liked the game for what it can be.

												This recommendation comes with some caution. Apotheon is a beautiful game and its soundtrack and environments are magical and immersive. The game is SUPER aesthetically pleasing, from its use of Attic Black-Figure pottery style, to the faux-ceramic texture of the screen (scratches and ribbing, which is the result of throwing pottery on a wheel, included!), to the beautiful use of color, light, and shadows. However, the game mechanics suck. A lot. It can get frustrating and downright annoying.If you're looking for a new, relatively cheap but visually stunning game, I would recommend Apotheon. Also, if you have a background in Classical history or archaeology (like me), this game becomes even more delightful, as there are excerpts from Hesiod and Homer, and all of the gods were clearly designed with their ancient depictions in mind. Just keep in mind the terrible mechanics.			"

												Apotheon is a reasonably good ""Metroidvania""-style game. The main pulling factor for this game is definately the Artstyle. So the flowchart for this game is pretty simple: Do you like the Artstyle? Yes: buy / No: don't buyOverall the gameplay is mostly fluid and satisfying. The Stages are varied and follow appropriate themes. The game manages to set the mood just right, eventho the appalingly British voiceactors do their best to brake this immersion. Controles can be a bit wonky at times, but on gamepad it's generally managable. It is somewhat prone to glitch at times, this goes from +5 HP apples ragdolling into a pillar and being unreachable to important quest items getting lost in a similar way(or down mount olympus). The story is ok, good enough to be a game, or greek myth. One thing that I personally liked a lot is that some typical tropes were avoided, like Hades being all evil. Also having Hera as Patron was both a reasonable and refreshing choice. I did notice they forgot to include poor Hestia. Which is a pitty as she is always left out because everyone thinks ""the twelve Olympians"" includes Hades, who lives in... Hades. Finished on easy with all sidequests, lacking some ""secret chests"" in about 15 hours.			"

												I bought this game completely on a whim and can't sing its praises highly enough. The artwork is fantastic with its warm glow and nod to the ancient Greek style and that sets you up nicely for what is an engaging journey up Mount Olympus. I'm still in the early stages of the game (running a Let's Play, link below for those interested) but have to say I'm impressed by the depth I've seen so far for a 2D side-scroller. Many people have said this before but it does have similarities to God of War but I do think there's more depth to it. There's even an educational element to the game for those with absolutely no clue about Greek mythology (like me!). For the relatively modest price the game is set at, this is a worthy purchase, particularly, if like me, you're looking for something a bit different. Enjoy! Apotheon Playthrough!  "

												An almost Souls-like experience, Apotheon follows Nikandreos, lead by Hera as he slaughters everyone on Olympus one by one, and sometimes house by house, eventually usurping Zues himself. Refuge or god, none are safe from Nikandreos' primal rage as he fights to avenge a quite literally god-forsaken humanity.  A suprisingly varied experience as brilliant in aesthetic as it is in satisfaction from start to finish. I do reccomend playing on the harder difficulty on your first playthrough to get the most out of this game. The lower difficulty leaves you with far too many resources and breathing room. You are killing gods after all, prove yourself worthy to walk upon the Olympian summit. One thing to note about this game is that a lot of your learning is done in a heavily autodidactic fashion. Such little tidbits will follow. Semi spoiler alert relating to the specifics of combat. 1: Sweeping an enemies feet out will throw them into the air.2: Hitting them in the head with your swing will do more damage.3: When blocking, you need to aim your shield at the point of which the attack will impact with you. This is particularly needed in the final fight. 4: If you get into a fight with guards around the 'non-combat' areas, either run as far as you can and hide. (The top left of the screen shows you portraits of who you are in combat with, and will fade away if they lose you.) But if you choose to fight, make sure you don't let them blow their horns. They will summon more dudes to fight and can do this endlessly.5: Middle mouse while blocking to do a shield smack, knocking people back and putting their guard down. 6: Stackable weapons durabilities are individual to that weapon. For example, if you have a spear in your hand it's durability isn't shared with the other 4 hidden on your person. 7: When breaking open stuff, if you have the time switch to your fist not to waste durability on weapons. That's all that comes to mind right now just after finishing the game. I would love to see a similar style game but for Norse mythology instead of Greek. It would be brilliant. Absolutely reccomend this game for fans of souls games type combat.			"

It keeps it simple yet interesting with plenty of secrets and small objectives to do that give you worthwhile bonuses, all without becoming tedious. It gets the mythology right, which is not something that always happens, and there are references and history all throughout the game.While the combat can occasionally become frustrating it is very rewarding when you defeat a boss or clear an area of especially annoying enemies.The soundtrack is amazing, really setting the mood and allowing you to be pulled in.All in all it is a fantastic game.

												Deserves an award for Most Pleasant Surprise of 2015. Got it out of curiosity with the price being so low at the time of writing, and it's easily become one of my favourites in a year that was stuffed with stellar games.The art and music are excellent. Visually, it's like the artwork on Ancient Greek pots has come to life. From the first moments to my latest, it just kept getting prettier. With every new area, I fell in love all over again. Great voice acting. It's simply a joy to wander in this world and find new secrets. The slow-swinging combat takes a little getting used to and will seem frustrating at first, but it's good fun once you get good at it. You have to learn the pace of the weapons and how to time your strikes, and with training and upgrades you become more dangerous too. While it's enjoyable enough roaming around, there are many fun action sequences and the boss fights are creative and exciting. If you like Greek myths, 2D exploration adventures, and a lot of ""find Key X to open Door Y"" progression then you'll love this. The ending is worth the journey, too!			"

												You don't need a review to tell you that the art style is amazing. The story is simple enough: kill the Olympian gods.Pros:- fun combat- excellent level design- diverse enemies and NPC cast- minor RPG elements such as leveling up individual armour pieces, which all have cool unique appearances- great diversity of weapon types that offer different gameplay styles, as well as some cool legendary weapons- soothing and mood-fitting soundtrack- great length/content (I've played for almost 4 hours and I've only killed one of the major Gods)- a ton of Greek myth references, great for myth buffs and anyone who has an interest in learningCons:- enemies in melee combat are difficult to hit when they are very close to the player- not necessarily a bad thing, but some may find the lack of character development underwhelming- boss battles don't seem very tough (granted I've only killed Apollo and some minor bosses such as the Chimera so far)I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Greek myth, but it is enjoyable enough that I would recommend it if you know nothing of Greek myth.

												A sort of metroidvania style adventure taking place in Ancient Greece in a black-figure style reminiscent of Archaic period Greek pottery art; Apotheon is an extremely interesting and well thought out experience.The game has its flaws, certainly.  The combat system, while servicable is rather frantic, often you're flailing around trying to hit things rather than being able to decisively attack.  There are a large number of weapons... often too many, as there are no less than thirty different weapons at your disposal, most of which can be thrown as well as used at melee range, not to mention a wide variety of arrows.  This makes picking the right weapon for the job difficult at times, and as weapons tend to break (though you hardly ever find yourself NOT having one, as they're EVERYWHERE) you generally find yourself using whatever you have on hand.  Fortunately, this aspect DOES add to the feel of the game, as you're often pulling weapons off racks and hurling them at your attackers.  Quite often I've found satisfaction in hurling a short sword and embedding it in an enemy footman's forehead.The power-ups are useful but none of them (until the final one, at least) are spectacular so the power up curve is very slight and almost imperceptible.  The enemies get harder and you get tougher, but the game never really seems to get any more or less difficult.  Depending on what you like, this can be a good or a bad thing, but I found it to be fortunate as the game never became a slog.There are a lot of puzzles and interesting little gimmicks in the game that aren't really overused.  Many of the boss fights are unique and interesting and each god's area is flavored by their domain and personality appropriately.  If you are a fan of Greek mythology (or even have a passing knowledge) you should enjoy the references and there's also a ton of little blurbs from various ancient Greecian literature to flavor the events of the game.As the game progressed, I found it to grow progressively more unstable, crashing several times near the end.  However, this was never more than a momentary irritation as checkpoints are numerous and the game has an autosave/continue system as well as a manual save should you need them.All in all, a solid and entertaining piece of work.  I'm not sure if I'll try to beat it on anything other than the default difficulty, but I did find all the lockboxes and I completed MOST of the sidequests so there's a lot of fun to be had.  It's definitely worth its time and Zeus and the other gods are compelling enough to keep you going until the end just to stick it to them.			"

												A simple Metroidvania game with a relatively unique combat system and an amazing soundtrack. Despite the heavily under-utilized exploration elements, the game nails the rest of its components and was an enjoyable play. Easily recommended for fans of the Metroidvania genre; if you are new to this genre, you can start with this game but there are a few better choices out there (notably Guacamelee).PROS:-Amazing soundtrack.-Solid voice acting.-Simple metroidvania concept with varied environments, hidden areas, and breakable walls.-Different weapons feel different. -Unique artstyle. This style has the possibility of being an eyesore or making certain components difficult to see, but this was not the case at all with Apotheon. NEUTRALS:-2 game world hubs. Cannot access the second hub until you clear the first hub which somewhat limits speed run or ""alternate path"" run throughs. However, within the given hubs, they can be cleared in any order from the start. -Breakable objects mostly pointless. Only ""meaningful"" collectible is gold which is used to get damage upgrades but not really needed.-Enemies are mostly pointless. I found myself simply running past most of them towards the second half of the game, especially after I had level 3 attack upgrades. -Way too many health/armor drops. I had max inventory almost all game.CONS:-No meaningful abilities gained (giving access to new areas).-No consideration for additional access in level design.-Heavily under-utilize exploration elements.**This is especially odd given it is a Metroidvania game, but, aside from armor, you gain no abilities that give you access to new areas. This is quite strange because you DO get the ability to  roll in mid-air  which could have been used to give access to many new game areas but....the environments/levels are not designed in this way.-Does not properly support side mouse buttons (not a big deal). 1 of my 2 side buttons did work, but only certain abilities (I ended up using it for throw, but it would not work for roll even though it would bind).

												Apotheon's story is not exactly original, but the excecution helps the familiar tale feel fresh. The music adds a somber air and punches up heroically during combat and boss fights.

												What an absolute marvel!Outstanding art, precise mechanics, engrossing story.The best game I have ever purchased for $5I absolutely love this game.The aesthetics with upgradable armor: The different armor types and how they look on your character: cloth, leather, metallic. The weapon variety: Dori, Sarissa, Xiphos, Sagaris, Bows etc. There are even unique weapons that do different capabilities, like the Hydra bow that shoots 3 projectiles instead of one. Interesting take on the different shields: The game does not stick to the traditional Hoplon, but tweaks it in a variety of different ways to better fit your play style, (reflect damage, or see in the dark) The mechanics: How the sarissa (long pike) only deals damage where the spearhead is, not the shaft; so when you go to thrust, anything in a close proximity is unscathed. The story: Amazing rendition of classic Hellenistic deities and a unique path to follow.SPOILER  Though it is very similar to the God of War archetype. This game is a gem. "

												Very enjoyable experience with some minor issues. It definitely has one of the finest art-style I've seen and gameplay wise it's also great, but there are some things that would be welcome in sequel if that ever happens. It's definitely not one of those Art >> Gameplay situations. Premise is really simple and quite similar to God of War games - Ancient Greek mythology + overthrowing godsYou have a wide range of weapons at your disposal and combat involves attacking and blocking/dodging. Nothing complicated, it just works. Would be great if there would be light/medium/charged attack system (instead weapons themselves replace this system) or better directional attack system. Weapons lose durability over time so when your favourite fiery sword reaches 0, it's gone.There are numerous destroyable objects, that can contain ether health/armor replenishers, ingredients for crafting potions/bombs or weapons. However if you destroy these objects with your weapon, durability is lost which is a bit annoying. You can still break everything with your fists so gameplay-wise disabling durability loss when not attacking enemies would be much better than just cycling between primary weapon and fists.You can't repair items, but plenty are lying around and you can easily buy them (rare weapons are actually more easily acquirable, since every time you find a rare weapon/shield, it's added to stock). Buying things from black market merchant also involves the biggest bug in the game - If you unlock enough rare weapons, you can't see bottom items when trying to buy from black market merchant (at least on 1366x768)Feeling of the game itself is entirely positive. It looks perfect for the setting you are in and it's not repetitive. Locations differ and feel unique from each other. And it's not just looks, gameplay/platforming differs in each location. Some acquired powers/gifts from the gods however feel a bit uninspiring. Who cares about +X % when using potion trait?Multiple secrets that gives you a bit of a boost in your journey. Some feel a bit disappointing, but who does not like hunting for secret locations?Super minor, but a really smart element in the game - when you collect new armor, you can change to previous look if you don't like the new one without sacrificing stats.Achievements are gathered as you play along + side objectives, so there are no ""Kill 12 wolves in 1 second"" medalsIn conclusion - an instant recommendation, feels like AAA platformer with some polish would make this an AAA+			"

												I have so far gotten to what I assume is the halfway point of the game, if not the second third, and I can already say that this game is worth the price (even though I only got it for $3 over on Humble Bundle)The story is basic, but enough to keep you engaged. This game takes place during the times dypicted in Ancient Greek Mythology (if you haven't learned much about it, you can get a basic idea from the Disney movie, Hercules, since you don't need to know much to be familiar with the lore this game covers). You play as Nikandreos, a warrior who is sent by Zeus' wife, Hera, to climb Mount Olympus and destroy the gods that abandoned mankind. Like I said, there isn't much to the story, but it does give you the motivation to pursue the task at hand.The presentation is very well done. The artstyle perfectly replicates the artwork of ancient greek, both in environments and characters. Just a quick heads up, however, that the artstyle matches a bit TOO well; like ancient greek artwork, character models and environmental statues and paintings will feature nudity, such as genitalia (both the male and female variety) and breasts, so if you don't like seeing that sort of thing, it's best to tread lightly. Rest assured, however, that it does not go any further than that. I also like some of the more subtle details, such as the glossy shine that follows your mouse, implying that the game is played out on a clay pot or jar similar to most ancient artwork of the time.Gameplay is just about what you expect from a Metroidvania: Expansive levels with numerous secret passageways and goodies to find, special abilities that you can unlock as you defeat more gods of Olympus, and the ability to take on the objectives you are given in any order. What makes the game a bit more unique, however, is the weapon and crafting system. To any Anti-Minecraft people out there, don't worry, crafting is neither required or even complex; there's only a handful of items you can craft, such as your basic potions and bombs, as well as consumable weapons like traps. The weapon system is also unique; unlike most other Metroidvania games, you're not just stuck to one weapon, with there being numerous weapons to find ranging from knives, arrows, spears, swords, and sheilds, with each type having their own varied range of weapons; some weapons do high damage when used a certain way, others have elemental abilities like burning damage, and some even provide explorative uses, such as lighting your way through dark areas. It's a bit like Dark souls in that regard, as you also have to keep in mind that some weapons are heavier than others, meaning they have slow attack rates but high damage capability. It's also worth noting that all weapons have stamina, meaning they break after significant use. Thankfully, though, you can purchase any weapons or sheilds you find in the field via the black market, so getting your favorite weapon back isn't too much of an issue if you have the gold to purchase it.Overall, I can easily call this one of my favorite Metroidvanias so far. It may not be as good as Ori or Dust, but it does what it intends to do very well.			"

												A sort of metroidvania style adventure taking place in Ancient Greece in a black-figure style reminiscent of Archaic period Greek pottery art; Apotheon is an extremely interesting and well thought out experience.The game has its flaws, certainly.  The combat system, while servicable is rather frantic, often you're flailing around trying to hit things rather than being able to decisively attack.  There are a large number of weapons... often too many, as there are no less than thirty different weapons at your disposal, most of which can be thrown as well as used at melee range, not to mention a wide variety of arrows.  This makes picking the right weapon for the job difficult at times, and as weapons tend to break (though you hardly ever find yourself NOT having one, as they're EVERYWHERE) you generally find yourself using whatever you have on hand.  Fortunately, this aspect DOES add to the feel of the game, as you're often pulling weapons off racks and hurling them at your attackers.  Quite often I've found satisfaction in hurling a short sword and embedding it in an enemy footman's forehead.The power-ups are useful but none of them (until the final one, at least) are spectacular so the power up curve is very slight and almost imperceptible.  The enemies get harder and you get tougher, but the game never really seems to get any more or less difficult.  Depending on what you like, this can be a good or a bad thing, but I found it to be fortunate as the game never became a slog.There are a lot of puzzles and interesting little gimmicks in the game that aren't really overused.  Many of the boss fights are unique and interesting and each god's area is flavored by their domain and personality appropriately.  If you are a fan of Greek mythology (or even have a passing knowledge) you should enjoy the references and there's also a ton of little blurbs from various ancient Greecian literature to flavor the events of the game.As the game progressed, I found it to grow progressively more unstable, crashing several times near the end.  However, this was never more than a momentary irritation as checkpoints are numerous and the game has an autosave/continue system as well as a manual save should you need them.All in all, a solid and entertaining piece of work.  I'm not sure if I'll try to beat it on anything other than the default difficulty, but I did find all the lockboxes and I completed MOST of the sidequests so there's a lot of fun to be had.  It's definitely worth its time and Zeus and the other gods are compelling enough to keep you going until the end just to stick it to them.			"

												This recommendation comes with some caution. Apotheon is a beautiful game and its soundtrack and environments are magical and immersive. The game is SUPER aesthetically pleasing, from its use of Attic Black-Figure pottery style, to the faux-ceramic texture of the screen (scratches and ribbing, which is the result of throwing pottery on a wheel, included!), to the beautiful use of color, light, and shadows. However, the game mechanics suck. A lot. It can get frustrating and downright annoying.If you're looking for a new, relatively cheap but visually stunning game, I would recommend Apotheon. Also, if you have a background in Classical history or archaeology (like me), this game becomes even more delightful, as there are excerpts from Hesiod and Homer, and all of the gods were clearly designed with their ancient depictions in mind. Just keep in mind the terrible mechanics.			"

												What an absolute marvel!Outstanding art, precise mechanics, engrossing story.The best game I have ever purchased for $5I absolutely love this game.The aesthetics with upgradable armor: The different armor types and how they look on your character: cloth, leather, metallic. The weapon variety: Dori, Sarissa, Xiphos, Sagaris, Bows etc. There are even unique weapons that do different capabilities, like the Hydra bow that shoots 3 projectiles instead of one. Interesting take on the different shields: The game does not stick to the traditional Hoplon, but tweaks it in a variety of different ways to better fit your play style, (reflect damage, or see in the dark) The mechanics: How the sarissa (long pike) only deals damage where the spearhead is, not the shaft; so when you go to thrust, anything in a close proximity is unscathed. The story: Amazing rendition of classic Hellenistic deities and a unique path to follow.SPOILER  Though it is very similar to the God of War archetype. This game is a gem. "

												I dont gush over games very often, in fact, Im a fairly cynical gamer, but Apotheon is awesome.  This is a gem that almost slipped under my radar (thank you, Steam sale), and I am very grateful it didnt because it's an example to me of what all game design should aspire to: great art style, great music, great voice acting, great game play, great writing, great design and fun, fun, fun!  The combat was a little clunky for me at first, but when I got used to it I realized it's actually quite skill-based and more sophisticated than I had at first thought.  The story is clever and well-written; as a fan of greek mythology, I was happy to see the research that went into the game and how well the designer's captured the personalities of the gods based on descriptions found in the classics.  The art style is unique and did a beautiful job of capturing the theme.  I am very surprised at how good this game is and I recommend it to everyone.  Easily my favorite 2d platformer ever and well worth the $$.  Well done Alientrap on giving this game the polish all games deserve but rarely get.			"

												Apotheon is a reasonably good ""Metroidvania""-style game. The main pulling factor for this game is definately the Artstyle. So the flowchart for this game is pretty simple: Do you like the Artstyle? Yes: buy / No: don't buyOverall the gameplay is mostly fluid and satisfying. The Stages are varied and follow appropriate themes. The game manages to set the mood just right, eventho the appalingly British voiceactors do their best to brake this immersion. Controles can be a bit wonky at times, but on gamepad it's generally managable. It is somewhat prone to glitch at times, this goes from +5 HP apples ragdolling into a pillar and being unreachable to important quest items getting lost in a similar way(or down mount olympus). The story is ok, good enough to be a game, or greek myth. One thing that I personally liked a lot is that some typical tropes were avoided, like Hades being all evil. Also having Hera as Patron was both a reasonable and refreshing choice. I did notice they forgot to include poor Hestia. Which is a pitty as she is always left out because everyone thinks ""the twelve Olympians"" includes Hades, who lives in... Hades. Finished on easy with all sidequests, lacking some ""secret chests"" in about 15 hours.			"

												An almost Souls-like experience, Apotheon follows Nikandreos, lead by Hera as he slaughters everyone on Olympus one by one, and sometimes house by house, eventually usurping Zues himself. Refuge or god, none are safe from Nikandreos' primal rage as he fights to avenge a quite literally god-forsaken humanity.  A suprisingly varied experience as brilliant in aesthetic as it is in satisfaction from start to finish. I do reccomend playing on the harder difficulty on your first playthrough to get the most out of this game. The lower difficulty leaves you with far too many resources and breathing room. You are killing gods after all, prove yourself worthy to walk upon the Olympian summit. One thing to note about this game is that a lot of your learning is done in a heavily autodidactic fashion. Such little tidbits will follow. Semi spoiler alert relating to the specifics of combat. 1: Sweeping an enemies feet out will throw them into the air.2: Hitting them in the head with your swing will do more damage.3: When blocking, you need to aim your shield at the point of which the attack will impact with you. This is particularly needed in the final fight. 4: If you get into a fight with guards around the 'non-combat' areas, either run as far as you can and hide. (The top left of the screen shows you portraits of who you are in combat with, and will fade away if they lose you.) But if you choose to fight, make sure you don't let them blow their horns. They will summon more dudes to fight and can do this endlessly.5: Middle mouse while blocking to do a shield smack, knocking people back and putting their guard down. 6: Stackable weapons durabilities are individual to that weapon. For example, if you have a spear in your hand it's durability isn't shared with the other 4 hidden on your person. 7: When breaking open stuff, if you have the time switch to your fist not to waste durability on weapons. That's all that comes to mind right now just after finishing the game. I would love to see a similar style game but for Norse mythology instead of Greek. It would be brilliant. Absolutely reccomend this game for fans of souls games type combat.			"

												Apotheon took me about 14 hours to complete. The controls were great, the story was interesting and the weapon variety made the combat fun. The art style looked cool throughout the game. The only issue I had was that once you threw all of one type of weapon (ex spears) it just swaps to the next and you can keep throwing. There were serveral times I threw every sword, axe, etc before I realized I was out of spears. Veni, vidi, vici!  I think thats Latin for I came, I saw, I kicked it's♥♥♥♥♥(?) Update - It looks like they have released a free online multiplayer version that you could download and play to see if this is a game you might like. I haven't tried the multiplayer, but the not free story mode was great!			"

												Deserves an award for Most Pleasant Surprise of 2015. Got it out of curiosity with the price being so low at the time of writing, and it's easily become one of my favourites in a year that was stuffed with stellar games.The art and music are excellent. Visually, it's like the artwork on Ancient Greek pots has come to life. From the first moments to my latest, it just kept getting prettier. With every new area, I fell in love all over again. Great voice acting. It's simply a joy to wander in this world and find new secrets. The slow-swinging combat takes a little getting used to and will seem frustrating at first, but it's good fun once you get good at it. You have to learn the pace of the weapons and how to time your strikes, and with training and upgrades you become more dangerous too. While it's enjoyable enough roaming around, there are many fun action sequences and the boss fights are creative and exciting. If you like Greek myths, 2D exploration adventures, and a lot of ""find Key X to open Door Y"" progression then you'll love this. The ending is worth the journey, too!			"

It keeps it simple yet interesting with plenty of secrets and small objectives to do that give you worthwhile bonuses, all without becoming tedious. It gets the mythology right, which is not something that always happens, and there are references and history all throughout the game.While the combat can occasionally become frustrating it is very rewarding when you defeat a boss or clear an area of especially annoying enemies.The soundtrack is amazing, really setting the mood and allowing you to be pulled in.All in all it is a fantastic game.

												A simple Metroidvania game with a relatively unique combat system and an amazing soundtrack. Despite the heavily under-utilized exploration elements, the game nails the rest of its components and was an enjoyable play. Easily recommended for fans of the Metroidvania genre; if you are new to this genre, you can start with this game but there are a few better choices out there (notably Guacamelee).PROS:-Amazing soundtrack.-Solid voice acting.-Simple metroidvania concept with varied environments, hidden areas, and breakable walls.-Different weapons feel different. -Unique artstyle. This style has the possibility of being an eyesore or making certain components difficult to see, but this was not the case at all with Apotheon. NEUTRALS:-2 game world hubs. Cannot access the second hub until you clear the first hub which somewhat limits speed run or ""alternate path"" run throughs. However, within the given hubs, they can be cleared in any order from the start. -Breakable objects mostly pointless. Only ""meaningful"" collectible is gold which is used to get damage upgrades but not really needed.-Enemies are mostly pointless. I found myself simply running past most of them towards the second half of the game, especially after I had level 3 attack upgrades. -Way too many health/armor drops. I had max inventory almost all game.CONS:-No meaningful abilities gained (giving access to new areas).-No consideration for additional access in level design.-Heavily under-utilize exploration elements.**This is especially odd given it is a Metroidvania game, but, aside from armor, you gain no abilities that give you access to new areas. This is quite strange because you DO get the ability to  roll in mid-air  which could have been used to give access to many new game areas but....the environments/levels are not designed in this way.-Does not properly support side mouse buttons (not a big deal). 1 of my 2 side buttons did work, but only certain abilities (I ended up using it for throw, but it would not work for roll even though it would bind).

												The game has such a great concept, directly inspired from greek mythology with its own little twist. The Gods of Olympus has turned their back from you, the hero Nikandros, leaving humanity to die drowning in rubble and blood. Queen Hera plans to overthrow her husband, Zeus, but in order to do that, she needs your power.And just like that, you are thrown into the gigantic arena that is Olympus to hust down, slay, and defeat every god that stands in your way, each god you kill, the more power you gain so you can even rival the mighty Zeus.The game has a very unique fighting system that doesn't make the game too difficult, but very attractive and engaging, like Aphrodite.The art of Apotheon is very original and different from any other greek mythology based game. It resembles the color schenes and the figures portrayed on ancient greek pottery. It is very appealing to see these stationary orange and black figures come to life from their painted forms.The music is very engaging and ""godlike."" (See what I did there?) It helps make the boss battles more intense so that the bosses seem mostrous and terifying.8/10 I am just playing all of the games I bought but never played for years.			"

												I absolutely love the concept of this game, particularly the brilliant art style (inspired by Classical Greek pottery) and the use of real mythology to weave together an original storyline. The voice acting is pretty good, which is rare for a video game. I also love that it was created by such a small team.Drawbacks: The controls were pretty wonky, which was normally fine but made some of the battles and other obstacles unnecessarily difficult--and not in a ""challenging"" way, just in a frustrating way. (I like what they were trying to do with the controls, it just didn't seem as well executed as it could be) The graphics also struggled, even if I greatly reduced the resolution. Both of these problems could just be my computer though; it's not the fastest.This isn't a drawback for me, but if you are squeamish in any way, this is not a game for you. It's very dark, bloody, and violent, and there is a lot of nudity--of course, without any of that, it would be missing the point of the mythological inspiration.Overall, vey well done and definitely worth playing!

												I was instantly drawn to this game,  more than a year before it released, when I saw its art style, and the combat looked right up my alley as well.  I can say with certainty that it was worth the wait.Combat is timing-based, and depending on what weapon you're using timing will change, as will the damage per swing.  Some enemies may be fast enough that certain types of weapons won't land a hit, so you'd better be able to think on your feet.  As for weapons, there are a LOT of them, with decent variety in playstyle.  There is also a crafting system for health items, fire jars, temporary speed, and other such powerups, giving you good reason to seek out all the little pick-up-ables that can be found amoungst pots, jars, and crates.The world is *large*, open, and PACKED with locked doors and little dungeons.  Definitely in the ""Metroid-vania"" genre.  As a completionist, I'm wondering how in the world I'll finish this game, with those tantalizing little ""X-out-of-Z chests unlocked"" indicators teasing me - so many locked doors to remember to open.The hub world is interesting, having a group of ""police"" that you'll need to avoid whilst you lock-pick into merchant's houses in search of loot, or try to take that tempting little statue.  You'll want to run and hide until your alert meter cools off if you're seen being a trouble maker, lest you be first warned with a fine of 20 gold, then straight up executed if you're caught again not long after.Boss fights are satisfying, music is fitting, story is fun.  Fair disclaimer though, I'm not finished yet, so I can't say if I like the ending.If I have one complaint about the game itself, it might be that the voice acting is perhaps the only thing not fully fitting with the style (it's not BAD, it's just not as ""Greek"" feeling as the rest of the game is), as it might be more enjoyable to just have text bubbles and imagine the voices.  Still, the speaking is good for the lazy who prefer not to read.The other complaint I have, though not down to the game itself, and more about the programming, is that this game seems to be a bit more intensive than it should be, and feels just a bit laggy, despite being a 2D platformer type of game.  Perhaps it wouldn't be an issue if I weren't playing on an iMac, but Bioshock Infinite didn't complain too badly.Overall, this game is a solid 9/10 for me; certainly one of the best 2D games I've ever played.++++++++++++++++++++Edit: I'm about halfway through the game now at 23 hours in.   I'm going pretty completionist, so I'm getting all the chests and such.  I have to say, the sheer number of weapons, items, powerups, etc is nuts.  Boss fights have been very fun, particularly Artimis.  The voice acting bothers me less now, seems to be the case that a few early voices just sounded weird to me.Really looking forward to seeing how the endgame plays out.  Game is still a solid 9/10.++++++++++++++++++++Game is complete, 100%, all achievements, guards kneel and weep before me, etc, etc.  Game is ok, 1/10Pfft.  9/10.  Almost leaning 8/10 for the all the lag I got playing a 2D game, even on an imac, but I really can't fault the whole game for a bit of optimization problems.  Only real complaint I have looking back is that you end up with 1,000 weapons, but you really only want to use like 4 of them, and the rest start to feel like fluff.			"

												The voice acting is amazing in this game. I really, truly enjoyed it. I could really feel the emotion of the characters coming through which is surprising for a 2D game. The combat / boss fights were unique enough to be challenging but not so difficult to cause frustration and repeat deaths. 9/10 Would recommend.			"

												So where to begin with this game.Well---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pros:+Great story, especially to those greek mythos lovers out there, such as myself. Makes you fan out to fight the Gods of Olympus.+Fun and creative gameplay.+Survivial (in a way), you pick up items on you're way, can buy items in stores, can trade items, but from as far as I can see, there is no selling weps or supplies.+Fun as hell bosses, and each boss sticks to a theme.+Some of the missions are hard as hell, but have great pay offs at the end.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mixed:~Music is pretty basic.~There is in fact voice acting for the text. But it varies, if anything, I hate how movie, tv shows, and video games do this stupid thing where they make everyone have a british accent. If I am playing a game about acient greek history, I would like thecorrect accent. It also switches off for some characters, going from british, to scotish, to an american accent.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons:-I am sure I am not the only one who has said this.BUT GOOD LORD THIS GAME'S STORY IS ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE ""GOD OF WAR"".You are a mortal who has been left for dead by Zeus, you aint gonna take that♥♥♥♥♥♥and go and hunt him down. Of course Zeus'sfollowers arent to happy so you have to kill them too.Good lord its like they took ""God of war's"" story and shoved it into one.Not to say ""God of war"" has a bad story, but there could be some more creativity into the story in ""Apotheon"".- Some of the game gets crazy, and pure unfair.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------So in conclusionIs this game bad? Hell no, it has its flaws but in the end the game is a great buy.My Rating: 7.5/10 "

I'm going to build my own Mount Olympus, with dice and courtesans!One by one, striking down ancient Gods, teaching them some humility and shoving arrogance back down their throats, you are the chosen champion - Nikandreos, who is marching through mythological Greek locations, trying to get some sweet justice. Sounds cliché, however the setting has an untapped potential which is used quite skillfully. Somehow it reminds me of the good old Tomb Raider - cold and empty halls of Poseidon temples, dark and ominous rivers of Hades, feeling of adventure and desolation.It does have issues - minor bugs here and there, open map edges where you can fall through textures, battle system could use some extra moves like parry, more enemy types. Nevertheless, it does seem to be polished and well-paced.Fairly simple and easy game with little secrets, rushed ending, but very educational, true to the source and truly an eye candy. And music... oh music is marvellous and very fitting, which will raise your hair as you approach your destiny and final battle. My heart is longing for more, but there are no alternatives, maybe it is time to fire up Titan Quest again?			"

												In English: Simply great level design & art style, fight with gods with cool weapons in awesome atmosphere...Only bad thing in the Single-player mode: too short, less than 10 hrs & I finished but I just can't wait some add-on/dlc on reasonable price.The multiplayer could be fun & when you can connect to other players it is. But sooner or later I was alway disconnected so far I tried to play online. (But in other games on Steam I can play online, so not my internet connection is the problem.)In Hungarian / Magyarul is: remek kis játék, megéri az árát. Pláne, ha szereted a mitológiai témájú játékokat. Lehetne hosszabb, de annyi van benne, amennyit kell érte fizetni. A multija sajnos küzd hibákkal, pedig jópofa lenne az is.			"

												Visuals in this game are stunning, if you did not notice. And overall commitment to ancient greek theme is very commendable. The music is plesant, although one would say lo-fi. And the gameplay is typical for the ""metroidvania"" genre, with the accent on exploration, with relative freedom given to you. The game has a nice set of optional and sometimes hidden quests, finishing such usually grants you some benefits in the main one. Some little things are worth pointing out too. When you run for a while in one direction on a level ground, you start to sprint. This spices the usual tedious walks of the games in this genre. The controls and combat in particular can be very wonky and even random at times. And game overall could really benefit from more polish. There are a lot of bugs and glitches. As if there was little time put in testing. If you want to try this game and did not like the introductory level, i say try one more to get a better feel. The first linear level with such a strange and clunky controls can misderect you from the joy of this game. It's not perfect, but it us surely very fun to play. Boners.			"

I binged all 12 hours to finish the game in a weekend because I loved it so much. Easily one of my favorite games in the last year. The mechanics can be graceless at times, but I found the incredible style and story more than made up for it. Lovely game. 10/10, would buy again.			"

												I was charmed to try the game by its unique art style that resembles Ancient Greek vase decorations, and I was glad to have tried the game. It's not just an artsy indie game, and the more you play, the better it gets.The game takes place almost entirely on Mt Olympus, and has you visit different areas. There are 2 main hub locations (Agora and Acropolis), and each one contains doorways to a number of other areas. Some of these areas belong to a specific deity, whilst others are just bonus locations. Most of the game's story involves you simply undertaking tasks for each Olympian deity and eventually confronting them one way or another.This is not just a simple 2D platformer. The game has quite an open world and really knows how to reward exploration. There are tonnes of optional areas and hidden secrets, and a huge variety of weapons to collect, many of which are uniques. There's always some delicious surprise around a corner or behind a breakable wall. The gameplay is very reminiscent of the Metroid style games, so if you've ever enjoyed those, you should have a fun time with Apotheon as well.Despite the enormous amount of fun I've had, I've also come across a lot of frustration, which was somewhat disappointing. As some people already pointed out, the combat, although fun and enjoyable, can be a bit tricky and awkward at times, because you have to time your swings really well. Not much of a problem most of the time, but it can be a nightmare when fighting fast moving enemies that either jump at you or fly around.There were some parts of the game where frustration came mostly from controls, such as trying to quickly outclimb the fast-rising flames of river Phlegethon, but most times it was in the boss fights. Although some bosses were a fun challenge, a fair few were frustrating beyond belief and involved mechanics which did not make much sense, like Diomedes being completely invulnerable unless you've thrown a jar of blood at him to stun him, or Zeus somehow being weak to his own lightning bolts, but managing to shrug off blades, clubs, and fire like they were nothing.Still, despite the frustrating sections, I've had a very fun playthrough. The music is also really fantastic and fits the areas perfectly. The most noteworthy one being the eerie track that plays in Hades. So for the most part, this is a really memorable and unique game. I would highly recommend you check it out if you've ever at least remotely enjoyed 2D platformers and sidescrollers.			"

												Funnily enough, a few weeks before learning about Apotheon for the first time, I had a similar idea for a Metroidvania-style game stylized to look like ancient artwork, only Egyptian-style instead of Greek. Not terribly relevant, just noting what got me enthused to play Apotheon in the first place.The basic premise of Apotheon is that Zeus has grown tired of mankind's continuous degeneration, and has decided to call do-over and wipe the Earth clean of mortalkind, and decrees that the gods of Olympus will withdraw their favor. Crops won' grow, sun won't shine, the forests are empty of game, etc. After fending off some desperate raiders in the opening tutorial, Hera bids you to travel to Olympus and take back what the gods have deprived your people of by force. One thing leads to another and you find yourself going head to head with Zeus himself in the climactic battle.Apotheon's being drawing point is definitely its artstyle. The entire game is made to look like Greek pottery art come to life, and it gives the game an identity all is own that serves the tone of the game perfectly. Gameplay wise there isn't much to talk about, pretty typical Metroidvania fare, and in the end I only have three major complaints:1. Weapon degradation has never improved a game. I imagine it was mostly added to force players to try out the different weapons in the game (there's a lot of them), but all it did was make me focus on using the worst weapons in my arsenal just so they'd break and get off the list. Breakable shields is more understandable, but generally speaking iron is slightly more sturdy than carboard and tinfoil.2. The game tends to take more than it gives, which made me resort to farming on more than a few occasions. Farming is for survival games and MMOs. Otherwise it just indicates poor resource distribution.3. The Caduceus of Hermes, while a fun exploration tool, also reveals a number of clumsy level borders, as the developers never intended those areas to be accessed. Many of these are one-way trips and can lead to falling out of the map entirely. I get the feeling the Caduceus was added to the game partway through development and the rest of the game wasn't built with it in mind.All in all these are only mild niggles in what is otherwise a beautiful and engaging Metroidvania title. Definitely give it a go.			"

												I have always had a mild interest in Greek culture, or more specifically, its mythology. It is some of the richest that I know, and some of the most entertaining, and this game does every bit of that storied culture proud. As far as I can tell, the setting described within this game is as spot on as one can get in regards to something first created thousands of years ago. The art style is amazing, I feel as if I  am fighting my way through my own Greek epic, my own legend, and the music captures that feeling even more, and honestly, the whole display would not look at all out of place on a urn or carving in a museum. When just wandering Olympus, the sound of Pipes and Lyres fill the world, but when Xiphos and Doru are drawn, out come the horns and battle drums, not to mention a chorus to build up the tension. While the style and display are among the best I have ever seen, the actual gameplay and writing technique fall slightly short. The writing itself is fine, but aside from our silent hero Nikandreos, there are few, if any, returning characters to beef up dialog. When your home village of Dion is attacked, there is little impact to seeing a Greek village engulfed in flames. Characters run around screaming the same few lines over and over again, and even the characters that do speak rarely show up again, and if they do, it is unlikely you will remember any of them. Even the Gods themselves have little to say, barely a paragraph in some cases, Hephaestus and Aphrodite being the most notable in that regard. Some gods have  more substantial amounts of dialog, mainly Zeus and Hera, but the rest talk before boss fights, and that is about it. I remember distinctly (spoilers to those who care) breaking Helios out of Prison, and expecting to see him again after I had done as he asked, but I never saw him again. He just ran off after giving me the requisite three things to blow up. The actual game portion of this game fairs slightly better, though it is also flawed in it's own respects. It is a two-dimensional brawler, with a focus on inventory and clever usage of the tools at your immediate disposal rather than special attacks. Your attack options include tossing various bombs, javelins, darts, or any weapon you happen to be holding at the time, (Hey you! Lets play catch the pike! You first!) blocking or bashing with a shield, over hand and underhand attacks, a faster but weaker stab, healing items for when you are terrible at dodging, at a roll command. Occasionally you can blow something up in the background, usually lanterns and sometimes specific urns, but for the most part that's it. This is improved somewhat with the generally very competent AI, which will attempt to use their superior numbers against you, flanking, dodging attacks, or constantly backing up so they can continue tossing infinite numbers of spears. And finally you have boss fights, when all have their own little quirks to keep them interesting; Apollo shuts off the lights, forcing you to sacrifice your shield for a torch, or else blindly fumble in the dark, Artemis takes turns hunting and being hunted by you, Poseidon attacks your ship at sea, knocking it around trying to knock you overboard, and various monster bosses have their own weaknesses and tactics. This is all well and good, but the combat fumbles a bit with the the combination of an absurd number of weapons at your disposal, and a cumbersome method of switching weapons on the fly, which leaves you vulnerable as you frantically scroll through your six different clubs to reach the hammer you want to use. The Dodge button is also rather finicky, with enemies often hitting you regardless of your efforts to dodge attacks. At the end of the day though, this is a beautiful game, with a wonderful world, with mostly entertaining combat and a mildly lackluster story. In short, I would give this game a 8/10, and a hearty recommendation.			"

												A nice platformer with a very distinct artstyle and theme, lots of metroidvania-style exploration to do and a combat style that takes a few ideas from the Dark Souls series.My only complaint is that none of the control schemes seems ideal - platforming and close combat are much better on pad, but all arrow puzzles are almost impossible without a mouse.I didn't try the PvP mode but given how unoptimized the controls are I guess it can't be exceptional.I still totally recommend this game for the main campaign and the gorgeous graphics.

Apotheon is an action/adventure title following the the fictional epic of Nikandreos (a spin off of Nikandros, meaning victory of man), in which Zeus has turned his back on humanity and destroyed it.  Nikandreos then goes on a journey through Olympus to avenge his people.The ProsApotheon is a beautiful game with a gorgeous pottery-esque asthetic.  Being two-dimensional and having long, horizonal areas make the game feel like it was developed on an ancient vase documenting the tale as you write it.  Damage you take will chip the background, making contact with an enemy provides a satisfying sound of the tympanum, and the game never seems to break character.  All of that combined with a splendid soundtrack, made areas like Posidon suprisingly memorable and provided the atmosphere to make Hades and the Artemis Swamps genuinely unnerving.Apotheon also has a very steady learning curve, and I never felt like I was being pushed too hard or taken too easy.  That being said, I never ran low on health supplies, but found it an interesting challenge to keep myself well stocked.  All the way up to the end, the player is still being introduced to new weapons, techniques, and button presses.  There isn't a true tutorial, which I like.  The game knows the player isn't dumb, and though fairly linear, there's a lot to do off the beaten path.The ConsFor all it's worth, there were a couple of times where the control scheme felt difficult to work with.  It almost felt like a great indie game that was morphed into some sort of flash game from 2006.  Apotheon has a combat system completely based around the orientation of your mouse.  So Nikandreos will do some contortionist movements to shoot an arrow directly upwards, but it also means that enemies will only be hit if you aim, which was particularly challenging for me.  Not that it's a bad thing, but there's a lot of mouse movements that one needs to execute in simply landing successive hits.  That, and weapons seem to have some sort of random attack pattern.  Nikandreos seemed to swing, stab, and thrust with whatever execution he wanted; be it overhand, below the belt, behind the back, etc.  I couldn't control that, so when using something longer like a Doru or Sarissa, you might just end up hitting the cieling and smashing your weapon on their head, instead of thrusting it into their unprotected thigh.There's only a few other minor gripes I've got.  For example, Nikandreos has some sort of acceleration that leads to him sprinting full speed until he gets to stairs, and then loses all of his momentum.  The development team was a little frugal with their voice acting talents, and many characters sound similar.  Nikandreos also doesn't seem to develop in an emotional sense, but rather the Mega Man sense, where unlocking more weapons and acquiring health upgrades simply enable the player to do more.  Though the game acknowledges Nikandreos getting stronger and bases the story around it, I can't help but feel detached to the main character like when reading stories like The Iliad and The Odyssey.My VerdictAlien Trap did a good job with this title.  I found the development engaging, with a pleasurable asthetic that kept me playing until I was done.  Though I have a few gripes with the movement and combat, the game feels very much representative of the God of War series - if written by Greek playwrights.8.25/10 "

												Playing Apotheon (Alientrap, 2015)  is like diving in the registers of a Greek vase, and fighting giants and chimeras. Apart from a light narrative, and low play time, it’s the nods to ancient Greek themes, mythology and their emulations of them that I found rather enjoyable.The platform game developed and published by Alientrap in 2015 is a 2-D action roleplaying game that has you play as the protagonist Nikandreos. The game features esthetics that emulates the black figure and red-figure painting style found on Attic Vases, as well as takes their mythological storytelling dimensions. The main narrative is propelled by Hera, making you her champion, wishing to rebel against Zeus’ desire to see the world of man reduced to oblivion; to accomplish this: she instructs Nikandreos to seize the divine powers from the Twelve Olympians, and then defeat Zeus himself. While the story line is rather simplistic, the art style, immersive atmosphere of the game, and copious mythological references give it its redeeming grace. Each level is tailored from the nuanced color scheme, to its supplemental steles that enrich the lore of the divinity with citations from Homeric, Hesiodic, Greek tragic sources, and other eclectic Greek works; that serves to give a greater comprehension of the themed level. A level of appreciation and respect for the ancient sources were applied to the game without warping the narrative of ancient authors, instead it works in the gaps between them; at the end of the Hesiodic Iron Age.The first thing that you will undoubtedly notice is the fantastic art style; it basically looks like a playable ancient Greek vase. The classic side scrolling open world renders all the game as a flat field and registers of buildings and the impression of the painting’s figures that are coming to life to tell their mythical narrative. The character are little more than black silhouettes with “incised” details It’s a game that is always a pleasure to look at. Most of the game has a wonderful orange tone, but some areas use a different color palette. If you are even moderately familiar with Ancient Greek art, you will find its representations are very similar to those of the original pieces, such as the Olympian Zeus, Artemesium Zeus or the Discobolus of Myron- to name a few, as their attention to detail seeps in the majestic representations that permeate the entire game's style.The game’s soundtrack composed and produced by Marios Aristopoulos features lyre and a chorus out of combat and a more animated chorus singing around beating drums during. These Classical instruments have variants for the realms of gods from the chirping of nature with a calm lyre in Artemis’s forest , to the enlivened drinking party of Dionysus  marked by an ever increasing rhythm of the aulos flutes ; to the brass instruments and drums in the Sisyphean eternal state of war in Ares’s realm, with an underlying guitar rhythm . Or the dismal din and sharp notes of piano with lingering chorus in Hades’ realm of the dead . The lyre, aulos, and chorus immerse the player in the Ancient Greek theatrics of the game even further.Even the battles against the Gods are proper to their theme: Nikandreos and the Goddess of the hunt takes turns being the hunter and the hunted; Aphrodite must be shot by Eros three times; Dionysus has inebriating drinking games at a party of Satyrs and Maenads; Demeter tasks Nikandreos to undergo a katabasis in Hades’s Realm to reach her daughter Persephone at Hades’ side. Not all gods agree with their lord, Zeus, and will be more than happy to help you out, but you’ll also face some of them in direct combat. Some wishes to be remembered in sympathetic pathos with the plight of man and gift you their powers The hauntingly poignant pathos of the narrative’s dialog and conflict follows in the clichéd footsteps of Greek Classical Tragedy, where the conflict between heroes and gods, ends in the demise of the hero’s by an act of Hubris, or by being saved by divine intervention. The pathos of the Gods, in Apotheon, gives them a complex emotional character. For example Athena makes the allegory of Olympus being troy, and Nikandeos the Trojan horse, perhaps the most poignant is when Aphrodite's dialog:“But it is my nature! Would you mortals worship me if I was anything less than what I am? What share of privileges will I have when there is no one left on earth to love? Please accept my sacred cestus into which is woven my powers of beauty and desire. A token of remembrance from a goddess with no worshipers left.”(Alientrap, 2015)However in the modern twist from the game, the Gods become the tragic figures, that needs to be saved by an act of hubris…well those with compassion for mortals, and those that oppose Zeus. This drama works because it’s relatable. At the final level, while climbing Olympus to confront Zeus, he narrates the “Five Ages of Man”  as described by Hesiod, and locates Nikandreos within the Iron Age, and adds the Dark age twist continuing the tradidion of Hesiod.In sum the game Apotheon takes elements of above common knowledge from Greek vase painting, sculptural art, mythical narrative, tragedies, and sources- even chorus and music to present them to the player in an unencumbered and seamless episodic narrative-albeit rather simple. But that is the beauty of it-exposition thought artistic emulation. I hope, this review made you wish to try the game for yourselves. Thus is game is a pleasurable way to introduce Greek Classics, and Myth to video gamers, or immerse yourslevs in a fun and light game , and prompt you to dig for obscure parts of lore across the game.-Cedric "

												The game has such a great concept, directly inspired from greek mythology with its own little twist. The Gods of Olympus has turned their back from you, the hero Nikandros, leaving humanity to die drowning in rubble and blood. Queen Hera plans to overthrow her husband, Zeus, but in order to do that, she needs your power.And just like that, you are thrown into the gigantic arena that is Olympus to hust down, slay, and defeat every god that stands in your way, each god you kill, the more power you gain so you can even rival the mighty Zeus.The game has a very unique fighting system that doesn't make the game too difficult, but very attractive and engaging, like Aphrodite.The art of Apotheon is very original and different from any other greek mythology based game. It resembles the color schenes and the figures portrayed on ancient greek pottery. It is very appealing to see these stationary orange and black figures come to life from their painted forms.The music is very engaging and ""godlike."" (See what I did there?) It helps make the boss battles more intense so that the bosses seem mostrous and terifying.8/10 I am just playing all of the games I bought but never played for years.			"

Ancient Greek art style is actually absolutely genious idea for 2D game. I cannot imagine any better way to express the Antiquity atmospehere and ""Apotheon"" externalizes it at very best. It was easy to get used to picture and controls and now I enjoy every minute playing it. Apotheon's atmosphere is unique: every authentical detail and beautiful music gives pleasure for both eyes and ears  (I also strongly recommend the OST for those who likes antiquity theme).			"

												As a whole, the ""Greek Gods"" and ""God vs. Man"" genre of video games is overdone. But this game stands alone. In a new class of 2D combat, Apotheon is a masterpeice. With a unique art style based upon Ancient Greek pottery, this game appears to have a clunky combat system, unworthy of a multiplayer. In actuality, it has a smooth movement system and precise controls that only adds to the playability and competitive nature. All in all. I was impressed. 9.5/10			"

												I don't really these 'reviews' that much, but I really felt like doing an exception for this masterpiece.To start with I have to mention the graphics of this game. Even though it's only a 2D platform game the graphics themselves are absolutely perfect. Done in a style of ancient greek paintings and mozaiques it unbelieveably matches the whole atmosphere of the game and is a pleasure to watch. Also each and every place you visit has a different atmosphere, from welcoming Agora of the Olympus, to hostile swamps under Artemis' realm, it really spices the game up and makes you feel you are still about to discover more and more unique locations, it never makes you bored.Another jewel of this game is the outstanding soundtrack composed by greek composer Marios Aristopoulos <3 . For each part of the Olympus (at which you operate in this game), or other destinations there is a different theme music which fits the nature of the place perfectly. When playing in the Hades' realm of the Underworld I was actually pretty scared solely because of the song playing in there.The story itself is very interesting as well and I really liked the differences between each of the numerous bosses appearing throughout the game as well as the unique ways of defeating them, every single one of them had a different approach and developers of this game really took everything they could and used every opportunity the 2D platform RPG game offered.For me as a lover of greek mythology this game earned it's place in my heart and I would really like to thank the developers for creating this game (not game a masterpiece within games!) and it pleases me that even in these times, some people are still passionate enough to make a game about the awesome greek mythology!I highly recommend Apotheon to everyone, this piece of art will just suck you in and won't let you out until you finish it and maybe not even then.That's it, thanks to the ones reading it this far and I hope that one day the 'gods in making games' at Alientrap will bring us something even more awesome than this, even though trumphing Apotheon will be an extremely hard task. :))			"

												I was instantly drawn to this game,  more than a year before it released, when I saw its art style, and the combat looked right up my alley as well.  I can say with certainty that it was worth the wait.Combat is timing-based, and depending on what weapon you're using timing will change, as will the damage per swing.  Some enemies may be fast enough that certain types of weapons won't land a hit, so you'd better be able to think on your feet.  As for weapons, there are a LOT of them, with decent variety in playstyle.  There is also a crafting system for health items, fire jars, temporary speed, and other such powerups, giving you good reason to seek out all the little pick-up-ables that can be found amoungst pots, jars, and crates.The world is *large*, open, and PACKED with locked doors and little dungeons.  Definitely in the ""Metroid-vania"" genre.  As a completionist, I'm wondering how in the world I'll finish this game, with those tantalizing little ""X-out-of-Z chests unlocked"" indicators teasing me - so many locked doors to remember to open.The hub world is interesting, having a group of ""police"" that you'll need to avoid whilst you lock-pick into merchant's houses in search of loot, or try to take that tempting little statue.  You'll want to run and hide until your alert meter cools off if you're seen being a trouble maker, lest you be first warned with a fine of 20 gold, then straight up executed if you're caught again not long after.Boss fights are satisfying, music is fitting, story is fun.  Fair disclaimer though, I'm not finished yet, so I can't say if I like the ending.If I have one complaint about the game itself, it might be that the voice acting is perhaps the only thing not fully fitting with the style (it's not BAD, it's just not as ""Greek"" feeling as the rest of the game is), as it might be more enjoyable to just have text bubbles and imagine the voices.  Still, the speaking is good for the lazy who prefer not to read.The other complaint I have, though not down to the game itself, and more about the programming, is that this game seems to be a bit more intensive than it should be, and feels just a bit laggy, despite being a 2D platformer type of game.  Perhaps it wouldn't be an issue if I weren't playing on an iMac, but Bioshock Infinite didn't complain too badly.Overall, this game is a solid 9/10 for me; certainly one of the best 2D games I've ever played.++++++++++++++++++++Edit: I'm about halfway through the game now at 23 hours in.   I'm going pretty completionist, so I'm getting all the chests and such.  I have to say, the sheer number of weapons, items, powerups, etc is nuts.  Boss fights have been very fun, particularly Artimis.  The voice acting bothers me less now, seems to be the case that a few early voices just sounded weird to me.Really looking forward to seeing how the endgame plays out.  Game is still a solid 9/10.++++++++++++++++++++Game is complete, 100%, all achievements, guards kneel and weep before me, etc, etc.  Game is ok, 1/10Pfft.  9/10.  Almost leaning 8/10 for the all the lag I got playing a 2D game, even on an imac, but I really can't fault the whole game for a bit of optimization problems.  Only real complaint I have looking back is that you end up with 1,000 weapons, but you really only want to use like 4 of them, and the rest start to feel like fluff.			"

												So where to begin with this game.Well---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pros:+Great story, especially to those greek mythos lovers out there, such as myself. Makes you fan out to fight the Gods of Olympus.+Fun and creative gameplay.+Survivial (in a way), you pick up items on you're way, can buy items in stores, can trade items, but from as far as I can see, there is no selling weps or supplies.+Fun as hell bosses, and each boss sticks to a theme.+Some of the missions are hard as hell, but have great pay offs at the end.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mixed:~Music is pretty basic.~There is in fact voice acting for the text. But it varies, if anything, I hate how movie, tv shows, and video games do this stupid thing where they make everyone have a british accent. If I am playing a game about acient greek history, I would like thecorrect accent. It also switches off for some characters, going from british, to scotish, to an american accent.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons:-I am sure I am not the only one who has said this.BUT GOOD LORD THIS GAME'S STORY IS ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE ""GOD OF WAR"".You are a mortal who has been left for dead by Zeus, you aint gonna take that♥♥♥♥♥♥and go and hunt him down. Of course Zeus'sfollowers arent to happy so you have to kill them too.Good lord its like they took ""God of war's"" story and shoved it into one.Not to say ""God of war"" has a bad story, but there could be some more creativity into the story in ""Apotheon"".- Some of the game gets crazy, and pure unfair.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------So in conclusionIs this game bad? Hell no, it has its flaws but in the end the game is a great buy.My Rating: 7.5/10 "

												Apotheon is an action platformer with rpg elements that you will find much more complex and demanding that it may first appear. However, as you pass the first stage of the game, which is learning the mechanics and geting used to the controls, the game becomes surprisingly interesting and rewarding. The story takes place in ancient Greece where the mortal world is abandoned by the gods of Olympus. The gods no longer have a use for humans and since they are also merciless and cruel, they are punishing them. You are a warrior named Nikandreos who seeks to prevend the destruction of your home and people. You meet various gods that help you or try to hurt you and other lessergods or heroes of the rich greek mythology. If you have studied greek mythology then many of the substories will be familiar to you.The presentation is a strong point of this game. A unique art style which is based on the ancient greek mythology and the result is very pleasant to the eye. The music and sound of the game is very good as well. No memorable tracks in general but it all comes together nicely, visuals and sound, it doesn't tire you at all.Gameplay wise Apotheon is an action scroller but it has some rpg elements like weapon and armor management, skill enhancement, a market etc.. but the fighting and the rpg stuff is very well balanced. Playing the game on higher difficulty is in my opinion demanded in order to appreciate the rpg side of the game, otherwise it feels just like an brainless action slasher. As for the negatives, the difference between normal level of difficulty and the higher ones can be frustrating and the controls can be very punishing. The battle sometimes gets glitchy and some key parts of the game can be abused and get passed taking advantage of the controls. Also in some parts of the game I spend a lot of time backtracking which is very annoying in these types of games since you are expecting to play a straightforward action game. All in all, despite being frustrating at some parts, Apotheon was a pleasant surprise. A cool theme- greek mythology, a slick presentation, nice sound, a balanced set of gameplay mechanics, moderate puzzle solving and a nice level design. I got to say that 2-3 levels as you get to the end of the game have very cool ideas and are really unique. The Athena one, the Poseidon, and a couple of others were great. Definitely looking forward to Apotheon 2.			"

												Possibly the most uniquely stylish Metroidvania ever. And even once you get used to that (it's visually brilliant all the way through, just look at those images up at the top of the page there), it's a very solid game - some fairly complex combat with an impressive variety of weapons and potions, all while working your way through the diverse lairs of the gods, with plenty of secrets to uncover.The story makes excellent use of its mythological roots, and many areas even include markers with relevant excerpts. It's really an impressive game all around - the only things I can even think to point out that weren't excellent were that it can be slightly awkward to switch what you have equipped midcombat (switching from melee to ranged to potions is fine, but switching from one ranged to another requires actually opening your inventory, which is slightly inconvenient with a WASD/mouse control setup) and that I managed to glitch outside of a certain giant spinning level by saving in a weird spot (the autosave was kind enough to rescue me).In short, if you've ever read Greek mythology and thought ""those gods are a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, someone needs to take them down a peg"", or if you just want a nice Metroidvania with some seriously snazzy aesthetics, get Apotheon and you'll have a godly time.

												first off, ragdoll physics 1000/10Pros-The campaign is long-Full of ancient greek mythology that makes the story somewhat interesting-Artwork is amazing, captures the game well-Music fits the time period and theme-Many side quests/objectives that can keep you busy even longer if you want-Fighting is pretty simple, but fun-Mechanics of weapons force you to diversify your fighting methods-Maps are big-Each god is somewhat different from each other, and has its own weakness and strength -Large array of weapons-Epic-Price is worth the gameCons-The fighting can get kind button mashy, especially when you have multiple enemies on you at once-Fighting can get repetitive-I feel like i advanced too fast for the gameplay, only 3 hours in I pretty much had the best armor in the game, and just tanked through the rest of the game-the rewards from defeating bosses felt too weak, and pretty much useless in the overall scheme of thingsConclusion-The pros of the game outweigh the cons by a landslide, and i definitely recommend you buying it			"

												What brought me to the game were it's unique visuals, what made me stay was the gameplay.I really missed good platformer games and it's one of the first ones I decided to buy on Steam and I definitely wasn't disapointed. It's a pretty standard platformer with polished gameplay and quite fun combat that's skill-dependent and not based on mashing buttons without coherence. The story is nothing special but it's not bad either. Overall a decent game that brought me quite a few hours of fun.			"

												If you want a short review:Graphics: Georgeous, very successfuly represent the stories etched on ancient Greek vases, as far as the artistic side is concernedSoundtrack: Gets you in the mood right of the bat. Extremely well composed and suited to the atmosphere of the game. Just like in Hotline Miami, the music makes of a very important factor in this game.Story: The story itself isn't really jawdropping, but features very well designed gods, both in terms of their appearance and character.Combat: The controls might be a bit unintuitive at the beginning, but you will get used to them quite quickly. Although relatively simple, the combat really has a high skill cap, especially on higher difficulty levels.Difficulty: Very difficult, especially on Champion and Olympian levels. The difference between Warrior and Champion is pretty huge, but unfortunately enough for the fans of extreme challenge, the only difference between Champion and Olympian is the lack of health regeneration. Still, the bosses can be really painful and will often require preemptive strategy and tactics to beat them.Overall: 9/10.Although I wouldn't place this game in the pantheon (hue) of the greatest indie games of all time (ex. FTL, Binding of Isaac, Risk of Rain, Shovel Knight), it is still a must buy for any person who likes platforming, the interesting graphics and difficult combat.PS.Use hatchets for maximum manliness.

												9/10Basically, you kill stuff to get their loot, then you upgrade and kill more stuff, but this time, with better weapons! :DThe physics of the game is pretty good, and I haven't encountered any bugs, so that's sorted. The whole game is steeped in Greek myth, as you would know if you watched the trailer, and I can see the amount of effort the devs put into this game. Art work is beautiful and I was never once bored with this game.As for replayability, I'd say it's okay. I would play it again in a bit because it's just that good, albeit in a harder mode. Multiplayer has been set up too so you can now spear your friends to death. My only regret is getting this game on sale. Yes, it's that worth it.(It's not a 10/10 yet because they need a Multiplayer campaign.)			"

												A visually captivating 2D platform game with great theming and simple mechanics in which a smart artistic concept creates a very aesthetic environment for a nice platform experience.The combat system is pretty straight forward, with a simple dodge ability to avoid attacks and a stamina bar limiting your moves. The angle and momentum of your attacks are important if you want to take down your enemies efficiently. The game also offers a plethora of melee and ranged weapons to use according to occation or to your liking.Story wise  its the same old scenario where a man goes against the gods of Olympus, nothing we haven't already seen in other games, namely God of War, or in movies. Level design is generally good and unique which helps to retain players' interest. On the other hand the total game length is rather short.In addition, as in every platform game, there is some puzzle solving, alas not complex enough (or at all) in many cases.As for the art style, a simple glimpse says it all. The use of ancient greek vase artwork for a 2D platform game is not only convinient for this genre but it bonds extremely well with both the theme, story and gameplay. Overall its a very good 2D platformer and certainly its worth its price value, though it needs a little bit more features and content.			"

												This game is really good but I dont wanna do a review. So heres how to make Enchiladas:1 Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.2 In a large frying pan at medium-high heat add a tablespoon of oil. When the oil is shimmering and hot (not quite smoking), add a corn tortilla to the pan. Cook it for 2-3 seconds, use a metal spatula to turn it over, and cook it for 2 to 3 seconds more. Lift up the tortilla with a spatula, add another tortilla underneath. Cook the second tortilla for 2-3 seconds, lift both tortillas, and add another tortilla underneath. Repeat the process with all the tortillas, adding more oil as needed. This way you can brown and soften the tortillas without using a lot of fat. It's important to pre-cook the tortillas because not only does cooking them help soften them for rolling, cooking them in a little fat helps develop the flavor of the tortillas. As the tortillas brown a little, remove them to a plate.3 Heat olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 5-6 minutes, until translucent. Add the garlic and cook for a minute more. Add the crushed tomatoes. Add the green chiles. Add 1/2 cup of water. Add the oregano. Bring to a simmer and taste. If the sauce tastes too vinegary, add half a teaspoon of sugar to the sauce. Remove from heat.3 Put a little olive oil on the bottom of a 3-quart casserole pan. Take a tortilla, cover 2/3 of it lightly with the shredded cheese, then roll up the tortilla and place it in the casserole pan. Continue until all tortillas are filled and rolled.4 Add sauce to the top of the tortillas in the the casserole pan. Make sure the rolled up tortillas are covered with the sauce. If not, add a little water to thin the sauce to spread it more evenly over the tortillas. Cover the whole thing with the rest of the grated cheese. Put the casserole in the oven for 10-15 minutes or until the cheese melts.Serve with sliced iceberg lettuce that has been dressed only with vinegar and salt. Garnish enchiladas with cilantro and sour cream.Here is the full wiki for Enchiladas:Enchiladas originated in Mexico, where the practice of rolling tortillas around other food dates back at least to Maya times. The people living in the lake region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate corn tortillas folded or rolled around small fish. Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, Bernal Díaz del Castillo documented a feast enjoyed by Europeans hosted by Hernán Cortés in Coyoacán, which included foods served in corn tortillas. (Note that the native Nahuatl name for the flat corn bread used was tlaxcalli; the Spanish give it the name tortilla.) The Nahuatl word for enchilada is chīllapītzalli  which is formed of the Nahuatl word for ""chili"", and the Nahuatl word for ""flute"". In the 19th century, as Mexican cuisine was being memorialized, enchiladas were mentioned in the first Mexican cookbook, El cocinero mexicano (""The Mexican Chef""), published in 1831, and in Mariano Galvan Rivera's Diccionario de Cocina, published in 1845. An early mention, in English, is a 1914 recipe found in California Mexican-Spanish Cookbook, by Bertha Haffner Ginger.Varieties - In their original form as Mexican street food, enchiladas were simply corn tortillas dipped in chili sauce and eaten without fillings. There are now many varieties, which are distinguished primarily by their sauces, fillings and, in one instance, by their form. Various adjectives may be used to describe the recipe content or origin, e.g. enchilada tapatia would be a recipe from Jalisco.Varieties include:Enchiladas con chile rojo (with red chile) is a traditional red enchilada sauce, composed of dried red chili peppers soaked and ground into a sauce with other seasonings, Chile Colorado sauce adds a tomato base.Enchiladas con mole, instead of chili sauce, are served with mole, and are also known as enmoladas.Enchiladas placera are Michoacán plaza-style, made with vegetables and poultry.Enchiladas poblanas are soft corn tortillas filled with chicken and poblano peppers, topped with oaxaca cheese.Enchiladas potosinas originate from San Luis Potosi, Mexico and are made with cheese-filled, chili-spiced masa.Enchiladas San Miguel are San Miguel de Allende-style enchiladas flavored with guajillo chilies by searing the flavor into the tortillas in a frying pan.A plate of enchiladas suizas.Enchiladas suizas (Swiss-style) are topped with a white, milk or cream-based sauce, such as béchamel. This appellation is derived from Swiss immigrants to Mexico who established dairies to produce cream and cheese.Enfrijoladas are topped with refried beans rather than chili sauce; their name come from frijol, meaning ""bean"".Entomatadas are made with tomato sauce instead of chile sauce.Enchiladas montadas, stacked enchiladas, are a New Mexico variation in which corn tortillas are fried flat until softened but not tough, then stacked with red or green sauce, chopped onion and shredded cheese between the layers and on top of the stack. Ground beef or chicken can be added to the filling, but meat is not traditional. The stack is often topped (montada) with a fried egg. Shredded lettuce and sliced black olives may be added as a garnish.ur welcum now bye			"

												Apotheon is a fun, 2-D action game, with a few bugbears in the works, but nothing that stops it from being a wonderful experience.The game is (if you couldn't tell) based on greek myth. The short version of the plot is that zeus is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at mortals and wants to wipe the planet of them, hera (his wife and sister, yes, greek myth is ♥♥♥♥ed up like that) doesn't like the♥♥♥♥♥♥he is pulling and decides to make you her champion. From there you go around God of War style and murder most of the greek gods, some of them help you, but most want your head on a pike.The gameplay is rather simple, yet effective and varied enough to keep it from getting boring. You have two sections of weapons, melee and ranged, during the course of the game you'll pick up many different weapons and can scroll through them all with a flick of the mouse wheel mid combat to get just the right tool for the job. Anything from knives to hammers that cause the ground to explode are on offer, hell, even some arrows that turn enemies into allies later on to. You also get a shield with which to stop the enemies from turning you into crumbled red feta cheese. Everything has durability and will eventually break, meaning you constantly need to swap out weapons and your shield (which you can only carry one of) in order to survive in combat, this forces you to change your play style on the fly, which can be a bit difficult, but once you get it down your fine. Normally you can pick up weapons from more or less everywhere, same with shields, but they are just sparse enough to make you keep swapping them out.Actual fighting is a little messy, since its all on a 2-D plane and normally its you VS three or four dudes at a time, all of which can attack as quickly as you. When you use the shield you create a barrier in the direction your arrow is facing, and anything that hits it is blocked, but this costs durability. Some shields offer bigger barriers than others, meaning it is possible to crack someone over the head with a hammer even if they are defending. The AI in this game is pretty good, as they will block if they have the time and will dodge attacks unless your quick and aim well. Its not so hard that its impossible, just that it requires good amount of concentration.Visually, the game is very unique, its designed to look like the side of those greek vases, and it is pulled off really nicely. The soundtrack is also a rather lovely bit of work, you don't notice it much, but when you do its nicely themed and well composed.The game also drops alot of greek mythology lore on you from start to finish, both in the form of actual levels and tablets that are scattered about. Its interesting to see how they use some of the tales, oh, and before you ask, yes, you do fight a chimera.Its not the kind of game you'd use to teach people about greek mythology, but it is a game that you can play if your looking for a 2-D, budget God of War, or if your looking for a truly unique and overall satisfying experience in the form of a greek Metroidvania game.

SummaryApotheon is a side-scrolling action platformer with a unique and interesting art style. It's a solid ~10 hour game that gets a bit repetitive towards the end.In detailThe art style is what got me curious about the game and eventually to try it out. The story is pretty much what you'd expect from a tale involving an ancient Greek mythology setting: Nothing special, but keeps you working towards a clear goal and has a satisfying conclusion. The progression is fairly linear, though in some sections you can choose the order you want to complete the objectives and there are some optional ones as well.The gameplay consists mainly of you fighting your way towards the current objective using a variety of different melee and ranged weapons. Combat takes a while to get used to as you're generally better off dodging or blocking first and delay attacking until there's an opportunity to do so. Some twists are thrown into the combat formula mix later, like the possibility of placing or using environmental traps or flinging large boulders at enemies. Movement and combat controls feel fluent for a controller, but I can't say how it would play out using a mouse and keyboard.Some sections contain minor puzzle elements and require something a bit different than just travelling from point A to B. I wouldn't exactly call this a ""metroidvania"" -game though despite being tagged as such. To me that term implies that there is and exploration element and backtracking involved i.e. that there are (optional) power ups that allow you to access parts of the game that you can't when you first encounter them. Now there are some secret areas and things to discover here and there, but they're not gated behind the powers you unlock while progressing through the main story.I had to give up on my completionist habit quickly as there's just an overabundance of breakable things and chests to loot and they rarely contain anything useful. That leads to the biggest issue I had with the game: The loot, crafting and the light RPG elements felt a bit tacked on. You can purchase better armor and attack training for various weapon types, but I didn't notice the effects of the upgrades in my ability to survive in combat. The crafting options are quite limited and I was mostly crafting health potions and bombs to blow up cracked walls.All the weapons and shields, even the special ones, also have a duration and they wear down when used in combat. That made the special weapons feel more like consumable resources rather than actual difference making equipment upgrades and I think that also took away some of the strategy in combats. There are some weapon specific combat mechanics, such as you can destroy enemy shields with hammer weapons, have longer range with spears etc. but I just didn't bother since everything just breaks eventually. I frequently found myself just using whatever I had in my hand at the time until it broke down and a new weapon popped up from the inventory. As final, shorter side notes: Music and sound effects did their job, but nothing apart from the (occasionally over-)dramatic voice acting stood out for me. The game also crashed on me once and unfortunately it happened when I tried to save, so the save file got corrupted. Luckily the game auto saves so I could pick up from the latest of those without losing too much progress.RecommendationI was expecting an exploration-focused, Zelda II-esque game where you wander around, talk to people in towns, accept side quests, buy stuff etc. but unfortunately it didn't turn out to be exactly like that. Although I was slightly disappointed with some aspects of the game and the gameplay not having much variety, it might be worth checking out even if just for the neat visual style.			"

												Side scrolling metroidvania type game. Wonderful graphics and music. Fun physics based combat. LOTS of weapons to use. Potion and item crafting. Kind of an RPG but there's no character leveling. Honestly, this game has a lot more content and variety of weapons than I was originally expecting. This game has exceeded my expectations and for the price, it's a winner.			"

												This game gets an A+ on Presentation!  It's beautiful and stylish in a remarkable way.  That's what kept me going for a while...  but I just couldn't learn to love the combat controls.  There are lots of different weapons, each with their own unique timing and effective range.  But mastering combat with moving targets and multiple enemies is ridiculous, and in spite of my best efforts, I always had to resort to button mashing.  It's not fun.  Button mashing works because there are lots of health potions, and your health regenerates after fights anyway, so you can just tank damage.  I never felt like I actually succeeded because of my skill.			"

More in the, ""If the controls didn't suck I may be having fun"" kind of way. If you like trying to jump somehwere over and over again or randomly button masshing trying to hit your target, then this game is for you. Seriously, I was excited for this and kept on playing, but it just made me miserable everytime I tried to jump somewhere or hit something.			"

												There's not much that is more pleasing than to throw a huge javelin from 40ft cutting clean through the throat of your enemy (gandalfvoice), justiceboner, am I right?But for reals, Apotheon is an immensely atmospheric greek mythology platformer, impressively developed by Alientrap.Not only does the gameplay feel pleasing and rewarding throughout the whole runthrough, but there's A LOT (I tell you, A LOT) of research done on greek mythology, it's a good arena for learning and easy for nerds to appreciate.Two criterias of which you need to scratch of one to make this an obligatory purchase:1 - Greek Mythology Enthusiast - I mean come on, you can't resist this.2 - Action role-playing platformer fan - very well executed, how you want them all to feel.Also: credz to the composer Marios Aristopolous for tremendously fitting theme-music in extraordinary detail - he really hit the target on this one. (Not that many video game themes I can listen to when not actually playing them). 5/7			"

												If you enjoyed NES ""Battle of Olympus"", ""Legend of Zelda: The adventures of Link"" or ""Metroid"", you will enjoy the hell out of Apotheon. This gives you that old school platform feel with a fresh style and fun mechanics.It will be worth your dollars to give it a try and Apotheon will repay you with hours of enjoyment.A few things i recommend you do.-Turn on the subtitles, I feel it adds to the games design and flows well with the voice acting.-The control combat is not your typical “Stick-Jock” style, there is a depth of strategy to the to the attacks that may take some getting used to. I personally had no issues with the controls on a game pad and it lead to some interest attack and shield defense moves.As far as the game goes. -Great Greek filled mythological story. -Great soundtrack (DLC, well worth adding on).-Full Voice acting is superb.-Beautiful level areas along with secret locations held within.-Fun and interesting combat system with both mythological weapons.-The ability to improve your hero’s Armor and Weapon proficiencies.-Simple and nice inventory/crafting system. -Adjustable Level Difficulty settings.-Complete gamepad mapping.-Multi-player Local (Have not attempted this yet).-Co-Op (coming soon).It will nice to see if there will be any add-ons in the future to continue the story of Apotheon.Having been playing games in all genera’s since my first commodore 16, there have been moments over the past few years that I was looking for something enjoyable and not bloated with all that “Look at all the things our game offers” and then to find out most of those things are broken or just weigh the overall experience down. Apotheon is a beautiful game that offers just the right amount of everything to make entertaining and continues bringing back for longer play sessions. It has been a long time since I played a game with such enjoyment or even looked forward to playing as much as I do with Apotheon.The only thing I would like to see in the future is an equipable inventory system for a DLC continuation of Apotheon story.Thank you Apotheon Team.

												Apotheon is one of these games that mixes defining characteristics from different genres and comes up with a great final experience for the player. First thing you will notice is the graphics. Apotheon uses the distinct ancient Greek pottery art style to portray ancient Greece and it works excellently. The world is unfolding before you as if you were looking at a genuine ancient Greek vase and with the brilliant use of lighting effects Apotheon leaves an impression like no other game. Exploration is also a big part of Apotheon. Level and world design are very thoughtful and immersive with a good variety of landscapes, from the lush forest of Artemis where you can hunt game, to the dark, spine-chilling Underwolrd where lost souls crave for your warm blood, the game delivers a fantastic world to discover. There are plenty of mini-quests and hidden areas along the way to keep you sidetracked and like any respectable RPG, you can enter houses, break vases, steal goods, collect unique weapons, craft consumables and although weapons break, you will always find some new toy to play with.Second, the game mechanics. Movement is done like any other platform game, you can jump, roll behind enemies, grab on edges and more, while combat is similar to Mount & Blade's. You aim/attack with the mouse and you can change the direction of your attacks by moving the mouse up or down. Also the speed of your character and his position affect the damage done, so gaining momentum before an attack, or hiding behind your shield play a big part in combat. The combat itself feels very precise and fluid with enough weapon variety to make it satisfying. Breaking shields with a big mace, outmaneuvering them with a long spear, rolling behind them and stabbing them in the back with a sword, pinning them down with a bow or even summoning various creatures to aid you in battle. And although every weapon in the game has it's uses, you can focus on playing with the ones you like and enjoy the most.Personaly I've never played a game that represents the iconic Hoplite better, so if you crave for some spear & hoplon action, you won't find it elsewhere. Lastly, I would also like to note the ability to customize how your character looks, something that most games seem to ignore but in my opinion is very important in every game that utilizes armors.Apotheon has become one of my favourite games of all time and I've been playing pc games since the age that Lost Vikings came out.To sum it up:-Enjoyable and dramatic story.-Unique and impressive art style.-Brilliant level/world design and compelling exploration.-Satisfying Combat, good variety of weapons.-Fair price for what the game delivers.

												Ancient Greece is, honestly, kinda overdone mythology-wise; perhaps thence the appeal of works such as American Gods or Never Alone. Yet Apotheon manages to build a fairly fun metroidvania deicide adventure off a stylized approach to such well-trod ground. The controls are not perhaps as good as they could be, but I am bad at videogames so this is a common complaint for me. Punching people through doors results in satisfying gouts of blood and this is probably the most ithyphallic T-rated game I've ever played.			"

												Metroidvania-style game with a distinct artstyle based on ancient Greek paintings and ceramics. You play as a human who is tasked with taking down various gods after they decide that humanity is not worthy of existing, and climb Mount Olympus to meet and battle Zeus. There is a surprising amount of depth in the various weapons you can equip and potions/projectiles you can use, which help you to explore the various dungeons and fight the multiple entities trying to stop you in your tracks. The artstyle is probably the best feature of the game, although the soundtrack grants a specific atmosphere which helps to immerse you in the mythology of the subject matter. This is a great title if you're looking for an action-adventure game that is a little different than usual.			"

												I'll list out the positives and negatives:+ Spectacular presentation, both in video and audio department. This is one damn pretty game.+ It's highly literate in Greek mythology. This isn't some cheap cash-in with a skin deep mythology paint on it.+ The length is just right. I finished it at around 10 hours.+  There are tons of weapons you can choose from and master, each with a different use, speed and reach.+ The controversial battle system is actually pretty awesome once you stick with it and master it. I'd recommend using a controller and having both thumbs on the analog sticks for most of the game.- The controls are too convoluted. Changing from a sword to bow or a potion is too messy because there are so many stuff in your inventory and when you're in the middle of a big fight, there's a high chance you'll select/use something you didn't want to.- There's no point in fighting the enemies unless the game requires you to. You don't gain any XP or anything and since your weapons break more often than I personally prefer, I would usually try to avoid fights in the hub areas.- the returning disc weapon is buggy. Sometimes when I changed to it, two of them would hover around my character and I couldn't attack or change weapons. I had to quit the game and restart from my saves.All in all, this is a high quality game and a very intricately designed piece of art and experience in itself. You can definitely come out of this game with loads of more general information on Greek mythology. That ending definitely made me think and that's something I can't say about most games. Despite the VERY minor glitches, If you can stick with the fighting mechanics and like action/adventure/RPG style gameplay with amazing presentation and art direction, you definitely can't go wrong with Apotheon.Thumbs way up!

Until you hit a critical bug and you cannot continue.Happened to me and several other people.The game is nice, but the the people behind this are not trustworthy, so i will never buy a game from them again. Not only because of a critical and acknowledged bug that they plainly ignore for YEARS. (see herehttp://steamcommunity.com/app/208750/discussions/1/523890681419953528/  ). NO response from the developers. which is a common pattern with the Alientrap studio:this studio lies to their customers. they were in development but already accepted your money. they promised a SINGLE PLAYER PC game. they had a published release date. then that date went past and NO response, NO sign, NO post. then after a FEW MONTHS they publish that apotheon will be coming to consoles and that they are working on that. all the guys that had already supported them and had waited for their finished PC game? well, too bad for them! they also announced that they are working on multiplayer at some point. was that what the people who initially supported them had wanted? no. they actually wanted a single player pc game. well too bad for them. finally the game got released. i play it, i guess like many others too.then suddenly i cannot continue because i run into a bug, apparently like many others too.(see => http://steamcommunity.com/app/208750/discussions/1/523890681419953528/ )well, too bad for us!i am through with you Alientrap. The game is great. As long as it works. Never again. I can apologize bugs. I even could apologize if I get a ""WontFix"" answer. But getting nothing at all for such a long time is not an acceptable nor a professional way to deal with your customers.therefore, consider well before buying "

												Solid 2D platformer with a Greek theme.  The art style is top notch, but at times the combat hit detection can get wonky because of the various weapon lengths.

 A short, gorgeous and wonderfully enjoyable action-adventure romp Apotheon is a damn fun action game and a damn fun exploration game all mixed up with an extremely accurate depiction of Greek Mythology and one of the most damn gorgeous art styles you'll likely ever see in a video game, though it is not without it's short-comings in a few areas. Gameplay The gameplay of Apotheon is primarily split between two elements: Combat and Exploration. The areas of Mount Olympus are fairly large and have a lot to see and do in them, as well as a lot to murder in them. First off, the combat. The player wields a variety of ancient weaponry that you can stab, slash and throw; as well as wielding a few other fun toys such as ancient Greek molotovs and grenades for some reason (it's not as out of place as it might sound). Combat is a simple matter of rolling, attacking and blocking, but it's simplicity is it's strength. I will never forget the moment I set a man on fire and then harpooned him into orbit with one of my spears as he fell of a ledge. The combat is very much a sandbox and can be approached in whatever way the player chooses and as such is extremely enjoyable at times, though not without it's frustrations. The smaller more common enemies tend to dodge a lot making landing melee hits quite frustrating at times though it's not a huge problem. The other half of the gameplay is exploration, running around the various hubs collecting things, looting, questing, etcetera. This is great fun for the most part and everywhere has somethign to find, though it has more frustrations than the combat portion of the game. The games ""quests"" aren't tracked and you aren't given any indication of where you need to be for anything other than the main story, which means finding things can be a pain and is heavily reliant on your memory of the levels, though clearing out the various hubs is an extremely rewarding experience. Boss fights are the biggest Strength and weakness of Apotheon. Certain fights, such as the fights against Zeus and Poseidon are incredibly enjoyable and present something new to the player, though other fights, namely Ares, can play out just like any other combat encounter in the game and let the player down after the huge build up to them; though I must say the variety in the level designs for each God's domain is amazing, and the objectives required to reach them never leave the player bored, e.g. Kill a variety of Greek mythological figures, storm a castle with a group of undead minions, traverse the seas to defeat Poseidon. All in all, Apotheon is just a brilliantly enjoyable game. Story Apotheon's story is nothing special, but the way it's presented is sure to please those with an interest in Greek mythology. You play as Nikandreos, champion to Hera, ascending the slopes of Mount Olympus to challenge the gods that have abandoned your people, taking their power via either their allegiance or their death. Ultimately, it's a fairly generic story, though the presentation of the various mythological figures is spot-on throughout making it fairly compelling if you are interested in that sort of thing. There's nothing inherently bad about the story, and it's certainly accurate, but it wasn't anything special. Sound Design The sound design is good overall. Nothing great, nothing bad. Weapons sound as you'd expect and are fairly enjoyable to use as such. Every single sound the player makes is fine, although environmental sounds are lacking. Enemies and NPCs seem to make almost no sound whatsoever outside of speech and combat, which whilst not entirely bad is a little strange. The voice-acting is passable. Whilst it's not awful, it's also not that great. The dialogue did not engage me at any point (not due to the writing, that's fine, it's due to the voiceover) but it also never bored me to sleep. Rising above the complete averageness of the sounds and voices though is the music, which whilst not always noticeable is fantastic and definitely adds to the mood of the game, especially during some of the more climactic moments such as the climb to fight Zeus. Conclusion In Conclusion, whilst being flawed in many ways and having it's fair share of frustrations, Apotheon offers what I consider to be an extremely compelling and entertaining semi-metroidvania experience that constantly presents the player with something new and interesting to do. If you can ignore the relatively minor flaws that this game has there is an absolutely superb experience to be had.			"

Apotheon is a superb and addictive fast-paced 2D action adventure set in Ancient Greek Mythology. The Gods have abandoned  Olympus, leaving you to perish without their benevolence. It's upto you to discover their powers and take up arms against them to ensure mankind’s survival!  - Highly Recommended!			"

Graphic style is pretty nice and great to look at. The methalogy and the lore will lure in all history lovers.Gameplay is fun and engaging, decent combat with lots of weapons to choose from.Great Game...it's God of War 2D..what more can I say.			"

rating: worth buying at sale price (<8€)score: 6/10 - solidsimilar games: Disney´s Hercules Action Game, Rogue Legacy, Dark Soulstarget audience: fans of greek mythology, metroidvania (this is not a metroidvania though), explorationApotheon is a beautiful game. There were parts I really liked this game, but there were also parts where the game was ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. It has some really cool ideas, but the devs also made some bad design decisions. Still, its worth a play, especially because of its satisfying ending and even for its full price you cant do much wrong, but I recommend waiting for a sale. GameplayMy biggest problem with Apotheon was that it wasnt a challenging game. The problem is not that the combat is too easy, but there are some features which breaks the challenge. First the fact that you can have healing items in your inventory is a bad design decision in my opinion (for this game) and even worse is that you can craft healing items. Even if you play bad, you can just keep healing and go. Crafting healing items isnt even that hard and also you will find tons of healing items on the way. Until half of the game I always had the maximum amount of healing items in my inventory and later I only had less because I started wasting them since I didnt need to fight efficient anyway. There are some ways you could solve this, I think for this kind of a game a health system like Dark Souls would be best. You get a set amount of potions and can only refill them at checkpoints. This way the devs always know how much potions the player has and can balance that part of the level accordingly.Another thing which breaks the challenge is that dieing in this game is meaningless, you just respawn and can continue. I didnt really understand how it works, cause sometimes everything was the way it was before after respawn, sometimes everything reset, maybe it depends if its a boss fight or not, I dont know.The AI sometimes does really random things or makes an extremely fast move or jump which makes them annoying to fight sometimes. The most annoying enemies were the sentrys, because they attack so fast that you cant block an arrow and make a counter attack after that, you HAVE to take a hit (on higher difficulty at least). There are even more annoying when they are at the ceiling and use blast arrows or hydra fangs.Some enemys have really powerful attacks which is fine, but sometimes those attacks launch you 100km away to weird places, also annoying. The inventory system is a mess. Extremely clonky and hard to manage, annoying. At at last there are some O P consumable potions, especially the potion which makes you invulnerable which COMPLETELY breaks the game, they are not even hard to craft its ridiculous. They should take out EVERY consumable item.So whats good about this game? Combat, even if sometimes annoying, is still fun, especially because of the many many different enemy types which I really appreciate. Later in the game when you have many more tools to fight with, combat gets even more fun and sometimes you can pull of crazy moves which will kill many enemys at once which is very satisfying to do.There are many different weapons, which behave different more or less, there are also some rare weapons with special effects. Same goes for shields and bows. You can summon minions, set traps, use bombs, there is alot you can do and whats more important is that you NEED to use different tactics against different kinds of enemys.The devs had some neat ideas for every level, the game has enough variety so you never get bored, unless the game gets too annoying. The boss fights were really fun and some of them really well made, especially the final boss. However the invulnerability potions breaks every fight (fortunately I figured them out really late so I used them only in 2 fights).Overall the gameplay is fun, motivating, satisfying and rewarding because of a nice progression system. All parts of the game are full of annoyances though, for some people more, for others less, so for you this could be a blast to play, or a very frustrating experience. For me the good parts made up the annoying things so I can recommend this game.NarrativeThe narrative of the game is basicly God of War. You are a human, Zeus is bored so he makes orders to destroy humanity or something like that, you want revenge and save your people so you kill every greek god until Zeus. The nice thing is that you probably know about greek mythology, so when you see your next objective which is for example ""kill Ares"", then you already are excited about it before you even meet him. This works because they gave them interesting personalitys, well at the end most of them are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but still they are fun to listen to. They have good voice actors are their writing is fine. There is no real big narrative though, its just something to give the gameplay some context, but thats fine to me, and at least it keeps you motivated throughout the game.Aesthetics/ GraphicsThe game looks beautiful, there is not much to say about its visuals. It can get a bit dull though, some areas of the game have different color palettes which bring some variety. The problem I have with the aesthetics is that sometimes there was too much on the screen and it was hard to tell where my character was standing or were I was aiming, or I didnt identify something as a trap which explodes when you attack it so I accidently made things explode many times.Oh also there are many naked people, including♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥SoundtrackMusic is good. Has enough variety and fits the game and its mood. Not much to say about it really.			"

												I have to say that there are definitely some pro's to the game, the majority of which are in its overall style. However, the game turned out to be a pretty big letdown overall due to the gameplay, as many other people seem to also complain about - and further, the developer seems like they haven't been that helpful with some big issues.I'll lay it out simply. The artistic style was the entire reason I got hooked into playing the game, right when I saw it. And I happen to love Greek mythology as well - or pretty much anything set in or focused around the mythology. I was super excited to play the game, but right off the bat I had a very big problem.The game simply did not load up for me at all. It showed a black screen, then the application closed. Thankfully, some people in the forum had a fix for installing some framework MSI that came with the game, and it worked for me. However, a good amount of people seemed to claim that didn't work for them and that they were just unable to play the game entirely. I've not really seen the developer respond about this problem, which is extremely important considering it's playing the freaking game! That's a big strike right away.There's a thread about the above problem in the Bug Reports sub-forum right now still.However, I followed along as I was still hooked in, and the above fix worked for me in about 5 minutes. Right away in the game, I noticed how bad the controls were. The setting changes don't matter, and mouse/keyboard vs. controller also doesn't really matter. The game has a weird lag in a lot of the motions, and your character doesn't function properly.You move relatively slowly for a bit, until your character can suddenly start sprinting if you're still moving in the same direction - however, the moment you hit any sort of incline at all, even if it's like a 10 degree ramp, your character comes to a complete stop and then starts moving slowly up the incline again. This happens all over the place, so your motion is really bad much of the time. Bringing that into combat, you have tough enemies moving around you while you keep getting stuck or bouncing around in certain corners or places.Also, while it is realistic that a person can't be sprinting and then immediately turn 180 degrees and keep sprinting, they can definitely keep a lot faster speed than your character. The same thing happens as with the little inclines. If you turn around, your character becomes a snail again for a short bit. Such a thing is really bad in battles when the enemies get around you easily.And speaking of battles - some of the characteristics are fine, along with a general collection of weapons. But again, the gameplay is poor in the sense that very often when you swing melee weapons all over the place, you can be too close to the enemies and the weapons just pass through or over them, which does not make much sense in a 2D game. Even spears did this at times - if I am jutting a spear straight ahead, it shouldn't pass through an enemy. Thus, the stamina mechanic was made more of a pain when half the time you lose stamina without being able to hit anything.Another issue is the UI in certain places - particularly in item descriptions and in the shops. The descriptions for some items, if long, will run off the screen even if you are in the max resolution for your PC. But more importantly, once you unlock enough items, you will be unable to buy some of them in the shops. The shops keep the items in a vertical list, and you'll eventually hit a limit where items will run off of the screen and you can't select them. There's even a thread about this right now (""Cloak and Dagger..."" in the General Discussions).In fact, there's a good amount of Bug Reports threads and the developer seems to not really be around much or care.There's more things I could go on about, including a good amount of lag in places too, but I don't want to sit here going on forever. The controls and gameplay overall are some of the biggest critical problems with Apotheon. I tried to give the game my best try and completed it simply because I wanted to witness all of the style, but it is really a pain in many places due to its problems.I can't willingly tell someone else to buy the game because I am sure there are many people who will hate it due to the above implementation issues.

												I really wanted to give this a positive review, the aesthetics look just great and the minimalistic approach does the job, but the combat feels sloppy and poorly programmed. Also the items scattered across the game don't feel well designed, the item fatigue system is tedious and finding different weapons aren't very rewarding because they'll break soon and you'll be back to using clumsy and low damage weapons again. The storyline isn't consistent and you'll miss the main objectives because of this, wandering around pointlessly.			"

												*Unplayable because of controls*I feel like this would've been a truly awesome game if the controls wouldn't be this terrible.In a combat, common behavior of following your target with mouse will make your attack type unpredictable, which also affects timing of the attack.If you don't want player to be able to change stab direction by more than N degrees while charging - that's fine, just perform the stab with the biggest angle change you allow. But *do not change the !@#$ing timing*			"

												This game is AWESOME, if u like platform games, and greek mythology, simply buy this, the combat is quite nice and there is alot of weapons to choose from (Axes, Swords, Javelins, spears, diffrent arrows / bows, and even ""magic weapons""), the controls are quite nice aswell, and simple, like switching between your melee wapons and ranged weapons with a click and a scroll with mouse wheel. There is alot to explore in the game which is quite nice.-You have a nice map of your surroundings aswell as an overall map, with quick travel.-You have diffrent ""swings"" with your equipped weapon (using the left mouse button) which furthermore is diffrent on the weapon u have equipped-You have shield equipped, which u can block with your right mouse button, and quickly switch to alternate offhand gear, like a torch.-And ofc. middle mouse button (if u have that on your mouse) is used to throw weapons, (javelins, spears), and so on.-Being able to pick up your thrown weapons or arrows.But beware, things break, so make sure u loot all u can..Design of the game is really nice, the levels / maps are well done, aswell as the lightning where the torch comes in handy :)Overall i'll give Apotheon a 10/10, its a brilliant game with awesome combat :)			"

Great example of how you can learn through gaming, and while I already knew a lot it prompted me to check out a few things I didn't know about greek mythology.The only bugs I've encountered is that throwing thunderbolts in water makes them float in air (which is hilarious), and a crash bug sometimes on transition, but I never lost any progress because of it.

												Giant Zeus versus Giant Nikanderos battle finale was the highlight of the game. Apotheon's visual environment makes the game appealling for replay value.

												A beautiful and unique indie hack n slash  platformer, theamed in ancient greek times. One of the best 2D stories i have played since Trine, the physics are enjoyable, the music and storyline can make you feel deeply inmersed in this wonderful world, and when facing the most tetric of Mythological beasts, you will be challenged greatly, it will take more than a few lucky swings from your weapon to thrive through to Mount Olympus.

												Great art style and the music fits well. The combat is not Guacamelee style where you just need to memorize the combos and then pound on the bad guys. Apotheon's combat is simplified, not simplistic, so the key is knowing your abilities and the enemy' abilities. It feels like a melee version of Capsized's combat, but since it is melee weapon range is key. You also need to learn to aim attacks to get past an opponent's shield.			"

												I really loved this game; an interest for Greek mythology is certainly a big plus when buying it. If you're a little familiar with the subject you'll see lots of of small details and other nice things to enjoy in this already beautiful game. The environments are all very well designed and everything has its own feel while still staying true to the original art style, that of ancient Greek vases and pots. The combat is something to get used to, but it works. The music is also very athmospheric and really adds to the overall gameplay experience. The story is quite simple but well executed. At times I truly felt like a god amongst men. Just buy it.10/10 would become a god again			"

												I don't normally like side-scrollers, but I really enjoyed this game.I was initially enticed by the look of an ancient Greek amphora come to life, and I was pleased to see the mythological research evident in the story, accompanied by an excellent soundtrack.  The levels have just enough variety to keep them interesting, so that it's not just smacking more Greek dudes with a variety of weapons every time.I'm not sure why some people were unhappy with the combat.  I use keyboard + mouse, and the only problem I had was an occasional inability to hit an enemy because he was standing right on top of me, so that neither facing left or facing right could reach him.  Other than that, I enjoyed the block & attack mechanism that so often resulted in a dramatic *clang* *clang* as I exchanged blows with my foe, each of us using his shield to defend himself.  I also liked the way weapons broke, often forcing me to improvise when I lost the last weapon that was most effective against a particular enemy.The difficulty ramps up pretty evenly, so that you get more abilities at about the same rate as the enemies get stronger.  One thing I really enjoyed became evident in the boss fights.  In most games nowadays, you have about 5 seconds to figure out the strategy to defeat the boss before it kills you with one or two blows.  Every time in this game, when certain weapons were weak or useless against a boss, I had time to react to this and try something else, because I could still take a fair amount of punishment (even from a god).  Other games would do well to emulate this; it's far more exciting to devise a new strategy while in the middle of a fight than it is to do so while sitting on the Load screen.The Good:Oustanding art style capturing the essence of ancient Greek pottery illustrationMusicDepiction of gods and goddesses in accordance with literature of the timeInteresting combat systemHistorlcal weapons (love the sarissa) as well as fantastical onesVaried levels and objectives with some semi-open-world aspects (player choice and optional quests)Treasure hunting for completionistsReasonable autosave (in addition to manual saves)The Bad:Enemies can stand in the same place as you, making them unhittableSeveral crashes when attempting to load levelsCould use a good spell check "

												A brand new Greek epic.  Huge story, brilliant design, outstanding 2D open world to explore.Each level has a unique twist to it that makes it stand out (Hades has enemies that respawn, Zeus' Palace rains lightning down on you, Ares' lair has respawning enemies that fight each other, Poseidon's area is all aquatic with underwater enemies found nowhere else).  Though the game pretty much is made of branching destroy-this-kill-that quests, the ways you have to execute them are all different.  This makes every quest unique, and every area a surprise.Each boss fight is special as well, keenly balanced for just the right amount of challenge without ever becoming frustrating.  The final battle with Zeus is blissfully unfair, requires strategy and thought to win, and never made me ragequit.The story is simple, and in any other context would be cliched, but it's appropriate here.  Overthrowing the gods who decided humanity must be extinguished is grand, epic, and engrossing.  I had to know how it ended, and find out what happens to the people I met along the way.Combat takes some getting used to, and switching weapons or using health and potions during combat leaves you vulnerable.  There's no way to switch to a weapon or potion directly; you have to use the mouse wheel to scroll through your inventory, and that can make it frustrating to use something in the heat of battle.Platforming can be awkward with keyboard and mouse, and I didn't get used to it until the end of the game, but there's really no way around it.  Again, it is challenging, but never frustrating.Apotheon is superbly designed, well-balanced, and a joy to explore.			"

There's better out there, but this is a good and simple one to throw some time into.Note that it has some crashing issues. In one playthrough, four times it crashed to desktop.

												The art style is excellent, the theme is really cool, and there's some nice variety of weapons. That being said, the combat is very clunky. It feels like they wanted a Dark Souls style combat, but it just doesn't work in this game. The aiming with projectiles is especially bad. The map hurts my brain to look at. The game, overall, just feels ""meh"".It's a pretty cool game that obviously appeals to many, but it just didn't pull me in.			"

												Gorgeous. I'm a sucker for pretty games, and Apotheon is an exquisitely pretty game. Pros: It's beautiful. The art style pulls you in and keeps you interested for a long time. There are lots of interesting mini-games, secret areas, unique challenges, and a mostly open map for exploring. Cons: Levels are a smidge too large, and the gameplay is quite long. This means the game risks over-staying its welcome as some of the levels can turn into a grind. Also the controls are clunky and can be intensely frustrating at first. You have to retrain your expectations for scroller controls and you have to use a mouse in order to enjoy the game. Unfortunately, despite being a scroller, this also makes the game almost impossible to play on a steam controller, which was a disappointment. That being said, it is a game that is absolutely worth purchasing and enjoying the presentation of, even if you end up not finishing it. Come for the artwork, stay for the artwork.			"

												Great art style, but I feel like the controls are just too clunky to be satisfying. Combat feels like 'wildly move around while spamming attack or wildly fling your ranged weapon at enemies' because the ranged reticle doesn't match where you shoot/throw. I only made it past the first 3 gods and got super bored with this game. The story doesn't really compel me to find out anything new about the world or care about anything in it (other than not dying). Character progression is also fairly lackluster; not skill or xp based, but how much gold and items you collect on your quests. Great overall idea, but the execution didn't follow through. Pick it up if you like art more than good games, I guess.			"

												Apotheon was a little game that i'd never even known about up until its release. I believe I read a small review about it and shortly after checked out its Steam page. Immediately its art style hooked me as i've always been a fan of Roman and Greek mythology as well as their cultures. I also love the history and combat from the era and when I saw this game was done entirely in Greek mythology art style I decided I was going to go in blind on this game and just buy it there and then. It looked great and it met any expectations I had. It was a bit of a different game than I expected. Its a Metroidvania type game that is similar to a lot of the recent 2D platformers from the current era. Its challenging combat and beautiful art and animations immediately grabbed me and that was just the scratching the surface. As I got into the game I found it had more depth than I expected, varied weapons and items, fun secrets and side missions, great sound and voice acting and just a huge charm which made it feel so unique even though there are so many other Metroidvania games out there. Everything in the visuals department sets Apotheon apart from other games and its amazing animation quality plays into the combat and gives it a very, very deliberate and visceral feel. They really did an amazing job on it and it stood out to me through my entire experience. Its a combat system that is a bit finnicky at first, is so satisfying once accustomed to and difficult to master. The combat I really feel makes this game worth playing and truly was handled perfectly to match the style of this game. Apotheon also controls fantastically, again it took a bit of getting used to because the game is animation heavy but once you get used to it the feeling of momentum from running and jumping just feels wonderfully on keyboard or controller. The same can be said for the combat as each blow landed feels visceral and has impact. The combat is deliberate, every attack commits your character to the action so the combat takes on a bit of a Dark Souls feel where some thought and patience is required to really accell at it. The game features a fairly large number of bosses each with their own challenges. The game never felt like it was getting stale as it threw in new twists to the combat at every turn with new enemy types and new level types to fight in. In one level you can barely see, its pitch black and you only have a torch to light the way a few meters in front of you. In another level you're battling mermen under water which restricts your ability to use ranged weapons accept for one which was made for the mermen's use. The voice acting is top notch and every God character has personality and identities. The story was well done and well told with lots of cool lore and history on the Greek Gods and every weapon and piece of armor has its own model and there are a lot of them. Theres a crafting system for consumables but its nothing to write home about. And each level looks beautiful and feels unique for the most part. The levels can blend together a bit because of how consistent the art style is but the color pallete is great and there are awesome contrasts and colors to give the game a really great feeling of majesty and beauty.Pros --Great combat system. Satisfying and brutal, pretty easy to learn yet hard to master.-Tons of different weapons, shields, items and armor each with their own unique models.-Expansive levels with lots of secrets and items to be found as well as enemies to fight.-Varied enemies.-Great voice acting-Strong, well told story.-Beautiful art style and color scheme.-Authentic feeling environment.-Awesome final battle. Cons --Weak crafting system.-Boss fights can be unintuitive at first.-Combat encounters can get a little repetative at times though not often.-Normal difficulty isn't very challenging, I felt very overpowered by the end of the game.All in all this game is absolutely worth $15 for my money. It was bigger, badder and better than I expected it to be. It lasted about 15 hours for 1 play through though, its probably realistically closer to 10-12 hours. It has multiple difficulty settings for extra play time as well as a multiplayer mode. I've not tried the Multiplayer so I can't speak for it but if it uses the combat system and runs smoothly I imagine its a lot of fun. I just bought this game not expecting the amount of detail and care that I found once I played it and it really suprised me. It was one of my favorite suprises in gaming in recent memory and I'd recommend it to anyone. It really is a fantastic Indie and is so masterfully crafted that it deserves more attention than its gotten. I'm not big on giving a number score to games but if I had to give this game a scroe, i'd give it...8.5/10 "

												This game looks interesting but...Has audio issues for someHas performance issues for someThree things bother me about this; firstly the developer tries to blame the issues on Microsoft XNA which is wrong based on the fact that no other game I have tried that uses Microsoft XNA has had these issues. Secondly with further research I have found that there are similar problems with this game on different platforms; Linux, Playstation 4, etc. Lastly, their previous game 'Capsized' also uses Microsoft XNA and works perfectly so what gives?The developer comes accross as if they don't have a clue about how the games internal audio/performance systems work; as if a third-party created the game engine for them. Therefore their only response so far is to superfluously put the blame away from the game. I have never had to disable hardware acceleration to get a game to work over the last fifteen years.Until they fix the issues I cannot recommend this game.			"

												I really wanted to love this game.There is only really one thing that killed it for me. The combat.Most enemies run around back and forth frantically, and I found myself mashing attack hoping the enemies would be in front of me when I swung. Doesn't help that most weapons take a while to swing.The point in which I turned it off, was fighting werewolves that did this grab and throw move by lunging at you. Annoying on its own, but when there are multiple in one room you're constantly thrown around with little way out.If they polished the combat, I would definitely recommend this game. Either way I wouldn't pay the full $15 they're asking when there are so many other great titles you can find for less.			"

												Apotheon is a game with an art style that's both unique and good looking. Everything feels right about the graphics and animations and it really does bring you into the mindset that this is a game about ancient greek mythology. The game has light RPG mechanics in where you can pick up multiple weapons and tools that are split into four categories; melee weapons, long ranged weapons, throwabale weapons/traps and potions/elixirs. The combat is pretty good, with fluid movement and some epic moments but it can get a little fiddly trying to change weapons in the middle of combat. It can also get quite annoying when some of your weapons overreach the enemies with weapons like the spear, the axe and the mace.What I would like to see is the ability to drop inferior weapons because scrolling to the right weapon can get frustrating when there's ten weapons between the one you want and with weapons breaking quickly you can't really set one as a primary. Spears should also stab and not get used as a club of some sort.			"

												Meh...This game seems like it could be interesting, but it's just lacking the polish necessary to make a good platformer.  One super important part to making a platformer enjoyable is mobility, I need to feel in complete control of my character.  You lose momentum whenever running over slight changes in terrain (e.g. from stairs to flat ground).  If you're running not in the direction of your mouse you move at cripplingly slow speeds.  The game just makes you feel clumsy.I'm personally not a huge fan of mouse-aim platformers, but if you are going to make such a game, the action has to be good enough to warrent the precise aiming mechanic.  I find it difficult to hit any given target, the mouse aiming seems more to get in the way than enhance the combat mechanics of the game.  I dunno, maybe it'd be more fun with a controller?			"

The gods have abandoned the ancient greeks and doomed the mortals.  However, with a little help from Hera the mortals have one last hero to place their hope into and fight against the will of Zeus.Despite a few imprecisions in the controls this action platformer has a lot to offer players.  Multiple weapons both ranged & melee along with crafting provides many ways to solve combat puzzles.The visual style of this game is fully committed to and works well in most cases although there are rare occasions where the high contrast color scheme masks finer details.

												I started this game excited about it. The originality caught my attention. The art style and soundtrack will be the only thing to save this game. The controls are clunky and unpredictable. The combat system doesn't make a lot of sense. I started this game and played through the entire thing in 1 day. The next day I figured I would go in and finish off the last achievement by completing an Olympian run. The game only lags more and more and gets more frustrating the longer you play(Not my PC, I can run any game without an issue). About 10 hours into my second playthrough my game crashed and when I went to reload, my save file wasn't there. I cannot suggest this game until most of these issues get resolved by the development team. I had high hopes and was disappointed.			"

												Sad to say, I am unable to enjoy this game. Bought it after my friend recommended it. Decided to play it while downloading XCOM 2. Game opened up just fine. Went to the settings, changed some very minor things, hit apply.Game crash.I tried it again. Again, game opens fine. I went to the settings and did the same thing, just to see if it would crash again. Guess what?It did.I try one final time, this time skipping the settings completely. I just decide to play the game. Fourteen minutes in, and I've started to enjoy myself. In fact, I've forgotten about the previous two crashes.  As long as I stay away from the settings, everything will be perfect. I'll meet a nice girl, go out with her, and eventually get married. We'll get a dog, and have a couple of kids. I'll finish college and go on to fulfill my dreams. I'll be happy... Fulfilled...  All is well and good... until Steam sends me a notification. Guess what happens.The game freaking crashes.Why? I don't know. I can't tell you. I couldn't read what the notification said, because the entire system froze up on me. And now, I still haven't met a girl, I don't have a dog, or any kids, I haven't completed college, I'm drowning in debt, I lost my left arm in a very dramatic shipping accident, my grandfather joined the American Nazi Party, and life is just awful!Screw you, Apotheon.

												Was really looking forward to this game, but the controls are abhorrent, so I'm having a hard time getting into it. It feels really clunky. I was getting Mark of the Ninja vibes from it when I saw it a while back, and I have been waiting for a release for a while. When it's come it does look good, but it just hasn't been able to grip me. If Klei had a play with this, I bet they could fix the niggles that are stopping me from playing it. Not that it's a bad game, it's just marred by being awful to control.			"

												I *really* want to recommend this game on the fantastic visuals alone... but unfortunately the controls feel *so* loose and clumsy. This is basically a side-scrolling action game where your character feels floaty, weapon selection and switching is too difficult, and fights feel like rag dolls flailing at each other. The art style is *brilliant*, and *if* the tighten up the controls, it could be huge fun for anyone who likes a good side-scroller beat-em-up... but for now, you'll probably find it more frustrating than anything else.

												Initial impression:+Beautiful scenery+Interesting story-Strange unwieldy controls-Using weapons is incredibly frustrating. Sometimes I swing weapons at a normal decent speed, other times I wind up for two seconds before attacking, which allows enemies to hit me and interrupt my swing...over and over...it's horrid.Edit:Learned after a bit that you have a stamina bar which, if low, makes you swing your weapon like you actually want to die.  Anyway, doesn't make it any more of a fun mechanic.			"

												I like the visuals, but the controls were just wonky for me.  everyone (both player and enemy) moves very quickly, with an acceleration and deceleration involved with running.  it ends up feeling like running on ice, and has the problem where you need to move a small amount, and you either go nowhere or accelerate to a run and a single run step takes you like 10 feet			"

												Overall average game.Even though there are quite a few supposed to be challenges, a lot of hidden lockboxes are actually highlighted on the map. All the boss fights are quite similar. No sense of accomplishment.Combat is boring, with only a few actions and weapons are not balanced. Steam Controller is not well well supported especially when it comes to arrow aiming.The lore based on the Greek mythology is quite good.			"

												NOTE: Looks like the play timer is bugged Im sure i didnt play that long my ingame timer is much lower.Apotheon is an ancient greek action platformer. I dont like the art style, but i guess it fits the ancient greek theme. You can see it yourself in the trailer, if its a plus to you thats fine.Gameplay consists of going on various quests involving following arrows through the overworld to find mini dungeons scattered about that often have a boss in them and lots of purposeless corridors. Most of these quests never really had any explanation as to why I needed to do them, for example in the ""Hades"" area players must cross 4 rivers before fighting the areas boss. When you cross these rivers you come out back exactly where you started. It seem the only reason I had to do it was to add to the gameplay, not the story. However, many of these quests were very interesting and fun. This isn't nessicarily a fault. The problems come in with the platforming and combat.Platforming is quite obnoxious, it almost feels like im lagging but I dont think i am. Its very hard to move just a small amount or land on a small platform. Most areas are designed with ""Z"" shaped platforms, so youll often try to jump up onto one and lagging into the crook, because the jump didnt respond well. Also unresponsive is trying to down jump through a platform. This is very annoying when trying to run away. When you receive a big hit sometimes you go flying unpredictably. Also if your like me your used to roll jumping everywhere. Nope in this game you get to jump roll instead, thats a bit strange. There arent really that many parts in this game that require precise platforming anyways but its still annoying, especially on the final boss.Combat system is very simple but there are a ton of guards its much better to just run past most of them. When you do have to fight, despite the game insisting otherwise, you can just button mash with most weapons. Range weapons even have automatic aiming which is pretty OP. You can also make a ton of healing items using the crafting system. Even when you do die you aren't set back much by it.Theres this weird issue while trying to switch weapons while in combat where you cant do it while attacking. I would expect the game to finish the attack and then switch. When your weapon breaks this gets really annoying and makes it hard to use the more advanced potions at all.The UI also has weird overlapping issues very often.If your going to play it play it for an ancient greek story the gameplay is subpar. P.S. If your going to play it anyways you should note that the last difficulty is locked until you beat the game once but theres a bug you can do to skip to the final boss and get the acheivement for beating that difficulty without beating the whole game again.

There's plenty of different weapons and you can switch on the fly for some nice maneuvers.The game is a looker and the sound design is atmospheric.A game like this could easily fall into the trap of becoming monotonous, but the game really delivers in the diversity of its level content and it has a few stand-out boss fights as well (some are more generic).

They are floaty and imprecise, and the weird combat system makes it far worse.  The transitions between animations are also too sudden and lack grace.  Doubtlessly attractive, and with a strong dose of Greek mythology, I was hoping this would be a  true gem.  Unfortunately, all it has it its looks, and they cannot carry it far enough.			"

												I do really like this game, from what I played so far. The combat isn't as awkward as many people say, at least for me. I grasped the proper distance and how to get past shields by exploiting certain moves to get past an enemy's guard. However, what irritates me the most about this game is the lack of actual controller support. No matter what I do, my controller is not recognized by this game. It irks me that Outland another action 2D combat is the only game on Linux that has such amazing controller support! I would prefer to play this game with a controller, which is why I haven't really put a lot of hours into it. Keyboard and Mouse while usable, isn't what I prefer for these types of games thus I cannot recommend this game until the developer fixes this issue.			"

The combat system is also another pro of this game, it runs so smoothly, and i love the concept of being able to throw every weapon you can equip. I actually really enjoyed reading about the different gods and godesses and how they contributed to the lifesytle of humans. I can only say positive things about this game so i have to recommend this game to anyone who likes good combat, a great plotline and a fabulous art style. 10/10			"

												Well. This game is awesome and I can only recommend it. From what I know about the greek mythology this game is quite accurate, the gameplay itself is motivating and it feels awesome to beat someone to death. With a Hammer. While laughing like crazy... Anyway, it took me 11 hours to play through, for the money, I can highly recommend it.			"

The world you can explore is fantastic with exellently voiced NPCs, music and an awesome and extensive loot/weapon collecting system. The overall gameplay and combat is great but you may find the controls being a bit flimsily formatted.Please get this game, the artstyle alone is worth it!			"

												This is not a bad game, but it isn't good enough to warrant a definition recommendation.So far I'm a couple of hours in. - Combat is floaty and underwhelming and some attacks take a lot of time to 'wind up', which is especially frustrating against fast moving enemies. This is especially annoying in my current level filled with fast moving wolves.- Navigating between weapons in a fast paced combat is difficult and fiddly, but I'm on a controller. There isn't a function to map different weapons to D-pad, so you have to navigate to a menu item whilst being attacked in real time.- Boss fights are either not challenging, or a grind fest. For example, the boss I'm on has turned me into a deer and I have to dodge her arrows. Too bad she teleports - There's no real strategy involved for this boss match at least.- While the levels are visually distinct in colour themes and have good immersive music, they offer no variation in terms of gameplay. Most places have interchangeable map design.- Because each level is its own 'zone', there's little internal variation *within* levels, it's difficult to locate oneself and explore. The fast running and scrolling means you can move fast through the level, but actually counteracts exploring.I bought this on sale, I would not recommend this game for the full price of £10.99. It's a good attempt with some nice mechanics, but falls far short of what it tries to achieve. Overall the game seems to have developed from the art style, rather than the other way around. The game itself seems like a showcase of the pretty sprites and nuggets of the Iliad dotted around. Looking at the Steam achievements one can see that barely a third of all players made it to the end of the first level, so take that as an indication that this game loses its novelty quickly.			"

												I had seen mixed thoughts on this game, but thought I would give it a try.I'm always very interested in ancient greek mythology, so that in itself is a major draw to this game. While the story is very reminiscent of another greek mythology game (*cough* God of War *cough*), the way it was presented set it on its own.The art style is awesome, it's bold colors and just oozes with greek influence. It felt like I was playing a story book that was made by the ancient greeks themselves.  There is a nice variety of locals as well as your move throughout the story. While the graphics looked great, there were some slowdown issues with the framerate despite having a fairly powerful PC. They would come at random times, independant of what was going on during that particular moment.The other part of the game that made it a very positive experience for me was the combat. Its difficult, it has a high learning curve (in my opinion), but its *satisfying*. Once you figure out how you have to space yourself for different weapon types, and how you have to actually aim your ranged weapons, it becomes very natural. I was FRUSTRATED at first, so expect that, but know the more you practice with it, the better the game becomes. You can't expect to just run in and kill everything without timing your attacks and blocks, or you'll die horribly (as I did at first).There were a couple annoyances with the game I should mention too. For one, unless I missed some control, the map can't be moved around to search the area. This makes looking through a large map impossible, which is necessary sometimes when trying to figure out where treasure chests are, where an objective is located at specifically, or if you've already gone a certain way. Second, the weapon breaking system. It adds a degree of realism, and it allows you to try different weapons when one breaks, but it still was annoying. I enjoyed playing with the sword the most, but it always broke way too easily. I understand what the devs were trying to do with it, but it just detracts from the fun a bit in my opinion.TL;DR Overall, the game is a lot of fun, with great unique graphics, and very fun gameplay. The story is not very unique, but enjoyable. The map could use some tweaks, and the weapon breakage system detracts from the fun a bit. Still a highly recommended game!9/10			"

												By now it's likely that you've heard of Apotheon's art style. If not, it is the single most remarkable thing about this game. The whole thing is designed to look like an ancient Greek vase, and it is most effective. The primary colors are orange and black, to resemble the clay and dark ink of the artifacts, with blue on the protagonist's armor and red on those of the enemies, along with occasional changes in background color as is appropriate for each setting (Green for the forest, blue for the sea, and so on.) The art style and animation generate a terrific atmosphere, as well, ancient and mystical and desolate and hopeless. Aesthetically, Apotheon is an absolute masterpiece and deserves every mote of the attention it's gotten.The story is also excellent. With the dawning of the Iron Age, the Gods of Olympus are none too pleased with the direction that humanity has taken, and like Zeus's Christian counterpart, have decided to punish mankind with extinction. Demeter makes it so that nothing will grow, Poseiden stirs up the seas, Apollo denies the Earth light, and Artemis keeps the forests wanting for game. Enter Nikandreos, the hero. He wakes as his home village, Dion, is under attack by raiders. After defending the Temple of Hera from the outsiders, the Queen of Olympus charges Nikandreos with overthrowing Olympus and saving mankind. I won't say any more. While this isn't a game with a great many twists and turns, the development of the story is something you should uncover for yourself. The key here is that the developers really know their stuff when it comes to the Hellenic gods. Each one you meet fits their classical characterization to a tee, and this creates a number of great scenarios, my personal favorite being the Artemis boss fight. None of the gods are simplified or lionized as they have been in a great many modern sources, (God of War or Disney's Hercules this is not) and many of them have aligned against Zeus' abandonment of humanity. In addition, there is a liberal scattering of passages from classical Greek sources throughout the game, each placed to give you a clear impression of the particular obstacle or characters you'll be facing shortly. All in all, while the story itself may not be groundbreaking, it's well researched, well written, and creative, and is a joy to watch unfold.The gameplay is where Apotheon falls a little flat. Most of the time it's fine, your classic action platformer with just enough backtracking and exploration that it could be called a Metroidvania (Though that doesn't quite fit). There are two hubs, the Agora and the Acropolis, with a shop, and each is connected to three major levels each based around a particular god, as well as both having two optional gods each: Aphrodite and Dionysus in the Agora and Hermes and Hephaestus in the Acropolis. These aren't required for the core plot but they are fun, help flesh out the world and each bestows you with a useful upgrade.The place where the game falls short is the combat, specifically. I enjoyed it, don't get me wrong, but it was simply clunkier than it had to be. Essentially, you have three attacks, an uppercut, an overhead strike, and a thrust, in addition to a shield bash. With the exception of the shield bash, which is done by pressing the middle mouse button with the shield up, the rest are far too difficult to pull off consistently or accurately. For example, the overhead attack is done by moving the mouse up and attacking, the uppercut involves moving it down, and the thrust is done by keeping it still. The problem is, the mouse is also used for aiming the attack and controlling the direction Nikandreos is looking. Couple that with highly mobile enemies, a problem that only worsens late in the game with the introduction of flying enemies, and this means that you'll have a hard time predicting exactly how your strike will come out or where it will go. The best thing to do is ""trade blows"", attack, shield, attack, shield, and so on and so forth. However, this can be problematic in the frequent case that you're facing more than one enemy. At that point, I just used the bow and cheesed everything.This isn't fatal, and once you get the hang of it, can be pretty fun. It's just something that will catch you by surprise and can annoy you throughout the game. The other thing to know about the combat is the weapon system. This is not a negative point, but it will be a turn off for some players. Rather than having set weapons that you unlock and can use indefinitely, you have a wide selection of weapons that will break after some use. This has two effects on gameplay: First, you must be a generalist. You can't just stick with the Doru (Spear) or Xiphos (Sword), unless you want to put a great deal of effort into making sure you always have decent durability. Second, you have to learn to preserve the most powerful weapons for the situations where you need them, like you might save the BFG ammo in Doom rather than using it on an imp. As I said, it's not a mark against the game, it's just something not everyone will like.Is Apotheon a masterpiece? Certainly as a work of art. As a game, no, there's plenty of room for improvement. However, while it isn't perfect, it's still a very good time. Hell, the aesthetic alone is worth any gamer's time. I recommend it without reservation. Check it out, I think you'll like it.			"

												Qualifications: finished game on normal difficulty in 7 hoursApotheon is a 2D action-rpg game with great style. The plot was reminiscent of God of War. The voice acting is solid which surprised me for a budget game. The best thing in my opinion was the sence of exploration the game provides. Theres so many side quests and collectables. The combat is a bit to get used to but is definetly managable. The game has some great set pieces and boss battles with varying scale. Some I'd say are pretty clever and interesting in how they're approached.  There is a crafting system and upgrade system in the game. I did not really use the crafting system much in my first playthrough though. The only real flaw the game has is the fact that weapons degrade. All weapons can be bought at shops in the game but when going through an area, its very possible to be finished with your favorite weapon a third through. This was probably most apparent in the last level when I had to go through I'd say 6 weapons just to reach the boss.			"

												To anyone who is a fan of Metroidvania style games, you should seriously consider this game. The art style is beautiful and the attention to detail really surprised me as it looks rather basic at first glance. It's also very true to the art style it was trying to replicate (Ancient Greek). Combat is very fun. It's not real in depth, but it's not simple either. Story doesn't have much to it, Zeus turns his back on the people and you, a mortal, travel to Olympus to fight the gods, but it doesn't feel lacking in any way, not to mention the voice acting is very well done.

												Lovely art direction, that's the first thing you notice about Apotheon. Then you notice the slightly janky combat system, although this improves with practice (and when you get more powerful weapons). The level design is imaginative, although the fundamentals of buildings and furniture don't change that much. Good boss fights (except for the running-deer one which highlights the difficulty of moving downwards). And good ending. Overall, good-to-very-good, and worth a shot.			"

												The concept of a greek mythology-inspired game may sound run-of-the-mill, but Apotheon is anything but. The game is a metroidvania type of action-platformer, but uses very little rpg elements, which simplifies the mechanics for players new to the genre.Your character does not level up, rather he gains extra health/protection and powers by upgrading his armor and weapons, and even honing his skill with select weapons such as the xiphos (sword) or spear.You move with the standard WASD, but use the mouse to aim, attack and block; this can be confusing for players who haven't experienced this type of controls, and this ends up muddling the combat. Often, the player will be stabbing blindly at the air, simply because the cursor isn't at the proper elevation. Likewise, this can affect the player's speed when moving if the cursor isn't in the direction the player is headed.The combat is not turn based, and most enemies can be dealt with only a few strikes of a sword or spear. However, enemies can pile up quickly and this is bothersome as running away is seldom a viable option considering the difficulties linked to platforming. The player is armed with only a modest jump and a stunted ledge grab to go through the levels.The visual style is deceptively modest, taking on the the style of ancient greek pottery of colour-on-black. The characters move mostly fluidly, bar some repeated motions during dialogues, and the background is almsot always filled with  ancient greek forests, cities and the like.Overall, Apotheon is a game that will frustrate the player in order to push them to do their best. The sometimes frustrating combat mechanics or platforming physics are easily overshadowed by the amazing visuals, immersive story and engaging gameplay.			"

												Holy mother of power fantasies, this game is amazing.The story is based on ancient Greek mythology, though it is not the game's strongest point. The combat is very satisfying and generally fantastic. It reminds me very much of the combat system in Dark Souls, but instead, it's in 2D.The player takes the role of Nikandreos, who wakes up in the middle of a siege on his home village by bandits. After killing these bandits, you learn that the gods have forsaken humanity and no longer wish for them to exist. Upon going into the temple, Hera appears in front of Nikandreos and tells him that they could form a partnership. She has had enough of Zeus cheating on her with other deities and even mortals, while Nikandreos has an interest in humanity not being wiped out. Hera teleports Nikandreos to the gates of Olympus, where he is tasked with gathering the strenght of all the major gods around and prepare to overthrow Zeus, the king of gods, himself.As you can see from the pictures and the trailers, the game has a unique artstyle in that it looks like ancient Greek pots. The soundtrack supports this artstyle and setting very well and the sound effects are very good.One thing to note with this game is that the bossfights are very cool and unique. This does not go for minibosses sadly, as they're mainly just something bigger than everything else and otherwise behave as all others.Overall, I had a blast.			"

												- The artsyle is divine and along with the amazing soundtrack, adds an ethereal atmosphere that God of War wishes it could achieve.- The difficulty is just right, not too difficult, but not too easy, died quite a few times and had to save before entering areas.- The controls can be quite hard to get used to at first, but you get used to them in no time.- Each level/zone is unique, adds personality to what each God represents.- The achievements are a bit tedious but fun regardless.11/10 that ending was hilarious and also very, very bittersweet.

												An excellent 2D platformer that I hope to play again on the unlocked harder difficulty.Pretty fun and solid combat system is complimented well by the ancient greek art and story styles, and while I was fairly happy with general combat with a decent variety in enemies, I think the uniqueness of different boss battles was my favourite part of the game.I'm hoping that the free multiplayer version of the game develops well as I would greatly enjoy thrashing my friends in this :)			"

												Apotheon, a game of art and challenging game levels.Apotheon is a game with basic flaws. It is a game about a man who is destined to become a God by killing the Gods that turned their back from humanity. The Gods have desecrated their promises to the humans and now they left humanity in utter chaos.The game has very basic controls that need to get used to if you're new to side scrolling games.Apotheon has one of the most beautiful graphics I have ever seen in a game. It is truly a work of art and a true masterpiece. The game's graphics has the type of art that ancient greek vases have. I like that ancient and mythical feel to the game.The game has a very nice soundtrack that sets the mood in each place that you visit.I warn players that become angry easily to hard games because this game is very challenging in some levels, but it adds to the realism and fun of it.The game is beautiful and aesthetic and because of this I give this game a 9/10. I wish it was longer and it had more awesome quests that involve more player freedom.Buy this game! It wont dissapoint! I promise!			"

												OK it's fair to say I'm a big fan of Ancient Greece and Greek Mythology but even so, this is a really fun platformer action game, reminiscent of the old platformer 'Gods' although this is only focused on Greece.So far it's been very entertaining, the story is simple but compelling and thematically the game is excellent. The music, art style, characters and such is very well done. I only noticed recently that the game levels are actually painted on a rock or plaster surface. Very nice touch. You can tell this has been a labour of love and they haven't bit off more than they can chew in the art direction and design. Initially you may think the simple palette limited compared to the vibrance of contemporary games but actually it is very subtle and it doesn't take too long see why they did it. Awesome work.Gameplay is simple yet varied enough to maintain your interest through the hack'n'slash. There have been a few surprises that have me wondering what else they have up their sleeve. I'm really enjoying the variety of equipment that's all tied back to actual Greek weapons and armour with a few added mythological notes as you'd expect.All in all, a well crafted game. Enough complexity and the difficulty so far has been challenging enough without bumping it up to 'champion' level.Great stuff by the developer to put this all together. And I got it for $5. Go buy this and take a break from the AAA titles!			"

												Extreamly fun and addicting, good turtorial, good gameplay, large, interesting areas with secret rooms, and AMAZING replay value, I probably had more fun playing the second time than I did the first.the only bad thing I can find in this game is sometimes, on the final fight things glitch out of the map or just out of reach (id explain in detail but im trying not to spoil it) but its a simple fix if you just let yourself die and respawn.A big thing that i think is cool about this game is that its difficult to die, but it dosent make it an easy game, its a bit hard to explain but you can take a few hits without dieing, but its not like you can just walk strait through a crowd of enimies ethier.another balancing act that ive seen in this game is that they have upgrades, but you dont have to grind to get them, I mean you can if you want to, thats what the forest is for, but its not like that sword upgrade is ever going to be the difference between life or death.I give it a 9/10, Ive seen more thought and detail put into this game than I have seen in most $60 games, and with the options to bump the difficulty up, try new weapons, playing missions in differnt orders, or trying to find all the secrets the large map has to offer (my current goal), you can play this game for practicly forever.

												I saw this game in the ""recommended for you"" section of steam earlier this year. It was still in the launch sale for 15% and I was intrigued by the unique artistic design, so I bought it, but didn't get the chance to play it until now.This game is not good, it UNBELIEVABLE. I thought this game was going to be so much simpler then it actually was, but it's only deceptively simple. Let me give you a rundown of all the great things going on in this game.-Fantastic, weighty combat that encourages carefully timed attacks over simplistic button mashing. If you button mash in this game you will more then likely die.-A HUGE variety of weapons that a ton of variety into combat, different weapons being ideal for certain situations.-An interesting, well written, well voice-acted ""God of War"" like story about a mere mortal taking on the Gods of Olympus in combat and coming out victorious.-Beautifully made musical score.-A unique visual style that makes every environment a joy to explore.-A compelling upgrade system that makes it feel great to empower your character with different armor pieces, and weapon training.-And challenging and fun boss fights that are a blast to play, my favorite so far being the one with Artemis.This game is fun, buy this game if you like fun.

												Simply put, it's a pretty enjoyable game to both play and look at! The art style is something new to look at and combat is very simple but varied enough to allow for stratization. You get a multitude of weapons with their own strengths and some special weapons that have special abilities to up the antie during a fight. You have armour and when you upgrade ypur amour from a lower level peice, you get to keep all peices of armour and customize your look with a lower level piece of armour (if thats the look you are going for) without having the downfall of losing armour points when downgrading  from higher to lower. All lore fits whithin greek mythology (Zeus is the same a man-♥♥♥♥♥; tyrant son of a gun that we all kmow and love) and the plot stays true to the formula: man rises up from their devastation and hands the gods their butts on a bronze platter. One negative is that you can catch the A.I, on corners and pick them off with a longer ranged weapon really easily (might not be a bad thing depending on how you play). Another would be the music  in some stages , like the very last stage, would end and would have a 30 second delay were it wouldn't repeat and then it would after 30 or so seconds, kind of killing the ambiance and mood. Also the Poseidon stage in certain areas when traveling with the boat, there would be complete silence unless you were fighting. That stage in particular wouldn't need music, as the desolation of the Sea would fit the silence, but it could benefit from at least the sound of wood creaking, water splashing against the boat or for at least the seagulls that fly over your head to cry, Other than those minor nitpicks, the game is absolutely perfect.I would recommend this game to anyone intrigued with the art style, anyone who played (and enjoyed) God of War, anyone who is familar with Greek Mythology or who just likes Greek Mythology infused movies (Clash of Titans, etc.) or anyone who is a casual gamer (Or hard core if you like to play games that don't require thousands of hours to master). It's really fun and it's price is just for the type of game that it is.			"

												Everyone should buy Apotheon. It didn't release through early access, it wasn't kickstarted, and the gameplay is really solid, yet for some reason it's not even on the 5th page of the Steam Top Sellers under games like H1Z1 and Stranded: Deep. That really, really sucks and it just shows where the industry is going if nobody is buying functional, innovative games in favor of broken, incomplete garbage.			"

												If I had to describe Apotheon in one word, it'd be fun.  Plain and simple, good ol' fashioned fun.Don't come into this game looking for an immersive novel-like story---it's just not there.  But like a beautifully illustrated children's book, Apotheon shines in its simplicity, style, and sense of adventure.  It's fun to play, and fun to watch.  The controls are simple and fluid.  The scenes are beautifully rendered in the style of Greek art.  It's truly a joy to behold.The soundtrack doesn't disappointment either, with a host of tunes that totally immerse the player into the environment, and convey the excitement (and sometimes anxiety), as you pit your mortal self against the mighty gods of Olympus.It's a must for any fans of Greek mythology, or anyone who enjoyed the Iliad or Odyssey.  Fans of simple, but fun adventure games will also find a lot to like here, as well as anyone who can appreciate games as art.To be fair, the story narrative could have been better integrated into the entirety of the game.  At times, it comes off feeling slightly arbitrary, or disjointed.  The side-plots also feel a bit confusing, and it's not clear most of the time how they fit in.  But, on the whole, the story is cogent, and it works for what the game is.  Again, in keeping with my earlier metaphor, think Chris Van Allsburg, not Leo Tolstoy.  My final grade for this beautifully rendered Greek odyssey:  B+.			"

												TLDR; 10/10, it's worth owning. Fist off, this game is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. The art style is incredible, with a greek pottery vibe that I adore. The effect of the screen cracking when you get injured is a genius addition, and the 2D simplicity with the perfect colour schemes... well, I could go on for hours, but you get the point.The mythological aspect of the game is amazingly well done, I adore greek mythos and this is one of the best representations I've seen in a long time. Playing as Hera's champion against Zeus- perfect. It balances accuracy with interest perfectly, with occasional optional text to view from the original sources, such as homeric hyms.The soundtrack is perfect for the game, fitting incredibly well with the different scenes, and I'm actually about to buy the soundtrack dlc since it's on sale at the moment. The voice acting is fairly good, and if it's not your thing you can skip the speaking by clicking/pressing space/some other control if not on keyboard.I would guess that the fighting in this game works best with a controller, it's not impossible with a mouse but it takes  a bit of getting used to. If there's one tip I can give you, it's not to button mash/click repeatedly. Your attacks will lose power, and you won't even hit them most of the time - make sure you time your attacks carefully and vary your weapon choices, and keep on your toes to face your attacker!Overall a solid 10/10 for this game- I bought it on sale, but I'd say it's worth the full price, or at least worth putting on your wishlist until it comes on sale again.

												Wow, this game demonstrates how to do boss battles. Every boss battle is unique (With Hades being the one exception); being turned into a Stag and hunted by Artemis, fighting Apollo in pitch darkness guided by his attacks and your torch, fighting a giant Poseidon as he throws your ship like a ragdoll in the ocean, being chased by Ares through a series of death traps, commanding an army against Athena, every boss in this game takes the formula and makes it fresh. If the entire rest of the game sucked it would STILL get this recommendation for the masterfully crafted boss battles alone.Get this game, especially if it's on sale. A word of warning, though; you literally cannot progress through the second half of the game without Lockpicks, so use them judiciously. They do drop randomly if you run out, but still.			"

Furthermore it has a fun and intresting storyline and world that will keep you entertained and amazed.

This however works both ways, manage to go pretty well for some time and you'll end up with loads of money you don't know what to do with and a huge arsenal that simply won't end. 7,5/10...			"

												Firstly. my review mostly lists the problems I had, since you're probably already interested in the game for whatever reason and wondering what might be bad about it.  I definitely played the game all the way through and enjoyed it, especially the boss fights.  The art style is brilliant, and the story is interesting enough (although I don't expect anything epic from a platformer).  I played with an Xbox 360 controller and the movement and controls are mostly solid.The combat was a bit awkward.  It's just impractical to try to aim your weapon AND shield properly with the right thumbstick at the same time while moving around with the left.  I never got used to it.  The weapon switching with a controller is a joke too.  It's impossible to accurately choose one of dozens of weapons with the d-pad in the middle of combat.   You have to pause the game and switch in the inventory screen if you don't want to be carved up while finding the right weapon.  The being said, the combat does take a little bit of brains to know when to attack and with what against whom.My biggest problem was the weapon/shield breaking mechanic.  Some weapons are more useful against a lot of foes, and some are kind of niche.  You tend to want to save the useful ones for potentially harder fights because they break so fast.  This means sometimes you're using terrible weapons against certain weaker foes just to hold onto the good weapons.  Shields break way too fast for you to be blocking with any regularity as well.  You do get a fair bit of replacement weapons, but you never know when the next good weapon or good shield is coming up, so I tended to try to conserve, which threw any battle strategy in the trash (there are so many health potions you can just keep healing instead of fighting well).  I feel like it would be a lot more fun if at least shields (and preferably weapons) were indestructible, because then you could use the weapons/shields to fit the strategy per enemy instead of playing resource management.  It's not unplayable by any means, just a moderate annoyance.			"

												Such a surprisingly fun game! It's not exactly 2D God of War as people mention, as the combat is a little more tactical and weighty. I would say it's closer to the dark souls kind of combat, although still quite far from it.You play as Nikandreos, a simple dude who chooses to stand up against a rampaging Zeus. You basically have three attacks (overhead, stab, uppercut-ish swing), but there are many different types of weapons with different reaches, attack speeds and damages. You could also ignore melee weapons and go ranged. There's definitely a lot of variety to the combat. The art style stands out in the game, it looks really beautiful, especially in some places where you can see things like birds among the clouds, and sun rays and stuff. The voice acting is quite nice, and the music too. Overall it's a great game that I enjoyed playing, and I'm looking forward to Alientrap's next game!My only gripe was the final fight, without spoilers.. let me just say it forces you to use a sword and a shield, and that was not my fighting style the whole game. It took me around 30 minutes of repitition to finish it.To sum up: I loved the game, loved the story, visuals, combat, weapons, voice acting. I would definitely recommend it!			"

												First impressions after playing a couple hours.-Good 2-D graphics and art (but too many areas look very similar, just different colors)-Good combat, weapons long-short ranged, shields and abilities-Good area maps and direction indictors so not walking around trying to figure out where to go or what to do next.-Good music, history and atmosphere.-Can get a bit repetitive after a hour or so, best in smaller doses.It reminds me of the game Outland, as far as 2-D gameplay.  Its not the best game on the market, but if searching for something different, you have the time-its easy to pick up and play in quick short doses and for a reasonable price then its certainly worthwhile.8.5/10 based on price, style and for basic indie game standards.

A story line of you overthrowing the Gods of Olympus, very good story, very good lore.  Great graphics/sounds. Combat is great.  Huge variety of weapons and modifiers (regular vs heroic) grade weapons.  Lot's of fighting style. Great bosses, and hidden places everywhere.  The game was challenging, but not overly so to the point where I couldn't advance. There is Champion difficulty if you are a masochist.  Very good game, very epic, a little short.

												Overall I give this game a 8.5/10 and would definetely reccomend you buy it if you like Platformers and/or Greek MythologyIf you want to know why, continue reading.Compared to other platformers, Apotheon's combat system is amazing, there's an endless combination of weapons and legendary weapons (with their respective affects) to find and evetually, break after beating in someone's skull. Not to mention armor and health upgrades that can not only be found completeing the main quest but in secret stashes and lockboxes hidden off to the side. Enemies are incredibly varied, besides the fact that they all wear red, and none of them will act alike.The only major problems I had with this game is that every single mission in this game is a ""Fed-Ex"" quest, you go to retrieve an item from a God, and that God or their underlings sends you off to go do some♥♥♥♥♥♥(the only exception being Apollo, because he's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) and then you come back, fight a boss, then get the item. All the items give upgrades and you feel accomplished after getting one, but then you remember that you still have to get items from 11 more gods. You might as well carry a checklist while playing this game. The only other annoyance I had was with enemy AI, the AI for the larger enemies (Bosses, Cyclopses, Weird half-animal dudes, etc.) is great, because you can wittily outmanuevur them and shove your spear in their asses. The AI for smaller enemies isn't that great, all of the normal enemies will engage you with whatever weapons they have, and thats it. Enemies like Apollo's Guards will randomly decide to attack you with a bow, drink a potion, run away from you until potion runs out, pull out their sword, stab your toe, and then run away from you again. And obviously there's tons of these guys in one area, so killing them is more of a chore than anything else. Wolves, who only majorly appear in one part of the game, will jump attack you, run as far as the can in one direction, turn around, attack you again, and then run as far as they can in the other direction before repeating everything else. You'd honestly have more luck just running away from them rather than wasting your weapons and armor trying to kill them.There are some pretty great parts in this game though, in Artemis' woods, some nymphs ask you to clear their home of satyrs (Olympus is overcrowded with all of the deities moving in suddenly) and you walk in to promptly find a bunch of goat-men, drunk off their asses with erect♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(someone actually took the time to animated a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on these enemies) humping the air and getting absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d.

He also invites all deities living on Earth to come to Olympus, so that when all humans die off, everyone can go back to the Earth.

												A fantastic game for those who don't even normally like the 2D action-platforming genre.  The various weapons and items allow for individualized playing styles and enemies stay true to greek mythology while avoiding the ridiculous portrayals common to games based on similiar lore (I'm looking at you God of War series).  The art style (Greek ""Red Figure"" and ""Black Figure"" pottery)  and mythology also serve as a treat for history buffs and classical art lovers as well. Would strongly recommend even without a sale price.			"

												Wow, this game demonstrates how to do boss battles. Every boss battle is unique (With Hades being the one exception); being turned into a Stag and hunted by Artemis, fighting Apollo in pitch darkness guided by his attacks and your torch, fighting a giant Poseidon as he throws your ship like a ragdoll in the ocean, being chased by Ares through a series of death traps, commanding an army against Athena, every boss in this game takes the formula and makes it fresh. If the entire rest of the game sucked it would STILL get this recommendation for the masterfully crafted boss battles alone.Get this game, especially if it's on sale. A word of warning, though; you literally cannot progress through the second half of the game without Lockpicks, so use them judiciously. They do drop randomly if you run out, but still.			"

												First impressions after playing a couple hours.-Good 2-D graphics and art (but too many areas look very similar, just different colors)-Good combat, weapons long-short ranged, shields and abilities-Good area maps and direction indictors so not walking around trying to figure out where to go or what to do next.-Good music, history and atmosphere.-Can get a bit repetitive after a hour or so, best in smaller doses.It reminds me of the game Outland, as far as 2-D gameplay.  Its not the best game on the market, but if searching for something different, you have the time-its easy to pick up and play in quick short doses and for a reasonable price then its certainly worthwhile.8.5/10 based on price, style and for basic indie game standards.

A story line of you overthrowing the Gods of Olympus, very good story, very good lore.  Great graphics/sounds. Combat is great.  Huge variety of weapons and modifiers (regular vs heroic) grade weapons.  Lot's of fighting style. Great bosses, and hidden places everywhere.  The game was challenging, but not overly so to the point where I couldn't advance. There is Champion difficulty if you are a masochist.  Very good game, very epic, a little short.

			Ever wanted to be on Mount Olympus? Well, now you can, thanks to this amazing platformer!		

If you like scrolling platformer games, you'll like this one. If you actively dislike scrolling platformer games, you'll LIKE this one. It's more of an action RPG that takes its cues from side-scrolling platformers but doesn't really fit the bill. You have to actually make an effort to hit people and attack. You can block, switch weapons, craft potions and other stuff.Did I mention the graphics? Well, time to do that now: they're awesome. Besides the clear indication that this has a lot of Greek wall-art graphics to it, it is completely shaded. There are natural shadows, great animations and particle effects.There's atmospheric music and competent voice-over work.It's also pretty cheap so what are you waiting for? GET IT!			"

												Firstly. my review mostly lists the problems I had, since you're probably already interested in the game for whatever reason and wondering what might be bad about it.  I definitely played the game all the way through and enjoyed it, especially the boss fights.  The art style is brilliant, and the story is interesting enough (although I don't expect anything epic from a platformer).  I played with an Xbox 360 controller and the movement and controls are mostly solid.The combat was a bit awkward.  It's just impractical to try to aim your weapon AND shield properly with the right thumbstick at the same time while moving around with the left.  I never got used to it.  The weapon switching with a controller is a joke too.  It's impossible to accurately choose one of dozens of weapons with the d-pad in the middle of combat.   You have to pause the game and switch in the inventory screen if you don't want to be carved up while finding the right weapon.  The being said, the combat does take a little bit of brains to know when to attack and with what against whom.My biggest problem was the weapon/shield breaking mechanic.  Some weapons are more useful against a lot of foes, and some are kind of niche.  You tend to want to save the useful ones for potentially harder fights because they break so fast.  This means sometimes you're using terrible weapons against certain weaker foes just to hold onto the good weapons.  Shields break way too fast for you to be blocking with any regularity as well.  You do get a fair bit of replacement weapons, but you never know when the next good weapon or good shield is coming up, so I tended to try to conserve, which threw any battle strategy in the trash (there are so many health potions you can just keep healing instead of fighting well).  I feel like it would be a lot more fun if at least shields (and preferably weapons) were indestructible, because then you could use the weapons/shields to fit the strategy per enemy instead of playing resource management.  It's not unplayable by any means, just a moderate annoyance.			"

												I reccommend this game, but with a few notes. It's difficult to play with the computer controls. I'd reccomend having a controller to play. The other neutral things I'd have to say about this game is it does get a bit reptitive, and can be finished in about 12 hours or so. Otherwise, the music and graphics are absolutely stunning. I've never experienced a game that is as uniquely artistic as this one is. All in all, I did enjoy, I just wish there was more!			"

""Atmospheric. Captivating Greek Theme. Great Attention to Detail. Slightly Flimsy Combat. Value for Money.""Apotheon is a fun 2D platformer with a beautiful ancient greek pottery aesthetic. The story follows Nikandreos - a champion of humanity - who rises up against the Greek Gods to steal their powers and salvage the fate of his people. As Nikandreos, you will scale Mount Olympus and challenge the Gods in their respective realms.+ Apotheon's gameplay is quite solid, with plenty of interesting melee and ranged weaponry (historically-accurate ones included) to choose from, making for healthy variation in playing style.+ Great attention to detail is also displayed in level and character design, with each in-game location having a different feel and plenty of variation in the appearances of both NPCs and enemies.+ The music accompanies the game well and gives it great atmosphere, particularly during epic god fights. The lyre pieces, in particular, gives the game an elegant touch.+ The storyline is average with a cliché god-usurper plot. Nevertheless, it is well-executed.+ Game length is pretty substantial, well worth its price tag.+ A healthy level of appearance customization is available for the hero, from leather caps to wolf pelts to the iconic corinthian helmet.However,- Combat is slightly flimsy as attacks are completely mouse-dependent and can be annoyingly difficult to control when Nikandreos is surrounded by enemies, which happens fairly often.- The variety of actions available during melee combat is lacking, being limited to the usual stab or an upwards/overhead swing.- On a personal note, the amount of armor sets available for Nikandreos pales in comparison to the wide variety possessed by the NPCs, leaving something to be desired for a game so heavily focused on attaining excellent visuals.Overall, Apotheon is a good game with a composition of 55% style 45% gameplay. Its form similar to the pottery art it emulates: carefully crafted and artistically flavorful. A definite must-try if you dig its aesthetic and love classical history; a worth-trying if you're looking to play a fresh platformer.B+			"

												Probably one of the best 2D open world RPG's I've played - which is almost a niche and intereting sub-genre category in and of itself.  Has good depth and fun factor (not too deep, not too shallow) to the crafting, exploration and questing.  The artwork is surprisingly satisfying and grows on you as you play, rather than gets old.  There are dynamic overlay textures and lighting effects you may not notice in screenshots/low res videos.And the combat: fun!  A little different to get used to at first, but it's worth it to give it some hours until you get more familiar with it.  Better than it first appears!  Don't play too conservative or mousy, just break everything and attack anyone who gets in your way is what I recommend to get the maximum enjoyment out of this one!			"

												Yes.Story:The game is simple: You're mad at Zues for being a♥♥♥♥♥♥so you're going to teach him a lesson or two. So with the help of his wife Hera you go on an adventure to gain favor from the other goods in whatever way you can. The story isnt too complex, but its enough to see that you have a clear goal and the characters you meet are varied enough whether theyre naked nymphs, gods of war, or random NPCs who have trouble walking up stairs. I wont speak much more because your interactions with the various gods were pretty interesting, despite 80% of them being ""♥♥♥♥ you mortal, I'm gonna kill you"".Gameplay:CombatThe combat is simple with just enough variety and nuance to keep it interesting. You have melee weapons with varied reach, attack speeds, and damage. Then you have your ranged weapons such as differnent types of bows, slingshot spears, and even firebombs. There are so many kinds of weapons that you'll never feel stuck once the durability of one dies out, but because there are so many, you'll eventually find one or two that you really like and end up using it the whole game with the exception of some of the bigger enemies who seem to take different types of damage from different weapons without any clear reason. The game was so short that I felt like I didnt get to use everything, but I wont fault the game for allowing me to find my niche and not punishing me for it. There are also some fights that you can cheese because of the way some of the level are designed. +1 for things you can only do in video games like Slashing horses in the buttcheeks through floors[/spoilers]Travel/SceneryTraveling from area to area isn't hard, but I did feel like the map was a little difficult to read at parts and was thankful for the ever helpful arrow telling me where to go. That being said, you are encouraged to explore as you will often find upgrades to your armor, materials for the simple  crafting system, and replacement for your broken down weapons. And some of these maps are big.ControlsOther than than the combat which did feel ""floaty"" at times, moving around is not hard, there this fun little mechanic where if you keep running in one direction you will eventually pick up speed into a full sprint, but you will ever run in one direction for too long.The platforming was good enough, but there was this little quirk where you can stick to certain ledges and slanted parts of the geometry that I never fully understood. It was helpful, but non-obvious.My biggest problem with this game was swithing through weapons and various tools. I played this entire game on an X360 controller and the Dpad on this thing is horrendous, I ended up using the wrong tool or weapon very often and since you end up carrying so many different item by the end, switching in the middle of a fight was a real pain, I would have appreciated either a radial menu, or having the game stop time while I reached into the infinite space that was my pants pocket.ConclusionWhile the controls might be floaty, the map kind of vague, and the game short I highly recommend this game.Each area you go to is varied and different enough to keep things fresh, you can play the game at your own pace, either explore everything or beat down ♥♥♥♥♥es with your hammer of justice. The combat is simple, but fun, seeing hordes of olympian guards fly through the map after laying down the law was a treat. The boss fights are simple enough not think to hard, but simple misteps will cost you a bit of health and armor.Finally this game looks and sounds amazing. The voice acting was very convincing and the art style is mesmerizing. From water to fire to lighthing it all looked great and the art team did not skimp on the bloodiness that were the Ancient Greeks.The time involved wasnt a huge commitment which for me was a godsend (pun intended) because I favor short and sweet experiences over those that drag on. My final word was that this game is fun, fast, beautiful and, and offers a great experience.TL;DR This game gud, kill gods, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up. "

												Good The artwork - Absolutely beautiful. This is probably the prettiest game I have ever played.The Story - The story is clever and is tight enough to be told purely through stuff that actually happens in game, so there is zero mucking around with a billion codex pages like some games.Level design - Every level is challenging in it's own way, and no two levels will be resolved in the same situation, some will require a stealthy approach, some will require straight out bloodshed, and some will need brains rather than brawn.Subject matter - This game delves far into greek mythology and is excellent in using it. Combat - Combat is challenging, but if you take enemies as they arrive, it is usually quite manageable, and will leave you with a sense of accomplishment after the more difficult enemies.Teaching the player - This game sort of throws the player right into the thick of it and teaches as it goes. It teaches everything you need to know without being too heavy or too light with the explanations.BadControls - With a keyboard the controls are somewhat clunky and some attacks, especially the bow, are very slow to respond. I even had some occurences where some of the more exotic weapons completely broke down, and prevented me from attacking, and one situation where I just stopped being able to block for no reason. The clunckiness of the controls also means that the platforming parts are usually a chore.Weapons/Items - There are far too many weapons and items in this game. There's 4 different categories of melee weapons, and then probably 5 or 6 different types within each category, and you can usually carry at least one of each type. When you combine that with all the shields, arrows, slings, potions, traps, etc, your inventory is quite difficult to manage.Finally, in my opinion the final boss fight area thing is utterly terrible. I found it so bad that rather than feeling like I achieved something, finishing the game just left a bad taste in my mouth. The entire section just completely ignored all the strengths of the game and used level designs and mechanics that emphasised everything that was wrong with the game.However, with the exception of the truly awful ending, I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and I would recommend it.

												I love this game unconditionally. I study history at my university, and I love Ancient Greece especially, and I could not stop geeking out over this game. It looks gorgeous, the story is great, and it is one of the most faithful approaches to the Greek myths I've ever seen. On top of that, it's damn fun. Athena's Labyrinth was probably my favorite zone, with all the cool skill challenges, but I was also a fan of the Underworld. The music and lighting down in Hades sometimes made me feel legitimately uneasy, and crossing the River Lethe was slow and tense without being frustrated. My only complaint is that the controls can be a bit sluggish when fighting, which is a bit of a problem in a platformer. Even then, combat made me feel like a badass. I should note, however, that I only played with an XBox controller, so a keyboard and mouse may be quicker and more precise. Other than that, no complaints. As a historian and lover of myth who loves to nitpick, I only noticed two historically inaccurate things: In the game, the sarissa can be held one-handed and thrown, and the pelta is carried on the arm. Besides the fact that these weapons were introduced in Macedonia several centuries after when this game seems to be set, the sarissa required two hands to use, and the pelta (which was invented to be used with the sarissa) was slung over the shoulder. But I digress. Long story short, play this game. Great story, great music, great history, and all-around fun.			"

												Probably one of the best 2D open world RPG's I've played - which is almost a niche and intereting sub-genre category in and of itself.  Has good depth and fun factor (not too deep, not too shallow) to the crafting, exploration and questing.  The artwork is surprisingly satisfying and grows on you as you play, rather than gets old.  There are dynamic overlay textures and lighting effects you may not notice in screenshots/low res videos.And the combat: fun!  A little different to get used to at first, but it's worth it to give it some hours until you get more familiar with it.  Better than it first appears!  Don't play too conservative or mousy, just break everything and attack anyone who gets in your way is what I recommend to get the maximum enjoyment out of this one!			"

												Honestly one of the best side-scrollers I've gotten the chance to play. The art style caught my eye immediately, reminding me of the Muses' scenes from Disney's Hercules. About a third of the way into the game, the realization that there are hidden shopkeepers, side-quests for items and buffs, and hidden chests scattered all over the game added some depth and diversion from an otherwise straight-forward, linear experience. As a fan of the God of War series, it's interesting to see a similar story implemented in a very different style of art and gameplay. Side-quests involving Dionysus, Aphrodite and Hephaestus were a welcome addition. The magic weapons you find along the way are great, a favorite being a discus that works much like a boomarang. After receiving items from each God and Goddess, you snowball into a powerhouse, which makes the rest of the game a breeze, but ends up making enemies more annoying than challenging.Like any game, there's room for improvement, particularly with items getting stuck into corners and left unreachable to the player, but this was a nice way to spend a weekend. Nicely done Alientrap!			"

												This is one of the most utterly beautiful games I have played. Just for the visual aesthetic alone, it is worth playing. However, on top of that, it is a good platformer and simple fighting game with an interesting story. The platforming is challenging but not frustratingly so except in one level that is constantly rotating and it is hard to orient yourself. The fighting is good and simple, without complex combos that would turn me off like in a dedicated fighting game. There is a wide variety of weaponry, but I often stuck with just one or two different setups. Spears in melee for reach and javelins for ranged so I could still use a shield in between shots. As for the story, it is typical Greek gods being self-centered jerks with you having to, literally in most cases, knock some sense into them.			"

												Liked: Great use of Greek mythology; exploration based gameplay that doesn't hold your hand with ""markers"" for every task; interesting and beautiful graphic style; ability to throw any weapon and large weapon inventory makes for interesting combat.Disliked: Wonky combat, especially ranged; very loose physics makes movement and combat unnecessarily challenging (especially knock backs which act almost like nuclear explosions sometimes).

												I reccommend this game, but with a few notes. It's difficult to play with the computer controls. I'd reccomend having a controller to play. The other neutral things I'd have to say about this game is it does get a bit reptitive, and can be finished in about 12 hours or so. Otherwise, the music and graphics are absolutely stunning. I've never experienced a game that is as uniquely artistic as this one is. All in all, I did enjoy, I just wish there was more!			"

												(English is not my native language, but...) It's a great game! Although I think that this game is more about design and art than actually playing (control feels not very comfortable, and a sujet not very smart), but this game was made with love, attention to details and style. These developers are more like artists, I mean, like painters, and it's absolutely fine for me, because this game is so beautiful that I finished it in two days. I don't like genre of actions too much, but this was interesting, and, again, this game is fascinating.			"

												Simply put, it's a pretty enjoyable game to both play and look at! The art style is something new to look at and combat is very simple but varied enough to allow for stratization. You get a multitude of weapons with their own strengths and some special weapons that have special abilities to up the antie during a fight. You have armour and when you upgrade ypur amour from a lower level peice, you get to keep all peices of armour and customize your look with a lower level piece of armour (if thats the look you are going for) without having the downfall of losing armour points when downgrading  from higher to lower. All lore fits whithin greek mythology (Zeus is the same a man-♥♥♥♥♥; tyrant son of a gun that we all kmow and love) and the plot stays true to the formula: man rises up from their devastation and hands the gods their butts on a bronze platter. One negative is that you can catch the A.I, on corners and pick them off with a longer ranged weapon really easily (might not be a bad thing depending on how you play). Another would be the music  in some stages , like the very last stage, would end and would have a 30 second delay were it wouldn't repeat and then it would after 30 or so seconds, kind of killing the ambiance and mood. Also the Poseidon stage in certain areas when traveling with the boat, there would be complete silence unless you were fighting. That stage in particular wouldn't need music, as the desolation of the Sea would fit the silence, but it could benefit from at least the sound of wood creaking, water splashing against the boat or for at least the seagulls that fly over your head to cry, Other than those minor nitpicks, the game is absolutely perfect.I would recommend this game to anyone intrigued with the art style, anyone who played (and enjoyed) God of War, anyone who is familar with Greek Mythology or who just likes Greek Mythology infused movies (Clash of Titans, etc.) or anyone who is a casual gamer (Or hard core if you like to play games that don't require thousands of hours to master). It's really fun and it's price is just for the type of game that it is.			"

It didn't release through early access, it wasn't kickstarted, and the gameplay is really solid, yet for some reason it's not even on the 5th page of the Steam Top Sellers under games like H1Z1 and Stranded: Deep.

												To anyone who is a fan of Metroidvania style games, you should seriously consider this game. The art style is beautiful and the attention to detail really surprised me as it looks rather basic at first glance. It's also very true to the art style it was trying to replicate (Ancient Greek). Combat is very fun. It's not real in depth, but it's not simple either. Story doesn't have much to it, Zeus turns his back on the people and you, a mortal, travel to Olympus to fight the gods, but it doesn't feel lacking in any way, not to mention the voice acting is very well done.

												Lovely art direction, that's the first thing you notice about Apotheon. Then you notice the slightly janky combat system, although this improves with practice (and when you get more powerful weapons). The level design is imaginative, although the fundamentals of buildings and furniture don't change that much. Good boss fights (except for the running-deer one which highlights the difficulty of moving downwards). And good ending. Overall, good-to-very-good, and worth a shot.			"

												On surface level this is one amazing looking game. Aestethics are insipired by ancient greek vases and that style is present throughout the game (suprisingly, even in end credits).The game can be challenging, button-mashing won't get you really far but once you get a set of weapons you are comfortable with and learn their rhytm you can easily slay even the most difficult enemies.What I especially liked is how varied the levels in this platformer are. Not only aesthetically but also in style of the enemies. And boss battles are really amazing, challenging and unique.I really had a blast with this game and you should deffinetly give it a shot.			"

												When I started to play this game I expected something a little different but, what I got was very good.  Visuals: The greek vase art style is perfect for this game and I never had to ask ""What is that supposed to be?"" and the way they color code is very clear: green for yourself and alies, blue for friendly's, red for enemies and no color for civilians. They also use this great effect when you take a heavy blow, a pottery crack will appear on screen to highlight what just happened.  Sound: The music while not necesarily award winning is very good in my opinion and can make the more epic moments of the game even better (I'm planning on getting the soundtrack once I've got some spare cash). The attack sounds clearly punctuate when you make contact with a target and when they make contact with you. I especially like how when a heavy blow is dealt or something dies you get a wooden drum type sound to accentuate what just happened. Gameplay: The combat is a little weird at first and not your typical metroidvania, but that is something that can be said about a lot of games (the little weird part, not the metroidvania part). I will say that Apotheon is better played on a gamepad because, it makes melee combat simpler since you don't have to actively aim your attacks and you have all your primary actions easily accesible at all times; but be sure to have a mouse near-by for the arrow aiming challenges (precise aiming with a joystick in this game is practicaly impossible). I do have a few gripes with the gameplay though. 1. if you want to pick a specific weapon to use, you may have to scroll through all the weapons you have of that type particularly melee and ranged (I never used that many bombs/traps or potions). 2. Even when using a gamepad my character would not be facing the right direction all the time in an intense fight (it was better than manualy aiming with a mouse though) also, the drop off for ranged weapons is probably a little to severe. 3. No wings, go to the acropolis for an explanation. 4. After you unlock most of the items on the blackmarket the screen can't show all the options at once. 5. Some item descriptions can't be entirely displayed unless viewed in the inventory, except one of the notes. But these issues may just be due to limited resources and are more of an issue of how refined the gameplay is.Finally, nearly all the bosses are either ingenious, epic or both and the the ones that fit into any of those categories are more of a test to see if you have a solid handle on the controls (the tutorial boss is a prime example of this). All the bosses are drawn from greek mythology and before you fight most of them, you read a passage of greek mythology to give you some context and an idea of who or what they are as well as what you need to know on how to beat them or what to watch out for. I only remember one or two mediocre bosses but, all these bosses are good examples of what a boss should be in a game. A test of everything you have learned and done to get to them. Not just a normal enemy that is a bit beefier than the others.To sum it up, this game is good, the visuals work perfectly for what this game is trying to be and the gameplay, once you've gotten use to it, it is solid despite it's minor flaws. Anyone who loves greek mythology and would like to see a different play on your average greek story that can make you think. (As you're playing think about the goal and objectives you are completing and ask if you're doing the right thing in context to the world that this is happening in, Classical Greece.) Also, I feel that this game is more greek than God of War is. The only thing you may ask for is a little more content, the game is fairly short. As for a sequel, no; the story prevents the game from having one by wrapping everything up in such a way that a direct sequel would just be tacked on for the sake of their being a sequel. A spiritual successor however, would be perfect. The gameplay was not just greek specific and I could see it being used in a Midieval or feudal Japan setting or if the developers wanted to stick with pantheons of gods norse mythology would be a good idea. The major problem I forsee is that they'd need to figure out a new art style to use. Regardless this game is definetly worth buying and at least finishing through to the end.			"

												I did not play the single player campaign more than a few hours so I cannot yet share any experience with it, my experience described further below is based only on the 1v1 local gameplay.I've played Apotheon recently and absolutely love it. It's brutal, quick and very nuanced in a way that a game like Nidhogg cannot hope to ever be. Each weapon feels different, they counter each other, they have different swing timers, different pickup times, and overall the gameplay seems extremely polished. There is hilarious stuff like boulders which will instakill the guy you are playing against if used properly. There are oil jugs which explode, dealing damage, and set their target on fire.  The way in which you deal melee damage is: you gain inertion from jumping/running in a certain direction, and you can gain bonus damage to your attacks (seen ingame as a blue colored swirl at the end of your attack).  If you have at least one other person interested in this type of game, you can have many hours of fun with the 1v1 local multiplayer, and as such I would recommend it. I realize the game does not have multiplayer as a focus and will list the pros and cons of this game below:PROS:- quick, brutal and very nuanced pvp gameplay- you can choose what type of weapons will spawn on your maps (only ranged, only melee or mixed)- different weapons which actually different and have different purposes, countering each other in pvp- not hard to get into, the basic rules of the combat system are simple and robust- full controller suppport which is actually well done in my opinion- amazing art and very polished gameplay- well designed and varied pvp maps CONS:- too few pvp maps - only 4 as of writing this- only one pvp mode: 1v1- only 2 controllers supported, no mixture between keyboard/mouse and controller- sometimes, just before you end your opponent with a boulder (while the boulder is mid flight) the game will crash, happened 4 or 5 times during our 15 hours playing session			"

												To start: I used to add a much longer header to these reviews, but since it often made the review too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery.Gameplay: Let's be honest; it's kinda hard to describe at face value this game without comparing it to Dark Souls. The combat is similarly weighty, the hitboxes are very tight, there's a stamina gague involved, weapons/shields run out of endurance, you can have up to 10 health regen items on you at once... yeah, there's a lot of similarities to Dark Souls in this game. One thing that not a lot of people agree with me on is on the matter of controls: I think this game controls fantastically, albeit not exactly like you would expect. Moving is with the left analog stick; that much you can expect (oh yeah, also I really recommend playing this game with a gamepad), but with the right analog stick you adjust the angle of your weapon, meaning that if you're good enough at seeing the angles, you can very easily critical hit any enemy you run across. Critical hits are headshots, for reference. Blocking is with the left trigger and attacking is with the right trigger. It does take a few minutes to get used to, but once you do, it feels very natural. As far as the enemies go, they usually have a combination of ranged and melee attacks. They also usually come in waves of four to five, so spacing is definitely something you wanna keep in mind. These enemies are all pretty fun to fight, and it's never an enemy swarm that feels unfair or overwhelming. I will say that the final area could've been one section shorter and have been perfectly fine. As for the boss fights, they're all pretty fun as well. There's plenty in there to keep things interesting, and they usually have their own clever mechanics (even if there are a couple of ""giant dude"" fights).This game really doesn't have much of an RPG element to it like the Souls series does. In fact, pretty much the only thing you get in the way of upgrades are armor upgrades or abilities you unlock from defeating certain gods. Apart from that, you've got currency and a rather meager crafting system (which feels kinda shoehorned in, to be perfectly honest) and that's your lot. Regarding the difficulty, I'd definitely recommend putting this game on Hard for your first time through if you happen to be a veteran of the Souls series, as this game can be a bit disappointing in terms of challenge if you're just going on Normal. Even on Normal it does offer some resistance, albeit a resistance of size and not of force, if you understand where I'm going with this. I only died once, and that was because I wasn't paying attention.Even though my first playthrough only took me about five hours, I could see myself playing this game again in the future (more specifically on Hard Mode). It's a pretty darn competent 2D action game with a pretty good amount of challenge and fun. While not anywhere near being GOTY material, I'd say $15 ain't a half bad price for this. 8/10Story: I'm not too well versed in Greek mythology, so I can't say with certainty how well this game follows the source material, but from what was presented, it wasn't bad. The writing does feel a bit romp-y at times in that it feels like we're going to beat up all these gods for the sake of beating up the gods (and collecting their powers, of course). The core storyline of the game is, ""Zeus is a butt, Hera gets mad, go hit Zeus with your wepon."" Dialogue is... well, it serves its purpose and nothing more. There isn't much in the way of twists (at least none that I called from a hundred miles away), so to be perfectly honest, the plot ain't gonna impress you. It does serve its purpose, and it does so pretty well, so I'll give it a 7/10.Graphics: Well, it's meant to look like ancient Greek bronze art, and it does. The way that the sprites were handled can get a bit silly at times, though. Basically, sprites in this game are jointed together, kinda like what you would expect from Flash animation. As such, sometimes the sprites rotate a bit too far and loop around or separate entirely, and it all just looks kinda silly. On the matter of optimization, I do feel like this game shouldn't be demanding as much from my system as it does. It's by no means a system destroyer, but it does warm my GPU up a bit (about 50degC for my GTX 760), which does seem rather odd for a 2D game. I suspect this is because of the lighting engine. Either way, I didn't have any frame dropping issues or overheating, but I will say that it maybe could've been optimized a bit better. The art is definitely stylish, but the obvious jointing could definitely get a few unintentional laughs out of you, and it does feel like the game could run a little lighter. 3/5.Sound: Again, the comparison arises to Dark Souls: it does feel like the composer kinda tried to use Sakuraba's style for the boss fights, but they didn't quite match the overwhelmingly anthemic nature of Sakuraba's work in Dark Souls. It's not bad, and in fact for an indie studio an orchestral recording is quite good; it's just that Sakuraba's work exists. The sound design is really, really good on the other hand, as well as the more subtle and ambient tracks this game has to offer. A couple of standout areas are the hunt for the Chimera and Hades. Those areas are very well done. The voice acting is pretty good as well. Nothing that's gonna blow you away, but it's quite a bit better than dev voiceovers. All in all, they did a pretty darn good job here in the audio department. While the boss themes could've had a bit more oomph, the subtleties are all very well done. 4/5.Overall scores are: 8/7/3/4; cumulative score of 7.3/10. I'd definitely say this game is worth your time if you like games like the Souls series. Just don't expect a Souls game and you'll be fine.			"

												Apotheon is a beautiful little game.  First of all. the artwork and game presentation and design is beautiful.  Have you seen images of those ancient Greek and Minoan frescos painted on walls?  This game looks and feels like you just stepped inside one of these.  The detail is exquisite in these handcrafted levels and environments.  It shows how so much can seemingly be done with so little.  For only being a 2D sidescrolling and platforming game, the creators have done and excellent job immersing and transporting one to an ancient and mythical time and place.  Its easy to see that a lot of love went into this project.The gameplay is equally great.  As previously mentioned it plays like a classic, sidescrolling, platforming game.  It has a slight RPG mechanic in that you have an inventory, certain gear can be equiped there, and some minor crafting can be done using items you collect.  For me the real treat in gameplay has to do with weapons.  There are tons of them.  They all have a purpose wether miniscule or more impactful.  Not only are there specifically ranged weapons, all weapons can be thrown anyway.  So you can chuck a crappy wood club you found at an enemy or one of my favorites, the darts or dorus spears.  You also can pick up shields with some being better than others and some actually having special characteristics.As far as movement goes it feels great.  Your little 2D character is nicely articulated.  You can walk, run, jump, roll, climb, hang and hand-over-hand, squat, stealth kill from behind and so on.  There are also physics implented which I always love to see even and especially in a minimalistic game like this.The music is outstanding.  Its ethereal.  Almost like a combination of Enya, Loreena McKennitt and the soundtrack to Gladiator.  And its infused into the game in such a way that its not abrupt or inappropriate but instead is incidental and purposed for the particular environment that you are in or situation.  The sound effects are also well done.  On par with the music is the voice acting.  Very well done and it adds more depth and richness to the game actually hearing others talk making the world more alive.  Story and lore can effortlessly be gleaned from hearing these soundbites or even clicking on pedestals/monuments throughout the game that bring up excerpts from apparently ancient texts and stories such as things Homer has written.(whether these are actual quotations from actual documents or creative liscense I don't know but it adds more depth to the game's setting and story)I was also pleasantly suprised to see that the base levels on the game's map themselves often have sublevels.  I even got lost once in one. :)  Overall I am very pleased with this little gem of a game.  I would absolutely love seeing these developers putting this same treatment into other games dealing with subjects and times in history or fiction such as the Japanese Samurai, a Western, Tolkein story and so on.So far some of the things I've gotten to do in this game include slaying the Tyrant named Ophion where upon which the wife of Zeus tasked me with pursuing her husband where then I was portaled, ascending into the realm of Olympus, aquired the Bow of Artemis, wandered into Aphrodite's chambers, was thrown into prison for provoking Apollo, killed a towering cyclops with my sling shot and Olympian darts and then released three solar steeds from their stables.  Great game and good fun. "

												I found it hard to return to platform games but this one certainly ticks all the boxes for me when I gave it a chance.  Sometimes I did find that switching from melee to tools to range to melee can be cumbersome especially when you're continually being interrupted or in the heat of combat. Would be nice to be able to bind some buttons to certain items or the active item for each category (maybe there is and I haven't looked hard enough). But I've been thoroughly enjoying the smooth yet simple graphics, voice dialogue and story.			"

												I saw this game in the ""recommended for you"" section of steam earlier this year. It was still in the launch sale for 15% and I was intrigued by the unique artistic design, so I bought it, but didn't get the chance to play it until now.This game is not good, it UNBELIEVABLE. I thought this game was going to be so much simpler then it actually was, but it's only deceptively simple. Let me give you a rundown of all the great things going on in this game.-Fantastic, weighty combat that encourages carefully timed attacks over simplistic button mashing. If you button mash in this game you will more then likely die.-A HUGE variety of weapons that a ton of variety into combat, different weapons being ideal for certain situations.-An interesting, well written, well voice-acted ""God of War"" like story about a mere mortal taking on the Gods of Olympus in combat and coming out victorious.-Beautifully made musical score.-A unique visual style that makes every environment a joy to explore.-A compelling upgrade system that makes it feel great to empower your character with different armor pieces, and weapon training.-And challenging and fun boss fights that are a blast to play, my favorite so far being the one with Artemis.This game is fun, buy this game if you like fun.

												This game is almost like chivalry (if i dont spell it correctly plz dont sue me) you need a stratagy to kill some enemys. dont just charge in like LEEROY JEEEENKINS. that would kill you very much dead. Also it puts a a good difficulty, this game is mostly for peopple who have fast reflexes orgo all out and see the blood splatter on the backround. Weapons have durability which makes the game force you to scavange for weapons. (i havent gotten very far in the game so i dont know if you can craft weapons yourself) But some bosses are difficult to new players *COUGH COUGH artimis COUGH COUGH* [P.s] buy this game ez good for psychopaths			"

			Ever wanted to be on Mount Olympus? Well, now you can, thanks to this amazing platformer!		

If you like scrolling platformer games, you'll like this one. If you actively dislike scrolling platformer games, you'll LIKE this one. It's more of an action RPG that takes its cues from side-scrolling platformers but doesn't really fit the bill. You have to actually make an effort to hit people and attack. You can block, switch weapons, craft potions and other stuff.Did I mention the graphics? Well, time to do that now: they're awesome. Besides the clear indication that this has a lot of Greek wall-art graphics to it, it is completely shaded. There are natural shadows, great animations and particle effects.There's atmospheric music and competent voice-over work.It's also pretty cheap so what are you waiting for? GET IT!			"

""Atmospheric. Captivating Greek Theme. Great Attention to Detail. Slightly Flimsy Combat. Value for Money.""Apotheon is a fun 2D platformer with a beautiful ancient greek pottery aesthetic. The story follows Nikandreos - a champion of humanity - who rises up against the Greek Gods to steal their powers and salvage the fate of his people. As Nikandreos, you will scale Mount Olympus and challenge the Gods in their respective realms.+ Apotheon's gameplay is quite solid, with plenty of interesting melee and ranged weaponry (historically-accurate ones included) to choose from, making for healthy variation in playing style.+ Great attention to detail is also displayed in level and character design, with each in-game location having a different feel and plenty of variation in the appearances of both NPCs and enemies.+ The music accompanies the game well and gives it great atmosphere, particularly during epic god fights. The lyre pieces, in particular, gives the game an elegant touch.+ The storyline is average with a cliché god-usurper plot. Nevertheless, it is well-executed.+ Game length is pretty substantial, well worth its price tag.+ A healthy level of appearance customization is available for the hero, from leather caps to wolf pelts to the iconic corinthian helmet.However,- Combat is slightly flimsy as attacks are completely mouse-dependent and can be annoyingly difficult to control when Nikandreos is surrounded by enemies, which happens fairly often.- The variety of actions available during melee combat is lacking, being limited to the usual stab or an upwards/overhead swing.- On a personal note, the amount of armor sets available for Nikandreos pales in comparison to the wide variety possessed by the NPCs, leaving something to be desired for a game so heavily focused on attaining excellent visuals.Overall, Apotheon is a good game with a composition of 55% style 45% gameplay. Its form similar to the pottery art it emulates: carefully crafted and artistically flavorful. A definite must-try if you dig its aesthetic and love classical history; a worth-trying if you're looking to play a fresh platformer.B+			"

												Who doesn't love the weird (and most often times twisted) tales of Greek mythology. Now come to life! You play as Nik, the hopeful defender of mankind, as the gods go crazy and don't want humans around anymore. The game play is pretty straight forward and creating/sorting through items is (thankfully) easy. Boss battles are challenging. Loved taking the gods legendary items by force!! Rarge! Overall an amazing 2D game that combines all that we love about mythology.     9/10Ps,Hera can suck it! Same with Apollo.			"

												If I had to describe Apotheon in one word, it'd be fun.  Plain and simple, good ol' fashioned fun.Don't come into this game looking for an immersive novel-like story---it's just not there.  But like a beautifully illustrated children's book, Apotheon shines in its simplicity, style, and sense of adventure.  It's fun to play, and fun to watch.  The controls are simple and fluid.  The scenes are beautifully rendered in the style of Greek art.  It's truly a joy to behold.The soundtrack doesn't disappointment either, with a host of tunes that totally immerse the player into the environment, and convey the excitement (and sometimes anxiety), as you pit your mortal self against the mighty gods of Olympus.It's a must for any fans of Greek mythology, or anyone who enjoyed the Iliad or Odyssey.  Fans of simple, but fun adventure games will also find a lot to like here, as well as anyone who can appreciate games as art.To be fair, the story narrative could have been better integrated into the entirety of the game.  At times, it comes off feeling slightly arbitrary, or disjointed.  The side-plots also feel a bit confusing, and it's not clear most of the time how they fit in.  But, on the whole, the story is cogent, and it works for what the game is.  Again, in keeping with my earlier metaphor, think Chris Van Allsburg, not Leo Tolstoy.  My final grade for this beautifully rendered Greek odyssey:  B+.			"

												Despite not usually enjoying platformers or the ""Metroidvania"" style of games, I found Apotheon a real treat. The visual presentation of the game is enough to recommend the game by itself -- the art style and animation are really something. The story is interesting, and blends elements of Greek mythology while creating its own narrative. Sound design and music are both quite good, as well. The combat is basic, but engaging enough -- the various classes of weapons each have their strengths, and fights are all about timing and range. With one or two enemies it can be a bit tactical, but when more start piling up it can start to become a bit of a tangle, where you're not certain what (if any) effect you're having.That's a minor quibble, however, and the game's length means you'll be finished with the epic (and for a nice change, that word is appropiate!) story before they start to detract from the experience. The absolutely beautiful art style combined with fun exploration, some interesting puzzles (I particularly enjoyed Athena's challenges), and decent combat gave me a enjoyable experience that I would recommend to others.

												Probably one of the best 2D open world RPG's I've played - which is almost a niche and intereting sub-genre category in and of itself.  Has good depth and fun factor (not too deep, not too shallow) to the crafting, exploration and questing.  The artwork is surprisingly satisfying and grows on you as you play, rather than gets old.  There are dynamic overlay textures and lighting effects you may not notice in screenshots/low res videos.And the combat: fun!  A little different to get used to at first, but it's worth it to give it some hours until you get more familiar with it.  Better than it first appears!  Don't play too conservative or mousy, just break everything and attack anyone who gets in your way is what I recommend to get the maximum enjoyment out of this one!			"

I saw this on sale yesterday and decided to get it because it peaked my interest in both subject matter, artistic design, and storyline, but I did not expect it to become my new favorite game! The controls were something to get used to at first because I wasn't used to this style of game, but after I got the basics down I became emersed in the storyline and art and will continue to play this game through to the very end. At first the game seems a bit easy as the designers want you to get used to the controls, but it definitely gets harder and harder to make it through levels and requires you to put more thought into strategy. All around great game and I recommend it!			"

												An excelent game with solid mechanics, innovate design, and a high degree of polish. The campaign offers many hours of gameplay, which constantly introduces variety and rarely repeats itself. Well worth buying outside of a sale.You play as a greek warrior from the archaic period fighting the greek gods on Mount Olympus, whom are attempting to clean up the earth by doing away with humanity. The story won't win any awards, but it serves its purpose of setting the scene well, and doesn't bog down the player in unnecessary details. It is, however, very well-researched, and proves it through excepts from ancient greek culture spread out on readible plaques spread throughout the game world (safely ignorable by those uninterested in such things). The artwork is beautifully drawn and heavily inspired from ancient pottery, while at the same time making important details very noticable to the player. Variety is the spice that makes this game special. The world is laid out in a metroidvania-style arrangement of hubs with branching off areas for each god. Each god's area carries with it a different theme, with different goals, enemies, and backgrounds; each in turn has subregions within. The contrasts are well-balanced, providing enough time for the player to learn new tactics and strategies in each zone, and often lessons learned in one place will prove useful in others. But (perhaps more importantly) it isn't always *necessary* to learn new tactics all the time: the player can usually power through but with a greater cost in resources. However, there's a certain satisfaction to be had in going out of one's way to sneak up behind an opponent merely so that dagger with 800% backstab damage doesn't languish in one's inventory forever.I cannot find a single major problem with the game, but I do have a few nitpicks. For instance, inventory gets cluttered after a while and there are like ten times as many lockpicks as locked doors. it's also annoying how smashing crates reduces weapon durability and that the stacking limit on crafting ingrediants is so low. But those are like tiny chips on an ancient vase: the basic quality of the item remains the same.			"

												UPDATED. Just finished the game, and my opinion is unchanged from my initial impressions. I adore this game and enjoyed very nearly every minute of it. Combat is a little awkward; there are a few glitchy things, and I crashed a few times... but it's all forgivable, because this game feels like it was made just for me.This is the only game I can recall where the mythology was truly given a proper treatment. It's woven into the entire game and presented with care and affection. I've been fascinated with Greek mythology since I was a child, and am not used to seeing it presented with such fidelity in any entertainment medium. I enjoyed Disney's animated Hercules film, and the first two God of War games on Playstation, but in either one of those cases the mythology could have been swapped with entirely original characters and no one would have known the difference. Here, the mythology IS the story, and it's done very well. And I am in love with the visuals: the varied color palettes, the silhouetted Greek pottery art style complete with texture and lighting overlay and simulated imperfections. I could stare at it forever; it's gorgeous... and the music is wonderful, too.Yet it's so difficult to unconditionally recommend the game, and the combat and controls are the reason. Using mouse and keyboard, the game controls like Terraria: Move with WASD, jump with spacebar, and control your weapons with the mouse, pointing the cursor around the screen to determine the direction you will strike. You will either be okay with these controls, or you will hate them. Personally, I thought they worked pretty well most of the time. I didn't love the apparent inability to choose how I was going to swing my weapon, but I didn't find it much of an issue on the normal difficulty, which is a little on the easy side. Now if I spent a few hours on Olympian difficulty, I might feel much differently. I haven't decided whether I'm going to attempt that yet.Overall, though, I am thoroughly impressed with this game. Loved it, loved it.			"

												I very badly wanted to like this game, really. But I found with less of an hour of play time, that the controls were too much for me to bear. I found it frustratingly hard to control, it made it significantly less enjoyable. I wish there was a way to adjust my sensitivity, but I couldn't find that in the options. It would have made it much easier to play. Overall a shame as I've seen others play it, and it always looked rather enjoyable and unique. Despite all of that, the artwork is absolutely, downright, WONDERFUL. The soundtrack is equally amazing, and it's a shame that I couldn't find myself focusing on this game's obvious strong points, the wonky controls made it quite unenjoyable. Pros-Amazing artGreat Concept Phenomenal soundtrackCons-Terribly, terribly wonky controls that, I felt, took away from this game's major strong points immensely.Overall-If you can get past the game's controls, definitely buy it. It's worth it. If not, maybe pick it up on sale. 5$ isn't much too shell out, and it's a superbly pretty game to look at.			"

												To anyone who is a fan of Metroidvania style games, you should seriously consider this game. The art style is beautiful and the attention to detail really surprised me as it looks rather basic at first glance. It's also very true to the art style it was trying to replicate (Ancient Greek). Combat is very fun. It's not real in depth, but it's not simple either. Story doesn't have much to it, Zeus turns his back on the people and you, a mortal, travel to Olympus to fight the gods, but it doesn't feel lacking in any way, not to mention the voice acting is very well done.

												Lovely art direction, that's the first thing you notice about Apotheon. Then you notice the slightly janky combat system, although this improves with practice (and when you get more powerful weapons). The level design is imaginative, although the fundamentals of buildings and furniture don't change that much. Good boss fights (except for the running-deer one which highlights the difficulty of moving downwards). And good ending. Overall, good-to-very-good, and worth a shot.			"

												      An awsome experience with great combat, bosses and an breathtaking level design with plenty to explore in each level, making it great for completionists speedrunners and the average player alike. The story on top of that is awsome and makes you genuinley feel like you're a character in a greek myth with an ending that left me speechless(not spoiling it).    Overall it's a great experience which is defintley worth the $15, Don't make the same mistake I made with taking the long wait for it to be on sale, IT IS A MUST BUY!5/5 A great experience that we're lucky is at this low of a price for this good of an experience.

												OK it's fair to say I'm a big fan of Ancient Greece and Greek Mythology but even so, this is a really fun platformer action game, reminiscent of the old platformer 'Gods' although this is only focused on Greece.So far it's been very entertaining, the story is simple but compelling and thematically the game is excellent. The music, art style, characters and such is very well done. I only noticed recently that the game levels are actually painted on a rock or plaster surface. Very nice touch. You can tell this has been a labour of love and they haven't bit off more than they can chew in the art direction and design. Initially you may think the simple palette limited compared to the vibrance of contemporary games but actually it is very subtle and it doesn't take too long see why they did it. Awesome work.Gameplay is simple yet varied enough to maintain your interest through the hack'n'slash. There have been a few surprises that have me wondering what else they have up their sleeve. I'm really enjoying the variety of equipment that's all tied back to actual Greek weapons and armour with a few added mythological notes as you'd expect.All in all, a well crafted game. Enough complexity and the difficulty so far has been challenging enough without bumping it up to 'champion' level.Great stuff by the developer to put this all together. And I got it for $5. Go buy this and take a break from the AAA titles!			"

												Firstly. my review mostly lists the problems I had, since you're probably already interested in the game for whatever reason and wondering what might be bad about it.  I definitely played the game all the way through and enjoyed it, especially the boss fights.  The art style is brilliant, and the story is interesting enough (although I don't expect anything epic from a platformer).  I played with an Xbox 360 controller and the movement and controls are mostly solid.The combat was a bit awkward.  It's just impractical to try to aim your weapon AND shield properly with the right thumbstick at the same time while moving around with the left.  I never got used to it.  The weapon switching with a controller is a joke too.  It's impossible to accurately choose one of dozens of weapons with the d-pad in the middle of combat.   You have to pause the game and switch in the inventory screen if you don't want to be carved up while finding the right weapon.  The being said, the combat does take a little bit of brains to know when to attack and with what against whom.My biggest problem was the weapon/shield breaking mechanic.  Some weapons are more useful against a lot of foes, and some are kind of niche.  You tend to want to save the useful ones for potentially harder fights because they break so fast.  This means sometimes you're using terrible weapons against certain weaker foes just to hold onto the good weapons.  Shields break way too fast for you to be blocking with any regularity as well.  You do get a fair bit of replacement weapons, but you never know when the next good weapon or good shield is coming up, so I tended to try to conserve, which threw any battle strategy in the trash (there are so many health potions you can just keep healing instead of fighting well).  I feel like it would be a lot more fun if at least shields (and preferably weapons) were indestructible, because then you could use the weapons/shields to fit the strategy per enemy instead of playing resource management.  It's not unplayable by any means, just a moderate annoyance.			"

												I like this game. It tells the relationships of the gods as well as abit about the family tree. It also adds flavours from other characters from Greek lore. The names of the weapons also matched to that of Greek times. The boss battles are also epic. The stamina bar is very irritating but its essential to spice up the combat in the game. Good solid indie game. Story is very predictable and linear. The main character does not have a voice but I think it works as you can say whatever you want to the screen and imagine yourself saying this to the Gods or the other characters.8.7/10 I recommend it if you are into Greek lore and epic boss battles			"

												I haven't enjoyed a videogame as much as this one in a while. Interesting and unique setting, great soundtrack, a lot of weapons and armour to choose from, interesting different themes and setting, also you'll prolly end up learning quite a bit about Greek mythology, it even has a local multiplayer in 2015! Also can't stress the art style enough, as it's one of the best ones I've seen.Not much to write on on the cons side, I noticed a few bugs where you can glitch through objects, fall out of the map and such but they're mostly in places where you're not really supposed to be anyway. Only really annoying thing was the framerate issue (might've been but don't think it's my rig, since every other stage ran on stable 60 fps) in the central Hades level when you first go down there. It's a bit sad that multiplayer is pretty dead but like I said, local multiplayer makes up for it. Oh and I wish the hardest difficulty would be available from the start, I found Champion a bit too easy.Would buy again/10.			"

												Apotheon is a game about defying the Greek gods. They have abandoned mankind, so you must seek their assistance or kill them and gain their powers to save man yourself. The combat in the game is straighforward, as to be expected in a 2D action game; click to attack with melee weapons, which is done with a thrust or swing, and movement is done with the WASD keys. Ranged weapons can be thrown or launched with a bow, sling, or other devices. You can even pick up and throw boulders or stone blocks for massive damage. The difficulty on the default difficulty setting is ridiculously easy, and the next setting really isn't much harder. I think I only died a couple of times. Beating the game unlocks the hardest difficulty, which I have yet to attempt. It's a lot more fun than this simple explanation can make it sound, so I reccomend looking up a youtube video of gameplay if you don't get the picture yet. Also, there is a lot of exploration. There are a lot of goodies to be found if you just look in the right places. There is also not much backtracking, so you don't need to worry if you don't like that sort of thing.As for the presentation of the game, the art style is done in a Greek pottery fashion. There's a filter that applies to the whole screen, the colors are those that would be used in ancient greek pottery, and the screen will crack if you take too much damage. It is very nice to look at. The music, however, is lackluster. Sometimes it is not even present, and when it is, it does not stand out at all.So, overall, is the game good? Yes, it's very good. The combat is fun and you will have to plan out strategies for dealing with enemies on the fly. Environments are big and there are many secrets to discover. Honestly, the only nitpick I have is the music. Other than that, though, the game is stellar. Originally I thought I would not like this game, but when I bought it, I was very impressed. A playthrough lasted me 12 hours, and it was fun the whole way through. If you like 2D action games with some exploration in them, it's hard not to reccomend this.			"

												I think I've found a new favorite sidescroller; it isn't all that often that one of those comes around where I don't roll my eyes and leave it after the first half hour. Pros:- Story. The story strays into the cliche at times, but otherwise is wonderfully crafted and engaging- Voice acting. This is something plenty games, especially sidescrollers, lack. The voice acting is spot on- Depth. The game has plenty locations to explore and plenty treasures to find, keeping the player interested and roaming- Accuracy. This is something I didn't expect, but the game tosses out old terms and quotes from the Greek poets and        Homer with astonishing regularity. This really helps the world connect back to the ancient Greek roots, unlike plenty other that wore the ""Ancient Greek"" label.- Varied Gameplay. Instead of being same-old, shoot-this kill-that, the game actively switches it up between puzzles, races, platforming challenges, and kill-them-all brawls interspersed with the occassional boss fight or conversation with an NPC. This helps it stay fresh for longer and is a welcome addition- Music. While it may not be to everyone's tastes, the music is hauntingly beautiful if somewhat repetitive after a time- Balance. This sort of game always has trouble balancing between frustratingly dificult and too easy. Apotheon manages it. There were definitely moments of sheer panic where I felt like I was being crushed, but these never crossed the line into an annoyingly hard fight.- Replayability. The first run through, without seeking out side quests or the like, on the easiest settings, takes about 12 hours. Have fun. I persume it will take another 12 on the next difficulty, and a lot more than that on Olympian.Cons:- Controls. Yes, let's talk about the one major failing that this game has; the controls. They aren't all that bad, but suffer on two points: Firstly, platforming is a bit of a nuisance. The game makes you stick to any climbable surface you touch, theoretically making platform puzzles easier but also slowing you down at inopportune moments. Furthermore, archery and thrown weapons are the slightest bit inaccurate and hard to master early on.- Tutorial. The first mission is in essence a tutorial mission. It gives you all the basics, but no more, leaving you to puzzle out the rest on your own. Where do I get more crafting recipes? Wait, my weapons can break? Can I repair them? These questions and more are left to the player to decipher. On the one hand, this can be enjoyable if the player enjoys the challenge and the thrill of discovering something new. On the other, people who want to jump straight in may suffer a few mishaps - I myself ended up fighting a boss with only one spear as my other weapons had worn down.Despite the slightly sticky controls and the imperfect tutorial, this game is still excellent. If you enjoy sidescrollers, story-driven adventure games, or Greek mythology, this game is a perfect fit and I anticipate having a lot of fun with it.			"

That is the only porblem I've really had with this game, it simply is not long enough, not to say that the time it gives you is not worth the money, because it is. Simply saying, a basic online multiplayer mode would not only be doable, but enjoyable as well, extending the play time and making this a greater game. If this isn't what the developers wanted, then so be it, it is still a great game and brings much amuzement and fun to any who play. 8/10: Love it, just need more!!			"

												This game will probably stay in my list of top 10 games of 2015. And that's thanks to the amazing art, beautiful music, solid fighting mechanics, and variety of levels. It's not a long game, but I feel it's as long as it should be. The level designs are wonderful and so is the voiceacting. I'd say that the story isn't all that detailed, but at the same time it's oddly very good and interesting.If anything, I'd like it if the powers you gained from the various Gods gave you abilities that you would need to get to another God or the very least open up new areas. That said, I do like that the powers you gain acts as buffs so it seems like you really gain that God's power. It also removes the need to backtrack through areas you've already been only to open up new sections of it which can be a bit tedious. I feel they have really found a good balance in their gameplay.The variety in the levels is another huge plus for Apotheon. You usually have to do 3 tasks before facing off against a God, and they have made each level unique to the God you're fighting. There's puzzles, horseriding, becoming a deer, and lots of neat mini-bosses to fight.10/10 for a most wonderful game			"

												(English is not my native language, but...) It's a great game! Although I think that this game is more about design and art than actually playing (control feels not very comfortable, and a sujet not very smart), but this game was made with love, attention to details and style. These developers are more like artists, I mean, like painters, and it's absolutely fine for me, because this game is so beautiful that I finished it in two days. I don't like genre of actions too much, but this was interesting, and, again, this game is fascinating.			"

TL;DR (Complete comment below)PROS+ Beautiful and neat art style (graphics, soundtrack, atmosphere...)+ Great gameplay, controls easy to take in hand+ Great variety in weapons+ Balanced and progressive difficulty+ The PRICE for such a quality gameCONS- Some rare physics glitches (items or arrows stuck in mid-air)- Bosses fight could have had more ""strategical"" aspects- Lacks customization / stats complexity? (Well, that's no RPG, but I would have appreciated some optimization options)- Disappointing ""hardest"" difficulty level, which is quite the same as the ""hard"" difficultyFINALLY...8/10, must have indie game for anyone liking 2D action platformer gameApotheon reminds me that videogames can be WORKS OF ART on their own, not only for the graphics, the soundtrack, the animations, but by combining all of these to make an amazing and pleasant experience.COMPLETE COMMENTThis game seduced me with its art style (it's not just beautiful, but also neat and refined) and convinced me with its gameplay, which requires well-timed attacks and dodges, using the right weapon / potion at the right time, diving in the melee like a true warrior, and even sometimes avoiding useless fights.After the first mission which could be considered as a tutorial, you'll be able to chose between two difficulty levels:- The Warrior (easy) one should be adapted for casual gamers and people who want to explore the levels without being threatened much by the enemies- The Champion (hard) difficulty provides a decent challenge and requires to understand well the fighting mechanics and the different enemies- The Olympian difficulty, unlocked when finishing the game once, quite disappointing: it's the same as the Champion one, but without life autoregen when it drops below 50. Don't see the point... Maybe limitting the number of possible saves or save frequency, or giving the enemies more damages / HP would have been great to make this difficulty level worth it.To beat the game, you will be given a variety of weapons with different attack power and range (and sometimes additional effects), but that will break easily, requiring to have a good set of weapons in your inventory before diving in fights. You'll also have armours giving you damage mitigation, and various potions that will become handy (not to say vital) in many situations.The quite rare physics glitches I encountered weren't quite a problem (it's just strange to see an arrow floating in mid-air, as the rest of the game seems just perfect).For ""serial achievers"", you'll need to explore every bit of every map to find the hidden keys, chests and rare weapons, which shouldn't take you too much time but still feels rewarding and pleasant.I'm definitely convinced that this game is simply better, funnier and more challenging than many 60+$ games.

												WOW! I saw this on sale yesterday and decided to get it because it peaked my interest in both subject matter, artistic design, and storyline, but I did not expect it to become my new favorite game! The controls were something to get used to at first because I wasn't used to this style of game, but after I got the basics down I became emersed in the storyline and art and will continue to play this game through to the very end. At first the game seems a bit easy as the designers want you to get used to the controls, but it definitely gets harder and harder to make it through levels and requires you to put more thought into strategy. All around great game and I recommend it!			"

												On surface level this is one amazing looking game. Aestethics are insipired by ancient greek vases and that style is present throughout the game (suprisingly, even in end credits).The game can be challenging, button-mashing won't get you really far but once you get a set of weapons you are comfortable with and learn their rhytm you can easily slay even the most difficult enemies.What I especially liked is how varied the levels in this platformer are. Not only aesthetically but also in style of the enemies. And boss battles are really amazing, challenging and unique.I really had a blast with this game and you should deffinetly give it a shot.			"

												I love this game unconditionally. I study history at my university, and I love Ancient Greece especially, and I could not stop geeking out over this game. It looks gorgeous, the story is great, and it is one of the most faithful approaches to the Greek myths I've ever seen. On top of that, it's damn fun. Athena's Labyrinth was probably my favorite zone, with all the cool skill challenges, but I was also a fan of the Underworld. The music and lighting down in Hades sometimes made me feel legitimately uneasy, and crossing the River Lethe was slow and tense without being frustrated. My only complaint is that the controls can be a bit sluggish when fighting, which is a bit of a problem in a platformer. Even then, combat made me feel like a badass. I should note, however, that I only played with an XBox controller, so a keyboard and mouse may be quicker and more precise. Other than that, no complaints. As a historian and lover of myth who loves to nitpick, I only noticed two historically inaccurate things: In the game, the sarissa can be held one-handed and thrown, and the pelta is carried on the arm. Besides the fact that these weapons were introduced in Macedonia several centuries after when this game seems to be set, the sarissa required two hands to use, and the pelta (which was invented to be used with the sarissa) was slung over the shoulder. But I digress. Long story short, play this game. Great story, great music, great history, and all-around fun.			"

												July 8 2016For being a linear, story-driven game, Apotheon holds many secrets that take time and effort to be revealed. There is nothing more satisfying than picking locks and stealing the items out of strong boxes. The gameplay is unique, since combat is controlled by directional mouse movement, whereas ordinary movement is controlled by WASD. Though the game resembles any two-dimensional Mario game made, it is far more in-depth, and far less rage inducing.My review does not do justice to the game.			"

It's an old kind of story: the gods get mad at men and abandon them, a hero rises up and defeat the gods. But it's not as vengeful and violent as God of War! The graphic makes me feel like I'm reading the story in a wall-painted picture from thousands of years ago! 10/10!			"

 Apotheon  draws from some of the stylings of games such as  Outland,  only this time with a novel Greek theme... and also  far  less engaging.Although the game holds a very nice aesthetic value and will seem intriguing for a few minutes, you'll quickly notice the cumbersome combat and movement mechanics, as well as the monotonous choice for a musical theme that propagates itself constantly throughout the level.I shouldn't already be getting tired of a game when I've only accrued 30 minutes of playtime. I'd say this is one to avoid.			"

												An utterly excellent game whose visual aesthetic is matched in stark beauty only by its combat.  Fighting is brutal, raw, delicate business.  You are often center-stage in a ballet of wits and blades in this Greek tale.  You will feel like a heroic warrior by its conclusion, not because you wield equipment of legend, but because you ARE a legend.Faithful to the spirit of ancient Greek mythology both in story and in visual direction, this game comes with my highest recommendation to the artists, the fighters, and the metroidvania-lovers.

												I started out playing the game ""Battle of Olympus"" on Nintendo.  This game both reminds me of it and absolutely blows it out of the water with concept, theme, music and visual elements to make any Elgin marble in the British museum drool.  I love history, and I also love Greek myths so this fits into my cache of personal time elegantly.  I think the look of this game is fantastic, the character adaptions are perfect, and the fact that all of the elements of the story are right off the side of an ancient amphora make me want to keep it kind of forever.  I see so many negative comments about game play, the only thing negative that I've found about it is that I am a terrible driver for my little hoplite.  This game is for the player like me who loves style, substance and intelligence in a game.  Also, using Homeric poems...a touch of absolute brilliance.			"

You play as Nik, the hopeful defender of mankind, as the gods go crazy and don't want humans around anymore. The game play is pretty straight forward and creating/sorting through items is (thankfully) easy. Boss battles are challenging. Loved taking the gods legendary items by force!! Rarge!

												If I had to describe Apotheon in one word, it'd be fun.  Plain and simple, good ol' fashioned fun.Don't come into this game looking for an immersive novel-like story---it's just not there.  But like a beautifully illustrated children's book, Apotheon shines in its simplicity, style, and sense of adventure.  It's fun to play, and fun to watch.  The controls are simple and fluid.  The scenes are beautifully rendered in the style of Greek art.  It's truly a joy to behold.The soundtrack doesn't disappointment either, with a host of tunes that totally immerse the player into the environment, and convey the excitement (and sometimes anxiety), as you pit your mortal self against the mighty gods of Olympus.It's a must for any fans of Greek mythology, or anyone who enjoyed the Iliad or Odyssey.  Fans of simple, but fun adventure games will also find a lot to like here, as well as anyone who can appreciate games as art.To be fair, the story narrative could have been better integrated into the entirety of the game.  At times, it comes off feeling slightly arbitrary, or disjointed.  The side-plots also feel a bit confusing, and it's not clear most of the time how they fit in.  But, on the whole, the story is cogent, and it works for what the game is.  Again, in keeping with my earlier metaphor, think Chris Van Allsburg, not Leo Tolstoy.  My final grade for this beautifully rendered Greek odyssey:  B+.			"

												Yes.Story:The game is simple: You're mad at Zues for being a♥♥♥♥♥♥so you're going to teach him a lesson or two. So with the help of his wife Hera you go on an adventure to gain favor from the other goods in whatever way you can. The story isnt too complex, but its enough to see that you have a clear goal and the characters you meet are varied enough whether theyre naked nymphs, gods of war, or random NPCs who have trouble walking up stairs. I wont speak much more because your interactions with the various gods were pretty interesting, despite 80% of them being ""♥♥♥♥ you mortal, I'm gonna kill you"".Gameplay:CombatThe combat is simple with just enough variety and nuance to keep it interesting. You have melee weapons with varied reach, attack speeds, and damage. Then you have your ranged weapons such as differnent types of bows, slingshot spears, and even firebombs. There are so many kinds of weapons that you'll never feel stuck once the durability of one dies out, but because there are so many, you'll eventually find one or two that you really like and end up using it the whole game with the exception of some of the bigger enemies who seem to take different types of damage from different weapons without any clear reason. The game was so short that I felt like I didnt get to use everything, but I wont fault the game for allowing me to find my niche and not punishing me for it. There are also some fights that you can cheese because of the way some of the level are designed. +1 for things you can only do in video games like Slashing horses in the buttcheeks through floors[/spoilers]Travel/SceneryTraveling from area to area isn't hard, but I did feel like the map was a little difficult to read at parts and was thankful for the ever helpful arrow telling me where to go. That being said, you are encouraged to explore as you will often find upgrades to your armor, materials for the simple  crafting system, and replacement for your broken down weapons. And some of these maps are big.ControlsOther than than the combat which did feel ""floaty"" at times, moving around is not hard, there this fun little mechanic where if you keep running in one direction you will eventually pick up speed into a full sprint, but you will ever run in one direction for too long.The platforming was good enough, but there was this little quirk where you can stick to certain ledges and slanted parts of the geometry that I never fully understood. It was helpful, but non-obvious.My biggest problem with this game was swithing through weapons and various tools. I played this entire game on an X360 controller and the Dpad on this thing is horrendous, I ended up using the wrong tool or weapon very often and since you end up carrying so many different item by the end, switching in the middle of a fight was a real pain, I would have appreciated either a radial menu, or having the game stop time while I reached into the infinite space that was my pants pocket.ConclusionWhile the controls might be floaty, the map kind of vague, and the game short I highly recommend this game.Each area you go to is varied and different enough to keep things fresh, you can play the game at your own pace, either explore everything or beat down ♥♥♥♥♥es with your hammer of justice. The combat is simple, but fun, seeing hordes of olympian guards fly through the map after laying down the law was a treat. The boss fights are simple enough not think to hard, but simple misteps will cost you a bit of health and armor.Finally this game looks and sounds amazing. The voice acting was very convincing and the art style is mesmerizing. From water to fire to lighthing it all looked great and the art team did not skimp on the bloodiness that were the Ancient Greeks.The time involved wasnt a huge commitment which for me was a godsend (pun intended) because I favor short and sweet experiences over those that drag on. My final word was that this game is fun, fast, beautiful and, and offers a great experience.TL;DR This game gud, kill gods, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up. "

												Apotheon has some fun moments, for example some of the boss fights are pretty clever. Apotheon also has some increadibly frustrating moments, for example the remaining boss fights. The visuals are nice and interesting, but that interest soon vanishes. The combat is mostly rewarding, but needlessly deep. The varieties of weapons mostly do the same thing, and they break too quickly to establish a reliable fighting style. The story is interesting, even though it isn't exactly original. I finished the game and get most of the acheivements. I don't regret playing it, however I can imagine how it could have been better.If you like Greek mythology, stabbing things, and have the time to spare, play this game. If none of those things are true, move along with no regrets.			"

												Apotheon is a 2d sidescrolling metroidvania style God of War with better art and better researched mythology than any game I've played.  Combat is tight, tense, and intuitive, and there's plenty to do and see in this beautifully crafted world.9.5/10, buy it ASAP.			"

The story line is fun and keeps you playing I love the mechanics of it all, I am a little disappointed in some of the bugs when the game crashes when you go through a door it happened about 20 times to me but its a quick game to load so was not that disappointed.

												Overall I give this game a 8.5/10 and would definetely reccomend you buy it if you like Platformers and/or Greek MythologyIf you want to know why, continue reading.Compared to other platformers, Apotheon's combat system is amazing, there's an endless combination of weapons and legendary weapons (with their respective affects) to find and evetually, break after beating in someone's skull. Not to mention armor and health upgrades that can not only be found completeing the main quest but in secret stashes and lockboxes hidden off to the side. Enemies are incredibly varied, besides the fact that they all wear red, and none of them will act alike.The only major problems I had with this game is that every single mission in this game is a ""Fed-Ex"" quest, you go to retrieve an item from a God, and that God or their underlings sends you off to go do some♥♥♥♥♥♥(the only exception being Apollo, because he's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) and then you come back, fight a boss, then get the item. All the items give upgrades and you feel accomplished after getting one, but then you remember that you still have to get items from 11 more gods. You might as well carry a checklist while playing this game. The only other annoyance I had was with enemy AI, the AI for the larger enemies (Bosses, Cyclopses, Weird half-animal dudes, etc.) is great, because you can wittily outmanuevur them and shove your spear in their asses. The AI for smaller enemies isn't that great, all of the normal enemies will engage you with whatever weapons they have, and thats it. Enemies like Apollo's Guards will randomly decide to attack you with a bow, drink a potion, run away from you until potion runs out, pull out their sword, stab your toe, and then run away from you again. And obviously there's tons of these guys in one area, so killing them is more of a chore than anything else. Wolves, who only majorly appear in one part of the game, will jump attack you, run as far as the can in one direction, turn around, attack you again, and then run as far as they can in the other direction before repeating everything else. You'd honestly have more luck just running away from them rather than wasting your weapons and armor trying to kill them.There are some pretty great parts in this game though, in Artemis' woods, some nymphs ask you to clear their home of satyrs (Olympus is overcrowded with all of the deities moving in suddenly) and you walk in to promptly find a bunch of goat-men, drunk off their asses with erect♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(someone actually took the time to animated a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on these enemies) humping the air and getting absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d. How do you get them to leave? Smash all the alcohol. Once you do that, they get so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥they kill each other.Oh, and the art style is pretty cool too.Plot Synopsis:You play as Nikandreos, a Greek normalfag from the village of Dion, one day, Zeus decides ""ayy lmao, humans are ♥♥♥♥"" and orders all the other Olympians to neglect mortals. He also invites all deities living on Earth to come to Olympus, so that when all humans die off, everyone can go back to the Earth. Crops refuse to grow, animals disappear from the forest and even the sun lingers at one point in sky all day. Humans being humans, instead of trying to repent/stop the oncoming disaster, they decide that now would be a perfect time to steal everyone else's♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game opens with Nikandreos stopping the pillaging of his village (and other things) by shanking every single mother♥♥♥♥♥♥ wearing a red tunic. At this point you go to the Temple of Hera where she appears, tells you to help the mortals and then sends you off to Olympus, all the while softly caressing your♥♥♥♥♥You roll up on the Olympian Gates acting chill as a mofugga', and the guards who for someone reason, don't recognize you as a mortal let you in to the Agora, which acts as the overworld of the first tier of Mount Olympus.I'd rather not spoil the rest of the game so I'll just say that Olympus is full of fly honies, and that ♥♥♥♥♥ Athena got♥♥♥♥♥for days.

												A fantastic game for those who don't even normally like the 2D action-platforming genre.  The various weapons and items allow for individualized playing styles and enemies stay true to greek mythology while avoiding the ridiculous portrayals common to games based on similiar lore (I'm looking at you God of War series).  The art style (Greek ""Red Figure"" and ""Black Figure"" pottery)  and mythology also serve as a treat for history buffs and classical art lovers as well. Would strongly recommend even without a sale price.			"

												Apotheon, a 2D scroller combat game features fantastic classical art, both in detailed backgrounds as well as functional objects. More impressive is its fluidity into the gameplay. Although at times the combat gets authentically chaotic, there is a fluidity in the weapons system that is something to speak off. A well excuted, roll, followed by a stab with your javelin and a fianle with a throwing the said javelin is never the question of the games mechanic but rather personal skill which is exactly how a game like this should handle.Combat and interaction with major gods is fresh for each boss fight. Good right to the very end.			"

												UPDATED. Just finished the game, and my opinion is unchanged from my initial impressions. I adore this game and enjoyed very nearly every minute of it. Combat is a little awkward; there are a few glitchy things, and I crashed a few times... but it's all forgivable, because this game feels like it was made just for me.This is the only game I can recall where the mythology was truly given a proper treatment. It's woven into the entire game and presented with care and affection. I've been fascinated with Greek mythology since I was a child, and am not used to seeing it presented with such fidelity in any entertainment medium. I enjoyed Disney's animated Hercules film, and the first two God of War games on Playstation, but in either one of those cases the mythology could have been swapped with entirely original characters and no one would have known the difference. Here, the mythology IS the story, and it's done very well. And I am in love with the visuals: the varied color palettes, the silhouetted Greek pottery art style complete with texture and lighting overlay and simulated imperfections. I could stare at it forever; it's gorgeous... and the music is wonderful, too.Yet it's so difficult to unconditionally recommend the game, and the combat and controls are the reason. Using mouse and keyboard, the game controls like Terraria: Move with WASD, jump with spacebar, and control your weapons with the mouse, pointing the cursor around the screen to determine the direction you will strike. You will either be okay with these controls, or you will hate them. Personally, I thought they worked pretty well most of the time. I didn't love the apparent inability to choose how I was going to swing my weapon, but I didn't find it much of an issue on the normal difficulty, which is a little on the easy side. Now if I spent a few hours on Olympian difficulty, I might feel much differently. I haven't decided whether I'm going to attempt that yet.Overall, though, I am thoroughly impressed with this game. Loved it, loved it.			"

												The outstanding art and theme really outshine most of the problems with this fun and immersive game about man and god duking it out in ancient Greece. This is a game in the style of Metroid where dungeons/levels can be tackled in any order.The game aims to resemble a rotating vase of Greek origin and succeeds magnificiently.  It looks like you are playing a game on a piece of ancient greek pottery.  The unique art style and story wasn't thrown together in a couple hours; the developers really did their research when it came to Greek mythology and captured all the flaws and craziness of Greek dieties.  There are flavor text signposts all around the world and great voice acting.  The final climb up to Zeus is awesome and has memorable voice acting.  Levels and boss battles are unique; my favorite was the fight against Artemis when you alternate between deer and hunter.Unforunately there are a couple flaws which may turn off some people.  The game is physics based so fighting and jumping is ""floaty"". Control is not precise like a Metroid game.  Also, the inventory management is a mess and there are way too many weapons and items.  I understand the developers wanted to give the players choices but there are too many weapons to cycle through during combat and selecting items is a similar pain.  There should have been fewer weapons and items or you should have been able to set certain items to quick keys/buttons.  I recommend a controller for maximum enjoyment but still expect to be frustrated by the inventory system.I understand the game will not be for everyone but give it a chance (at least until a boss fight) as I think the developers did a great job capturing the world of ancient Greek gods in video game form.

												     I haven't finished the game yet,but I still have something to say.    This is an interesting horizontal version ""open-world"" action game. In this game, playing as an ancient Greek warrior, you are going to fight against Zeus who has turned his back on human. Here are some good points of this game:    1.Open world. You can explore nearly all the places in the game and kill nearly all the NPCs you meet;    2.Wonderful graphics. Just like ancient Greek wall paintings;    3.Various weapons. Spear, bow, Greek fire......remember: normal weapons will be broken if they are used for many times.			"

												If it was for the music alone, I would say play Apotheon. But it's not just the music, the gameplay, the lore or the voice acting. It's fun. It's nerdy. It's beautiful. The weapons are interesting and it's almost a good thing they degrade because you'd just stick with your favorite and never try somerthing new. The elixirs are less important, but perhaps i wasn't using them right. I play a pretty defensive style, so I'm not all juiced up, but rather had others do my fighting for me. The story has fun diversions from the main quest, which is great becuase the main quest isn't that long. You get to meet most of the gods, for better or worse and it's like watching the worst family dinner ever. These people are aweful. And the saddest part is that your village has a little temple to these jerks. The aiming control for the arrow/projectiles is a little....wonky. It definitely took some getting use to and there's a little dysjunct between physics and how this game thinks arrows fly. But it's not impossible and when you have awesome swords and spears, you don't need arrows but for puzzle. I am more of a slash and bash sort of player, so if you were expecting to finesse your way into Olyumpus then... this game might be frustrating.			"

												This is a relatively short game (10 hours to do everything, with a bit of rushing). The style is really nice...everything looks like it is either painted on a wall or on a vase. The game rotates around the whole family of Greek deities. It reminded me a bit of God of war....you get angry, go rampage and create chaos everywhere. I think there are many analogies between the two....It is a 2D platformer with quite big level maps. Good that you can run pretty fast, otherwise it would be a pain to get from one place to another. There is the main story and some sidequests, some more hidden than others. You have an inventory, you can craft simple items, you can buy items as well. You can level up the abilities you want, but everything is kept very simple, don't expect an RPG.I think the fighting should have been better....it is very hit and miss most of the time, you never know if the weapon is going to hit the enemies or pass through them without dealing damage. This is the main negative point, but the game is enjoyable nevertheless. The scenery changes also enough, keeping the game from being too repetitive or boring.Got it on sale for 3,70, I would not pay the full price. "

												This game will probably stay in my list of top 10 games of 2015. And that's thanks to the amazing art, beautiful music, solid fighting mechanics, and variety of levels. It's not a long game, but I feel it's as long as it should be. The level designs are wonderful and so is the voiceacting. I'd say that the story isn't all that detailed, but at the same time it's oddly very good and interesting.If anything, I'd like it if the powers you gained from the various Gods gave you abilities that you would need to get to another God or the very least open up new areas. That said, I do like that the powers you gain acts as buffs so it seems like you really gain that God's power. It also removes the need to backtrack through areas you've already been only to open up new sections of it which can be a bit tedious. I feel they have really found a good balance in their gameplay.The variety in the levels is another huge plus for Apotheon. You usually have to do 3 tasks before facing off against a God, and they have made each level unique to the God you're fighting. There's puzzles, horseriding, becoming a deer, and lots of neat mini-bosses to fight.10/10 for a most wonderful game			"

												(English is not my native language, but...) It's a great game! Although I think that this game is more about design and art than actually playing (control feels not very comfortable, and a sujet not very smart), but this game was made with love, attention to details and style. These developers are more like artists, I mean, like painters, and it's absolutely fine for me, because this game is so beautiful that I finished it in two days.

What I liked: Art style is amazing and fits the over all theme perfectly( an art style based on greek pottery, it limits the overall smootness of animations, but looks great for the style they wanted) Animations and phsyics of the game, they also tie into gameplay Every boss fight is unique and gameplay is tied to their power in order to win I love the fact that you have freedom of movement to attack and varied attacks depending on how you move Weapons, armor, and items that all feel and look unique, has a good progression throughout the game It's a good Greek mythology game on PC( can't think of  think another one)What You Need to Know: Throwables don't work under water, except a trident( kinda neat)  Good amount of optional side quests and gods to complete that aren't marked on the minimap  You can use the minimap while moving( don't even know how much I love this feature) and is required for some challenges  Story is good enough and voice acting is great. This isn't God of War quality here, but it's also a much smaller game and team.  Physics and connection of hits can look weird at times, but nothing to complain about Weapons degrade overtime, which is good because it forces you to try all the weapons and not just the best one I never bought weapons or items, only recipes and weapon training. You don't get game changing god like powers similar to GOD of WARMy Score:APaid: $2.50Completed in: 13 hoursGames similar:   Dust: An Elysian Tail( very stylized gameplay)  Cortex Command( physics based combat and movement)  Mount and Blade( how you control your attacks) "

												You begin in a ravaged town, scavenging for crude weapons in true farmer militia fashion as you battle back marauding pillagers. The tone is desolate, and horror surrounds you; you must fight your way out of the darkness. The combat system is slasher, and reminds me of Mountain Blade or Chivalry; with timing, postioning, and range being important factors of success. Ultimately, however, I found the combat to be clunky and a bit unsatisfiying with a feeling of weightlessness. Not that the combat is bad, it is fine, but it is hardly the games selling point. The gameplay really shines when scenarios of total warfare erupt and really serve of the striking imagery of the game. The visuals are truly what make this game stick; it is as if you ""watching"" a piece of art, rather than playing a video game...  Apotheon is the perfect example of an art style setting a game apart from its competition, In fact, nothing about Apotheon is unique or compelling except for the greek-themed art direction. The game is an open-world, side-scrolling action RPG and it performs quite well in that capacity, but; you should buy it because it is pretty.			"

												I had decided to take a break from my usual gaming direction revolving around waifu bait and Japanime, and turned my attention towards my second favorite culture, Greek Mythology.  In addition to offering surprisingly fun platforming gameplay, Apotheon does a great job of capturing the essence of the Olympian gods and their attitudes.  Especially Hera.  Zeus must have slept with a really hot mortal girl to get Hera that riled up.  The only gripe I would have is the Nephilim tier main character, Nikandreos.  Who evidently is a mortal capable of running around Olympus and slaying everything, including the gods.  They were called immortals for a reason, you know.  But I guess staying 100% true to the lore and having Zeus send him straight to Hades in the first five minutes would have made for a lousy game, so I'll give them a pass on that.  All and all, it was a wildly enjoyable game that any fan of Greek myth should like.  It even has a Dionysus drinking game!10/10...I'll never forget you, Athena. Not ever.			"

												I purchased the game based solely on the strong thematic ancient greek mythology aesthetic.  In that sense I wasn't disappointed.  The game is wonderous to look at.  The game itself is a simple platformer, with lots of loot and different types of weapons.  The controls are adequate, but the jumping mechanism seems delayed or poorly responsive.  I played mainly on the Xbox 360 Controller, until I couldnt beat Zeus, where keyboard and mouse rspond much better, albeit still not greatly. Overall, I enjoyed it thoroughly despite the controls being a little bit off. Highly recommended for the visual style.			"

												A great game; and as others have said, the art and music are amazing so make sure you snap up the soundtrack on your way to the checkout, especially if it's on sale.This game has controller support, which I would recommend you use (I used X360). The combat is a little strange and unintuitive for this genre so be prepared to get used to what controls like a twin-stick shooter X platformer (you pretty much have to manually tell your character to face either left or right and up or down using the right-stick).Boss battles are quite tricky; I rage-quitted the Artemis one a couple of times. At least there's god mode in the console commands.Good mythology too.8/10			"

												I don't usually write reviews, but this game deserves one.It's graphics are gorgeous as it replicates greek arts and style. Combat is clever and kept fresh since it forces you to constantly use different weapons since they have limited duribility. You might think this will be annoying, but it isn't. Each type of weapon are good in their own way. I ended up using maybe around 15 different kind of melee weapons by the end of the game; this includes tridents, flaming swords, iron rods, and spears (my favorite). I can say the same for ranged weapons as well. You can use arrows, hatchets, and more.The map design is well done. In the grand scheme of things, the entire map is split into themes that match a personality of the associated gods. Ares, god of war, rules over a bloody, trap-filled, chaotic battler areana. Athena, goddess of wisdom, has a revolving maze. Each theme can and will change the way you battle your enemies.The story is brought to life thanks to the great voice acting. If you have played God of War, this story will seem very similar since you have to deal with different gods.Overall I would definitely recommend this game! If you have around 10-12 hours of spare time, use it on Apotheon.			"

												Apotheon is a fantastic adventure/side-scroller. The art is beautiful, the story is great, the fighting system is pretty solid. There's plenty to do but not so much that you'll be overwhelmed. I usually don't feel led to accomplish a ton of side quests that only amount to extra loot or require a lot of running around, but something about Apotheon genuinely made me want to. Maybe it was the rich world the story takes place in, I'm not quite sure, but it was something I've found lacking in a lot of other similar games that give you free reign to explore.Sure, the game has its setbacks. Sometimes you get absolutely bombarded by enemies and it gets repetitive or stressful, the default controls can be a bit awkward (especially if you're left-handed like me, even though I'm used to having to mess around with controls for Steam games), and the game has crashed on me a couple time, but it auto-saves frequently, so it's generally no big deal. I also adore how the developers took so much time to research and properly implement different aspects of ancient Greek mythology, art, and culture into the game, you can tell a lot of love went into it. This game has made it into my top 10 favorite video games in record time, and I'm definitely looking forward to whatever the developer, Alien Trap is planning next.			"

												+Astonishing design+Atmosphere+Combat and weapon system (finally something different!)+Sound(-track)+Content to explore even after the story is over-Pretty short story (I'm now done after ~9h and I can tell you I didn't rush or hurry..)-Multiple crashes and glitches (getting stuck in a wall so you have to restart the game, not too bad but a bit annoying, on Mac at least)-Movement, especially jumping and rolling, was a bit too bulky for my taste. There are parts in the game [SPOILER WARNING] in Athenas temple where you have to jump and dodge etc. and with the current movement set these were more annoying than enjoyable.Overall a cool looking nice game, would totally buy again. I did very much enjoy the experience and the game is certainly as mentioned before not over just because the story is.You should totally get this one if you're into mythology and nice game design. 8/10			"

												Apotheon is the fight of Nikandreos ('Victory of Man') against Zeus & the Gods of Olympus who have decided to destroy humanity once & for all. Nikandreos must travel through the realms of the lesser gods & defeat them, taking their powers & climbing higher up Olympus to battle Zeus. Although the platforming is simplistic & the combat a little clunky, the ambience of the game is beautiful. I love the artstyle, the whole game appearing as if it is wrapped around an ancient Greek vase, the visuals complimented by an excellent music score & voice acting. Each god's realm has a thought-out, distinctive feel & challenge - Hades is a dark, claustrophic place inhabited by shades clawing at the living, Artemis' glade is serene but full of dangerous beasts & Athena's realm is an ever shifting maze requiring strategy to nagivate. This approach carries over to Nikandreos, who can equip a surprisingly wide variety of weapons and armour to face Zeus (my personal favourites are the weapons & arrows with 'backstab' stats).Apotheon is beautiful to look at and a pleasure to play.

												As a classicist I may be a little biased, but I really enjoyed this game. The black-figure art style is what initially attracted me and made Apotheon an instant buy. Both the art and the music are beautiful, and the inclusion of quotations from the Homeric hymns and other source materials was a nice touch, and much appreciated.About the only (relatively minor) negative thing I could say about the game is that I felt that despite the huge variety in weapons and items, it didn't really seem to matter much what I used. I just picked something and only really switched when it broke or if it just wasn't getting the job done. Usually this just meant a switch from melee to ranged on a few bosses that seemed to call for it, and the occasional enemy like peltasts or mechanical sentries that were difficult to get in melee range of, rather than any specific weapon choice within those classifications. Given the realtive speed with which equipment breaks though, I did get a chance to use pretty much everything the game had to offer, however. Despite my slight ambivalence toward the combat in general, the variety in boss fights and trials, from brawling with Ares  and hunting Artemis, to traversing Athena's shifting labyrinth, to the time trials such as Dionysus' drinking contest and crossing the river Phlegethon in Hades, kept things fresh and entertaining. The encounters and puzzles were well done and provided an adequate level of challenge, but nothing proved particularly difficult. So, I might have liked to have the option to play on Olympian difficulty from the beginning, rather than have to unlock it by beating the game. There is a decent amount of content in the way of optional/side-quests to satisfy the completionist as well.All in all, Apotheon was a very enjoyable experience and highly recommended! Well done to Alientrap for this gem.			"

												Simply put, it's a pretty enjoyable game to both play and look at! The art style is something new to look at and combat is very simple but varied enough to allow for stratization. You get a multitude of weapons with their own strengths and some special weapons that have special abilities to up the antie during a fight. You have armour and when you upgrade ypur amour from a lower level peice, you get to keep all peices of armour and customize your look with a lower level piece of armour (if thats the look you are going for) without having the downfall of losing armour points when downgrading  from higher to lower. All lore fits whithin greek mythology (Zeus is the same a man-♥♥♥♥♥; tyrant son of a gun that we all kmow and love) and the plot stays true to the formula: man rises up from their devastation and hands the gods their butts on a bronze platter. One negative is that you can catch the A.I, on corners and pick them off with a longer ranged weapon really easily (might not be a bad thing depending on how you play). Another would be the music  in some stages , like the very last stage, would end and would have a 30 second delay were it wouldn't repeat and then it would after 30 or so seconds, kind of killing the ambiance and mood. Also the Poseidon stage in certain areas when traveling with the boat, there would be complete silence unless you were fighting. That stage in particular wouldn't need music, as the desolation of the Sea would fit the silence, but it could benefit from at least the sound of wood creaking, water splashing against the boat or for at least the seagulls that fly over your head to cry, Other than those minor nitpicks, the game is absolutely perfect.I would recommend this game to anyone intrigued with the art style, anyone who played (and enjoyed) God of War, anyone who is familar with Greek Mythology or who just likes Greek Mythology infused movies (Clash of Titans, etc.) or anyone who is a casual gamer (Or hard core if you like to play games that don't require thousands of hours to master). It's really fun and it's price is just for the type of game that it is.			"

												Everyone should buy Apotheon. It didn't release through early access, it wasn't kickstarted, and the gameplay is really solid, yet for some reason it's not even on the 5th page of the Steam Top Sellers under games like H1Z1 and Stranded: Deep. That really, really sucks and it just shows where the industry is going if nobody is buying functional, innovative games in favor of broken, incomplete garbage.			"

												So far the surprise of the year for me.Great soundtrack, voiceover, story, sidequests and platforming. The actual action can feel a bit wonky but it helps adding to the gameplay value when you finally manages to headsmash an axe to an enemies face.Put this one on to your wishlist if you are an fan of oldskools like Prince of Persia, Flashback or Blackthorne.

												Just finished this game and having never written a review for a game here on Steam; I felt compelled to do so (call it, will of the gods). I thoroughly enjoyed it and hereby recommend it!  Rise, Nikandreos, protect your people and destroy the evil gods! Pros:- Matches ancient greek art perfectly (seriously, compare the game to actual black-figure pottery art)- Music - Voice acting (even if it sounds British)- Gameplay - changing and challenging, but not so difficult you pull your hair out- Extracts from written history/mythology (such as Homer's Illiad) adds great immersion into the gameCons:- A few dollars too much perhaps (I bought it on sale but would be happy to pay more than what I did, just not the normal price) - Campaign could include maybe two or three more levels to give it some more gametime, but just go for all the achievements and that'll extend (obviously)I did not experience any glitches, bugs, or problems while playing. Ran perfectly at maximum settings.			"

You get quite a lot of hours of game play out of it, combat can get tricky since you will have your hands all over the place trying to get the right hot keys and right clicks, but it's not too bad. The art and lore are the high point of this game, very refreshing. And as of when I'm writing this review it's on sale and super cheap, you should definitely give it a go.			"

												The art style speaks for itself; based off of ancient Greek pottery art. Love it.The gameplay however is akin to a 2-D game of Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, as in you dodge their attacks and get your hits in. It has a cool array of weapon types (ie fast but weak swords, slow but strong axes, etc.) and enemy types to combat. Even not on sale, this game is worth your time.			"

												Well, if you are an apassionist of ancient Greet culture, you are recommended to check this game out! Although the story line is not related to any Greek myth we are familiar to, the ambient and the missions bring us back to that epic game. The ending is rather though-provoking!

												Firstly. my review mostly lists the problems I had, since you're probably already interested in the game for whatever reason and wondering what might be bad about it.  I definitely played the game all the way through and enjoyed it, especially the boss fights.  The art style is brilliant, and the story is interesting enough (although I don't expect anything epic from a platformer).  I played with an Xbox 360 controller and the movement and controls are mostly solid.The combat was a bit awkward.  It's just impractical to try to aim your weapon AND shield properly with the right thumbstick at the same time while moving around with the left.  I never got used to it.  The weapon switching with a controller is a joke too.  It's impossible to accurately choose one of dozens of weapons with the d-pad in the middle of combat.   You have to pause the game and switch in the inventory screen if you don't want to be carved up while finding the right weapon.  The being said, the combat does take a little bit of brains to know when to attack and with what against whom.My biggest problem was the weapon/shield breaking mechanic.  Some weapons are more useful against a lot of foes, and some are kind of niche.  You tend to want to save the useful ones for potentially harder fights because they break so fast.  This means sometimes you're using terrible weapons against certain weaker foes just to hold onto the good weapons.  Shields break way too fast for you to be blocking with any regularity as well.  You do get a fair bit of replacement weapons, but you never know when the next good weapon or good shield is coming up, so I tended to try to conserve, which threw any battle strategy in the trash (there are so many health potions you can just keep healing instead of fighting well).  I feel like it would be a lot more fun if at least shields (and preferably weapons) were indestructible, because then you could use the weapons/shields to fit the strategy per enemy instead of playing resource management.  It's not unplayable by any means, just a moderate annoyance.			"

												     I haven't finished the game yet,but I still have something to say.    This is an interesting horizontal version ""open-world"" action game. In this game, playing as an ancient Greek warrior, you are going to fight against Zeus who has turned his back on human. Here are some good points of this game:    1.Open world. You can explore nearly all the places in the game and kill nearly all the NPCs you meet;    2.Wonderful graphics. Just like ancient Greek wall paintings;    3.Various weapons. Spear, bow, Greek fire......remember: normal weapons will be broken if they are used for many times.			"

												The outstanding art and theme really outshine most of the problems with this fun and immersive game about man and god duking it out in ancient Greece. This is a game in the style of Metroid where dungeons/levels can be tackled in any order.The game aims to resemble a rotating vase of Greek origin and succeeds magnificiently.  It looks like you are playing a game on a piece of ancient greek pottery.  The unique art style and story wasn't thrown together in a couple hours; the developers really did their research when it came to Greek mythology and captured all the flaws and craziness of Greek dieties.  There are flavor text signposts all around the world and great voice acting.  The final climb up to Zeus is awesome and has memorable voice acting.  Levels and boss battles are unique; my favorite was the fight against Artemis when you alternate between deer and hunter.Unforunately there are a couple flaws which may turn off some people.  The game is physics based so fighting and jumping is ""floaty"". Control is not precise like a Metroid game.  Also, the inventory management is a mess and there are way too many weapons and items.  I understand the developers wanted to give the players choices but there are too many weapons to cycle through during combat and selecting items is a similar pain.  There should have been fewer weapons and items or you should have been able to set certain items to quick keys/buttons.  I recommend a controller for maximum enjoyment but still expect to be frustrated by the inventory system.I understand the game will not be for everyone but give it a chance (at least until a boss fight) as I think the developers did a great job capturing the world of ancient Greek gods in video game form.

												Apotheon, a game of art and challenging game levels.Apotheon is a game with basic flaws. It is a game about a man who is destined to become a God by killing the Gods that turned their back from humanity. The Gods have desecrated their promises to the humans and now they left humanity in utter chaos.The game has very basic controls that need to get used to if you're new to side scrolling games.Apotheon has one of the most beautiful graphics I have ever seen in a game. It is truly a work of art and a true masterpiece. The game's graphics has the type of art that ancient greek vases have. I like that ancient and mythical feel to the game.The game has a very nice soundtrack that sets the mood in each place that you visit.I warn players that become angry easily to hard games because this game is very challenging in some levels, but it adds to the realism and fun of it.The game is beautiful and aesthetic and because of this I give this game a 9/10. I wish it was longer and it had more awesome quests that involve more player freedom.Buy this game! It wont dissapoint! I promise!			"

												OK it's fair to say I'm a big fan of Ancient Greece and Greek Mythology but even so, this is a really fun platformer action game, reminiscent of the old platformer 'Gods' although this is only focused on Greece.So far it's been very entertaining, the story is simple but compelling and thematically the game is excellent. The music, art style, characters and such is very well done. I only noticed recently that the game levels are actually painted on a rock or plaster surface. Very nice touch. You can tell this has been a labour of love and they haven't bit off more than they can chew in the art direction and design. Initially you may think the simple palette limited compared to the vibrance of contemporary games but actually it is very subtle and it doesn't take too long see why they did it. Awesome work.Gameplay is simple yet varied enough to maintain your interest through the hack'n'slash. There have been a few surprises that have me wondering what else they have up their sleeve. I'm really enjoying the variety of equipment that's all tied back to actual Greek weapons and armour with a few added mythological notes as you'd expect.All in all, a well crafted game. Enough complexity and the difficulty so far has been challenging enough without bumping it up to 'champion' level.Great stuff by the developer to put this all together. And I got it for $5. Go buy this and take a break from the AAA titles!			"

												I think I've found a new favorite sidescroller; it isn't all that often that one of those comes around where I don't roll my eyes and leave it after the first half hour. Pros:- Story. The story strays into the cliche at times, but otherwise is wonderfully crafted and engaging- Voice acting. This is something plenty games, especially sidescrollers, lack. The voice acting is spot on- Depth. The game has plenty locations to explore and plenty treasures to find, keeping the player interested and roaming- Accuracy. This is something I didn't expect, but the game tosses out old terms and quotes from the Greek poets and        Homer with astonishing regularity. This really helps the world connect back to the ancient Greek roots, unlike plenty other that wore the ""Ancient Greek"" label.- Varied Gameplay. Instead of being same-old, shoot-this kill-that, the game actively switches it up between puzzles, races, platforming challenges, and kill-them-all brawls interspersed with the occassional boss fight or conversation with an NPC. This helps it stay fresh for longer and is a welcome addition- Music. While it may not be to everyone's tastes, the music is hauntingly beautiful if somewhat repetitive after a time- Balance. This sort of game always has trouble balancing between frustratingly dificult and too easy. Apotheon manages it. There were definitely moments of sheer panic where I felt like I was being crushed, but these never crossed the line into an annoyingly hard fight.- Replayability. The first run through, without seeking out side quests or the like, on the easiest settings, takes about 12 hours. Have fun. I persume it will take another 12 on the next difficulty, and a lot more than that on Olympian.Cons:- Controls. Yes, let's talk about the one major failing that this game has; the controls. They aren't all that bad, but suffer on two points: Firstly, platforming is a bit of a nuisance. The game makes you stick to any climbable surface you touch, theoretically making platform puzzles easier but also slowing you down at inopportune moments. Furthermore, archery and thrown weapons are the slightest bit inaccurate and hard to master early on.- Tutorial. The first mission is in essence a tutorial mission. It gives you all the basics, but no more, leaving you to puzzle out the rest on your own. Where do I get more crafting recipes? Wait, my weapons can break? Can I repair them? These questions and more are left to the player to decipher. On the one hand, this can be enjoyable if the player enjoys the challenge and the thrill of discovering something new. On the other, people who want to jump straight in may suffer a few mishaps - I myself ended up fighting a boss with only one spear as my other weapons had worn down.Despite the slightly sticky controls and the imperfect tutorial, this game is still excellent. If you enjoy sidescrollers, story-driven adventure games, or Greek mythology, this game is a perfect fit and I anticipate having a lot of fun with it.			"

												Apotheon----------A great platformer, its strong points are its beautiful design, music track and story. The game gives you a mood that you are exploring a mythic world and you are going to tear the gods from their rule.The music accompanied with this game fits that mood perfectly.You gather armor tiers and you can craft potions which may boost you or summon allies. The armor system is done pretty nice, once you gather higher tier armor, your total armor level expands. That means that once you can still wear your other armor purely for cosmetic reasons while retaining the armor level. There is no experience or statistics system, but the game does not really need that.You do get an array of weaponry with names that stem from ancient Greece. Spears are Doru, swords are Xiphos, etc.The controls are a little floaty, but the developers have taken away frustrations that other platformers have. When you reach the edge of a platform, you hang off of it and you can gradually slide down or climb up.Something I did not really like was the fact that you assault guards who clearly are not hostile to you unless you attack them first. It made me feel a bit like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to attack them first just so I can progress in the game. But this is just my opinion. Ingame, I missed the classic monsters like the Centaur, Pegasus, Minotaur, Manticore, Hydra and the Medusa Gorgon. I was hoping to fight those as well.Furthermore the Steam achievements for Apotheon are a little too easy to gather.----------Nevertheless, Apotheon is a godly game and I really recommend it to anyone into Metroidvania games.

												I love this game unconditionally. I study history at my university, and I love Ancient Greece especially, and I could not stop geeking out over this game. It looks gorgeous, the story is great, and it is one of the most faithful approaches to the Greek myths I've ever seen. On top of that, it's damn fun. Athena's Labyrinth was probably my favorite zone, with all the cool skill challenges, but I was also a fan of the Underworld. The music and lighting down in Hades sometimes made me feel legitimately uneasy, and crossing the River Lethe was slow and tense without being frustrated. My only complaint is that the controls can be a bit sluggish when fighting, which is a bit of a problem in a platformer. Even then, combat made me feel like a badass. I should note, however, that I only played with an XBox controller, so a keyboard and mouse may be quicker and more precise. Other than that, no complaints. As a historian and lover of myth who loves to nitpick, I only noticed two historically inaccurate things: In the game, the sarissa can be held one-handed and thrown, and the pelta is carried on the arm. Besides the fact that these weapons were introduced in Macedonia several centuries after when this game seems to be set, the sarissa required two hands to use, and the pelta (which was invented to be used with the sarissa) was slung over the shoulder. But I digress. Long story short, play this game. Great story, great music, great history, and all-around fun.			"

												After a string of underwhelming and overpriced games I come across this one. Finally, a game worth its price. This game is very well polished and the controls are great. This game is recommended for all fans of half life, team fortress 2, wolfenstein, and even call of duty players..... now hold on a moment you might say, this is a platformer not a FPS, why would I recommend this to FPS players? Well the reason is simple. The game, and especially the controls, feel exactly like a FPS. you attack with left mouse button, use secondary with right mouse. use tertiary with middle mouse. item selection is 1,2,3, and 4. movement is WASD, save is F5, load is F9, jump is spacebar.... this is for all intents and purposes an FPS that has been flattened into 2D and I actually cannot recommend this to people who are not fans of FPS games regardless of whether you like platformers or not.

												I reccommend this game, but with a few notes. It's difficult to play with the computer controls. I'd reccomend having a controller to play. The other neutral things I'd have to say about this game is it does get a bit reptitive, and can be finished in about 12 hours or so. Otherwise, the music and graphics are absolutely stunning. I've never experienced a game that is as uniquely artistic as this one is. All in all, I did enjoy, I just wish there was more!			"

												Who doesn't love the weird (and most often times twisted) tales of Greek mythology. Now come to life! You play as Nik, the hopeful defender of mankind, as the gods go crazy and don't want humans around anymore. The game play is pretty straight forward and creating/sorting through items is (thankfully) easy. Boss battles are challenging. Loved taking the gods legendary items by force!! Rarge! Overall an amazing 2D game that combines all that we love about mythology.     9/10Ps,Hera can suck it! Same with Apollo.			"

												If you need something new, this is your game. Has an original feel with an amazing art style. Yes, the fighting combat is a little clunky but you get thousands (not actually) different types of weapons to harness your ability to fight your enemies...The shield mechanic is KEY and feels so nice to block incoming attacks with. The story is simple yet intriguing as you ascend higher into Mount Olympus, opening up more levels to go to, mostly in any order you want, making your way to Zeus.10/10 for not letting me down with the ending. Last fight ruled.			"

												The outstanding art and theme really outshine most of the problems with this fun and immersive game about man and god duking it out in ancient Greece. This is a game in the style of Metroid where dungeons/levels can be tackled in any order.The game aims to resemble a rotating vase of Greek origin and succeeds magnificiently.  It looks like you are playing a game on a piece of ancient greek pottery.  The unique art style and story wasn't thrown together in a couple hours; the developers really did their research when it came to Greek mythology and captured all the flaws and craziness of Greek dieties.  There are flavor text signposts all around the world and great voice acting.  The final climb up to Zeus is awesome and has memorable voice acting.  Levels and boss battles are unique; my favorite was the fight against Artemis when you alternate between deer and hunter.Unforunately there are a couple flaws which may turn off some people.  The game is physics based so fighting and jumping is ""floaty"". Control is not precise like a Metroid game.  Also, the inventory management is a mess and there are way too many weapons and items.  I understand the developers wanted to give the players choices but there are too many weapons to cycle through during combat and selecting items is a similar pain.  There should have been fewer weapons and items or you should have been able to set certain items to quick keys/buttons.  I recommend a controller for maximum enjoyment but still expect to be frustrated by the inventory system.I understand the game will not be for everyone but give it a chance (at least until a boss fight) as I think the developers did a great job capturing the world of ancient Greek gods in video game form.

												     I haven't finished the game yet,but I still have something to say.    This is an interesting horizontal version ""open-world"" action game. In this game, playing as an ancient Greek warrior, you are going to fight against Zeus who has turned his back on human. Here are some good points of this game:    1.Open world. You can explore nearly all the places in the game and kill nearly all the NPCs you meet;    2.Wonderful graphics. Just like ancient Greek wall paintings;    3.Various weapons. Spear, bow, Greek fire......remember: normal weapons will be broken if they are used for many times.			"

Looks amazing, but marred with clunky combat and technical issuesMove over God of War there is another game based on Greek mythology and it is Apotheon. Sure some Greek Gods show up as personas in Persona 3 or playable gods in Smite, but there aren’t many games entirely set in Greek mythology. With all that said, it is very unfortunate that Apotheon doesn’t do anything much with its’ story. The story is similar to that of God of War without the constant talk of being angry and yearning to have revenge. Zeus being a jerk that he is abandons humanity causing chaos and grief. You play as Nikandreous, a Greek warrior that saves his town from an attack from bandits. He is then greeted by Hera and she explains that the origin of humanity’s suffering is caused by Zeus. The only way Nikandreous can save humanity is by killing gods gaining their power and eventually challenging Zeus. The visual design is Apotheon’s strongest suit and makes an immediate impact once the game is booted up for the game for the first time. The game looks as if you were playing on ancient Greek pottery. There is a loving attention to detail from how the characters move across the screen as if they were drawn on actual pottery. One striking example is how your character climbs ladders on its’ sides rather than directly in front of it. The colors match the ancient Greek pottery to a tee, with an emphasis on yellow and red hues. Unfortunately, the game rarely mixes up its’ art style. I found the yellow and red hues especially difficult to look at for gaming sessions longer than an hour. It felt like the equivalent of playing back to back Mario lava levels for one hour straight. There are some some levels that introduce blue and green hues, but they are the exception to the rule.The gameplay in Apotheon plays like a metroidvania game without the gating element. Once you have access to lockpicks and Greek fire which is gained a little past the tutorial, you’re free navigate to any area within a level. You do gain powers by defeating bosses in Apotheon, but they only serve to advance the story and improve Nikandreous’ combat effectiveness.Speaking of combat, Nikandreous can wield swords, axes, lances, bows, maces and more. Each weapon has a wind-up time as well as an attack range requiring the player to switch between weapons mid-combat depending on the situation. Attacking an enemy with a spear that’s too close and the spear won’t connect. You can throw your weapon directly at the enemy and pick it back up, offering a stylish alternative to finish off a ranged enemy without resorting to bows or javelins. There is also a stamina bar that prevents you from spamming attacks. Rounding out the list of combat options are shields, a combat roll and craftable utility items like Greek Fire, potions and armor kits.The combat sounds well designed but is easily abused. Ranged combat works as intended, but become extended affairs especially against shielded foes. There is no enemy collision so you can literally walk into the enemy and swing at him until he dies. In fact you can do this with almost any weapon even spears as long as you have Nikandreous aim directly above or below. Once I was out of stamina, I would roll out the way, let it recharge and redo this process. I was able to repeatedly do this even against late game foes.The other issue with the combat is its’ physics. There are some enemies that can throw Nikandreous. On one occasion, my character was thrown into a wall and clipped through the other side. On another occasion, my character clipped through a wall and was instakilled. There are also explosions and certain enemies that can knockback Nikandreous. The knockbacks have a tendency to bounce Nikandreous ludicrously high in the air allowing you to skip major portions of a level if timed correctly.Inventory management is unintuitive and clunky. The weapons and items are arranged vertically as small icons and becomes a mess to go through especially halfway into the game. There is no way to sell items so you’ll often find yourself rummaging through ten to twenty melee and ranged weapons. Adding insult to injury is that some weapons are completely buggy. The discus weapon for example is a boomerang-like weapon, that returns to Nikandreous after being thrown. Once the discus returns to the player, the weapon is automatically equipped. There were occasions when the discus was permanently affixed as my equipped weapon and I was unable to change weapons. In order to fix the issue, I had to throw the discus and have it get stuck in the environment. Also there is no quest log and I wasn’t even aware that there were optional quests until I checked the item section in my inventory.Technical issues also find its’ way in the audio department. The music was fine, but the sound effects and voice acting were completely silent. After some quick Google searches, I discovered that the game does not work for speakers in surround sound settings and must be set to stereo. I had my speakers set to surround sound for over a year and this is the first game where I’ve encountered such an issue.Ultimately Apotheon is a satisfactory but flawed metroidvania type game. The game is absolutely gorgeous and nails the ancient Greek pottery art look. But looks are the only thing the game does right, everything else about Apotheon is marred with clunky combat and technical issues. I can’t recommend Apotheon to anyone unless if you’re into Greek Art. If you want to play a metroidvania game that looks great and does its’ combat justice I would recommend playing Guacamelee instead.			"

What I liked: Art style is amazing and fits the over all theme perfectly( an art style based on greek pottery, it limits the overall smootness of animations, but looks great for the style they wanted) Animations and phsyics of the game, they also tie into gameplay Every boss fight is unique and gameplay is tied to their power in order to win I love the fact that you have freedom of movement to attack and varied attacks depending on how you move Weapons, armor, and items that all feel and look unique, has a good progression throughout the game It's a good Greek mythology game on PC( can't think of  think another one)What You Need to Know: Throwables don't work under water, except a trident( kinda neat)  Good amount of optional side quests and gods to complete that aren't marked on the minimap  You can use the minimap while moving( don't even know how much I love this feature) and is required for some challenges  Story is good enough and voice acting is great. This isn't God of War quality here, but it's also a much smaller game and team.  Physics and connection of hits can look weird at times, but nothing to complain about Weapons degrade overtime, which is good because it forces you to try all the weapons and not just the best one I never bought weapons or items, only recipes and weapon training. You don't get game changing god like powers similar to GOD of WARMy Score:APaid: $2.50Completed in: 13 hoursGames similar:   Dust: An Elysian Tail( very stylized gameplay)  Cortex Command( physics based combat and movement)  Mount and Blade( how you control your attacks) "

												This is one of the best mythology based games Ive ever played, based in a world where the heroes and the monsters are gone. With the fall of the age of bronze and myth comes an age of iron in which zeus loses faith in humanity. The gods abandon the Earth, and only one man can stop them.Although this may sound ""God of War""-ish, the game drops the usual hollywood fluff and special effects for a simpler and more rough myth. It is obvious from the start just how well researched the story was. Although not based on any particular myths, the Gods and other mythic characters are portrayed in a spot-on fashion. The personalities are familiar and correct to the original tales, the places visited such as Hades and the Garden of Artemis feel natural to the legends and impose a vivid and often lasting image. The games aesthetic only furthers these feelings with its use of old Greek art, where the way these ancient people saw the world was immortalized in the only fashion they knew how to use for their time. Even where the game takes liberties in its story, it still rings true to old Greek mythical ideals.What about the combat you may ask?From the start, I realized the combat was challenging. Many have complained that its the controls. Personaly, having beaten the game on the hardest difficulty, I can say this is not the case. Although the creators may have not have used the most ideal system for fighting, it still works quite well. Especially in a game about a mortal challenging the divine. Fighting is challenging and often fun, only frustrating in sections of the game where multiple enemies rush you at once. Weapons, armor, and shields all may break if overused. The key is timing, and the system in place feels well balanced and all-around satisfying.All in all, a must play for anyone who's a fan of mythology. The story, characters, voice-acting, aesthetic, and even combat all wrap up for a very memorable and great work of art. 10/10 imo.			"

												This game is everything I never knew I wanted. Back when it was released, I dismissed it as ""just another metroidvania game"" banking on its unique aesthetic. I bought it on a whim much later, and fell in love. This game has a stunning art style, and unique(ish) combat. Strikes have to be planned deliberately, as there is some (intentional) input lag. Boss battles are memorable and well designed (with a couple exceptions). The story is bare bones but has some great moments. Not for everyone but then nothing is. If you like Greek mythology and metroidvania games pick this one up.			"

												Apotheon is the fight of Nikandreos ('Victory of Man') against Zeus & the Gods of Olympus who have decided to destroy humanity once & for all. Nikandreos must travel through the realms of the lesser gods & defeat them, taking their powers & climbing higher up Olympus to battle Zeus. Although the platforming is simplistic & the combat a little clunky, the ambience of the game is beautiful. I love the artstyle, the whole game appearing as if it is wrapped around an ancient Greek vase, the visuals complimented by an excellent music score & voice acting. Each god's realm has a thought-out, distinctive feel & challenge - Hades is a dark, claustrophic place inhabited by shades clawing at the living, Artemis' glade is serene but full of dangerous beasts & Athena's realm is an ever shifting maze requiring strategy to nagivate. This approach carries over to Nikandreos, who can equip a surprisingly wide variety of weapons and armour to face Zeus (my personal favourites are the weapons & arrows with 'backstab' stats).Apotheon is beautiful to look at and a pleasure to play.

												Wow!  Just finished my first playthrough.  Absolutely fantastic game.This game is incredibly aesthetically pleasing; just a beautifully crafted game.  Combat is fun (sometimes a bit janky) but rewards tactics and improvement.  I will say that it isn't the smoothest combat system, but it is honestly very enjoyable and allows for mastery.  Button mashing exposes your crappiness in this game which is always appreciated.  Exploration unlocks new items (weapons and armour) and never feels repetitive. I even learned a bit about Greek mythology in the process!One glaring problem is a specific bug with the sigil of the necromancer.  Do yourself a favor and look this up before you begin playing.Outside of that though, an incredibly fun and rewarding experience.			"

												An action platformer that goes all-in on the Greek mythology theme. Uses an art style that reminds me of ancient Greece's black-figure pottery.The game has main areas with doorways that lead to realms of gods you have to defeat and eventually you can reach the big boss, Zeus. That's a pretty simplified but accurate description of the game but they use several things to give it more depth: side quests/crafting/simple upgrade system/large variety of weapons/simple puzzles.Controls feel a little different from regular platformers because there is momentum in your movement and the arc of your attack changes based on your position, angle, and weapon choice.If you enjoy the idea of Greek mythology, the theme will pull you in. If you're very familiar with Greek mythology, this game is based on and refers to the mythology but isn't something that really goes deep into it. It's a challenge the gods story and that doesn't really lend to very deep storytelling. There are references and (hopefully accurate) quotes from ancient Greek literature scattered about that give it a little more credibility.Worth a look if you like action platformers and a try if you're into Greek mythology.

												A truly great game. Let alone the rich and well executed mythological Greece theme the gameplay itself is amazing. Fluid and decisive combat, numerous weapon options, craftable potions and traps, side missions and treasure hunting for those who seek it. I'll admit I enjoyed the game far more because I love ancient/mythological Greece (the references in this are on point btw) but aside form that this game really is worth it. I got around 20 hours of gameplay out of it (taking my time finding all chests, searching every nook and cranny) just fyi and I enjoyed every minute of it.			"

A small crew to make a masterfull game. Their list of voice actors is extensive though :D.Lastly, if you enjoy smash bros like multiplayer. then get online with your friends.

												I don't usually write reviews, but this game deserves one.It's graphics are gorgeous as it replicates greek arts and style. Combat is clever and kept fresh since it forces you to constantly use different weapons since they have limited duribility. You might think this will be annoying, but it isn't. Each type of weapon are good in their own way. I ended up using maybe around 15 different kind of melee weapons by the end of the game; this includes tridents, flaming swords, iron rods, and spears (my favorite). I can say the same for ranged weapons as well. You can use arrows, hatchets, and more.The map design is well done. In the grand scheme of things, the entire map is split into themes that match a personality of the associated gods. Ares, god of war, rules over a bloody, trap-filled, chaotic battler areana. Athena, goddess of wisdom, has a revolving maze. Each theme can and will change the way you battle your enemies.The story is brought to life thanks to the great voice acting. If you have played God of War, this story will seem very similar since you have to deal with different gods.Overall I would definitely recommend this game! If you have around 10-12 hours of spare time, use it on Apotheon.			"

												A great game; and as others have said, the art and music are amazing so make sure you snap up the soundtrack on your way to the checkout, especially if it's on sale.This game has controller support, which I would recommend you use (I used X360). The combat is a little strange and unintuitive for this genre so be prepared to get used to what controls like a twin-stick shooter X platformer (you pretty much have to manually tell your character to face either left or right and up or down using the right-stick).Boss battles are quite tricky; I rage-quitted the Artemis one a couple of times. At least there's god mode in the console commands.Good mythology too.8/10			"

												I purchased the game based solely on the strong thematic ancient greek mythology aesthetic.  In that sense I wasn't disappointed.  The game is wonderous to look at.  The game itself is a simple platformer, with lots of loot and different types of weapons.  The controls are adequate, but the jumping mechanism seems delayed or poorly responsive.  I played mainly on the Xbox 360 Controller, until I couldnt beat Zeus, where keyboard and mouse rspond much better, albeit still not greatly. Overall, I enjoyed it thoroughly despite the controls being a little bit off. Highly recommended for the visual style.			"

												I thought i would take a punt on this game a while back, so glad i did. I genuinely thought platform games like this were extinct. The last platform game i enjoyed this much was Castlevania - Symphony of the Night many moons ago on a ps1.Im not comparing the two games im just saying that the fun i got from Apotheon was right up there. The style is like greek pottery has come to life, the character moves fluidly, and theres plenty to explore and find. Apotheon has everything i want to see from this kind of game.  You will have to get good at toggling between weapons though, accidently pulling the wrong weapon can be frustrating and deadly.  If they were to make an Egyptian game like this i'd be on it in an instant.			"

												This game deserves the ""Test of Time"" Award! I've played it many times and each time still felt the same as the first! The way  of telling its story is very peaceful and civilized. It's an old kind of story: the gods get mad at men and abandon them, a hero rises up and defeat the gods. But it's not as vengeful and violent as God of War! The graphic makes me feel like I'm reading the story in a wall-painted picture from thousands of years ago! 10/10!			"

												By now it's likely that you've heard of Apotheon's art style. If not, it is the single most remarkable thing about this game. The whole thing is designed to look like an ancient Greek vase, and it is most effective. The primary colors are orange and black, to resemble the clay and dark ink of the artifacts, with blue on the protagonist's armor and red on those of the enemies, along with occasional changes in background color as is appropriate for each setting (Green for the forest, blue for the sea, and so on.) The art style and animation generate a terrific atmosphere, as well, ancient and mystical and desolate and hopeless. Aesthetically, Apotheon is an absolute masterpiece and deserves every mote of the attention it's gotten.The story is also excellent. With the dawning of the Iron Age, the Gods of Olympus are none too pleased with the direction that humanity has taken, and like Zeus's Christian counterpart, have decided to punish mankind with extinction. Demeter makes it so that nothing will grow, Poseiden stirs up the seas, Apollo denies the Earth light, and Artemis keeps the forests wanting for game. Enter Nikandreos, the hero. He wakes as his home village, Dion, is under attack by raiders. After defending the Temple of Hera from the outsiders, the Queen of Olympus charges Nikandreos with overthrowing Olympus and saving mankind. I won't say any more. While this isn't a game with a great many twists and turns, the development of the story is something you should uncover for yourself. The key here is that the developers really know their stuff when it comes to the Hellenic gods. Each one you meet fits their classical characterization to a tee, and this creates a number of great scenarios, my personal favorite being the Artemis boss fight. None of the gods are simplified or lionized as they have been in a great many modern sources, (God of War or Disney's Hercules this is not) and many of them have aligned against Zeus' abandonment of humanity. In addition, there is a liberal scattering of passages from classical Greek sources throughout the game, each placed to give you a clear impression of the particular obstacle or characters you'll be facing shortly. All in all, while the story itself may not be groundbreaking, it's well researched, well written, and creative, and is a joy to watch unfold.The gameplay is where Apotheon falls a little flat. Most of the time it's fine, your classic action platformer with just enough backtracking and exploration that it could be called a Metroidvania (Though that doesn't quite fit). There are two hubs, the Agora and the Acropolis, with a shop, and each is connected to three major levels each based around a particular god, as well as both having two optional gods each: Aphrodite and Dionysus in the Agora and Hermes and Hephaestus in the Acropolis. These aren't required for the core plot but they are fun, help flesh out the world and each bestows you with a useful upgrade.The place where the game falls short is the combat, specifically. I enjoyed it, don't get me wrong, but it was simply clunkier than it had to be. Essentially, you have three attacks, an uppercut, an overhead strike, and a thrust, in addition to a shield bash. With the exception of the shield bash, which is done by pressing the middle mouse button with the shield up, the rest are far too difficult to pull off consistently or accurately. For example, the overhead attack is done by moving the mouse up and attacking, the uppercut involves moving it down, and the thrust is done by keeping it still. The problem is, the mouse is also used for aiming the attack and controlling the direction Nikandreos is looking. Couple that with highly mobile enemies, a problem that only worsens late in the game with the introduction of flying enemies, and this means that you'll have a hard time predicting exactly how your strike will come out or where it will go. The best thing to do is ""trade blows"", attack, shield, attack, shield, and so on and so forth. However, this can be problematic in the frequent case that you're facing more than one enemy. At that point, I just used the bow and cheesed everything.This isn't fatal, and once you get the hang of it, can be pretty fun. It's just something that will catch you by surprise and can annoy you throughout the game. The other thing to know about the combat is the weapon system. This is not a negative point, but it will be a turn off for some players. Rather than having set weapons that you unlock and can use indefinitely, you have a wide selection of weapons that will break after some use. This has two effects on gameplay: First, you must be a generalist. You can't just stick with the Doru (Spear) or Xiphos (Sword), unless you want to put a great deal of effort into making sure you always have decent durability. Second, you have to learn to preserve the most powerful weapons for the situations where you need them, like you might save the BFG ammo in Doom rather than using it on an imp. As I said, it's not a mark against the game, it's just something not everyone will like.Is Apotheon a masterpiece? Certainly as a work of art. As a game, no, there's plenty of room for improvement. However, while it isn't perfect, it's still a very good time. Hell, the aesthetic alone is worth any gamer's time. I recommend it without reservation. Check it out, I think you'll like it.			"

												Picked up this game in the Summer Steam Sale - I'd never heard of it before then, and wow, was I missing out apparently. This is one of the best platformers I've played in a while, and certainly the most distinctive in art style that I've ever played, period. The whole style of the game looks like any given scene from it could be painted on the side of a Greek vase, and it's this 2D art styling that really gives the game its unique quality, coupled with a solid soundtrack and voice acting, it really sell the 'world' of Apotheon.The combat system is very solid (though it takes some getting used to) and there are tons of weapons, most of which you'll have to use because there is a breakage mechanism so you'll eventually (or quickly) bust your preferred one if you use it too heavily. Sometimes it can feel a little clunky, but when it works, it works well - there's nothing quite as amusing as smacking a cyclops in the back of the head with a boulder or trading spear thrusts with a demigod (or introducing Ares to 'sticky bombs'... heh heh).If I had one thing to criticize, it would be that the game doesn't checkpoint except when you move between areas, so with the levels being very large, this can be a minor problem, at least early on when you might get murdered by beastmen in a swamp or something. You can save whenever you want out of combat, but this convenience feature actually feels like kind of a downside when the game is as immersive as Apotheon is. Popping out to the menu to save so you don't lose too much progress on an oops really breaks the rhythm of it.But that's a minor problem in a game that's otherwise fantastic.			"

												Overall I give this game a 8.5/10 and would definetely reccomend you buy it if you like Platformers and/or Greek MythologyIf you want to know why, continue reading.Compared to other platformers, Apotheon's combat system is amazing, there's an endless combination of weapons and legendary weapons (with their respective affects) to find and evetually, break after beating in someone's skull. Not to mention armor and health upgrades that can not only be found completeing the main quest but in secret stashes and lockboxes hidden off to the side. Enemies are incredibly varied, besides the fact that they all wear red, and none of them will act alike.The only major problems I had with this game is that every single mission in this game is a ""Fed-Ex"" quest, you go to retrieve an item from a God, and that God or their underlings sends you off to go do some♥♥♥♥♥♥(the only exception being Apollo, because he's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) and then you come back, fight a boss, then get the item. All the items give upgrades and you feel accomplished after getting one, but then you remember that you still have to get items from 11 more gods. You might as well carry a checklist while playing this game. The only other annoyance I had was with enemy AI, the AI for the larger enemies (Bosses, Cyclopses, Weird half-animal dudes, etc.) is great, because you can wittily outmanuevur them and shove your spear in their asses. The AI for smaller enemies isn't that great, all of the normal enemies will engage you with whatever weapons they have, and thats it. Enemies like Apollo's Guards will randomly decide to attack you with a bow, drink a potion, run away from you until potion runs out, pull out their sword, stab your toe, and then run away from you again. And obviously there's tons of these guys in one area, so killing them is more of a chore than anything else. Wolves, who only majorly appear in one part of the game, will jump attack you, run as far as the can in one direction, turn around, attack you again, and then run as far as they can in the other direction before repeating everything else. You'd honestly have more luck just running away from them rather than wasting your weapons and armor trying to kill them.There are some pretty great parts in this game though, in Artemis' woods, some nymphs ask you to clear their home of satyrs (Olympus is overcrowded with all of the deities moving in suddenly) and you walk in to promptly find a bunch of goat-men, drunk off their asses with erect♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(someone actually took the time to animated a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on these enemies) humping the air and getting absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d. How do you get them to leave? Smash all the alcohol. Once you do that, they get so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥they kill each other.Oh, and the art style is pretty cool too.Plot Synopsis:You play as Nikandreos, a Greek normalfag from the village of Dion, one day, Zeus decides ""ayy lmao, humans are ♥♥♥♥"" and orders all the other Olympians to neglect mortals. He also invites all deities living on Earth to come to Olympus, so that when all humans die off, everyone can go back to the Earth. Crops refuse to grow, animals disappear from the forest and even the sun lingers at one point in sky all day. Humans being humans, instead of trying to repent/stop the oncoming disaster, they decide that now would be a perfect time to steal everyone else's♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game opens with Nikandreos stopping the pillaging of his village (and other things) by shanking every single mother♥♥♥♥♥♥ wearing a red tunic. At this point you go to the Temple of Hera where she appears, tells you to help the mortals and then sends you off to Olympus, all the while softly caressing your♥♥♥♥♥You roll up on the Olympian Gates acting chill as a mofugga', and the guards who for someone reason, don't recognize you as a mortal let you in to the Agora, which acts as the overworld of the first tier of Mount Olympus.I'd rather not spoil the rest of the game so I'll just say that Olympus is full of fly honies, and that ♥♥♥♥♥ Athena got♥♥♥♥♥for days.

Apotheon is a good game; not great, just good.Aesthetically, it's a gem. Both art and music are excellent and provide a consistent experience.Mechanically, the game is so-so. Combat and platforming feel uncomfortable; they aren't game-breaking but it certainly can be annoying (one of my complains of Capsized, another game by the same developers). Combats can be a little unforgiving, but have occasional great moments (I felt like being in 300). I just hope the developers perfect the feeling of the controls for further games, they don't feel quite right.Level and boss design are just fantastic and work very well with each god's characteristics. No two boss fight feel like the same. They are innovative and fun.The game also provides a very simple crafting system that I rarely had to use (except for the two default recipes: a health and shield regenerators); in fact, I became aware other recipes existed at 80% of my playthrough.Also, Apotheon tries very little to remind the player of the different side missions.TL;DRSeveral design flaws push Apotheon away from being an astonishing game. Nevertheless, it's a worthy experience worth playing.7 / 10			"

												The controls on the PC are very frustrating and clunky, while the game demands a great deal of agility and precision in places.  It could be better on a console I suppose, or if you have something better than a basic computer keyboard. Struggling with the controls results in a great deal of repiition which makes me put the game down quickly. I can't stand repeating things over and over because my guy refuses to climb a ladder at a crucial time or if a key press doesn't register.That said, as the game continues and the player gets more armor and health, things become a bit more forgiving and you can get by with button mashing.

(Well, that's no RPG, but I would have appreciated some optimization options)- Disappointing ""hardest"" difficulty level, which is quite the same as the ""hard"" difficultyFINALLY...8/10, must have indie game for anyone liking 2D action platformer gameApotheon reminds me that videogames can be WORKS OF ART on their own, not only for the graphics, the soundtrack, the animations, but by combining all of these to make an amazing and pleasant experience.COMPLETE COMMENTThis game seduced me with its art style (it's not just beautiful, but also neat and refined) and convinced me with its gameplay, which requires well-timed attacks and dodges, using the right weapon / potion at the right time, diving in the melee like a true warrior, and even sometimes avoiding useless fights.After the first mission which could be considered as a tutorial, you'll be able to chose between two difficulty levels:- The Warrior (easy) one should be adapted for casual gamers and people who want to explore the levels without being threatened much by the enemies- The Champion (hard) difficulty provides a decent challenge and requires to understand well the fighting mechanics and the different enemies- The Olympian difficulty, unlocked when finishing the game once, quite disappointing: it's the same as the Champion one, but without life autoregen when it drops below 50. Don't see the point... Maybe limitting the number of possible saves or save frequency, or giving the enemies more damages / HP would have been great to make this difficulty level worth it.To beat the game, you will be given a variety of weapons with different attack power and range (and sometimes additional effects), but that will break easily, requiring to have a good set of weapons in your inventory before diving in fights. You'll also have armours giving you damage mitigation, and various potions that will become handy (not to say vital) in many situations.The quite rare physics glitches I encountered weren't quite a problem (it's just strange to see an arrow floating in mid-air, as the rest of the game seems just perfect).For ""serial achievers"", you'll need to explore every bit of every map to find the hidden keys, chests and rare weapons, which shouldn't take you too much time but still feels rewarding and pleasant.I'm definitely convinced that this game is simply better, funnier and more challenging than many 60+$ games.

												As a classicist I may be a little biased, but I really enjoyed this game. The black-figure art style is what initially attracted me and made Apotheon an instant buy. Both the art and the music are beautiful, and the inclusion of quotations from the Homeric hymns and other source materials was a nice touch, and much appreciated.About the only (relatively minor) negative thing I could say about the game is that I felt that despite the huge variety in weapons and items, it didn't really seem to matter much what I used. I just picked something and only really switched when it broke or if it just wasn't getting the job done. Usually this just meant a switch from melee to ranged on a few bosses that seemed to call for it, and the occasional enemy like peltasts or mechanical sentries that were difficult to get in melee range of, rather than any specific weapon choice within those classifications. Given the realtive speed with which equipment breaks though, I did get a chance to use pretty much everything the game had to offer, however. Despite my slight ambivalence toward the combat in general, the variety in boss fights and trials, from brawling with Ares  and hunting Artemis, to traversing Athena's shifting labyrinth, to the time trials such as Dionysus' drinking contest and crossing the river Phlegethon in Hades, kept things fresh and entertaining. The encounters and puzzles were well done and provided an adequate level of challenge, but nothing proved particularly difficult. So, I might have liked to have the option to play on Olympian difficulty from the beginning, rather than have to unlock it by beating the game. There is a decent amount of content in the way of optional/side-quests to satisfy the completionist as well.All in all, Apotheon was a very enjoyable experience and highly recommended! Well done to Alientrap for this gem.			"

It plays like God of War, and the music sounds like it can belong to either game. Jumping does feel weird but once you get a handle for the controls you're in for a great challenge and  great game.Also, deicide. Deicide is fun. "

Fluid and decisive combat, numerous weapon options, craftable potions and traps, side missions and treasure hunting for those who seek it. I'll admit I enjoyed the game far more because I love ancient/mythological Greece (the references in this are on point btw) but aside form that this game really is worth it. I got around 20 hours of gameplay out of it (taking my time finding all chests, searching every nook and cranny) just fyi and I enjoyed every minute of it.			"

The style is like greek pottery has come to life, the character moves fluidly, and theres plenty to explore and find. Apotheon has everything i want to see from this kind of game.  You will have to get good at toggling between weapons though, accidently pulling the wrong weapon can be frustrating and deadly.

												This is great game, for the most part. Throughout the game there were a number of instances where I found slight errors occuring with the controls. BUT, the one thing that I found nearly unforgivable was the extreme number of control errors that I came across when battling Zeus. Not only did I experience an excessive number of controling errors, but at random points throughout the fight my potions of invulnerability would cease to work. All around this is a decent game, but the pricing feels high for me at 15 dollars, I purchased the game on sale for 7.50, which feels much more reasonable.			"

												What a wonderful game.The story was magnificent, accurate enough to please most any mythology buff, and long enough to have resolution. The main story is excellent because you can work your way towards it quickly or thoroughly. There is plenty more to discover than what is necessary to reach the end of the game. The gameplay is interesting and takes some getting used to. It is quality sidescrolling and the level design is quite excellent. Fighting (which is the main mechanic) can be tricky and frankly a bit clumsy, but it works well enough.Now the best parts of the game are the music and art. All of the levels are done in this beautiful classical era art. It is like you are playing the whole thing on the side of a vase. The music is epic in the right places, beautiful in others.Definitely a great game, probably about an 8/10 at least.			"

												Oh man I had so much fun with this game.  On every level, it was lovely, the gameplay was fun, the art style was beautiful, and the presentation of Greek Mythology was absolutely spot on.Honestly, thinking back on it now, I'm just amazed at all the things you get to do in this game! Sail the sea Play a drinking game at a party Manneuver a labyrinth Escape from a prison Hunt down a gang of assassins Explore underwater ruins Fight in a trap-filled arena Fight a Cyclops Fight underwater Fight on horseback Get turned into a stag and survive being hunted by Artemis for long enough until she turns into a stag and you get a chance to hunt her, and take turns like this until one of you kills the other!I understand a lot of people have trouble with the combat, so they come away thinking it's floaty and imprecise.  I absolutely loved the combat, so here's some advice for anyone about to start the game:  it's all about controlling the distance between you and the enemy!A spear can only damage at its point, so if a baddie gets between you and the point of your spear, you won't be able to hit him until you put some distance between you.  Spears are good if you want to stay at a distance, but you have to make sure the enemy doesn't close in on you.  Swords are close range and deal damage along their entire edge, but are easily blocked by shields.  Axes and Maces are slow to attack, but do so at an arc - if you're really good you can time your attacks to swing over an enemy shield and hit them on the head.  Swords > Spears > Axes > Swords, it's really well-balanced, and you'll be switching weapons all the time to get an advantage!On top of that, you get to explore this beautifully-drawn world of Greek pottery and meet some of the biggest names in Greek mythology as you ascend Mount Olympus.  I whole-heartedly recommend it!			"

												The study of Ancient Greek history and mythology is one of my primary hobbies so it's hard for me to gauge how much not appreciating many of/all the wonderful touches, references and stories within this game would impact someone's enjoyment. The aesthetics are perfect and, once you get used to the combat system, the game is enjoyable in its own right also. There are plenty of side missions, achievements, secrets, etc. and a wide variety of game styles are incorporated within the whole so there's something for everyone while not alienating anyone. Absolutely recommended if you have any interest in Ancient Greece whatsoever.			"

												I don't really know what to say about this game, my experience with it was somewhat mixed.Let's start with the pros, the music is awesome which is always a plus, the mythology and the story with the way its told are nice, the art style is cool and unique, the game is not short, and the voice acting is top notch.The cons outweigh the pros in my opinion, why can't I sell something from my inventory? Why the weapons have such a tight durability that it breaks before I even get to enjoy it a little bit? Why there is no meaningful progression system to feel rewarded? Why the UI and the inventory are so freaking hard to access and to use (most of the times I couldn't pick the right weapon and the right potion in mid fight because it's so confusing and insufficient to use)? These problems could be easily fixed by the developers, I don't see a reason why it's the way it is.The fighting mechanics are overly simplified, the gameplay gets repetitive easily as the art style and assets keeps repeating themselves the whole game (except for few levels which were unique with superior quality than some other levels), there is no meaningful rewards for exploration, all you get is the same few weapons, few armor upgrades (I wouldn't really call them upgrades) and some items to craft potions, that's it, The same 4 or 5 enemies types are all of what this game have, they are not really unique from each other as well,  Again my experience was mixed, it took me 15 hours to beat this game on the hard difficulty, some of these hours felt fun while most of the times it felt like a chore to finish the game, I'm barely recommending this game just for the music, the story and the concept, but overall it's just an average game that gets a 5 out of 10 in my book.

												I'm generally very picky when it comes to Metroidvania-style games, but this game hit the nail on the head. Fans of either Castlevania or greek mythology need to give this game a try. Pro's:*A compelling world to explore. The artstyle and ancient greek lore work very well. There are also quite a lot of secrets to find. The Greek gods are the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you expect them to be and it makes for a satisfying story. * Good selection of weapons, which facilitate exciting and fast-paced combat.* Combat AI of enemies seems well-made, ducking and blocking to avoid your attacks.* Well-made boss battles. Con's:* The art style is somewhat low in contrast, making things hard to distinguish sometimes, especially in the map screen* Weapon durability system. I'm generally not a fan of weapons breaking, and since you can't repair equipment you will need to find replacements. These are, fortunately, abundant, even for the magic weapons. The abundancy of said magic weapons makes them feel less special, though. * the rewards for treasure hunting drop off when you have eventually found all types of weapons. There's not a new weapon around every corner, like would be the case in Castlevania.  "

												I love the amount of dedication and research that went into this game! I am a die-hard mythology nerd, and it makes my heart sing whenever I see a little tidbit from the original sources here and there. The art is absolutely astounding, and the music pins the atmosphere down. The only issue I have with this game is that the combat system is a little wonky. At times, my character got hit and went flying off to gods-know-where and it becomes a small challenge to get back into the battle. The controls are a bit funny and take some time getting used to (I was only truly comfortable with the controls on my SECOND god battle, which meant a very interesting and frustrating first god battle). However, I honestly believe that the authenticity and beauty of the game are truly worth these shortcomings. This game is definitely among my top favorites, and I'll continue to play it again and again in the future.			"

A big pro to this game is the AI which even on normal difficulty, which is the easiest, gives you trouble, and when u are fighting u really have that satisfaction when u block an attak right in the last moment or kill your enemy with a badass throw of spear :))) The sidequests are also very fun to do and they don't feel like a burden, and are somtimes funny too.

												I don't really know what to say about this game, my experience with it was somewhat mixed.Let's start with the pros, the music is awesome which is always a plus, the mythology and the story with the way its told are nice, the art style is cool and unique, the game is not short, and the voice acting is top notch.The cons outweigh the pros in my opinion, why can't I sell something from my inventory? Why the weapons have such a tight durability that it breaks before I even get to enjoy it a little bit? Why there is no meaningful progression system to feel rewarded? Why the UI and the inventory are so freaking hard to access and to use (most of the times I couldn't pick the right weapon and the right potion in mid fight because it's so confusing and insufficient to use)? These problems could be easily fixed by the developers, I don't see a reason why it's the way it is.The fighting mechanics are overly simplified, the gameplay gets repetitive easily as the art style and assets keeps repeating themselves the whole game (except for few levels which were unique with superior quality than some other levels), there is no meaningful rewards for exploration, all you get is the same few weapons, few armor upgrades (I wouldn't really call them upgrades) and some items to craft potions, that's it, The same 4 or 5 enemies types are all of what this game have, they are not really unique from each other as well,  Again my experience was mixed, it took me 15 hours to beat this game on the hard difficulty, some of these hours felt fun while most of the times it felt like a chore to finish the game, I'm barely recommending this game just for the music, the story and the concept, but overall it's just an average game that gets a 5 out of 10 in my book.

												Mechanically elementary and with a basic narrative, Apotheon is an experience made worthwhile by the atmosphere it cultivates and its satisfyingly simple gameplay.			"

												Really great with steam controller. Amazing game, however there are a few bugs (stuff like an AIs getting caught in the doorway). Definitely worth $15 though.			"

												Wow. This game is a masterpiece. Slowly, after fighting some gods, you grow stronger, and eventually become strong enough to kil gods. The ending of this game hit me like a wall of bricks. This game has fun combat, tight controls, and WONDERFUL storytelling.			"

												One of the best games I've played in years. Great game design, pace and not ludicrously hard for the casual gamer - although there are options to increase difficulty. This is a platformer that pays tribute to the old days but is not stuck there. I really can't wait for a sequel or similar game from the developers.10/10 "

												I thought i would take a punt on this game a while back, so glad i did. I genuinely thought platform games like this were extinct. The last platform game i enjoyed this much was Castlevania - Symphony of the Night many moons ago on a ps1.Im not comparing the two games im just saying that the fun i got from Apotheon was right up there. The style is like greek pottery has come to life, the character moves fluidly, and theres plenty to explore and find. Apotheon has everything i want to see from this kind of game.  You will have to get good at toggling between weapons though, accidently pulling the wrong weapon can be frustrating and deadly.  If they were to make an Egyptian game like this i'd be on it in an instant.			"

												pretty good gameMany people have negative things to say about the controls. I played on keyboard and mouse, and after an hour or so of awkwardness I got used to it and had no further issues. I rebound a couple things and it was fine.Interesting combat system, dozens of weapons with special properties, every boss fight is unique, satyrs walking around with visible erections. I dont know what more you could want honestly			"

												This review is completely biased. I'm a Grecco-Roman historian, and seeing the classical artwork brought to life, coupled with a fantastic soundtrack, was a total win for me. This game looks FANTASTIC. The use of classical artwork from black-figure pottery just fits, and is very true to form (no removal of Priapian appendanges, ahem). The fact that the background is actual a marble wall with the game painted on, is such a cool touch. Also, the different evnironments are unique and varierd - the forests of Artemis felt very different from the levels in Hades, and the tone was just right. The voice acting is pretty top notch too, better than some AAA games even. As should be the case, all classical figures are Britsh. This is correct and proper. The mythology of ancient Greece is nicely incorporated into the story, and the plethora of classical Greek weaponry gives a lot of diversity for playthrough. The combat can get a little hectic and clumsy at times, but the overall polish of the game overroad that for me.I only had a few stability issues, with a couple of CTD, but the autosave function is well implemented and meant that I didn't loose a lot of time.Overall, very enjoyable sidescroller, with absolutely stunning imagery, well voiced and fleshed out story, and an awesome soundtrack, which I'm intending to buy. if you'e any interest at all in Greek mythology, I would wholeheartedly recommend this game. But even without that, it's different, well paced, and stylish.			"

												Upon the update which allows the game to automatically switch to integrated graphics cards the game is much easier to play! I retract my previous statement and give this game a thumbs up!			"

												I have enjoyed this game a lot. The plot is not the best one, gameplay needs a bit more work make combat smother. Design and levels layout are marvelous. Of course, aphoteon is not a AAA but in its field it's outstanding.			"

												The study of Ancient Greek history and mythology is one of my primary hobbies so it's hard for me to gauge how much not appreciating many of/all the wonderful touches, references and stories within this game would impact someone's enjoyment. The aesthetics are perfect and, once you get used to the combat system, the game is enjoyable in its own right also. There are plenty of side missions, achievements, secrets, etc. and a wide variety of game styles are incorporated within the whole so there's something for everyone while not alienating anyone. Absolutely recommended if you have any interest in Ancient Greece whatsoever.			"

												It is an elaborate game. By exploring the maps and by fighting each level, you can feel that the developers really put lots of effort on this game. Some levels are hardcore fights, some need strategy and dexterity. The combat experience is smooth. Using the mouse to combat in a 2D platform is actually smooth and flexible.			"

												Beautiful and fun game. To add to what another reviewer wrote, some of the things you can do in this game:Sail the seaPlay a drinking game at a party with DionysusManneuver Athena's rotating labyrinthEscape from a prisonHunt down a gang of assassinsExplore underwater ruinsFight in a trap-filled arena with AresFight a CyclopsFight underwater against mermenFight on horsebackTraverse the rivers of Hades while beating back the deadGet turned into a stag and survive being hunted by Artemis for long enough until she turns into a stag and you get a chance to hunt her, and take turns like this until one of you kills the other!However, for me, a controller is required. I found the keyboard/mouse combo completely unuseable.			"

												Amazing game, worth every cent I've spent...1) Great artwork. 2) Amazing soundtrack. 3) Simple yet fun. 4) Good puzzles and lot of exploring to do.5) Story is rather simple and Generic though. But still interesting. 6) Game runs well and smoother than many Triple A titles....and definitely not demanding to run. 7) If you like Greek Myth, then you shouldn't pass out on this game !One down side to the game, it's not that "" replayable "" and there isn't any "" New Game + Mode "" either. But this game is currently only 17$ about 4$ USD.....so it's actually super cheap....Most games here costs about least 130 - 250$ easily..This game actually give more content than what you paid for !

 Apotheon  draws from some of the stylings of games such as  Outland,  only this time with a novel Greek theme... and also  far  less engaging.Although the game holds a very nice aesthetic value and will seem intriguing for a few minutes, you'll quickly notice the cumbersome combat and movement mechanics, as well as the monotonous choice for a musical theme that propagates itself constantly throughout the level.I shouldn't already be getting tired of a game when I've only accrued 30 minutes of playtime. I'd say this is one to avoid.			"

												An utterly excellent game whose visual aesthetic is matched in stark beauty only by its combat.  Fighting is brutal, raw, delicate business.  You are often center-stage in a ballet of wits and blades in this Greek tale.  You will feel like a heroic warrior by its conclusion, not because you wield equipment of legend, but because you ARE a legend.Faithful to the spirit of ancient Greek mythology both in story and in visual direction, this game comes with my highest recommendation to the artists, the fighters, and the metroidvania-lovers.

												This game is unique and fun. The combat is interesting and the world is really cool. However, it's basically an open-world platforming game, and if you're trying to explore it can be a real slog. It's annoying to have to keep bringing up the map to search for things, and it's painfully slow to walk around. I wanted to keep playing (I enjoy 100%ing games) but near the end of my playthroughs it just became a slog. In the end, this is an exporation game where it's not fun to move around.Everything else is good though.			"
