												Be warned : Silverfall installation is broken as hell on Steam.Original game contain TagÃ¨s system protection. It seem Steam version never corrected about that.If you want to play bundle, always install game in that order : 1--> Silverfall (don't check files integrity 100% because installation is neverending looping) 2--> Silverfall Earth Awakening (SEA) 3--> after SEA install, check file integrity until you reach 100% To play game, always run SEA instead of Silverfall. You'll get all content.Never try to install SEA 1st because SEA is false standalone : it use files data shared for both original & standalone extension (like PhysX drivers). If Silverfall is already installed, SEA will only download few files to complete bundle.Run SEA only when done, you'll get choice to play from level 1 Silverfall or level 45 SEA.I don't believe i play this game today. This game isn't so bad that people said about it. It is still fun to play if you know how to config it and how to use stats/skills with efficiency.Perhaps there is a way to play multiplayer without Hamachi. I tried to register @ official link in-game but server down since many years i think. Companions help for heal & support you. But i prefer human players.Worth the money : i recommend full bundle.

												Silverfall is not a good game.It has bad voice acting, weak story, god awful level design, several glitches and crashes, not-so-deep combat, etc, etc.Why am I recommending it?Because it's FUN!Silverfall's salvation is rather fun combat and good looking player and equipment models.All I want from ARPG's is the loot that makes me look good while killing mobs that drop loot and Silverfall does that!Another strong point is that there are no classes.You can spend your skill points on 8 different skill trees - that's A LOT of options!You can be the archer that casts dark magic spells or nature warrior that occasionally turns into werewolf or technology fire mage that summons robots, or...So, yeah, if this sounds good to you, grab Silverfall: Complete! Don't buy separately! And probably wait for a discount, because, like I said, it's not exactly a good game.Also, don't expect it to be fun from the beginning. It's kind of game that gets better after playing for some time.PS.: There are few reviews here somewhere with installing instructions, follow them!EDIT: Added missing articles.			"

												Silverfall is one of those games I always wanted to buy at the game store but never pulled the trigger on.  It sat on the shelf with Divine Divinity, another game I always wanted to buy but something else had more of my attention.  Having now played the latter and just finished this game I can safely recommend that no one play this game and instead play Divine Divinity if you're looking for a hidden gem.  Silverfall isn't bad but it's terribly mundane, I only ever encountered one crash and following the Steam forum suggestions didn't have any issues installing it.  I played it to the end, though I'm not sure why, it's almost mind numbing enough combat like Diablo 2 to just parade through for loot but the loot isn't very exciting either.  Overall I think this game was just a bit too easy, and while it isn't terrible it just isn't worth recommending that any of my friends play.  It's one redeeming quality, if I had to choose one, would be that it's graphics engine plays quite nicely with the Nvidia Control Panel so I was able to easily add far more AA and AF than would have been possible at release.  Even tech that wasn't available then like FXAA played nicely, sadly the game doesn't offer a lot of thought through detail so while you have a nice smooth cartoony look after adjusting settings you still aren't left with much to look at.

												Old style hack and slash. Very complex character development and one of the best crafting systems in an Rpg.Still a good game after many years if you can get past the sluggish controls.			"

												I've been playing Silverfall ever since it was released on steam. I love RPG games, and most of all i love RPG games with a good story and sidequests to it, that makes Silverfall and Silverfall: Earth Awakening very good and on the same time the motion in it, it's the first RPG i ever saw where there is so smooth motion to it, and that the people ""ragdolls"" When they get killed, even the enemies. the loot drop style is about the same as Diablo, which i also love a lot! to be honest, there is nothing wrong with this game, it's abseloutly amazing			"

												I loved the base game, though hated this stand alone expansion.  Basically, if you also own the base game it allows you to play it with the expansion updates. Still, if you already played it, then you can just import your character from base Silverfall to Earth Awakening expansion, play with a 45 level character, or choose from the two new races provided: Dwarves and the Lizardmen. This sounds good enough in theory, but... First of all the crafting system that was added to the expansion is just pathetic and completely useless since the items that drop from enemies are even of better quality, not even mentioning that to be able to craft you must use the skill points to improve it, which prevents you from acquiring good battle skills and ends by turning into a boring game since all the hard job is done by your companions due to your character not being able to inflict a decent damage. Secondly - this expansion looked verry short to me, but this may be just due to it being boring, thing that stimulated me in hurrying to finish it. The last reason why i hated it, but not the less important - bosses have a lot of HP but inflict almost no damage at all, it takes like 3-4 minutes to kill one of them, still you dont even need to heal yourself, you can just let your hero and his companions to auto attack and go make youself a coffee. I recommend playing the original Silverfall, but to skip this expansion since you may end up by being as disappointed in it as i am.			"

												Official Multiplayer Servers seems to be permanently down, seems also that you'll not find support form producers, so this game isn't what it is promised to be. So if you search something like a multiplaying based on servers I suggest you to get something different (I would point to Titan Quest).That's a shame because multiplaying would have been great in this game.There are also other bothering problems that you can ignore, like getting stuck in simple little rocks or can't jump down from little heights or graphic that ""is not the best"". You still can use Lan multiplay, but you have to find someone every time, which isn't so simple.			"

												So i am going threw our Supported games and checking them and playing them to see if there working well enough to use in a event for our Group, first i play them Solo awhile to get the feel then i will work on the Multi-play Feature, i will need help on some of these games which i will add a list of soon.Steam Group info here:  Groups info:  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/DungeonAddictsFirst upYou need to install Silverfall as well and at lease load it once, if it keeps going to bar, you need to go into the Game folder and delete the Config for this game. Then you need Load SteamFrom the Library section, right-click on the game and select Properties from the menu.Select the Local files tab and click the Verify integrity of game cache... button.Steam will verify the game's files - this process may take several minutes.Once the process is completed, the Check Window will automatically exit.https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335 Then install Do all the same as above.Then launch the game from FS:EA only and pick ether level 1 to enjoy the first game or level 45 to start this game. it reminds me of Titan Quest you have to have both installed but you play off off Immortal Thrones.Pick your Race from Human, Elf, Dwarf, Troll, Goblin, Lizard manClasses are Tree skills so it is really open to what you want Melee, Caster, Archer, Gunner etc. i went with one-handed Weapons and shield. and Dwarf. You can Gain followers threw quests events etc. i have at the minute a caster and a archer with me so it works i rush in do the damage they lay down covering fire and the caster is a Ice mage and Healer so really good.There is a Stash and your backpack has 4 Tabs but there named tabs, like Weapons - Armor - Items - Crafting stuff and the first two fill Quick, but you can Quick travel vie map to town. its the basic color code most games use white-yellow-blue-orange. But this game offers a really cool gear slot Backpacks-Flags-Stuff, so you can change that look a long with your gear kinda cool really, no Shoulder or Cloak slot, but maybe the back slot will have one and shoulder items are included in cheat armor.i Put about 10 hours into this game and it is still fun to me its kinda like PoE and Torchlight had a crappy Baby but he was a ok kid. but its more Camera control than those games.you can Re-spec it cost 10 gold per point re-spec and it just goes up and up never resetting but you can farm gold easy.Also you can Craft and add effects to items, but i have not got into that yet.5/10 Really, it's fun but do not pay over 5$ for Both games do not buy the first one.i have tons of Screen Shots on this game and i plan on keep on playing it.
