												Oh wow, a blast from the past that requires some love. 20 years ago, I thought I was good at RPGs. Then I played Crusaders of the Dark Savant and realized I was good at following the bread crumbs that easy to moderate RPGs lay out for us. This game was incredibly difficult in the era when there was no gamefaqs.com to download walkthroughs on. When FAQs became a common theme, I re-installed and found it was still pretty tough. That being said, it has a unique world setting, a greatly diverse character class and race structure, and an extensive story-line that is unique and engaging. Wizardry is not a world for the feint of heart, but for those who embrace a challenge, love RPGs and have an affection for Old School gaming, Crusaders of the Dark Savant is a challenge you must embrace. A stellar game that received far too little fanfare in it's day and is deserving of re-incarnation.			"

												Old school turn-based RPG action with an engaging story, interesting NPCs, a surprising degree of non-linearity. Add in deep character customization and actions that actually have long-term (and sometimes surprising, unintended consequences) and you've got a gem with some true replay value.			"

												In all fairness, you'd be better off buying the GoG.com version of this one. You get more stuff with GoG. Play the DOSBOX version if you can because Gold is very crippled by age and does not perform right on Modern machines. For example, the game screen is stuck at a 640x400 size... you can't change it sadly, unless you put the games shortcut in Compatibility mode, and force windows to temporarily resize your desktop resolution down to 640x480. Not a pleasant solution in my opinion.Other than those gripes, if you're not familar with old school CRPG games, you're going to ♥♥♥♥ing hate this game, because it is hard. Long. And unforgiving to noobs.  It ain't Final Fantasy. And it ain't Skyrim, scrub.Here's what not to look forward to:No automapping- Nope not in this game kid. Back in my day we had to do this ♥♥♥♥ with grid paper and draw the maps ourselves. Good luck figuring out where the hell you are in the game. *Psst Gamefaqs got yo back G*♥♥♥♥ Stat Rolling system for created Characters-  Believe me, you will be doing this alot the first few times or so because the way the game is set up. You get 1 shot for stats per character creation. At the end of character creation, you either accept what you've rolled, or delete it... thus bringing you back to the character review screen where you'll have to go through the entire character creation process. It's an exhausting process,Thousands of ♥♥♥♥ing words! - Hope you enjoy reading sport! Because that's what you'll be doing in this game. No voice acting here. The Gold edition does provide voice narration, but I honestly couldn't deal listening to the guy talk.  The plus to this game is the challenge it presents you. It's a very long dive.. if you do it right it could last you a month or so of game time. The story is awesome! A mix of sci-fi and low fantasy. It's one of the few CRPGs that tied your party to the previous games. So if you beat Wizardry 6, and imported them into 7, whatever ending you got in 6 carries over into 7. It's pretty cool!I give this game 7/10 Donut Farts			"

												Alright Wizardry 7. I hope you have played Wizardry 6 before thinking playing this Game. ;-)This may have the better graphics and the sound is pretty amazing here, but rust me, play Wizardry 6 before or don't play this series at all.You ask why?Well it's pretty simple while Wizardry 6 is hard as hell, I feel it's still waaaaay easier than this one. Additionally if you finish Wizardry 6 you can import your Party winto W7 and continue in this adventure.Generally the Wizardry Series tend to be much harder than other dungeon crawler games, even the older ones, so if you're new to the genre, I really suggest you try Lands of Lore 1 and then Eye of the Beholder first.Alright, let's talk about W7.The game is highly complex with a ton of spells, most of them useful in at least some scenarios. There are plenty of riddles in this game, a lot of them also requires to carefully read and note basically everything. A lot of information may just appear dead, but at some point, you need it.The battles are sometimes tough and sometimes really easy. You can adjust the difficulty in some kind, that if the game gets too difficult you can change the classes of your party, which makes a lot of encounters trivial. But it may require some grinding at some point, altough I think you can make it through without senseless grinding. There are plenty of random encounters anyway.The much harder thing in this game are the riddles and ""quests"". Did I mention that you don't have a quest book? Well you don't have one. The good thing is: You have a minimap. Well kind of. You have to raise the card drawing skill first and even then, it's not a full minimap.The riddles and dungeon mechanics are so hard that I think if you play this game the first time without consultating a walkthrough you probably end up with 750 - 1000h of gameplay.The game content is about 3 times as big as in Wizardry 6 and the map is huge. Additionally there are plenty of dungeons and they have some of the most annoying mechanics I've ever seen, which requires some map drawings even if you have the minimap.I really suggest this game to anyone who likes dungeon crawling games and is looking for a real challenge. This is as hard as it can get.			"

												Truly a gem of old school rpg, runs smoothly, i have found no glitches or lag. The variety of classes and ability to change classes makes it great to create characters to suit yourself and your style. Its well worth the small price for the game.

												I played this game about 20 years ago and enjoyed it so much. It was a challenge back then and is a challenge now, but it's still a lot of fun. It's a true old-school RPG and one of the best I've ever played. So much depth to it but it really does require persistence. You will feel lost and not sure what you're supposed to be doing at times, but it's worth it if you can stick at it.			"

												Definitely prettier and more ambitious than Wizardry 6. It now has  plenty of color, and SEVERAL tile sets! It does feel like they took several steps back with the interface, neither mouse or keyboard driven being ideal. Mouse is more intuitive with the new icon based interface, but it is horribly slow and cumbersome for battle or menu selection, while with the keyboard controls one  basically needs to have the interaction cheat sheet open in order to do pretty much anything.  And unfortunately, while mouse is active, the game will not allow for menu selection through the keyboard, which would have fixed pretty much everything, having both input methodsI hope to take less time with my SA LP than I did with Wizardry 6. That took  longer.			"

												A massive step forward from the previous title, taking the 6 and incrementing it to a much higher number. Whilst this was later surpassed by Wizardry 8 and 9 (before the massive let down with Wizardry X, which is impossible to judge in quality) you have to respect how good this addition was at the time.

Entire team died 3 min in on 2nd fight after 5 min unskippable opening credits and then 10 min opening cinematic. 1/10.P.s.

												I played the game years ago, but never completed it.  Bought it again so I could finally finish the game. A thoroughly enjoyable, but very difficult, crpg.  The amount of race/class combinations and abilities is astounding.  The puzzles are almost impossible to figure out without the hint book.  Luckily, you get the hint book for free in the program's file folder.  Expect to reload saves often.I imported a party from Wizardry 6.  One downside is that it took a very long time before I found weapons and armor better than what I had imported with my party from the previous game. So a lot of the early treasure seems a bit worthless.It takes a long time to finish this game.  Especially if you don't download one of the many save game file editors that are available. Expect to spend years trying to beat the game if you don't use the hint book. Some of the mazes are extremely complicated. You certainly get a sense of accomplishment when you finally do complete the game. Recommended if you like Dungeons and Dragons, but want a few more options when leveling your character.  If you liked ""Eye of the Beholder"" or Wizardry 6, you'll probably like this as well.  Just keep in mind that the puzzles and mazes are significantly more complicated than ""Eye of the Beholder.""   Certainly beatable with the use of the hint book.			"

												True oldschool gem, my first CRPG experience, the GAME, which instigated my ongoing 25 year-long (already?!!) love for a genre.Can't say much above.D. W. Bradley was a genius. Really wish Wizards&Warriors to appear on Steam also sometime..If you're wondering, which version to play (Original / Gold) - pick Original. Yes, Gold has an automap, but also has a number of major flaws (off-style character portraits, no fullscreen, too small non-changable window size, ugly mouse pointer icon e.t.c).			"
