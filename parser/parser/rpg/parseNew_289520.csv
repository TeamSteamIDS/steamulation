												First of all, I would like to say I am a fan of the King's Bounty series and Darkside is not a bad game. Actually, it has the potential to be one of its best installments. The key word being ""potential"". Unfortunately, I cannot possibly recommend buying it to anyone. After one month participating in the early access program, I logged 400+ hours playing and testing it. I posted several suggestions in the forum and took part in several other discussions posted by others. The developers gave us, non-russian speaking customers, almost ZERO feedback. All we got were sporadic monosyllabic posts about technical issues. They posted no information about patches and/or the work that was being done.They pushed back the release date 5 days without warning us - let alone telling us why they did it. After these 5 days there was a cosmetic 10 meg patch and that was it. The product was out.As it happens, the game they put in the market bears very little difference from the beta version I started playing one month ago. There are huge empty areas, very little or imprecise information about several quests, many balance issues, unclear tooltips, and possibly a number of minor/major bugs. In short, it is NOT a finished product. I expect (and hope) there will be future patches to change all this. But, unless you want to buy an unfinished product,  I would wait a few months to buy it on sale.			"

Early Access Review
								Somewhere in 1C Software's offices in Moscow, there's some sad little gnome locked in a cage with a computer, cranking out sequels to 2008's King's Bounty: The Legend. Apparently, the only tool at his disposal is a level editor, since Armored Princess, Crossroads and Warriors of the North have been pretty much the same game over and over again. Is it any wonder that Dark Side is no different? If you've played any of the previous titles mentioned, you know exactly what to expect from this game: There's just nothing new or fresh to it, everything looks and feels like you've seen and played it before - because you have. Almost 30 hours in, I just can't bring myself to continue playing. It's just so incredibly dull. Been there, done that. Yes, King's Bounty: The Legend was great. But with each installment, each failure to actually add something new and exciting, I liked the series less and less. What were small annoyances in The Legend (the chaotic quest log, the useless maps, the horrible path finding, the inflexible camera, the small battlefields or the down-time due to travelling and restocking) have  by now become major issues for me. Please, 1C, set that sad little gnome free, hire some talented programmers and give us something really new for a change. A true sequel for once, not the same game with a new logo again.			"

												This has ""we don't care"" written all over it. For example:One of the starting/tutorial-ish areas is this huge island with 3 armies to defeat, and absolutely nothing else. Nothing to collect, no sightseeing, no hidden booty. They even give you a ship so you can sail all around the island and make absolutely sure that, indeed, there is nothing else to do there. (other areas are ok)The writing has the same vibe, though they do try to be funny. There's a fair share of really silly dialogues and a few embarassingly bad ones. The English localisation is ok but you can tell the game was written in Russian.Quests are bland and sometimes feel they're only there to waste time between battles. Bait and switch endings, questgivers that send you to the same place several times, handful of fetch quests.Skip unless you only care about the combat.			"

												Early access project that was released is still unfinished. Game lacks balance, zones like Wintehill are in alpha stage. After playing some hours i decided to wait for game upgrade to full release to avoid spoilers but FULL RELEASE was a 10mb insult patch. At current state this is NOT worth your time nor money. Please check this game forum before considering purchase.Edited: This game never was at Kickstarter...			"

												It's a good game overall. It really is, gives almost as much enjoyment as previous iterations. So why the thumb down? Because there are issues which I'm not willing to see in future releases of this game, nor in any other games for that matter.There are reviews saying that the developers completly ignored the community. I personally don't care if devs are listening to community or not, as long as they're good enough to release a consistent product. Which this is not. In far too many places it looks like the devs (level designers mostly) were thinking ""ok, here's a draft of a level, I'll save it now and finish it some time closer to the deadline"", and then never did.First catacombs are ridiculously lined with eggs along the corridors walls, just like someone would launch a level editor and made click, click, click, click to spray them in few minutes and voila! We have a level!On Whitehill there was not enough will to do even that, it's just a barren land with a couple of enemies and badly aligned textures.Aralan feels deserted even thought there's no reason for that in the story, it's an Elven mainland!Most other levels are ok, but from time to time you'll see things that strike you how someone couldn't be arsed to finish something on a decent level.You don't release something in such a merry state, they should rather cut such unfinished content alltogether. Now it's like a lovely pie with a ball of poo on top instead of a cherry.Then there are bugs. Not game breaking ones (I haven't had even a single in-game crash), rather little or bigger annoyances. Like inability to have an aspect-ratio correct display with sharp graphics (everything gets soft-scaled with some blurry filter), unless you switch your monitor to game's native resolution (1680x1050) without scaling, which makes things look better (but still not perfect). Or crashes when you switch resolutions (had to edit the configuration file manually). Or crash on every exit. Or some badly working spells. Etc.The point is that it's not that the devs ignore the community. They outright abandoned the product - there were practically no meaningful patches, and probably never will be.What annoys me most is that publisher is now probably sitting there scoffing ""we released a 20% unfinished product and look how it sells! lets make the next one 60% unfinished, straight in the customers face hahaha!""And they will charge it 30 euro, with 60% of levels being deserted whitehill lined with eggs, provided that you'll get out of washed-out main menu without a crash, to be fixed with the next patch, which will never come. And we'll buy it.And that's why I thumb it down. To have the next King Bounty as well designed as The Legend, as bug-free as Crossworlds, and as rich as WotN.As to what I liked: the overall story is fun, even though I don't empathise with evil scum (I'd rather be a hero). Some dialogues are ingenious, but some are childish (I guess there were several writers). There are no bosses (except the final enemy), which I never liked. There's some new beautifull music by Lind Erebros (he's a russian Paul Romero ;).And it's generally another King's Bounty, which is never enough.Go get it, and then thumb it down to let the devs/publishers know that they can do better.

												As a huge fan of all the King's Bounty games published by 1C Company, this game was a big let down. I don't know what happened here, but the quality control was completely lacking.After playing the first game in the series, I never hesitated to pick up the sequels on launch day. I could play these games forever. When Dark Side came out (and I had no idea it was in the works), there was a lot of negative sentiment and complaints of the game being bug ridden. I had faith in the developers, so I decided I would wait to pick it up until they had time to iron out the bugs. As the 4th (5th?) game in this series, I knew that the UI, combat systems, character development, were all very mature, so any bugs  in the game would have to be related to quests and items specific to this game, which is really just content.After some time went by, they dropped some big patches and a ""Premium Edition"" for the game, and it went on sale for a large discount. I figured this was the signal that it was time to give it a go, I was excited to have another chapter in the Kings Bounty universe to explore! The reality was a little different.There is no Kings Bounty universe to explore here. The worlds filled with secrets, quests, and story wonder are completely absent. What you get are large maps, that are distinctly Kings Bounty areas, with pretty much nothing on them. Where you'd ordinarily have criss-crossing side quests, caches of items in every cranny, buried treasures, and a wicked gauntlet of enemy mobs to navigate, there was instead long hallways full of spider eggs, and nothing else, towns filled with houses with no residents. Guards with no dialogue. Gates that don't actually open. Dead ends with nothing in them. Large open rooms with not a single monster or treasure in them. I couldn't go on.To me, it seems like the team that worked on the other games had little to no involvement with this game. They polished the engine and the map making tools to a degree that perhaps ANYONE could use them to make a Kings Bounty game, but that's not necessarily who SHOULD make a kings bounty game. This one feels like it was made by someone's nephew, who wanted to get some experience in the video game industry, and obviously nobody at the company ever played it, because I can't imagine that it would get the seal of approval from anyone involved in the previous games. It should be called ""King's Bounty: Experimenting With the Map Maker"".I hate to think that I now have to give conditional recommendations to the King's Bounty games. ""Yes, try King's Bounty! Oh, except for Dark Side, that game sucks.""  People don't respond to those kinds of recommendations, and if someone happens upon this series by chance and plays this game first, they certainly won't be coming back for more, and will instead miss out on the magic of the other games. That's sad. This game should not exist, and I'm sorry to have to say it.			"

												Please fix the game!!!I played all the previous KB games and I must say that I'm very dissapointed with this release.First of all, the early game lacks balance, you have to face armies that stronger than you with very little choice of spells so it's quite frustrating to replenish your army repeatedly.There are some area that nearly empty that make me ask why it was created in the first place.The story seems interesting but lack of balances make me feel very stressful after each encounter.I'll not touch this again until they could fix it properly.

												King's Bounty : Dark Side comes in with a fresh viewpoint and good intentions-it is a big step forward over the dullsville that was Warriors of the North, but after starting relatively strong the game becomes a repetitive, challenge-free grindfest that saps your will to press on and finish the game.The game has a few seemingly unrelated issues that come together in the midgame that really make it boring to play: The game is not set up will to allow you to change out armies easily-you don't have anywhere to put your effective, proven army compositions in storage while you try out a new army type,  and recruiting a new army from scratch is super expensive for most of the game. As a result, every fight plays out the same, and since you generally fight the same armies over and over, you wind up banging your head for hours playing the same fight with different permutations over and over. Once it stops being expensive, it doesn't matter becuase the game becomes so easy (even on Impossible, the difficultly I played at) , the units are poorly balanced and while the game does its best to just overwhelm you with AI stack sizes it doesn't really matter, your armies still crush them due to abilities and stats. The game is just too long, areas drag out and any novelty of being the bad guy is drained away as you get two pages of interesting story for every few hours of grinding fights.I've played every KB game since The Legend, and I appreciate the fresh take on the story that Dark SIde is trying to do, but it is unfortunate that the rest of the game didn't get that same fresh coat of paint.  I'm not opposed to playing games that take a long time to complete, but those games must make me change up my routine and present interesting strategy gaming play, which Dark Side does initially but fails to do as the game's systems scale out to larger numbers (in both stats and army size).

Early Access Review
								King's Bounty: Dark Side (Early Access Version)So, what´s the Dark Side all about? Mainly it´s a bit of a fresh take storywise (and therefore also regarding your troops), since you don´t play another boring good guy hero, but finally you can help the forces of darkness, which are being overwhelmed by their enemies, the supposedly heroes. Poor orc babies are slaughtered by mean elves, century old vampires are cowardly destroyed by slimy vampire hunters and the beautiful demons are driven from their lava pools by ugly human paladins.So far so good or rather dark, now what´s in it, beside a real refreshing background story?Firstly the engine is the same as in the other games of the series, so are many basic gameplay mechanisms. Therefore this game propably won´t appeal to people who are complaining about that KB series just repeats itself.Also the ""choosing"" of your heroes race and class, is not as free as the marketing may claim. Basically you have your orc warrior, your Demoness ""paladin"" and your vampire sorcerer. Though they not only differentiate in their main skill tree, but also partly in story and even the companions you can get. So while you don´t have real free customization, the replayability is as good as never before imo.Naturally there are also new rage skills, new units (some are real new units, some are variations of existing ones, for example the human traitors), many new item sets etc. A handy new feature is your own ""base"", where you have an amount of dark basic troops and a teleportation ability, which eliminates some grinding and extra ways. Furthermore you can and have to improve the base, steadily opening new options.Since the game is still early access there are still some bugs in it, some unbalanced things and some quests which lack proper description (but knowing the series, maybe the last part will stay that way ;) ). Overall though i had a quite good and stable experience in my 30+ hours.Conclusio: for fans of the series and/or for fans of a bit more dark (but extremly funny imo) scenario this game is a clear recommendation, for critics who want something totally new, this won´t be it.

												Summary: Clearly the worst game in the series, but still a lot of fun.Pros: Virtually identical game engine to previous KB gamesCons: Virtually identical game engine to previous KB gamesThe RPG elements are silly, but that's OK because they're meant to be.  If you take the plot seriously you're playing the wrong game.  However, the quests are also sometimes buggy and often ambiguous to the point where you'll probably have to consolt Google to know what to do next, which is not OK -- but not fatally so.  That's because the quests are merely an awkward contrivance to get you from one battle to the next -- which is where the game really shines.As with each new game in the series, the basic combat engine is the same, with a handful of minor new mechanics for new spells and monsters thrown in.  You also get a new ""companion"" that provides a suite of new special abilities in combat.  In King's Bounty:Warriors of the North you got Valkyries; in Dark Side you get... well I'm not quite sure what it is, some kind of demon, I think.  As usual the new abilities are a mixed bag: some you'll use every combat, some you'll probably only use a couple times to see what they do and then file them away.The thing that makes the game fun is the variety of units and spells you can use in combat.  After a few introductory campaigns, you can switch your army's ""build"" pretty easily at any time, which allows you to do all kinds of experiments with different tactics.  Over the course of my game, I went from an army built around a couple of super-strong core units (dragons), to one compsed almost entirely of undead melee units, to one focused on plastering the enemy from afar with ranged units.Plus, there is huge variety of spells that can supplement or even become the focus of your tactical strategy.  Pump up the Hypnosis spell to its maximum level and use it in conjunction with your companion's Jealousy ability to turn your emeny's army against itself.  Spam the Call of Nature spell to overwhelm your enemy with a horde of summoned animals.  Make your own army effectively immortal by casting Resurrection every turn.  Or just lay into the bad guys with good old fashioned Fireballs and Lightning Bolts.  Those are just a few of the many strategies I've used with success.The spell and unit animations are more or less the same from previous games in the franchise, but that's not a bad thing since they are, as far as I know, the state of the art.  The same can be said of the whole game, really: there's nothing new here, but until something new does come along, King's Bounty remains the best turn-based tactical combat game around.			"

												After a hundred hours of playing ,I feel myself in an awkward position of not wanting to play the game. Why u ask? Well, as strange as it might sound, because it got released! When i was playing the early acces I obviously had fun playing the game and when I stumbled upon some bug or ballance issue I would just shrug and say ""beta""to myself, the hope of a future patch was always there. Can't do that anymore. Then came the forums (mostly lurking), being very familiar with beta-testing (mostly non-steam) I always try to read the forums to prepare for bugs and so that when I see a bug I know if I should post it or if it's already known to the devs. This imo came to be the biggest source of anger for all us early acces players: 0 Communication (honestly the first post I saw by a dev was about snowwhite, during the release). It sounds silly but it really annoyed me, the methaphorical straw that broke my back I guess. Haven't played since.So in conclusion the feedback/patches/communication were so badly done that even though they were imho the game's only flaw (love KB) it was enough to turn away a fan of the series since the beginning.Hopefully this gives slightly more insight in the angry old posts and drama for the potential new players. Since Nerbu, Dw0rd and DG D did a near perfect job of discribing the current product I thought some elaboration on the background would be helpfull.Fun, unfinished and horrible community management sum this game up.

												Its a rare thing for me not to recommend a game, and an extremely unexpected not to recommend a game from my favorite series - King's Bounty.Why you may want to buy it:- King's bounty! One of my favorite game series. I love these games.- Fun texts, sometimes. But it gets boring over time.- Nice graphics (may be considered outdated by today's standard, it seems the game engine wasn't updated since original Kings Bounty: Legend)- Good gameplay and replayabilityWhy you should not buy it:- the game gets extremely repetitive by the end-game period- boring texts- no bosses (seriously? no, seriously? Last game had no less than FIVE unique bosses, this one has... final boss? thats it?)- extremely long - lvl 80 takes a ton of time to finish- small bugs here and there, you may get locked out of a quest, your world may not generate enough scrolls to finish a quest to get an achievement (seriously, you may need to start a new game just to get a random chance to get a cheevo... several times)- ridiculous amounts of typos (I read most of the texts in the game), mostly regarding female character (treated as male character), as well as some nonsense phrases- boring quests - go back and forth between 2-3-4 locations- very weak enemies don't run away- you get 250 chests by the end of the game, and your bonus is... 5% extra XP! When you have like 10-20 fights left, very useful.Overall the game is fun, but not up to standard of other King's Bounty games, so I do not recommend it. Better to replay one of the older games.			"

												The worst King's Bounty game I have seen so far. It takes ages to finish, which is usually a good thing. However, in this case it takes ages because you have to run around from one island to the other...again and again.A typicall quests looks like:""Hello evil vampire, I would like to cooperate with you, but first you got to fetch me the following three items and kill 3 enemy heroes"".Off you go, often to a different island, where you have been before and where there is nothing left to do, just to talk to some NPC that gives you the desired item. Then you have to return to your quest giver. And you do this over and over again... walking...walking...walking...walking.The quest log is horrible as well. It does not tell you what to do in many cases. So, if you didn't read the quest text carefully, you need to look it up on the internet. Otherwise, there is no way to re-read the quest text.Oh, and the fights are very repetitive and unbalaced (nothing too unexpected, if you played the first two KB games. But this one felt even worse).On the first island, the difficulty seems alright, then it becames very difficult suddenly (could be because I played the mage class). After the first few islands it then becomes too easy. All enemy groups classified as ""deadly"" or ""invincible"" are a joke. You just use your call nature spell to summon animals that did ~55.000 damage at the end of the game.To sum it up, don't buy this game, unless you like getting frustrated.			"

Posted: October 23, 2014
												After 1 official patch (9/2/14) that I'm aware of, this game has very few bugs (compared to KB: WOTN), w/ the caveat that the Mac version seems to be a little behind the PC. I'm expecting a new patch soon, and hopefully the Mac faithful get a better game. Because this game is super fun.I was mystified to read some reviewers thought it the worst in the series (or maybe the ""weakest""). That's not my impression at all. I think they stepped up their game significantly w/ the writing, quests, and overall sense of humor. Also, for those of you tired of playing the same old standby human and dragon units, this is the game for you. You can of course over time get a significant medley of old favorites, but I would recommend trying to stay close to the thematic choices that fit the 3 PCs: Mage (Vampire) > Undead units; Paladin (Demoness) > Demon units; Warrior (Orc) > well you get the idea. I've only played as the Mage, but I suspect I won't feel differently after playing the next 2 PCs.More than past games, you really should have a pad of notepaper, and keep notes on where NPCs are, what they are selling, etc. A lot of times, the main clues for a quest are in dialogue only, so pay attention!There is a massive amount of bang for the very modest buck you pay out (I'd go for the Premium Edition for the 2 new islands, 1 of which has a cool new unit). I spent a ridiculous amount of time on just 1 playthrough, and I plan on 2 more to come.There is one particular new unit that is one of my all-time favorites: the Dragon Rider. They cost a fortune and are hard to get initially, but--at least for a small army game like the Mage/Vampire has--they were a huge part of my success mid-late game.There are minor criticisms I might have, but that's all they are--minor. If anyone cares what I think, here they are:1) while underground ""realms"" get maps, dungeons don't; that should be an easy fix going forward in the series;2) changing the camera's perspective can be a minor pain, sometimes having to poke your horse into a wall and swivel around just to see from a different perspective;3) the ""bleed"" damage is OP in this game. All it takes is some puny archer to hit your Black Knight stack and all of a sudden you're losing numbers of them from what should have been a minor wound;4) on a similar note, I wish they would calculate damage/status effects a tad bit more ""realistically""--for example, it's great that Ents take double fire damage, but why should any of the undead units take ""bleed"" damage? Silly.Don't get discouraged in the early game when you seem limited in troop recruitment etc. Once the game opens up (i.e., other islands and realms), you'll soon have a dizzying number of potential quests. Final nice point: many times, there are more ways than just 1 to solve a quest.			"

												This game is OK.  Unfortunately, the King's Bounty series has stagnated.  They started out with a solid game, but successive iterations haven't really improved upon the original.  I only own this game because it was included with a bundle and I'm unlikely to purchase any further King's Bounty games or replay the ones I own.  The combat in this game remains among the best of any strategy game I've ever played but the questing is miserable.  Although the developers have thankfully taken the time to include the origin of each quest in the quest log, most quests in the log don't explicitly state where to go for each step (not where on the current map, or even which map).  And in terms of content, almost all of the quests are simple fetch quests that require slowly shuffling back and forth between a few locations many times or collect quests that often devolve into a pixel hunt.  Even with a flying mount and the new teleport mechanic, constantly running trivial errands is very boring indeed.  I feel like having some good voice acting might help ratchet up the fun-factor with some injections of character, but the quests in Dark Side are again text-driven.  The fun-factor is also hindered by some serious flaws with the underlying quest engine:  collect quests generally don't mark items as critical, leaving it possible to consume or destroy quest-sensitive items, quests frequently have hidden interdependencies making whatever quest you're currently on fail to update without feedback, etc.  It is shockingly easy to find oneself with quests that are impossible to finish without restarting the game anew, but who wants to replay 80 hours just to deliver some thorn spores?  Maybe a well-documented script console and/or comprehensive wiki pages from the developer would help here.I think that my favorite KB is Crossworlds.  On reflection, I think that the simple arena-style quest progression is what makes it so much better.  Combat and army-building are the focus points and uninspired questing is greatly abbreviated.  In contrast, I feel compelled to arm myself with pen and paper prior to sitting down with Dark Side and I hate having to do so.  1C must evolve or perish.			"

												After having just completed this game on impossible, I really just cannot recommend it. I'm a huge fan of the King's Bounty series but I feel like 1C is just dicking us around at this point. They're releasing a bug-riddled, rehashed, mostly re-appropriated-content game. I don't mind paying for a new 'campaign' essentially since the engine is the same for the most part and they carry over most of the same units, but this is really just a case of relabeling a bunch of units and calling it a day.If you're an absolute completist, the game isn't unplayable. You should prepare to spend most of your time running around trying to figure out where you're supposed to be going, though, since the quest log is almost useless and you have to guess most of the time where the quests or story wants you to go. Most of the land is pretty lazily designed and doesn't flow that well. There are re-used maps aplenty.Ultimately, I just don't know if I can keep playing these half-baked games. They have such a solid engine to begin with, they could probably just let some users come up with new stuff for them and release that, but I guess they just really have no intention of caring about these releases. Such a sad fate for such a promising initial entry.			"

Early Access Review
								I started playing today and haven't had problems with startup. It's running on my desktop and laptop. Cloud sync isn't working so I'm manually copying save folders. So far, it's running as it's own standalone story without wading through the same game again.The graphics are bright and flashy, so my desktop is lagging but I haven't had any crashes like I had with fighting Loki in WotN and with Advisors in Ice and Fire. I'm concurrently playing Ice and Fire and haven't had any Advisor crashes today. A coincidence or unexpected fix?I'm only at level 2 playing a Demoness at Normal but I've already encountered new spells and units and I'm looking forward to more. I haven't found a Manual or Guide, so it's been learning by trial and error. Maybe it's too early in the release cycle to expect one.  They've also continued the vein of humor found in the newer releases. Nothing stupid, just enough to give anyone so inclined, like myself, the opportunity to appreciate it. I've wondered if it was just the translators doing it, but aside from the Snow Black visual pun in the logo, I've found an example early in the game itself. Not really a spoiler but stop reading if you care. <<Too many spider's eggs in WotN? Okay, here's your spider's eggs!>>This is a must have for King's Bounty lovers.			"

												As a fan of the previous KB titles (as well as all the M&M's and HOMM's), I began playing Dark Side with some trepidation after reading negative reviews and comments. After 110 hours, I'm glad I was wrong.Dark Side has some minor drawbacks -- unmarked quest items are too easy to sell/discard, quest dialogues don't appear unless you've solved the NPC's previous requests -- but in general I think this is the best of the KB titles. It solves the single most annoying thing about the previous games, the constant need to backtrack to previous realms/islands to replenish lost trooops. A teleportation system in this one makes travel a snap and there's a virtually endless supply of troops.The scenery is the prettiest of all the KB games, and the game's a visual delight once you learn to fly. The game's major conceit works well: You're playing as the bad guy. Yet as the story unfolds, you quickly end up believing you're on the right side of things. The quests are generally more interesting than the usual bring-x-to-y tasks, and there are some when you have to remember people and places from early in the game to complete later assignments. Take notes.			"

												Disclaimer: I did not complete this game, nor do I intend to.This game is disappointing. It feels incomplete - not because there is missing content (although, there might be after the point I stopped playing), but it just feels like the developers cared less and less as you progress through the story. The plot is pretty barebones from the start, but 22 hours into the game, I am literally running around gathering x for y for no good reason.It's not so much that the quests are generic either (although they are). Rather, how random everything is. Often, I got some vague text like ""you should find someone who knows X"", without any other useful clues. I had to resort to randomly running around checking every nook and cranny of each (relatively large) world. Just Google ""King's Bounty: Dark Side, where is..."" The forums are filled with people getting stuck because there is no relationship between the content of some of the quests, and the things you need to do to solve it. Furthermore, the game feels ""padded"". There are quests that, upon completion, ""humorously"" reveal to you that you need to do more nonsense to complete them. That got old fast. If anything, you feel tricked.What's good? Sadly, the things I enjoyed about the game only made me feel more disappointed because of the amount of potential wasted. The combat mecanics are of the classic similar-to-Heroes-of-Might-and-Magic persuasion. If you're into that sort of thing, it can be fun running around collecting troops for your expanding army. It can also get boring really quickly when weak enemies constantly overestimate their strength and charge at you, wasting your time. There are times where the game is genuinely funny, but those are few and far between. Most of the time, it just reads like amateurish writing.I will admit I bought the game off the hype. I looked at the picture of Snow White, read about ""Light and Dark"", and though ""Oh, cool, this will be a game about how members of the fairy tale community take sides, and wage war on each other"". I found myself hunting for ♥♥♥♥ing dwarves on the behest of that stupid woman, only to have her disappear when I had killed them all.			"

												I've played all of the KB games. The first 2 are the best. Next up, I'd put this game. Warriors of the North was very convuluted, and reused far too many maps from the previous games. I felt like 50% of tha game was simply playing through the first 2 again. KB: Dark Side rekindles that fire I felt in the first 2 games. Yes, you will see many of the same units and spells as the other games, but most of the maps are new, and the story presents a different aspect, as you are playing on the side of evil.  This is much closer to a ""new game"" than Warriors of the North in my opinion.That said, I wish we'd get a whole new KB game, with a new engine, all new units and spells, maps one of these days.

Early Access Review
								After 22 hours of play, I must recommend this game to any Kings Bounty player. Unlike previous game (WoTN + Fire and Ice, which had too many improvements to player and his units and enemies were still at the same strength), this game seems difficult and thus challenging once again (currently playing war on impossible). All previous King Bounties ended in using same units again and again, this one is played diffierent, because you have acces to evil units from the beginning. I really enjoy story and quests - its funny to be evil.I didnt encounter any game breaking bugs yet, just few minorly bugged items and quests.  Just one thing I dont like - undergroud areas seem empty (few enemies, no buried or laying treasure, just running around empty caves), but I hope this is just unfinished yet  and will be repaired in the full game.

												I've played this game for 60 hours now. It started out kind of novel and fun, but now it is dragging out as a horrible drawn out battle of ""can I finish the game before I kick in my monitor."" The quests are fetch after fetch after fetch after fetch. To get in the dungeon, you need 3 words. That means about 8 fights. Once in the dungeon, a guy needs his five bones to open a passage. That means 8 more fights and scrounging around. After you find these bones, now he wants his mandolin. Now you need to find his house, fight the small army inside. Then, when you return it, he wants some wine. I have it in my inventory, but for some reason, I can't give it to him and have to trick him instead. Then, the chamber is open. Now, to free the spirit, we must destroy three obelisks. Before I spoke with the guy, they were unprotected. Now, through the gift of voice, they each have an army protecting them. And it goes on, and on, and on. I've played other King's Bounty games, this one is similar, but the quests are complete rubish. Just too long and over the top. Too many fights for trivial things. You need a handkerchief for this guy? Well, it's over there, protected by... whatever. Enough. I've made it this far, I'm going to finish, but this game should be half the length.I'm rating it up because... it only cost me $3. 60 hours for 3 dollars is crazy, so I can't say it's bad.			"

												The opening two hours of the game do an excellent job of disguising an otherwise great experience. Things start off ok, you get to pick one of three characters, each representing one of the three games skill trees, and are then whisked off to a unique starting area. Things then go downhill for the first opening act, which acts as the games vague tutorial. The areas are empty save for the few packs the game throws at you to show you the combat, there’s no loot, no treasures, no exploration. The dialogue is oddly stiff, and badly written in places. The combat in this section of the game also suffers, whereas in other entries of the series you’d get your companion early, and unlock the extra battle functions, in Dark Side you’re on your own, the most fun and inventive part of the combat locked away as you drudge through the battles, trying to make your way to the start of the main quest proper. It wouldn’t be a problem of note apart from the fact that it’s a fair chunk of time until things start looking up.The first two hours are dull, confusing and badly paced.Then it all changes, the game breaks wide open, you get the best companion the King’s Bounty series has ever had, a fresh heap of possible armies and new abilities. The maps open up into beautifully designed mini quest hubs full of battles, treasures, puzzles and interesting characters to woo, threaten and fight. This is as good as the King’s Bounty series gets, in a fresh new skin and from the point of view of the “bad guys.” If you’ve played the series before you’ll know what to expect, and if you haven’t, and you manage to drag yourself through the games opening, you’re in for a treat. My favorite in the series so far.			"

												I just want to say, its been some time since I've played a Kings Bounty Game (I really enjoyed Armored Princess when it came out), but after that I hadn't played in some time. The next title I purchased to the franchise was Dark Side and quite frankly I remember being bored out of my skull.Its been sometime again since i've picked up a Kings Bounty title and I was looking at Crossroads and before I wanted to snatch it up, I couldn't help but remember the disaster of the latest version I'd played, Dark Side, and so i went to take a look at the reviews here just to get a reminder and I have to say -The second review, by Plastic Jesus, sums up my experience perfectly. I would tag the review if I could or knew how, but reading the review has given me confidence to buy another title by Kings Bounty simply because I'm certain that my first experience with Armored Princess wasn't a fluke. Dark Side was just a disaster. I didn't have any quarrels with combat specifically but the lack of content, mobs, treasures leave you seriously bored. There isn't anything worth exploring, there aren't any exciting minor quest interactions to toy with, and lastly, you won't find enticing treasures to lure you into dangerous situations where you're blocked off by a throng of trolls.Anyways, I just wanted to say Thanks to Plastic for the honest review - I clearly remember now why Dark Side is a bad memory and not a good title to base the Kings Bounty serires off of.

												The game lacks the quality and polishing of Armored Princess. Playing Dark Side feels like playing a game made by a 3rd party modder. You can notice it when watching the clumsy movement animation of your protagonist on the adventure map. King's Bounty was always a game with a terrible pacing, but this one manages to be even worse. The progression is very slow and borring. Playing for hours there is nothing to look forward to. The only good thing about this game is that you get to play demons early. But the rest of the new stuff is uninspired and borring. They changed significantly the might/mind/magic skill tree, but it does't make the gameplay more fun. Also, notice how they lock extra content behind the Premium Edition. In short, If you enjoyed Armored Princess, i suggest you consider that the franchise is done and ignore the rest of the titles that came after it.			"

												I wish there was a 'meh' recommendation.The game is King's Bounty through and through, where they've learned from their mistakes from the first game and polished it from the Warriors of the North game, which was riddled with typos.Yet, the Warriors of the North game was a lot better in so many ways.Dark Side starts off pretty darn good. I love being able to play the evil for a change and actually commit horrible deeds to warriors of the light. Its charm, however, starts to run really stale as soon as you reach the 10'ish hour mark. Fetch quests are among the abominations of poor game design. Yes, no 'RPG' is complete without them and I'll look that through the fingers, but here comes Dark Side, where a fetch quest can consist up to 10-15 stages, where the player is running / teleporting back and forwards, making it an _absolute waste of your time_It's not just 'bad' in the sense that this happens, it's 'bad' because nearly every quest is like this!On top of that, the quest log has to be the poorest excuse of a 'log' that I've ever seen, yes, even worse than the games before this. 90% of the time, you're wandering about aimlessly, looking for an object / npc / location, only to find out you actually had to go to the shelter. A good example? A quest said: 'talk to the acolyte'. Ok, which acolyte, there's quite a few of them? Turns out to be in the shelter. 2 steps down this questline, it says 'talk to <person name>' which is the acolyte... As I said before, this isn't just 1 quest, the whole game is riddled with this nonsense.The difficulty curve is another big peeve of mine. In Warrior Princess and Warriors of the North, the curve was somewhat acceptable. In Dark Side, you either have a series of fights you can waltz over, only to get a tough as nails hero to fight against you, or you fight through tough as nails monster packs, only to waltz over a♥♥♥♥♥♥easy hero fight. There's no rhyme or reason and you find yourself going back and forth to your shelter every so often.I've enjoyed this game for the first 15-20 hours, then it became stale and I found myself just wanting to finish it as quickly as I could, hoping it'd get better. It only became more and more stale, no interesting dialogues, no interesting characters, just hopping from place to place. The only interesting dialogues are with the prisoners and that's about it.On the very plus side? The game isn't riddled with obnoxious boss battles!Bottom line, I wouldn't recommend this game if it isn't 5 euro's or your regional equivalent, but it's pretty decent if you're a fan of the series.

												When I first played King's Bounty The Legend, I was blown away. It was so much fun and I replayed it through multiple times. The game was rich with lore, humour, engaging tactics, and so much more. It represented an awesome reboot of the old Sega King's Bounty game from 1990. King's Bounty Armoured Princess refined and perfected all that was good in King's Bounty the Legend. Crossworlds added a nice facelift of that game.Then the franchise began to grow tired. King's Bounty Warriors of the North felt repetitive, but still had some positive parts.This latest installment - King's Bounty: Dark Side is very very staid and tired. The game offers virtually nothing that is new: same graphics, same gameplay, same everything, more or less. Even playing with creatures of the darkside - the games supposed Unique Selling Point - has already been an option in all of the earlier King's Bounty games. Moreover, KB:DS feels rushed and underdeveloped. The islands feel sparse and seem to have been designed with little attention to detail. The game objectives feel odd and cumbersome. It's all just tired and dull.Really, the developers (1C: Company) need to come up with something fresh or the franchise is going to die a slow and torturous death. Their current plan of releasing poorly done expansions as sequels is frustrating and something of a slap in the face for their fan base, who love the game but want something more. I have to rate this game a thumbs down and hope that yet another bad review will signal to the developers that the next King's Bounty game cannot be yet another extension of the formula they made in 2008 (yes, 8 years ago now!) and must represent a major overhaul. Otherwise, this is probably the last KB game that I will buy, which is a shame.So, no, KB: Dark Side is not worth buying. Save your money and hope that 1C will release King's Bounty 2 sometime in the nearish future.			"

												As a long time Kings Bounty fan, it saddens me to give this particular installment a thumbs down because I really love everything about it, especially the theme, but it's the dismal quest log that ultimately ruins it for me.  This was never an issue with previous recent installments of Kings Bounty but unfortunately for this one, the devs apparently caught a big case of the lazies because often times this bit of text would be featured in the Quest Log: Please note, you must look for the solution on your own. Some of the subquests will not appear until they are completed. And even when some of the quests don't say that lovely little tidbit that equates to 'Yer on Yer Own!"", you'll still be hard pressed to complete some quests because even though they're as simple as going to pick up a certain bride, and yet said bride will have nothing more to say other than, ""Talk to you later."" With no other indicator of what needs to be done to get her to come with you. It's just damn frustrating to the extreme.  A little extra effort with the quest log would have gone a long way.I don't mind having to figure out quests for myself but for a game like this, with multiple different islands that interconnect haphazardly in all kinds of ways, having a decent quest log is absolutely essential, even vague hints would be a huge upgrade from the complete lack of an informative quest log that is currently used in game.This is the second time I've tried to play this game (with a couple restarts in between) to the end and I keep hitting a wall where it just becomes not fun to continue and I'm sad to say, I've hit that wall yet again.

												Fetch and Carry: The GameI like the series quite a bit, but dear lord is this one tedious.  I ended up with something like fifty, twelve-part, fetch and carry quests to complete, of the ""we're not going to tell you where exactly you need to go to get the thing"" variety.  The games in this series are nearly identical in combat, gameplay, music, and visuals so pick a different one over this one.  Not that it's bad, per se, but the others are mercifully shorter and have a more logical flow to the quests.			"

												As with all the King's Bounty games, this one is excellent, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be as well made as the others. Specifically the sound is very buggy, especially during battles and the ending is incredibly disappointing and short considering the source material and the length of the game itself.  Some missions are also bugged, with locators randomly either not showing up or refusing to go away for the rest of the game.Collision detection is nightmarish, and the maps often have some points(especially bridges) where the pathfinding simply collapses. You can use this to your advantage when being pursued by monsters(if you don't get stuck), but since you can FLY and monsters can't that's almost never a problem. Since you'll find the majority of the power-ups in the overworld maps anyway, it's entirely possible to avoid most of the combat until your leadership, spells and war chest are so inflated from kiting that you can seriously stomp the game regardless of difficulty.This game more than any other in the series has way too many step and fetchit quests, which eat up time and money in game by making you run around all over the place for seemingly little more than to pad the gameplay. Seriously, often you're revisiting areas that you depopulated of all opposition forever ago. In it's favor though it does include a ready means of teleportation between the lands, which you're going to use and overuse a lot.The plot is, like most of these games, insanely stupid and funny and not very serious. Classes are the standard fare for the series, with a warrior, mage, and paladin archetype - except they're the orc, the vampire and the succubus. I went with the vamp for the first playthrough, the mage class is always good for being able to crush half the life out of an army before the first round even really gets underway. Crystals seem to be much rarer in this game, so choose to learn only the spells you know for a fact you will use a lot.Second playthrough will be with the succubus, which I may or may not finish depending on if which character you choose changes the gameplay significantly. Past games in the series have avoided this, but since the classes are actually characters in this version one can hope...At this point, the game engine needs a serious update. Navigation seems primitive now, it hasn't changed since the first game - right along with the ridiculously locked camera angles. The camera itself still seems to fight you even after almost a half-dozen games have been made.This game should be able to be ported to tablets. No joke. The graphics are pretty badly dated at this point, it's time for an overhaul.At least this game doesn't deprive you of your special abilities in boss fights, something that was always insanely pointless and unfair in previous entries, although the powers are significantly more limited.All in all the series continues it's slow decline since Armored Princess. Some serious improvements need to be made and better production values need to be embraced. Still highly enjoyable and definitely worth the cash for all it's little flaws.			"

												Pros of this game-You kind of get to play the ""evil"" side-You kind of get to make decisions that seem to matter-Some new units look awesome E.G: Hyena riding goblins or wolf riding orcs-Teleportation makes travelling a lot more convinient-Companion system is improved -Demoness(Paladin,Skald) class is finally useful-Units are a bit easier to buy than previous games-Skill tree is better. They removed skills like artificer so you don't have to keep every crappy items till you reach like level 3 artificer and can just break any level items for crystals and runes.Cons of this game-Still have crap tonnes of bugs and glitches that crashes the game-Even though units are easier to buy, you have to reach mid game ish for them to be easy to buy-Quest objectives are really vague so you don't have a clue most of the times so you have to look up guides-Story is terrible. It is a pro that you can play as evil side but it doesn't really feel like you are that evil. Most of your actions are justified because they made the ""good"" side way more evil than the actual ""evil"" side.-You are still someone's errand boy. This was an ongoing problem throughout the franchise but now it feels worse becuse you are supposed to be this evil protagonist but most of the times you are spoon feeding the NPCs with your money and some crappy random items that you normally sell or don't even bother to pick up. -Difficulty curve: I really don't care about no loss play on impossible or some random hardcore play like that so I played normal difficulty and tutorial bit of the game was ridiculously hard because of the limitations of units& skills I can use. After you get to mid game till the end, game is extremely easy. This is once again ongoing problem in the franchise but got really bad on this one.-Too many useless units for the effort required to get them: Some units are easy to get but useless but units like those clown things that shapeshift are way too hard to get for what they are.-No big boss fights till the end: Yup. And last boss is♥♥♥♥♥♥easy too. Makes game pretty repetitive since most enemies use same units in the same area most of the times.-Lizardman are gone. No more T-RexSo basically if you can withstand all the glitchy gimmicky-ness, unfriendly quest log, repetetion don't really care about story, go ahead and buy this game. The actual game play for combat and tactics bit is kind of better than previous games because your rage skills are little more better for any class you chose and there are few more spells you can choose from.

												Well it is on Steam sale so you ought to know a little about this game.  The first king's bounty was revolutionary and fun for the time.  If you have payed the series before this will finally make playing with evil units accessible.  If you haven't I would start with a different edition before playing this one.  Preferably, King's bounty: The Legend or Armored Princess.  I love magic systems in games and this has a much better one than usual.I'm enjoying playing this game, but I hope they don't make another without a major overhaul.  Their online game doesn’t cut it.Pros:Punishingly hard.  It is possible to lose by not being powerful enough to continue.Great magic and rage system that are balanced against each other.They adapted the system enough to make evil units really playable.The don’t flinch when it comes to evil story choices.Cons:Once you develop a good strategy it is mostly rinse and repeat.Finding the next part of a quest is unnecessarily frustrating.Has not kept pace with the state of modern strategy gaming.

												I have been playing this game since its Beta launch and hoped to get more when it offically launched on the 19th.  Nope zip nadda nothing.  There is still empty areas and bugs (just try to pick up all of the spider eggs at the beggining I dare you!!)  The game is overly hard at the beggining but then it is too easy once you hit level 6 and can sneak into about 80% of the areas and collect everything you need.  You can be at level 14 without killing one group after you make it to Portland.  The randomness sucks as you pretty much get the same things everytime even in the same place.  Replayability is a joke and don't bother playing any race except for Demons.  They are the only ones that give you enough units early in the game and the only ones that can sacrifice so you NEVER have to purchase new troops again.  I hate to say it but I liked Warriors of the North better.  At least when you replayed you can more random items.  BTW I am currently at level 21 Vampire I can kill ANYTHING with my Phoenix and Snow Storm combo.  Gets reallly boring really fast.  I would not recommend until they actually release a new game instead of just spinning out the BEta with no changes.  They probably got enough money already and are working on the next release or a DLC for this one like they did for Warriors of The North.  Come on guys my 12 year old could do better than this!!!!

												LOVE the King's Bounty series, and this one is certainly great BUT . The quests in this one are stupid, annoying, and take away from the fun and typical KB series.  There are TOO many lands, with you having to go back and forth CONSTANTLY.  You commonly have no idea where to go to next, so you end up going back and forth between 15 lands, revisiting every path, again, and again, and again, and again, furthering one tiny quest here and thereIf you enjoy King's Bounty style or early Might and Magic games, go play something else.  If you enjoy CONSTANT and HORRIBLY vague quests that you have to look up, read every answer, then waste another half an hour to DAYS, with the answer in your hand, trying to still figure them out, well this game is for you.Also, the game is unbelievably unbalanced.  Having finished all of the King Bounties before this and all of Might & Magics and every other similar game, I could not get through the beginning of the game with 2/3 classes at all, and it took a dozen tries to get past the start of the game.Now I destroy ""invincible"" armies left and right.  This is just bad on top of bad on top of bad decision, design, and path.  I hope everyone involved in creating this garbage is fired and the next King's bounty goes back to its roots.			"

												How did I even spend nearly 100 hours on this game? Well, Its fun, in my eyes. I have a few other Kings Bounty games that I've played like, 2 minutes of and overall this one is my favourite. That being said, I love the mechanics of battle, I like the characters, and I LOVE that the game doesnt seem to hold your hand through all the quests. Theres just stuff you have to find and figure out for yourself. I havent encountered any bugs, and hope not to in the future.			"

												I have no idea why this game gets so much negative feedback. I haven't finished it yet, but so far it's as good as all the other parts. There are witty dialogues, funny references and a huge variety of interesting monsters and skills. I can't see anything to complain about. The concept of creating a force against the Light by collecting allies and evolving a Headquarters is very interesting and gives you a lot of options on how to play. I love it and enjoy it very much and I really hope this won't be the last King's Bounty part after so much negative feedback.			"

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Kings Bounty Dark Side 

			Views: 4,056		

			Kings Bounty: Dark Side is the 4th game in the Kings Bounty series, which is a turn base strategy. On Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/289520/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is...		

	Kings Bounty; Dark Side is a turn based strategy game set in a hexagonalhoneycomb battlefield.  This is the fifth game in the Kings Bounty series, andI have found that for the most part, the game has remained unchanged from the first game.	As a turn based strategy game, you lead troops into battle as an Orc,a Demoness, or a Vampire on your choice of difficulty.  Strategy and tacticsare at this games core, with your decisions on what kind of troops you use, whatclass you choose, and what spells you use influencing how well you do in the game.The Orc (warrior) gives a bonus to Attack, the Vampire (mage) leans more heavilyon spells and spell power, and the Demoness (Leader) is the middle ground, relying on both magic and numbers of troops.  Each unit or spell can synergizewith other units and spells, so you must be aware of what you are doing to excel.There is a place for everything	This game series best and strongest feature is its combat.  It is highlyenjoyable and satisfying.  The issue I had with the game was that it is too easy.While this game in the series starts out with a steeper learning curve in thebeginning, but it has the same problem as the other games;  mid to late game battles are too easy with the gear provided and abilities earned.  It becomestoo simplistic and redundant.  The difficulty level does not increase as your characters power increases.  	As for the story;  it gets by, but is definitely not a strength to thegame.  In this particular game, you play as a dark side character, but spend themajority of your time doing fetch and carry missions or reuniting lost loves;nothing that falls in line with the darkness of your character.  This storyis the weakest one of all the series.	Graphically the game has not changed at all from previous games.  Also,the quest log hasn't changed from previous games-listing current and completed missions on the same log, making it next to impossible to find a particular one.  You are bombarded with a multitude of quests that do not fall in line with thecharacter you represent.  As to level design, you unlock different islands as youprogress, but in contrast to previous games, they made the islands larger and morecomplicated, with convoluted roadways.  I don't play this game to enjoy the scenery between levels.  By complicating the level design, it becomes more annoying and doesn't respect the players time.  It slows the gameplay down in a negative way.	While the combat is good, it is unchanged from previous games in the series.  Graphically it is the same, the aesthetic is the same, the level designhas only been made worse.  The story is a waste of time.  I cannot recommendthis game, and would point you to the Kings Bounty; Armored Princess game ifyou are curious to try out this gamestyle.This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watchif you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:http:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												Bought the game last night and played until 2:00am before I had to go to bed or fall asleep on the keyboard. Been playing it for about 5 hours today with no troubles. I think some of the areas are just not finished yet. I found a secret passage in a castle but couldn't go down the steps. There's also limited inventory in the shops and castles. Some castles don't have anything to start with but the one where I installed a new king did get inventory just not what I needed for my army.I'm getting the idea that the game will differ slightly depending on the character you're playing. I'm playing the Demoness right now and she just got her companion. I do find it frustrating that I don't find any demon units other than at the shelter. I lost a key unit during a fight with a dragon and have yet to find someplace where I can get more. Probably one of those things that hasn't been fully completed yet.I'm still pretty early in the game, though. Just headed to the third island. The only quest that really annoyed me is the one to deceive the castle guard on Monteville - or whatever the island name is, I dont' remember now.  Other than that, so far, so good. My only other complaints are probably things that wil be addressed as the game get closer to being finished. One would be that some of the initial areas and underground areas don't have maps for consulting. Don't know if they're just not done yet or if there won't be any. Another would be that I have people in my inventory that I don't know what to do with yet. I like that I get to take prisoners, I would just like to know what to do with them.Really looking forward to seeing how the game will be completed and what extras will be there when its officially released. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a King's Bounty fan and was disappointed with Warrior's of the North. This one seems to be in better shape before completion than Warrior's of the North is even now.Update now that the game is officially released....I know people are disappointed that we didn't get a mega patch with the official release but that just tells me we've basically been playing the full game all along with early access. Yes, there's still some work left to do and I personally am hoping for additional DLC but as of the release, I still like this game. I've started completely over, looking for anything new. Nothing stands out so far. And yes, I do still recommend the game and I'm glad I got in on the early access so that I do have the extras in the premium version. However, the extras are only $5.00 more and if I hadn't gotten in on the early access, I would be willing to pay it. The extras are worth it in my opinion.Looking forward to what the devs have in store next.			"

												This game is weird, it's definitely a King's Bounty game, but its full of bugs and it looks like its not really a story.  It looks more like they just threw together a bunch of half completed projects and map and called it a game.  It's not terrible but where Armored Princess was a great game, this feels incomplete, unpolished and average at best.A few things to add after playing longer... the balance is way off.  Everything I am running into is stronger than me.  You can still get through most fights but it costs a lot to replenish after each.  But thankfully that is easy to do since they give you a teleport minion that you can use to run away from anything stronger than you (on the map) and go to your shelter where you have a shop with unlimited minions for your class (3 shops, one for each class).Beyond this, BUGS BUGS BUGS. I don't know that I've ever played such a buggy game.  You never know if quests end because the icons above the houses are mostly all broken, some quests I have show as every step completed but they won't reward me and other quests I try to advance but they just don't move.  This game is not worth it, maybe when it'll be 3-5$ but do yourself a big favor, don't go paying anywhere near full price.			"

												The Good:I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the exploration and battles of the previous games. This game builds upon those established formulas and offers a fun experience for those who enjoyed that part of the ones that came before it.The Bad.The English localization is pretty bad. While very little of the dialogue is grammatically incorrect the phrasing and tone of many characters is awkward and confusing. Many conversations, especially those dealing with the evil nature of the player and their companions, come off as quite childish, almost like they were written by an 5 year old. Some of this may just be bad writing. It's hard to tell. Maybe they were aiming for dialogue that had a narmy charm to it? If so they fell slightly short.Quest objectives are often vague and the solutions can be non-intuitive. In multiple cases I scouring a region for half an hour trying to find an item before discovering that the item in question was located in another region found later in the game. The icons for Quest Giver, Quest Objective, and Complete Quest are very hard to distinguish and often seem to be used incorrectly.Conclusion:I recommend the game only to people who enjoyed the previous games primarily for the battles and exploration. If quests, plot, and dialogue matter significantly to you, you'll probably be happier spending your money on something else.			"

												Play this in the beta and it work fine.  Day it released I believe it was the 19 hit play, hard drive start working, wait wait wait and nothing.  Game will not even launch right now hot play and I get nothing.  Went to the forums try various recommended fixx's and still won't launch.  Updated every driver I can think of.  Still won't launch.  Delete it and reinstalling as I type this reiview.  Fingers xrossed hopefully when I hit play it once again launch and I am able to play as I did weeks before its realease.  I have had problems with armored princess much the same way.  They did manage to fix it and warriors of the north I never had a problem with.  Out of the titles I own from these guys two of them I had to do my own search and fixs for to get them even to play.  In my book that doesn't make for very good products.  There for I don't recommend this 1.  Myabe its just a windows 8.1 issue or maybe not.  At this point I have no ideal and very little feed back on what the problem even is.			"

Early Access Review
								Quest log could be a bit more detailed.Fun so far, if you liked King's Bounty games this is worth a snag. It is nice to play demons/orcs/undead for once.I cannot help comparing this to Warriors of the North + Ice and Fire......and in comparison the material here (after 4 hours) seems rather thin.			"

												No matter how hard I try (and I have tried several times over the last few months...) I can not like this game. It feels unpolished, the maps have too much open space and way to little content and it simply does not have the spirit if the other installments... :-(Just go and get Warriors of the North or Crossworlds, both are much better choices! :-)			"

												I love this franchise, but skip this one.The difficulty is even more all over the place than in previous iterations, the zones feel more 'samey' and less alive/characterful, and in general, it just feels like a poor effort.More than anything else, Dark Side is just missing the sense of exploration the others have - all the great 'core' units come from the same place in abundant quantity, so finding a source of a new/cool unit or magic item just doesn't matter. There is no need to 'make do' with second-choice army compositions because you are just handed huge numbers of core units.It isn't terrible or anything, but I would rather go back and play any of the previous iterations of the series than come back to this one.

												Meandering. Imagine the Amazon river from hell with all its twists and turns and little streams that lead nowhere.Convoluted. Back and forth. Ever decreasing circles. Ragequit.The Developers have even - belatedly - added a line in the quests summary pages saying ""We don't have the time to add in proper clues - so figure it out your self - IT'S FUN!""Addictive. 450 hours in across all the various KB games. That is a lot. So I am not saying ""I played this game for 100 hours and it is crap"". I sort of love them. Finished the first two but can't seem to bite the bullet and keep going on these later two (this and Warriors of the North).I really love the King's Bounty series - it is probably the most fun, absurd, ridiculous and obtuse series out there. Choose a fighter, paladin or mage. Amass an army and send them into battles on a turn based chessboard. Cute graphics. No bugs or crashes experienced. My early army consisted of Wizards and Imps. Now I command mostly dragons that can fly around the battlefield unleashing hellfire. The series reminds me a bit of the Diablo clones where you just want to do one more battle to level up and increase your various map. They promote exploring as you can find cash, magic runes, other runes and spells. The battles can be very strategic.450 hours in and I still like the music - found myself humming it this morning. What is wrong with me?In the Dark Side the forces of good have done bloody war on the evil minions and the evil demons and orcs need saving. As a lady Demon Spirit Paladin class - I travel the various worlds encouraging the various leaders to ""Turn to the Darkside"" and support our cause. If they don't, I replace them on the throne by hook or crook.The more positives aspects of this game:For probably the first time in a KB game - I quite enjoyed the story telling and various chit chat.I like some of the quirky people you meet on your travels - like the Seven Dwarves - very bad people.You can enable cheating - but still get the achievements - coolI came across a ""Colossus"" spell that when cast game me random Level 5 troops - hello Archdemons and CyclopsI liked the Tomfoolery you could do with Blood Priestesses where I sacrificed my troops to increase some of the others. At one point I had 100 red and green dragons in reserve - at no cost!I liked you can trick a Dragon Leader into accepting fake princesses who he then subsequently turns into the best units in the game - fearsome Dragon riders.The negatives in this game can be reflected in one single word - Whattheheckisgoingon?Some of the quests are diabolical. Impossible to figure out on your own. God save the Internet and special thanks and high esteem to two Steam users (Shadowcran and Siannah) who posted two fantastic guides. The developers should be thanking them for the majority of positive reviews.The Seven Dwarves quests involves searching three different maps.In the Island of Monteville - you need to get into the Castle. This quest involves a travelling circus, make up, a portrait, an elven outfit and a password. CONVOLUTED.Buy these games cheap and you are virtually guaranteed 20-30 hours of fun. After that it's like running a marathon - all about your stamina.			"

												I like all KB games a lot but since other team (the one that made Warriors of the North) took over it becomes worse and worse. More lvs, skill tree even more broken and balance in late the game doesn't exist anymore. U can choose now Orc, Vampire or Demoness wich is normal kb classes with jus reskin. While 2 other have no problem, if u take warrior (orc) it will  be tough to get out of tutorial. Why? He has no rage skills yet, worst units, no usefull magic and very low mana. About units : guy who balanced them sucks so much. Goblin axe thrower - why... this unit was fine in previous game but its pure trash here. He's range is 2... rly. Weak with low health unit need to stand almost in front of enemy face to throw axe. GJ. Dwarvens cannoneer is now slowest♥♥♥♥♥♥ever. Im pretty sure ancient treant and achedemon needed buff cuz they were too weak right? RIGHT? Fighting in meele combat in this game is a suicide. Until u are sure u can kill enemy in one hit u shouldn't get too close to them. Why? Because of dots. Bleed, poison, frost, burn hurts as hell in this one. U can also get bleed fron tick of one of other three. Might be wrond but u can bleed... from everything, like why the F*****g hell archers punch can make dragon bleed?! Didn't saw but they have some spiked gloves and♥♥♥♥♥♥or maybe he take it of and scrach with 10m nails or something i don't know. Quests on other hand offten doesn't even say what u need to do. Its like u need to imagine what u need to do to push thing or walk around and talk to everything maybe something will push quest/s on. I bought this game when it was in early access and the devs were rly bad. When game got update... u had no fkin clue what the patch did. U literally had to go to forun copy things the russian player posted and translate if for urself with google translate. Had fun playing this game but the treatment from devs of this game was awful. If they didn't even wanted to post patch notes its showed how deep in the a** they had u :D So i u played previous kb and want more, go on but if u are new to the series don't. Go check Legend or Warrior Princess/crossworls and then if u will want more u can try WotN or this one.			"

Early Access Review
								One of my favorite rpg series. New game is somewhat 'smarter', enemies much intelligent than in previous games, crystals don't lie down like crap anymore, they are pretty scarce so you get most of them by destruction or in later stage you can buy them (no cheap solution though). Bottom line, you must consider really well which spells you will use often.  Quests much more interesting, less of ‘go there bring me that’ and the plot is developing really nice.The pet dragons are replaced by a single creature who can learn some nice tricks with time and teleports you anywhere you want, no need to run miles and miles to get to specific location.   So guys, this game is THE BEST of the previous ones, old good stuff polished and much new stuff to explore!I definitely recommend this game to the fans of the King’s Bounty games and to all who like this kind of games.

												Allright, This is a turn based RPG- A bit in the Might and Magic style. If you can get this game in a sale, do not hesitate, however if you have to pay the full price, it still is worth the money.I like the evil being story in this, and it has some nice word/name jokes that are worthy, Some quests are hard to solve as in you have to ' find ' old locations that you did visit, and find new ones, You are not being handheld like your mother did when you were 3 years old.One major flaw in the game is the spell Call of Nature. If you have this on level 3, enough mana and some tanks on the battlefield of your own. Then this is THE spell.Go play, i spent a lot of time in this, and its seriously worth its money. "

												King's Bounty: Dark Side was something I thought I'd like, being an evil creature doing evil things has always been a thing I like, but the game itself isn't that great, it begins nicely sure, but then you get to a point that you realise there is no other option of units then the one the game started you with.I picked the demoness because I wanted to try out an agility character in this series for the first time and the game made me begin with demons, sounds normal enough, but then after I've completed about 5 islands, I realised that there was almost no reason to use troops that aren't demons, I did try other troops every once in a while, but they just weren't as strong as them, I tried the snakes, poison is good, but not as much as bleeding or fire from other troops, I tried the Guards unit which to be honest isn't half bad, but you can still get better, when I tried out archmage, they just died doing barely any damage and their shield is worthless since you can finish most of the fights in 3 turns (on hard that is). It isn't that much of an issue the way I'm saying it, but using the same troops for the whole game just makes it so repetitive it becomes boring, give haste, orc shield 1 unit, charge, kill everything, repeat, barely any fight does it require anyother strategy.Of course, this is just my personal experience, I do love the series, but it just felt weak compared to the others, doesn't help that the game has some issues which the developers don't care enough to fix the problems, like the sound cutting out when too much stuff is going on or swordsman doing their idle animations way too often.If you want a good King's Bounty, buy Crossworld, it pretty much is Armored Princess (the best one in my opinion) with an expansion pack to it, as well as 2 new campaigns, those 2 campaigns might be short compared to the complete game, but they are satisfying to play.

												This game is not playable on Mac, but still it's possible to buy it...Has a chance to crash upon start-up, then crashes when you try to modify the game settings. If you don't need to touch the settings, the game can still crash during battles, some units' skills causing it 100% of the time.The game forums are filled with angry mac users with the same problems.On PC it seems it can crash ""only"" if you use some specific units' skills.Being a huge fan of KB's serie, I really want to play this game but instead get an unfinished product.Oh and the developers haven't done anything to fix it since the ""release"".

												The good: Greater variety of units near the start and a more non-linear structure than Warriors of the North. Also units aren't a micromanagement nightmare. Furthermore, early demon and undead armies provide interesting play. The shortage of crystals also makes spell choice more meaningful.The bad: The writing quality slides past the first few islands - be prepared for quest instructions that are hopelessly vague, inconsistent or plain wrong, nearly deserted islands, encounter levels are a mishmash and the main plot starts to fall into 'people attack you for no good reason'. The ending is particularly unsatisfying in this regard.The ugly: 1280x960 resolution (and all other options creating a horribly pixelated mess) is horribly antiquted in 2014.Worth playing if you already have played king's bounty (or similar games like HOMM), but not the best entry of the series. Good overall design held back by uneven execution.			"

												This is a game where you command armies of troops and tactically maneuver them on a grid-based battlefield, while leveling a hero character up and customizing your approach to battle. That sounds pretty fun to me. Which is why I keep trying to like this series of games, as the original King's Bounty was such a staple of my childhood. But sadly it is a deeply flawed series, so despite some positive features, just isn't recommendable. In (literally) the first battle you fight, the opposing army uses abilities that causes your armies to act on their own accord instead of listening to your orders. While the fight itself is easy, this is a good indicator of how the game goes. Design decisions were made that may have sounded tactically interesting, but result in a poor user experience where you often find yourself watching things unfold on-screen with little to no meaningful input on your part.The AI is also acutely aware that while it can throw limitless hordes at you, you have a very finite force. It often makes decisions that would make no tactical sense in terms of winning the battle, but pick aware at you. Again, this may seem tactically interesting, but the end result is a lot of reloading and long trips back to recruit more soldiers. "

												Warning, the game is addictive.Their are bugs, but not are particularly game breaking or will even slow you down. Keep 2 saves on each campaign and alternate between them and it's all good.The game has endless replayability as it differs every single time. Many players make their own limits, and go for ""no loss"" campaigns. Turn based strategy at it's finest.			"

												The writing for this game is hideously embarassingly bad. Actually embarassingly bad is an insult to the courageous 2nd graders who try their hand at writing. Someone was paid to write this terribly, and thats terrible. Expect every encounter with anyone to end in a scripted battle, a la icewind dale without any of the charm. That being said the fighting mechanics and leveling system are fine. I'd recommend it for turn based fans, anyone else is better off buying HoMM 3 for 10 bucks.			"

												This game has a lot of bugs, it's very unbalanced in combat and every quest made me search for a walkthrough because quest tracking system is all messed up.And yet, i really enjoyed the game. Sure, it might not be the best strategy game out there, but it has it's pros and, sadly, cons.Pros:- Good visuals- Nice level and character design- Funny and interesting quests- Ending plot twist (Yeah, this game has one)Cons:- Bugs that may force you to load a previous save- Repetative gameplay- Horrible quest tracking system6/10, a game only fans of the series will like.

												if you know about kings bounty then obviously I don't need to explain much about this but it's more of the same. I've enjoyed the series but feel like this needs to be the last one as fundamentally there is not much design difference between them now and the graphics engine is starting to age. Much as I love the soundtrack it's also been heavily reused in each game and is starting to get a bit irritating.It's a solid game with alot of content a good 50+ hour campaign, it doesn't hold your hand like other games and won't point you towards exactly where you need to go for each quest, this can be interesting or annoying depending on your patience level.I still enjoyed it and it's a decent game for any turn based/fantasy/rpg type players. With all KB games though the combat can get a bit monotonous by about half way through the game. "

												As someone who played (and enjoyed) both King's Bounty: The Legend and Armoured Princess/Crossworlds, all I can say about this one is that it is NOT worth your time and money by comparison. The game practically screams 'unfinished', with empty adventuring locales devoid of life, resources and the little touches of its previous installments, badly balanced encounters where practically everything you encounter is stronger than you and you lack the free-roaming of the earlier installments, and an extremely wonky opening act that does a poor job at introducing the world both gameplay- and storywise.To be avoided.

Early Access Review
								Congratulations to the King's Bounty Team. This is a game I well recommend to all lovers of turn-based strategy, I'm sure that those already well used to this Series will love it. I've just completed the game for the first time with just over a week to go before the official launch and it is complete. So if you want to buy now at the pre-launch price and get the added extras, do so, you're buying a bargain. I'm pleased to report that I suffered no crashes in +190 hours of game play (a problem that KB players will know well from previous games in the series). Just a few minor gliches, and a continuity repetition that didn't spoil the game play. I'm sure the Guys will iron these out. This is also a more ""thinking"" game than others in the Series and without spoiling, do not worry if you're not able to solve side quests straight away or if you're stuck, quite simply think of a different approach to the problem and remember there may be more than one solution .... All in all from me 10 out of 10 KB - Well Done!			"

												This latest entry is just like the rest, but thats a good thing. The unique twist of playing the 'dark' characters was pretty cool. The graphics are good(3d vision works well except for some text). A medium level pc can easily run and enjoy this game as with all the other Kings Bounty games. My complaints are that the last couple of Kings Bounty games have had a lot of mission related bugs are there are perhaps too many mission details to keep track of and the engine doesn't always give you enough info to remember where you are with their progress. It can become confusing all too quickly with 100 or so missions available and I find them to be a big road block for me wanting to replay. I still recommend any of the Kings Bounty Games(I've played and finished all the single player ones) but the mission complexity is getting overkill and the amount of bugs they keep having to fix is very symptomatic of that.

												One of the best King's Bounty adventures so far, I haven't encountered any serious bugs so far, which is really good. The story is kinda of silly but it works, and the fact that you finally can use the undead without any disadvantages is awesome. One of the only flaws of this game so far is that it is almost the same as the other games, but it works fine again, so it is not a big deal. This is clearly recommended for all fans of Heroes of Might and Magic and the old King's Bounty games, and it is much better than the Warriors of the North edition!			"

												 The most underated game of the series. Interesting setup, classic KB humor, and unlike previous KB games, you dont play as a righteous hero this time but as an evil vampire, orc or succubus. Most the units are familiar from previous titles but the new units like the amazons, the spies, the strongmen, and the dragon riders are really special with interesting abilities. But the best thing is the quests. In that department Dark side surpasses all the other KB games. The quests here make you to think  they are generaly more rewarding and there is a stronger RPG element. Also, many special units can be aquired only by completing some quest line. The companion is awesome,  you can recruit units directly for him by giving him prisoners and also he can teleport you in any island/territory you have visited before for a small fee. One of the negatives is that the  introduction is too long and kinda boring can discourage some players and a few bugs i encountered (not critical though). "

												Sigh. Another uninspired, deal-breakingly buggy King's Bounty release. Dark Side is more like glorified DLC than a stand-alone game. Kind of cool to be able to play the ""evil"" factions, but I remember the good ol' days of Heroes of Might and Magic III (K's B is sort of an offshoot/fork/sidebranch of the HoMM series) when you'd get to play a variety of factions in a single campaign. But I'm okay with that – can't expect too much for a game at this price point.Dark Side's also a little grindy, but I'm okay with that too. I mean, it's King's Bounty, of course it's grindy. Embrace the grind!But the sad fact is that this game is extremely buggy, to the point of unplayability. It stutters and crashes within five minutes of playing (sometimes on the opening screen!), every single time. I should add that A., I have a pretty nice rig, 4Gb of RAM on my GPU alone, and B., I've tried playing on the lowest possible graphics settings. Nothing helps.Maybe the developer will release a patch that actually patches things? I hope so. But not only would I not recommend this game, I'd seriously think twice about buying anything from these guys – Warriors of the North, the previous installment of the KB series, was just as bad.			"

												This game is nothing short of embarrassing. 1cpublishing should be ashamed of itself, releasing this mess.Remember back in the day, before everything was digital, during the time of DVDs and video rental stores? There would be these shady companies that would release direct to video sequals, or straight up rip offs with the intent to decieve. The terminator would have ""the exterminator,"" and transformers would have ""transmorphers."" Suffice to say, they were all terrible, and their only goal was to trick you into spending your money before you realized you'd been sold a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Well thats what this game is!You realize this as soon as the game starts, from the first line of dialogue, which could have been written by a 3rd grader. It usually goes something like this:Main character: ""hello dwarf! I am nice deamon! Let me in your lands,""Gatekeeper: ""Ok, I am a dwarf, and I am weary of deamons, but you seem nice""Main character: ""Okay, thank you dwarf, i will come in now. Oh, remember how in the past your race was nuetral and thats why you are not scared of deamons?""Gatekeeper: ""Yes, that makes sense. Opening gate now. Come inside""I mean, It'd be comical if it wern't for the fact that this con men swindled me out of my money.The maps are aweful. You know those mods that no one ever downloads? Those maps that an 11 year old spent hours making but just doesn't have the eye to make work. Thats every map in this game. They all feel thrown together, without purpose, completely lacking anything CLOSE to cohession or theme. The first undergroud area has pipes, and mushrooms, and spiders nests everywhere. Its an eyesore! Its like the guy was looking at the objects availible to him and picked a bunch at random and just cluttered the screen with them. Except its NOT cluttered. Its EMPTY. There is nothing on the map!!! The old Kings bountys games were rich, and densly packed. These are COMPLETELY EMPTY. I kept hoping this would change and the actual game would start. But nope, its just the empty world that persists throughout. This game is the WORST example of money grubing, lack of pride, and out and out disrespect for fans. If you buy this game after reading this, you might be the type of person that invites the guy who just broke into your house to rob you, to bang your wife. If you have even the most miniscule of self respect, do NOT give these crooks your money. Don't let them get away with this. Its criminal.			"

Early Access Review
								This is my first King's Bounty game.  I've enjoyed this game so far, however, I'm wondering how many hours it will credit me as having played.  The only real glitch I've run into so far is that the game has deleted my saves and reverted me back to ones made hours before, TWICE.  I guess, that's early access hazards? Or maybe a steam related problem from allowing steam to do download fullspeed in the background? No Idea. At any rate, the game is fun, and I've enjoyed it so far.  I think I'm going to wait for the game to mature a bit before playing more, because I've literally lost (over) half of my game play despite being one of those people that saves every 5 minutes.  I guess that transfer saves to steam cloud deal was meant to be a (do this or you're screwed thing?).  Well, anyway the game is fun.  Although I have no experience with the other King's Bounty games, I only had a couple minutes of  ""What do I do?"" time pushing buttons to find the dig key (d) to find artifacts (and then later seeing it next to the minimap and feeling dumb.)The player can pick his/her surname/nickname (but not first name) and pick from between three characters.  Female being a demoness in a g-string.  Males being an aloof vampire and a very likable orc.  The choice seems to make no difference other than cosmectically, as you can use the other characters skills in combat, and you only see your troops in combat not your main character.  You do, however, travel in the real time world as your character and encounter mob groups like in Dofus or many other turn based games over the years that most of you are probably more familiar with than I am.  So far, despite what I read in reviews prior to purchasing the game the story is quite amusing.  It's very light and does not take itself seriously at all.  It's no Shakespeare, and it's definitely not Gloria Steinem, (fantasy games almost always equal big chested males and big chested women) so don't expect otherwise. Especially since this one doesn't even take itself seriously storywise.)  Speaking of stories, don't expect voice overs.  It's clicking on dialogue.  The dialogue is amusing (to me.) However, don't expect big budget stuff. I don't recall a single cut scene.  The game is basically you buy, pick up items that turn into, or you just run across units that you use  to fight for you.  You can also use some hero powers each combat round to turn your mana into damage, healing etc. depending on your powers, and some other ones based on ""rage"".  The three characters can use each other's rage powers, and I believe everyone accesses the same skill trees so again your hero choice should be cosmetic?I will be posting in the future when I regain my patience and redo the hours I've lost in gameplay. Twice.			"

												I found this game to be mind numbingly boring and slow. The battle system just didn't really float my boat but that wasn't the only thing. Very glitchy and some items are impossible to get to which annoys someone who likes to search and grab anything and everything possible. I wouldn't waste any money on this and this is the first game I've been disappointed on spending any money on even when it was on sale. D: Even watching something while 'playing' this didn't help make this game any better or easy to tolerate.I like the idea behind it and all but it's just missing so much to keep it interesting and fun so I uninstalled it because I'd go insane if I kept playing this even for random achievements. This is my first legit 'no' for most people while other games I haven't recommended just weren't my cup of tea and I couldn't see it being my friends cups of tea either.			"

												At first it felt like 'wow, cool game, how could i miss this before'. But then the quests become VERY repetitive and boring, you have to walk a lot, talk a lot, fight weak enemies (if you are not playing on impossible difficulty), get some stupid items, etc. Dialogues are mostly boring too and in many quests you hear the same things from 2 or 3 different characters. Some levels are badly designed and you can't even use your flying mount there, so you walk over and over and over again. Many important landmarks or characters are not marked on your map so you have to remember everything. Becomes even more frustrating when you are looking for some quest stuff and there is no clue in the quest's description as to in what location is the item or enemy troop you need to get to.Also it's not cool that you can't upgrade your usual version to a premium and get dlc content.If you are a big fan of King's Bounty, you can still try to enjoy this, but I think there are better games in the series.

												This is a review from the standpoint of a lifelong King's Bounty fan. And by that I mean a person who played the original King's Bounty game in 1990 too.Before I start analyzing, I must tell you something. A single play-through of this game, doing all quests and fights, will take you over 100 hours. I am not joking. I am dead serious. If you want to do a no-loss play-through and are forced to repeat some battles, or better yet, you play impossible (meaning each fight takes a long time), you will be looking at 150+ hours of gameplay. Know what you're jumping into. This is 150 hours for 18-21€.There are already a few reviews in. Before I start, I will state the obvious: King's Bounty, in all of its installments, is basically a single player Heroes of Might and Magic game (regardless of the fact that King's Bounty actually pre-dates HOMM). Opinions are divided, and I will tell you why: because some people are missing the point of this game. Everyone is so preoccupied in expecting an upgrade to King's Bounty: Armored Princess and Crossworlds, that they fail to expand their view and realize what the developers have been thinking. While I am not in their heads, I can see quite well what they did, and it is simple: they gave us 3 different play-styles, which you can mold YOUR WAY and have them do the stuff YOUR WAY. This is what's important to me: a game letting me do stuff MY WAY, and not forcing my hand through a plethora of corridors and bottlenecks.People on the 1C forums have been complaining that they were forced to play the humans for 3 games in a row since time immemorial. So many wished to start with different races: be it the elves, the demons, the undead or the orcs. Now that we got a game that allows us to do it, people suddenly shift their opinion and start complaining about lack of troop variety in early game, or complain about no-loss victories.I myself am an avid Impossible/No-loss King's Bounty player. While I take pleasure in having such a play-through, it is not the only way to play the game - hence the play-style remark. Orcs are supposed to be numerous, and with adrenaline boosting their attack and skills, they can trounce an enemy before they suffer big losses. Demons have high Hit Points troops, but as a whole, they lack healing and resurrection capabilities, until you find means to do so. Undead can also form swarms, but it is their mobility that makes them great. A single vampire, switched to a bat can kite the enemies for a millenia, while the Vampire Wizard hero, regenerating lots of Mana per turn, destroys them with spells. Never ever miss the general idea of all King's Bounty games - they allow you to get creative. So be creative - don't just jump to conclusions. Never forget that all the games up intil KBWOTN had the classes working with the same race. Here you have races tied to classes. This alone separates KBDS from any other installent till now, and I think it works well. Never forget that when the game opens up, you can still do your own thing and get your favorite line-up. Nobody stops you from doing so.Having cleared this out, let's analyze the components of the game itself.- Main Menu: nothing different from other King's Bounty games. There is also a 3D option, but I don't suggest you play the game in 3D for a long time.- Graphics: a very slight upgrade over other King's Bounty games. Some textures are clearer, and some troop models look better. Then again, not by much.- Sound: the soundtrack of King's Bounty has always been its strong side. It has different themes, mostly orchestral with opera motives. 1C has always promoted a captivating soundtrack, and they provide it in this game as well.- Gameplay: this has always been the strong suit of all KB games. You can mix and match line-ups, get creative, and reap rewards. You also have 3 different heroes to do it with. This allows for hundreds of hours of fun.- Price: 18EUR is a very good price for this game. I always judge the price of a game harshly: I expect a 3 to 1 return at the very least. This means that to me, every 3 hours of game time cost 1 euro. I can easily expect dumping over 100 hours in this game, so I am quite all right with the price. There are so many games on steam that don't even make the 1:1 cut, it is terrible.- Day 1 DLC: while I don't support this practice, if people were smart enough to research the game, they should have bought the early access.

												This is both the best, and the worst entry so far. It's the most balanced in terms of combat and design, with the new additions being universally at least interesting, and mostly strong. Rage powers finally brought into line with magic and still quite interesting and fun to use. Just generally, it's the best on that side of the equation.It's also the least polished and the opening segment drags hard. Basically, it's horrible for new players who can't sit through a draggy opening and lack of polish.I cannot rightly suggest it over the better paced/polished Crossworlds for people without either, but if you have crossworlds and want more, this is the best option.

Early Access Review
								This is my first King's Bounty game.  I've enjoyed this game so far, however, I'm wondering how many hours it will credit me as having played.  The only real glitch I've run into so far is that the game has deleted my saves and reverted me back to ones made hours before, TWICE.  I guess, that's early access hazards? Or maybe a steam related problem from allowing steam to do download fullspeed in the background? No Idea. At any rate, the game is fun, and I've enjoyed it so far.  I think I'm going to wait for the game to mature a bit before playing more, because I've literally lost (over) half of my game play despite being one of those people that saves every 5 minutes.  I guess that transfer saves to steam cloud deal was meant to be a (do this or you're screwed thing?).  Well, anyway the game is fun.  Although I have no experience with the other King's Bounty games, I only had a couple minutes of  ""What do I do?"" time pushing buttons to find the dig key (d) to find artifacts (and then later seeing it next to the minimap and feeling dumb.)The player can pick his/her surname/nickname (but not first name) and pick from between three characters.  Female being a demoness in a g-string.  Males being an aloof vampire and a very likable orc.  The choice seems to make no difference other than cosmectically, as you can use the other characters skills in combat, and you only see your troops in combat not your main character.  You do, however, travel in the real time world as your character and encounter mob groups like in Dofus or many other turn based games over the years that most of you are probably more familiar with than I am.  So far, despite what I read in reviews prior to purchasing the game the story is quite amusing.  It's very light and does not take itself seriously at all.  It's no Shakespeare, and it's definitely not Gloria Steinem, (fantasy games almost always equal big chested males and big chested women) so don't expect otherwise. Especially since this one doesn't even take itself seriously storywise.)  Speaking of stories, don't expect voice overs.  It's clicking on dialogue.  The dialogue is amusing (to me.) However, don't expect big budget stuff. I don't recall a single cut scene.  The game is basically you buy, pick up items that turn into, or you just run across units that you use  to fight for you.  You can also use some hero powers each combat round to turn your mana into damage, healing etc. depending on your powers, and some other ones based on ""rage"".  The three characters can use each other's rage powers, and I believe everyone accesses the same skill trees so again your hero choice should be cosmetic?I will be posting in the future when I regain my patience and redo the hours I've lost in gameplay. Twice.			"

Posted: August 20, 2014
												This is a review from the standpoint of a lifelong King's Bounty fan. And by that I mean a person who played the original King's Bounty game in 1990 too.Before I start analyzing, I must tell you something. A single play-through of this game, doing all quests and fights, will take you over 100 hours. I am not joking. I am dead serious. If you want to do a no-loss play-through and are forced to repeat some battles, or better yet, you play impossible (meaning each fight takes a long time), you will be looking at 150+ hours of gameplay. Know what you're jumping into. This is 150 hours for 18-21€.There are already a few reviews in. Before I start, I will state the obvious: King's Bounty, in all of its installments, is basically a single player Heroes of Might and Magic game (regardless of the fact that King's Bounty actually pre-dates HOMM). Opinions are divided, and I will tell you why: because some people are missing the point of this game. Everyone is so preoccupied in expecting an upgrade to King's Bounty: Armored Princess and Crossworlds, that they fail to expand their view and realize what the developers have been thinking. While I am not in their heads, I can see quite well what they did, and it is simple: they gave us 3 different play-styles, which you can mold YOUR WAY and have them do the stuff YOUR WAY. This is what's important to me: a game letting me do stuff MY WAY, and not forcing my hand through a plethora of corridors and bottlenecks.People on the 1C forums have been complaining that they were forced to play the humans for 3 games in a row since time immemorial. So many wished to start with different races: be it the elves, the demons, the undead or the orcs. Now that we got a game that allows us to do it, people suddenly shift their opinion and start complaining about lack of troop variety in early game, or complain about no-loss victories.I myself am an avid Impossible/No-loss King's Bounty player. While I take pleasure in having such a play-through, it is not the only way to play the game - hence the play-style remark. Orcs are supposed to be numerous, and with adrenaline boosting their attack and skills, they can trounce an enemy before they suffer big losses. Demons have high Hit Points troops, but as a whole, they lack healing and resurrection capabilities, until you find means to do so. Undead can also form swarms, but it is their mobility that makes them great. A single vampire, switched to a bat can kite the enemies for a millenia, while the Vampire Wizard hero, regenerating lots of Mana per turn, destroys them with spells. Never ever miss the general idea of all King's Bounty games - they allow you to get creative. So be creative - don't just jump to conclusions. Never forget that all the games up intil KBWOTN had the classes working with the same race. Here you have races tied to classes. This alone separates KBDS from any other installent till now, and I think it works well. Never forget that when the game opens up, you can still do your own thing and get your favorite line-up. Nobody stops you from doing so.Having cleared this out, let's analyze the components of the game itself.- Main Menu: nothing different from other King's Bounty games. There is also a 3D option, but I don't suggest you play the game in 3D for a long time.- Graphics: a very slight upgrade over other King's Bounty games. Some textures are clearer, and some troop models look better. Then again, not by much.- Sound: the soundtrack of King's Bounty has always been its strong side. It has different themes, mostly orchestral with opera motives. 1C has always promoted a captivating soundtrack, and they provide it in this game as well.- Gameplay: this has always been the strong suit of all KB games. You can mix and match line-ups, get creative, and reap rewards. You also have 3 different heroes to do it with. This allows for hundreds of hours of fun.- Price: 18EUR is a very good price for this game. I always judge the price of a game harshly: I expect a 3 to 1 return at the very least. This means that to me, every 3 hours of game time cost 1 euro. I can easily expect dumping over 100 hours in this game, so I am quite all right with the price. There are so many games on steam that don't even make the 1:1 cut, it is terrible.- Day 1 DLC: while I don't support this practice, if people were smart enough to research the game, they should have bought the early access. I agree that nobody is forced into doing so, and I would like to set your souls at ease, that the game is perfectly playable without it. The extra item, which people have been fussing about, doesn't really do much, it gets easily outdated, and must be swapped for a better one - so you are not missing a whole lot.- Bugs: yes, they are still present.

								 I have been a fan of this series since Legend and I am very happy with this latest installment in the series its refreshing to play from an evil angle.

												Aside from the fact that it is the same engine as the previous four iterations of Kings Bounty I would say this version is the most refreshing so far. Playing for the other team is actually been a lot of fun so far. I havn't run into any bugs yet and have enjoyed the quests as well. Really addicting game play if you are into this type of genre. At $24.99 I will definitely get my moneys worth.			"

No real point, tough enemies to begin with...real boredom of playing the ""bad"" guys, little variety...no real linear story line. I'd rather have a colon cleansing on a Saturday evening then play this anymore. After Armored Princess each follow up is lacking the depth and replay-ability Armored Princess offers. It just appears to be a ""hastily worked or downright lazy"" follow up to a great series. Don't spend more than $5 for it. I caught it at $3.99 on a flash sale			"

												As much as I love the KB series I can’t give Dark Side a positive review. It’s simply been too long since the KB: The Legend came out without the developer making any attempt to refresh the series by improving the graphics or substantially revising the gameplay. Dark Side feels more like a community mod that allows you to play a new race rather than a whole new game worth releasing on its own. Here’s hoping that we see a King’s Bounty 2 with, at the very least, updated graphics.			"

												I finally got around to uninstalling this game, after buying it a year or so ago and playing it a few times before putting it down and never even thinking about playing it again. I suggest anyone who sees this, read my brief warning about the games major flaw. In todays gaming market, with more developers telling hard core gamers one thing to their face, then coding everything to pander to ""accesability"" and dumbing everything down to fit on a console, us old school hardcores need to be more cautious than ever in purchasing expensive games,  so this is my review. If ""like me"" you are sick and tired of buying a game, only to find out that even the so called difficult game settings are nowhere near difficult, then DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I understand that different people play video games with varying levels of skill and prowess, but that should be what the easy and tutorial settings are for. I expect hard difficulty to be hard, brutal to be brutal and punishing to punish me for my sins. Kings Bounty was beautifully made, well developed and stable, it showed so much promise at first. Alas, this was all pointless because it was ruined by an inbalanced loot table, overpowered items and stat increases that all seemed to come to quickly. If you are still looking for a better modern version of HOMM 3 or 4, THIS IS NOT IT and your hunt has not come to an end. I wouldnt buy this game again at any price point at all, it definitely isnt good enough in any other cattegory than gameplay mechanics to stand out, so it fails on its one ace card in its sleeve and does so miserably.

												Okay, I bought the game on early access, and the quality was so poor, I deleted it and just recently tried playing it again. The game is very glitchy, and crashes often. It crashes when I try changing the resolution, loading games, turning the wrong direction... It is obviously rushed, there are a lot of areas that feel unfinished. There are a lot of instances where you can't get to chests, enemy troops, get stuck in spots due to bad layout. The earlier games are pretty laced with phallic imagery and mostly-naked females (nipple armor is about all they get), so I knew that going in, but it is a bit much in this game. I wish we had the option of selecting somthing more than a thong for the character. It just made me feel like they were trying to get virgin 12 year old boys to like the game and overlook poor prgramming. There is a lot of errand hunting and going back and forth in this game, which can make it seem kind of slow and pretty boring. That being said, I enjoy playing it for the most part. It isn't as good as the other games, and it seems a bit lacking in content. There are a lot of names of NPC's that seem like they weren't supposed o be kept for final product (Marie Curie, Sandy♥♥♥♥♥♥ etc) that are either real people or the kind of names that make me think of prank callers. Sometimes the dialogue is funny (when you can actually read the script, which is blurry and difficult to see at the best of times), but often it is very cheesy and amatuer. There is a different tone like there were several different writers that didn't talk to each other. Turn-based games are hard to find, so for that reason, I am okay with the amount I spent on the game, but the quality is really lacking, and I won't buy any other games that may be released. IActual fighting in game is a little slower than I remembered, and some of the spells don't work (wanderer especially like Titan's Sword). All in all, it plays like an unfinished product lacking quality. The clothing on women bothers me a bit in this one, and it might just be that it comes across too desperate and is kind of annoying, not sexy in any way.  "

												Difficulty is through the roof. If you are a casual gamer, do not play this game. If you enjoy a tactical challenge, do not plays this game, as completion does not rely on tactics (in my understanding of the word) but exploitation of game mechanics not related to tactics but implementation. Dialog is as always crappy, but you are forced to spend time reading it, as the game offers little help or guidance outside what is said in the (poor) dialogs, resulting in time spend googling what to do.

This game has a good potential to be good.1) the worst thing about this game is finding out who to talk to and what to do next in the quest line. you cannot skip steps either. you must complete everything in a certain order or the dialogue choice/quest item/quest npc will not appear! a lot of the quests don't get triggered until other unrelated quests are completed and it is just a mess.2) quests are poorly designed. most of them have you deliver stuff and if someone is in the way kill it. in fact that is all the quests in the game i can think of right now. good thing there is no quest that makes you deliver a baby...imagine if a vampire or an orc or a demoness is delivering your baby. other than that you deliver anything and everything.3) quests are bugged even in the premium version. or maybe no one ever found out how to complete/trigger some of the quests....who knows? but then quests are not the only bugs, some of the combat system like the female vampire's ability is bugged as well...i guess they never really tested the female vampire's ability in certain stages. then there is also phoenix that get resurrected on top of a person occupying the tile. then there is also bugs with the sheep that gets sheeped again (who would sheep a sheep? well what happen if someone did? then the game crash!) ....4) Game certainly good, but monotony kills with a time. I prefer original part more. my assessment = 7\10			"

												Not my favorite.  I prefer to auto-combat and, in doing so, I lose the abilities of my pet.  Unless there's a patch I'm unaware of - but without being able to auto-combat it's very disappointing.Also do not like the lack of information/guidance/instruction with this game.I'm back to playing Crossroads.  Kings Bounty: Dark Side left me ""meh"".   Will only recommend to others if these points are not issues for you.			"

												i like it but it still have major bugs in the game.  The game stop all of sudden and you lose everything.  PLus the Error report DOES NOT REPORT> PERIOD.  It keep getting error message.The worst is there three main players you  can choose from. However, you can only saved the game for one player at a time.  If you played another and saved, it is rewritten over the saved game of the previous character.  Beat me why this happen. I would wait until they repair the system. "

												Good addition to the King's Bounty series, for a cheap price and decent content, especialy Sometimes you will feel kinda lost, but the game has a nice atmosphere, beautiful soundtracks (mostly from previous games but also new ones),  some jokes and references here and there, ridiculous translation at times.Prepare your eyes, you will have a LOT of texts to read because there is no voice acting in the game.In short: If you like Turn-Based Strategy games it's definitely worth a try. (free roam on world map, turn based combat)			"

Posted: June 26, 2015
												I purchased this game on the cheap as part of the King’s Bounty bundle during the summer sale. Having never played any of the other King’s Bounty games I found this one to be quite enjoyable, with a few caveats.Pros: An enjoyable combat system reminiscent of Heroes of Might and Magic or Age of Wonders, with scores of units to fight and recruit. Moreover, there is an interesting and expansive Magic/Rage system with boatloads of spells/abilities. A fun and remarkably funny storyline. You get to play the bad guy(!), which is definitely a change of pace from many games; but, to my happy surprise, the writing was good enough that I actually began feeling like I was the good guy. It’s a long (loooooooong) game, very easily 100+ hours. (Have a great deal of time that you need to murder? Look no further.)Cons: I found pacing to be a bit-- screwy, while looking for quest objectives you can wander into an area or zone that you really should not be in and quickly find yourself on the wrong side of an a** whooping. Save early, save often. Speaking of looking for quest objectives, the quest log can be somewhat vague, and at times downright counterproductive. Quite frustrating, but in the end a minor quirk. It’s a long (loooooooong) game. Unfortunately, there’s a point where progression becomes unbalanced and the story become hidden behind an endless grind of meaningless battles. This is the biggest detraction from an otherwise excellent game.Overall, I found more positives then negatives with the game. I didn’t encounter any of the bugs that others had run into, so that might have colored my experience; however, apart from a few gripes, I found the game more than decent. For me it’s a recommended-if-on-sale.7/10  (Pretty good for a game that I bought to see what bloody Snow White was all about.)			"

Posted: July 11, 2016
												Firstly I played KB: The Legend and Armored Princess ( with the Crossworlds expansion ) only skipping Warriors of the North so I am familiar with the series and could even call myself a fan and I will write this review with those experiences in mind.Short version:Pros:1. More new content ( units, spells etc.)2. Letting you play as a villain this time3. Allowing you to more seriously play others races ( undead, demon and orcs )4. Quests have been improved a bit by having limited choice and consequences here and thereCons:1. BUGS!! Damned it all if they didn't deliver on the bugs this time2. A lot of the text seems to been either poorly translated or was written worse this time3. Worse level design4. About half the achievements don't work ( they show up ingame but don't count on steam )5. Over long and more tedious than previous games ( at the time of writing this review I'm at almost 70 hours and I don't see a ending coming soon )6. While some quests are a bit more interesting a lot are the same old kill this or that and now a good number of longer chain quests don't say what you have to doRant version:Why guys, why did you release such a unfinished mess of a game? The previous 2 games I've played had almost none of the problems this one has. Probably what killed my enjoyment of this game the most were the bugs, I can deal with the way the series has been structured with the constant running back and forth for reinforcements and the somewhat railroaded pathway with an almost linear difficulty progression when it comes to the enemies.BUT I cannot deal with the bugs this game has.Actually let me make a list of the ones I've seen up till now:1.Necromancers have false info show up when hovering with the attack cursor over a enemy2.Some enemy ranged units will try to spend all of their action points even sometimes not attacking you3.A lot of achievements are bugged and cannot be gotten4.Crashes way too often compared to the previous games5.Some actions in combat seem to freeze the game and has atleast 1 made me kill the program. Or you might have bad luck and get enemy units that freeze midway through their turn in which case you have to reload and hole that they won't repeat themselves6.Some enemies had false difficulty rating show up ( until now only the priests of light that spawn after a certain quest )7.In the demon world there is a dungeon with a few items behind bars, after killing the guard and opening the prison I found that they are unpickable.8.Using the zombies ability to pass their turn to another unit can bug out if you use rage abilities. The unit which should have gotten an extra turn is passed over and a new round starts making you effectively lose a unit turn for nothing.9.There is a quest for researching dark version of light spells. If you get the dark shroud scroll, learn it and upgrade it and then later on you hand in the echivalent scrolls for completing the quest the spell will reset in your spellbook thus wasting any crystals you used on it.10.Somehow while having an enemy orc under blackies jealousy the spell didn't end and enemies started attacking that orc as well, something that should'nt happen normally with the spell.11.Killed a unit under the empathy spell and I got 30 rage points for it. I don't think thats intended.Also if the bugs weren't enough of a annoyance then I also had the pleasure of witnessing atrocious level design and pacing. Some examples :1. Spells seem to come far too late compared to previous games so get used to using the same 3 or 4 for 40 hours 2. Enemies seem to scale up in difficulty faster than you can keep up even with farming every available opportunity, again something the previous games did better ( IIRC in my playthrough of The Legend being meticulous meant that I never faced a enemy at a rating of deadly or higher until right at the end )3. Crystals for learning and upgrading spells are VERY RARE ( until you can buy them ). Again another reason why you will only use very few spells for 1/3 of your playtime4. A few quests have the nasty habit of not telling you where to find/buy this or that. This one is actually a minor complaint since they are few and the longer chain quests usually are linked more closely to progression through the game.   Actually scratch that I just found one that is tied to the main quest, is a fetch quest and doesn't say where I need to go to pick up some damned shrooms at a point in which I have access to most islands.5. Also while having more options in how you can complete or progress quests is nice, making it so that all options except one end up in a quest failure is just insulting.6. Aside from some new units a lot of the game seems recycled, with very few genuinely new assets and terrain ( meaning not just recolored like a lot of the ''new'' dark troops ) giving the game a very cheap feeling7.Related to 2: After reaching and passing what seemed to be midgame and finally unlocking most abilities, medals and troop types the difficulty seemed to nose dive straight into easy and as long as keeping with the grind of easier enemies the game never seemed to recover it's challenge.Think that's enough for now seeing as I am not done with the game yet I will probably edit and add to this review as I continue the game. It might be the worse entry yet in the series but I still like this style of gameplay and with enough time can slog through this to the end.			"

												Game is definitely random - random treasures, random monsters and etc. So the most difficult part is just the beginning. It's bad and good at the same time because it can take some time to start the game where monster's can be defeated.Later, game difficulty significantly reduces if you have right warrior's stack in your army slots.  To finish some quests you have to read dialogues carefully. They mostly contains useful tips to complete them. New units are imba, but they're great. Building your own ""citadel"" where you can upgrade your units is brilliant either.I would recommend game for those who like the series.			"

												Decent game exactly in the same vein as the previous kings bounty.This is probably the only one I didnt finish. I DO enjoy these games a lot but this one went in a mega fedex tangent and I didnt know where I was meant to go. SO, its good but I cant say brilliant. Combat is bigger and better but so are the worlds. Instead of making these games much longer I think there should be a campaign focused on more quirky combats... mad layouts and 2 v 1 or hostiles in the map sort of thing. Maybe even a 1v1v1 sort of setup happening. Regardless, its more of the same but longer and a little more tedious to complete quests.			"

												It is more of the same, so don't expect anything breathtaking. It's a King Bounty - with its usual features: a not-so-deep story, a lot of quirky humor, magic, monsters, plus the chance to play as the bad guy, chasing the good guys out of your world. The gameplay is the usual one - hexagon-map and turn-based strategy for the fights, free movement in a colorful 2D world for the exploration part. Despite not being an absolute must-have, I would recommend it on a good sale as a nice time-killer between more serious games pursuits. Just keep in mind that - being all in all quite repetitive - if feels like it goes on and on forever!			"

												I played King's Bounty Legend,King's Bounty armored princess,King's Bounty Crossworlds so I will talk about last game.Ok here we have King's Bounty:Dark Side.Developer make 4(!!!) same games:King's Bounty Legend,King's Bounty armored princess,King's Bounty Crossworlds and King's bounty warriors of north valhalla,and somehow he failed at making fifth(sic!) game called King's Bounty Dark side.So I will list pros and cons from bad to worst.Cons:-one of the stages was full of eggs spiders to just pick up to make spiders,0 guardians from this treasure.It was like undone map.-another stage was with 30-50 gold literally when at this stage of game you earn from battles like 40thousand(!!) gold.It was big misunderstanding.-sounds are glitching.90% of game sound is glitched so sometimes you heard battle sound or not because it's not trigger just.-not even one single step to make better graphics.It's just like any other king's bounty game without even one single improvement in graphic aspect.The first game was released at 2008 year and from this time literally 0 improvement.-the best tactic to win this game is just having elder vampires,vampires,black dragon,red dragon and random minion.Vampires are overpowered,they just regen and regen+you attack with drakes.Other units just stand and watch vampires doing they work.-TOOOO many quests.The amount of quests are just massive,it should be less quests and more battles.-first playing the game crash at 23(!!!!) minute of playing.I was like,ok every game can have bad days so I will go forward-game is glitching/crushing at random moments,because why not.So here are pros.A few of them from good to best:+new musics dark themed.+you can play at dark side which is fun as vampire,orc,and succub.But it's just visual,in other aspects you not really feel you are that bad guy.+you have yours bad castle(base) where you do bad things which is fun because in other games you not have your own base.+yours dragon was replaced with ""coal"" and use rage.Coal is little black things with evil white mask,and looks good.It's interesting concept to replace dragon.This game crushed my anti-virus,take full fun from next game from series King's Bounty and place me to abyss where I can cry why developer make such bad game.I ask why?I rate 2/10.C for effort but F in making.You can do better developer,you know about it.

								Nice, I can say! Not similar to previous parts. But beta seems quite confusing with empty islands, If authors did not place the right amount of decoration – it’s ok, but if treasures and monsters (read experience) are missing than probably it’s worth waiting release.  But as one of the previous comments: it nice to play bad (say “hallow” to Mr. Horned Reaper!)			"

The quest dialogue is terrible and the game crashes a lot.  The combat is actually what you would expect, without much to differentiate it from any other game of this genre; which makes it the best thing this game has to offer.  I wouldn't bother buying this at any price.			"

												Boring, unmotived, unimaginative that's the first impression I get when playing this game. As each scenario, the two I tried anyways, vampie and demoness just send you on your way with no levels, no epic beginning of game feel of battle. Just bleh, such as for the vampire, you would think after hundreads of years he would be least lvl 5, but nope not a chance, just generic lack luster lvl 1 with a single item. The game fails to impress in any sort of way, the music is bland and taken right from previous games, where in those games it was actually exciting and fit in to what was going on.When I first played a King's Bounty game, the world felt huge, inspiring, that I wanted to go explore there, dig for treasure, try things out, this version made me want to fall asleep. Yes this game does do somethings right and have expanded on the original, but the cons heavily outweigh the pros.			"

												King's Bounty: Dark Side is a game which I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish!The gameplay is extremely fun with hex-based, turn-based battles at the core of it. The environment and scenery are very nice and those combined with the breathtaking music really add to the atmosphere. Once more as with several other games the music is simply stunning: the tune heard in the Elven lands, the tune heard in the Demonic lands etc are so different and captivate the land they describe perfectly.The story if quite interesting, but it's especially the humor used throughout it which makes for a great experience.In a way it reminded me of Overlord: the game is like a parody on the traditional 'goody goody' RPG's. It's really littered (in a positive way) with funny stuff, ranging from the obvious 'victimized' role of evil, over passwords like 'QWERTY', the names of the Beatles and the island of the Light having the shape and road structure of a big peace sign.The amount of different units in this game is quite big and each unit has its own pro's and con's which makes for a great amount of tinkering and combining to try and get the 'best' army. The game also has some nice features like for example upgrading items: in order to do this you actually have to fight the 'Keepers' of this item and only if you win does it get upgraded.A minor issue with the game is the Quest log. While definitely not bad it does lack some important info at times making it unclear what has to be done to complete a given quest (in most cases such quests will advance later in the game).Near the end of the game some quests require specific scrolls in order to be completed, however those are nowhere to be found (probably already sold during the course of the game). This is a bit 'meh' in my opinion since nothing makes those scrolls stand out in any way, thus the only way to complete those quests is in a new playthrough.A bigger issue are crashes and bugs: in 50% of the time the game crashed when exiting to Windows. This is not an issue since I'm exiting anyway but it's annoying. During gameplay I had a sporadic crash caused by clear bugs. For example if one of your units does 100% damage (so kills all enemies) the game will crash, probably because the number '100' doesn't fit the allocated space or something. This happens quite rarely and when you 'know' it you can avoid it.During my playthrough at one point I was not able to go to one specific island anymore, neither through sailing nor teleporting, the game would always crash. After some rummaging on forums I found out that verifying the Steam game cache magically fixes this. All of these bugs are luckily not game breaking but they should have been ironed out by now.The advice here is to quick-save regularly so no data is lost.It took me 98 hrs to finish the game on Normal difficulty doing all quests which could be completed which is time well spent. Note that this is the first King's Bounty which I have played, so I cannot compare to previous installments.Overal I can say this is one of the best games I have ever played, great fun.I'm giving it a 9 out of 10 where the one point is deducted for the bugs.

												Even though only minor differences has been made since Kings Bounty:Legends it is still highly addictive. This one is particularly much more difficult in terms of the quests. For some quests you really have to be lucky cause there are very few clues about where you can find the particular person, item or place mentioned in the quest dialog. It is also advisable not quickly skipping the dialogues, cause sometimes the only clue you may get lies in that dialogue. And you can only see the short desciption of the quest in your quests list, not the dialog which contains the clue itself.There is a new concept of something like ""base"" called shelter, and you can get improvements and develop special units from here. This is a really nice addon.I am also glad that the darned ""runes"" thing and the spells related with that disappeared in this new version. "

												Great game, 9.5/10, perhaps the best of the Kings Bounty Series!I have played and finished all Kings Bounty games, but the previous ones felt a bit unispired, some islands were not really woven into the story. This one is different, you play the Dark side, the sory is build on capturing and ruining the best 3x3 good people on different island, and the quests are often intertwined. You have a better sense of achieving something, and so my 134h were great spent. I could complete all but 1 quests (bugged), so the game is in a good state.Playing the dark side, in my case a seductuve Demoness, was a nice change, you almost felt bad for ruining true love, making the most happy person cry and break the most loyal person :)Played on normal, and in contrast to earlier KB games, its almost a bit too easy, as with time, you have access to unlimied supply of troops (if you have enough money).Highly recommended, and looking for the next installment!

								fun game lots of hours of quests and kind of interesting story being the bad guys. 3 different heroes gives replayaiblity. how ever company isnt very good. any patchs will not affect a save file so if a game breaking bug is in the game at the time you start your game you will have to start a new game to fix it once the patch comes out. so patchs not ebing retro active can be a big issue. the company is also very shady and have lied and sneakly pushed back the release date. they said they would release patch notes that was 2 months ago still nothing and the night before the rlease they moved the date back 5 days and we still dont know why.i say either get it before rlease for the cheaper price and dlc or wait a few months till a sale and after many patches			"

								I'm a huge King's Bounty fan. I haven't gotten too far in on Dark Side, but so far this feels pretty weak in terms of level design and pacing. For example, the catacombs had their walls just lined with eggs, and thats a LOT of clicking to collect them. There are treasures with 15k gold in the first few minutes (just unguarded and hidden away in a random corner) which is ridiculous. There were areas I could get to, but I clearly wasn't supposed to be there (because there were no enemies, all the doors were locked)... and then I had to go back and talk to a person and suddenly the area could be used.In other King's Bounties, the loot and itemization was really well distributed through the map. This isn't the case here.King's Bounty never had the greatest writing, but a couple of places it was really phoned in. Just walls of text that have nothing to do with anything. Will keep playing, maybe it gets better. But I hoped the new player experience would at least be more polished.			"

												I realize that this game is somewhat unfinished, but the state that it's in is nearly unplayable. Started as demons, and the first areas were very lackluster and linear. If you don't mind playing around with a mostly empty game, it's okay, but as of this review, it's hardly worth the 25 bucksEdit: After playing the game a bit more, I discovered that the linear area with the heroes of light was not the only area available to explore. After finding Portland, the game feels much better and more like the previous King's Bounty games.			"

												I played king's Bounty the legend and king's bounty armored princess althouh toward the end I got tired of the repetitiveness and quit playing. I saw this and saw that they had 2 previous games release in between so I expected alot of changes I was sorely dissapointed : /. The graphics are identical to the first game, the text is still insanely small (thats why I'd always give up on reading it before cause itd give me headaches leaning forward to read it), the talent trees are still nearly identical if not identical, gameplay so far is identical, and even the unit sprites are the same just with different names. I'll admit there may be a little be of new content later in the game and I suppose I'll find out since I spent the money i may as well play it, but overall I'm annoyed 4 games later and the game is still the same as the first 1 just with a different story a few new units/spells/abilities/items. I'd still recommend the game for people that haven't played any of the king's bounty games, but if you've played any of the predecessors and considering buying this just go back to the other one not worth it.P.S. Its also worth mentioning that the game has already crashed on me once within 50 minutes of playing.(even morrowind/oblivion let me get further! :P )			"

												@JoYo: Because your profile is private and I could not reach you: After installing the game I had the same error. Seem like you are normally a non english game player.(e.g. german like me). Problem here is Steam: Got to your game libary in your steam client. Right click to the game and go to ""prperties"". Then go to ""Language"". There should be your language (e.g. german). Actually KB-DS only support russian and english. Put in ""english"" then you should have the normal game.But I also be disapointed in getting a beta/alpha status game. Lot of balance problems as well as dumps (e.g. if you change graphic settings) and graphic is blurred in most graphic resolutions.I will go back to WotN and waiting for major bug fixes for DS.			"

												If you're new to King's Bounty, don't make this your first game. It's the least accessible of any of them, and not meaningfully better than the old ones. Armored Princess has a lovely demo available here, and I highly recommend checking it out if you like strategy RPGs.If you've gotten tired of the series and are looking for something to shake it up, this isn't that game. It does some interesting things, but from battle to battle this isn't really distinguishable from any other one.If you're still having fun with the series and want to play more of what you've already played, this game is definitely better than Warriors of the North. The writing is still pretty charming, the quests are a lot more puzzley than previous ones (though horribly padded and sometimes painfully vague) and there's enough new to stop you getting too bored. I can't recommend it for anyone else, but if you still like the gameplay and can tolerate the bad there's quite a lot of good.			"

												Update - I've finally finished the game and my feelings about the game are very mixed. I really enjoyed the first half of the game. Things start to fall apart somewhat in the second half. Although I enjoy the quests, there are too many of them and too many of them are boring and/or buggy.Too many quests are fetch quests - find five mushrooms, get me this scroll etc. Boring. Some are buggy, or the instructions for them are so vague they might as well be buggy.Still, I did finish the game and I don't regret buying it. Kings Bounty is such a strong design that only WotN completely screws it up.Time to develop Kings Bounty 2. Maybe a Kickstarter, I will contribute.--- Original review ---------This game redeems the King's Bounty series after the terrible Warriors of the North.Unlike WotN, the game is a challenge, at least to me, on normal difficulty. The quests are interesting and at times amusing.  Reminds me of Armoured Princess, which from me is high praise.			"

												Short review if you played a King's Bounty game before: This is King's Bounty again. If you enjoyed the previous games you will enjoy this too. It's a bit more on the quest solving side but there is still as much hex map fighting and goodie grabbing as always. No ground ground breaking innovations though. Just King's Bounty.Game seems a bit longer than usual. I am 40 hours in and feel like i am half way through. Also the jokes seem to be even more silly the in previous title (seven dwarfes, really?) and your rage demon looks like No-Face from Spirited Away. But who cares. You're playing King's Bounty.			"

												King's Bounty: Dark Side is the latest installment of the King's Bounty serie. For the first time, you will play as the bad guy. The balance of Light and Dark was disturbed. The forces of Light are close to wipe all the creatures of Dark. Players will choose one of the dark heroes- Orc warrior, Demoness paladin, or Vampire mage. The beginning of the game is specific for each of the character, but the rest of the game is the same. Players will be even able to travel to the places where other heroes start. In general, I find the story to be good.The combat system is the same as in the previous games. In addition to sending forces to eliminate the enemy, players can cast spells or use abilities of their companion. The only change is that there is only one boss battle in the whole game, which some people may don't like.The other thing I don't like very much is the design of quests. In many cases, players will just run back and forth from point A. For example a witch give the player a quest to bring her five ent sprouts. Now, ents are warriors of the Elven army, so player may expect to find them in one of the two Elven isles. But to which one to go? In the end, the Ent sprouts are to be found in a completely different island, where players can buy them from the local witch, if they didn't kill her previously. Some quests may not be finished at all. For example, there is another witch that wanted from me to bring her three magic scrolls. Unfortunatelly, I was not able to find one of them in the whole world, so I couldn't finish the quest. I've seen many people complained in the forums about this kind of quests. I've aldo read in the forums that some people had some of their quests bugged. Luckily, I didn't encounter this. However, I had problems with quest marks. Sometimes, after I progressed in a quest, the question mark appeared on the next location of where I should go, but the old one didn't disappear. This caused that sometimes I had two or even more question marks regarding one quest. Sometimes, the question mark was completely missing. The quest log isn't very helpful , because it only contains the introductory description and tasks what to do in order to complete the quest. Sadly, the tasks are often written in an rather unhelpful way(e.g. “Buy a puppy”, but where to buy it). Sometimes, you are given an advice how to solve the problem and where to go, sometimes you are not. One of the quest stopped upgrading after a while. So yes, there are flaws in the design. Not frustrating, but  they spoil the fun. The game even crashed a few times. Luckily, the loading times are short, so it doesn't take much time to return to the world of Teana.One of the pros of King's Bounty is the humour. You can find references to other work of pop-culture, like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. Some dialogs are quite amusing. However, in some  dialogs players will be given more than one options how to answer, but it seems that whichever players choose, the result is the same. That is not very good, in my opinion.The story is quite good and the locations are nice. Graphics is the same, which I don't find a big problem. They added a few new songs, but in my opinion, they aren't very good. There is also the problem that remained from Warriors of the North- the game seems to select a song that is not very suitable for particular situation. Many times I've heard combat songs in the world map and vice versa. In my opinion, this spoils the atmosphere a bit. It's hard to decide whether to recommend this game. It's still fun to play, but it has its flaws. If you have played the previous games and just want another journey from King's Bounty universe and you don't mind some glitches, then you might find what are you looking for. For others: if you didn't like the previous installments, you probably won't like this one either. If you are interested in King's Bounty series but haven't played any of the games, I'd recommend you to pick The Legend or Armored Princess, which are the better ones, in my opinion. If I'd have to choose between Warriors of the North and Dark Side, I'd choose WotN, since quests in that game can be completed and it's in better technical shape than Dark Side.			"

												King's Bounty: Dark Side is the latest installment of the King's Bounty serie. For the first time, you will play as the bad guy. The balance of Light and Dark was disturbed. The forces of Light are close to wipe all the creatures of Dark. Players will choose one of the dark heroes- Orc warrior, Demoness paladin, or Vampire mage. The beginning of the game is specific for each of the character, but the rest of the game is the same. Players will be even able to travel to the places where other heroes start. In general, I find the story to be good.The combat system is the same as in the previous games. In addition to sending forces to eliminate the enemy, players can cast spells or use abilities of their companion. The only change is that there is only one boss battle in the whole game, which some people may don't like.The other thing I don't like very much is the design of quests. In many cases, players will just run back and forth from point A. For example a witch give the player a quest to bring her five ent sprouts. Now, ents are warriors of the Elven army, so player may expect to find them in one of the two Elven isles. But to which one to go? In the end, the Ent sprouts are to be found in a completely different island, where players can buy them from the local witch, if they didn't kill her previously. Some quests may not be finished at all. For example, there is another witch that wanted from me to bring her three magic scrolls. Unfortunatelly, I was not able to find one of them in the whole world, so I couldn't finish the quest. I've seen many people complained in the forums about this kind of quests. I've aldo read in the forums that some people had some of their quests bugged. Luckily, I didn't encounter this. However, I had problems with quest marks. Sometimes, after I progressed in a quest, the question mark appeared on the next location of where I should go, but the old one didn't disappear. This caused that sometimes I had two or even more question marks regarding one quest. Sometimes, the question mark was completely missing. The quest log isn't very helpful , because it only contains the introductory description and tasks what to do in order to complete the quest. Sadly, the tasks are often written in an rather unhelpful way(e.g. “Buy a puppy”, but where to buy it). Sometimes, you are given an advice how to solve the problem and where to go, sometimes you are not. One of the quest stopped upgrading after a while. So yes, there are flaws in the design. Not frustrating, but  they spoil the fun. The game even crashed a few times. Luckily, the loading times are short, so it doesn't take much time to return to the world of Teana.One of the pros of King's Bounty is the humour. You can find references to other work of pop-culture, like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. Some dialogs are quite amusing. However, in some  dialogs players will be given more than one options how to answer, but it seems that whichever players choose, the result is the same.

												This game is so♥♥♥♥♥♥comparing it to the good old KB Legend. Only a very little few of new troops. At frist i thought that there will be 3 story campaings and no, there arent , they have only 1 different starting mission. Game is boring af because you keep having a feeling that you already played this game. Developers should really get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together and create a good new game instead of realising ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games where instead of paying for them to enjoy great gameplay and new history you just pay for new location and very little of new skins. Because of that you r feeling like u r playing a really bad DLC instead of a full new game.       Game is 3/10			"
