												To start, DS was a decently cool game. Basically, it was 3D Diablo 2 with a party. The graphics were awesome and there were seamless transitions into the underground/dungeons, you only loaded initially and using teleports.However, this Steam release has two extremely deal-breaking drawbacks. The first is that the expansion pack is NOT INCLUDED.  Unlike games like Age of Empires 2, where they incorporated the expansion into the vanilla game itself and made an entirely new one, this game does not even include the expansion, nor is it available for purchase as DLC. Thanks to the wonderful world of licensing, it's gone forever.The second issue is that MULTIPLAYER IS DISABLED. This is because the legacy DS2 servers were hosted by GameSpy, which no longer exists (right? I thought the spyware would make them last forever!), and it seems that GasPowered did not believe this release would not generate enough money to justify a server of their own. What this means for you is that YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO EVEN CREATE LAN GAMES. It is conceivably possible to violate the Steam EULA to replace the .exe file with an old no-cd replacement and modify your hosts to not try to check in with GameSpy, but you will still run into This Bug. [www.tunngle.net] And so far, no one has found any solution to this problem, so in all likelihood, you will be playing in single player. This is really disappointing because, at least this problem, would have been a super easy fix on GP's part.That said, this does not make the game unplayable if you want to do single player again, or if you've never played it before, you can have the single player vanilla experience for only $6.99, which is not too bad for a game with this much content. But for me, personally, I feel it's a disappointment and false advertising.			"

												Oh man. This game. This ♥♥♥♥ING GAME. 44+ hours put into this monster. Most of my time was recorded ""offline,"" so really it's more like 50-70+ hours, 100+ on the outside. And guess what? I'm only halfway through Veteran difficulty after spending god-knows-how-many hours trying to get through Mercenary. And time of completetion on Mercenary? Somewhere in the ballpark of 15+ hours for me at least, because holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I was grinding so hard and I enjoyed every. ♥♥♥♥ing. Second. Of it. Was still a grind, but it was a very fulfilling one, I'll admit. Yes, I was trying to kill mobs so I could get this one drop that would make or break my build, but when it finally DID appear...oh man, oh MAN did I feel like everything was worth it.That should stand as a testament as to how damn addictive this game is, which is pretty damn good. Really. DIABLO(tm) is and always will be the king of Hack n' Slash Action RPGs, but this game gives the king a run for its money.A classless, skill-tree based progression system is the star of this title, having built on the framework of the first title. Now, you can tweak your builds to your liking. Combat Mage that deals ♥♥♥♥tons of AoE damage? Go for it! Melee tank that uses greatswords for massive crits? Baby, you can do whatever you want~~! Ranged character that can snipe from halfway across the map? Yes, please! Nature Mage that can makes enemy projectiles tickle like they're nothing but feathers? Oh, darling, you know how to get my motor running~~~!However, be warned! Multiclassing is nigh-on impossible, so take the game's advice to heart and stick to one class. Not that you can't do it, but it's ill-advised nonetheless.Also revamped is the town system. Instead of just being a checkpoint, you actually have a *reason* to go back to town. You can sell-off your vendor trash a *lot* easier. You can portal back to town. You can buy that one sword that gives +5 cold damage and has a chance of proccing a massive blizzard from the merchant. Sure, it's pretty bare-bones compared to other games, but gawddamn this title needed this sort of system badly.I know that a lot of Hack n' Slash Action RPGs already had this feature, and this was definitely missing from the first title. It was basically GPG realizing that they screwed up in that respect on the first title, so to see them rectify it is refreshing.Overall, this title is amazing. It's $6.99 USD or your regional equivalent. Don't even wait for a sale. Get it now. You owe it to yourself.			"

												What a beautiful game. Every now and then I run across a game that just nails its genre. The Age of Wonders series makes me feel that way for example, and more recently, Mark of the Ninja -- a game that's just an absolute pleasure to play because the makers lavished attention on it to make it a joy, and the player wants it to never come to an end.  Dungeon Siege II is one of those games.Everything that makes a fantasy action strategy game fun to play is in this game -- gorgeous artwork, evocative soundtrack, user-friendly interface, fully customizeable characters, great gear, generous loot drops, secret rooms, interesting and complicated quests, and far more gold than you could possibly need. Dungeon Siege II is like Torchlight's older brother, just as likeable but more grown up. Well, as grown up as a fantasy romp can be.			"

												I still own the physical Deluxe Edition of this DSI & DSII and was very excited to see them reach steam so that I can access and install it no matter where I might be in the world. I have probably put roughly 3k hours or more into this game alone.  I still consider this game to be one of the best action RPG's ever created. Rich story and lore, not the greatest but decent voice acting for it's time. In some ways this DSII still puts some of the newer RPG's to shame, and it is easy to see where some of todays RPG's draws it's roots from here.  At first glance the graphics look outdated, since this is not a remake of DSII, one should expect the graphics not to be top notch in comparison to today's titles. But once you zoom in to take a more detailed look at the characters, enemies, weapons, armors, & spells, it is still quite amazing. Far from the majority of cookie cutter RPG's of today DSII still stands out from the rest.  DSII is full of sidequests along with it's main storyline. But best of all true individual party member customization. A choice not truly given in a lot of today's titles. When a character joins your party you are given a ""suggestive"" path, based on the character's background in the story. But, every character & party member has all the ability trees available to them. You are not forced to build into that characters suggested tree. You want to turn your warrior into a a dual wielding assassin but also have healing, ranged, or combat magic abilites? You can do that. Or a fire wielding combat mage with a bow? You can build that too. A party of all mages? Sure. Picked up a bowman you want to turn into a healing mage? No problem. True freedom to make the party you want. Or even go solo if you want to. There are still many mods available for DSII out on the net, some of them giving minor changes to complete overhauls or new maps and in a few cases a whole new story and storyline. Want to beat down your enemies with an overpowered pillow? How about pots, pans, spoons & forks? Want to play as one of the enemies in the game? Grab the mods. With all the mods available out there it gives the game a very high replay value. Since the closing of gamespy, there has been no full internet accessibility. But creating a virtual LAN over the net using a 3rd party program like Hamachi or Tunngle can easily overcome this issue. And the Steam version user can connect to a retail disk user provided they are playing both the same version, example: DSII to DSII, or DSII BW to DSII BW, and same patch version (Since I own a retail copy disk I have been able to test this). If not, then you will not see each other in the LAN lobby. I would like to see cloud support in the future. (It is easiest to add the BW expansion Killa has provided in ""guides"" to get LAN working as it comes with the original DSII:BW launcher.)In this review I would also like to thank Killa and everyone else that have done all the work to get the DSI & DSII expansions for steam working and making all the necessary files available. So that all who have purchased it can enjoy the complete classic Dungeon Siege experience. Since DS3 lacks everything that made DSI & DS2 such great games. Also if you enjoy the Dungeon Siege series of games give Space Siege a try, which is a spinoff of the Dungeon Siege series of games set in a fictional future. Unlike Dungeon Siege, however, items are limited much like Shadowgrounds (No relation). Also Space Siege lacks the party play style of Dungeon Siege, and I have not had a chance to test multiplayer on it (unlike DSI & II, Space Siege used GPGNet, & I have not yet had a chance to see if the service still works). But still nonetheless another great game in the Dungeon Siege realm.			"

 ""I hear you’re off to cause some trouble. I don’t suppose you’d care for the company of the best fighter on the island?” Dungeon Siege 2 represents a great squad-based action role-playing game, that contains all of the best elements of its predecessor, and introduces novelties like the class based super powers and class related skill trees. It is rounded out by smart combat mechanics, an impressive storyline and immersive atmosphere. The higher difficulties will keep you entertained with new challenges, while the loot will be improving continuously. From the Dungeon Siege series this game – in combination with the add-on Broken World – is definitely the strongest one, and a remarkable example of an epic dungeon crawler. Trivia: You are the only one who can stop the evil reign of Chris Taylor in the secret pillow fighting chamber. Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements.

												It's hard to express just how much fun I had with this game. Really refined from the first entry in the series, and adds a lot of depth to character development. Managing a party instead of just one character allows you to experiement with several builds at once, and you'll unlock larger parties at higher difficulty levels. The structure of quests and sidequests often have you exploring areas you couldn't access earlier in the game, giving some good variety in where you'll be going and why.Overall a very worthy dungeon crawler standing toe-to-toe with DIablo 2 or Titan Quest			"

												Just put it to rest after a lost weekend of it.  I like it.  I am a story person and as such I order my DSs 2>3>1. 1 didnt do it for me: I never finished.  3 was good although in retrospect having played it before 2 I realize it was short and mildly less absorbing than 2. 2:positives: -story often engrossing-raising my pet to adulthood by feeding it swords, armor and accessories was delightful-at least  50% of the banter was charming, voice acting was generally good-pretty landscapes-plenty of play hours per dollar-important villain dissolves into (what looks like) black feathers at his demise; I approved.-sometimes button mashing and the resultant monster dismemberment just hits the spot.negatives:-grind, mountains of creatures to fight and fight and fight to excess.  Sometimes I began to wonder if the story would ever resume-with so many enemies piled on each other in their eagerness to finish me off on the detailed background and smeared with the varied colors of lightning, fire, death and ice it often was difficult to see who was living and who was dead.

												I love this game. Graphics have dated a fair amount, but gameplay is still very good and the story is gripping. Plenty of sidequests for completionists on top of the extensive main quest. Rogue / Mage / Warrior set up is slightly altered by having magic split between Combat mages (DPS) and Nature mages (DPS / Healer). Leveling up and character specialisation is extensive, with a lot of opportunities to specialise in different powers for each class, plus:- Warriors can choose shield and sword tanking, double-handed swords DPSing or double-wielding- Combat mages can choose between Death, Fire and Lightning magic which is important when different enemies have weaknesses to certain elements- Nature Mages can choose between Ice magic, Earth magic and Healing magic as well as having a  wide variety of buffs to help the party- Rangers can choose to use bows, crossbows or throwing knives.Definitely worth a try! Shame there's no expansion though.			"

This game is just so much fun that once you start you can't help but play it all three times through...If you consider yourself a fan of rpg, games like Sacred or Diablo, or even a PC gamer in general, you should think otherwise until you have played this game at least once in your life!

												Dungeon Siege is a series of action-RPG, where every chapter feels very distinct from others. You can see the evolution, but there are so much diversity, that people who like DS1 may be strongly against DS2, DS2 fans might be opposing DS1 and DS3... At least, it is not that hot, as ""apple vs. droid"" holywar now.Dungeon Siege II made much to expand all that was good in the DS I - the system of characters development, interesting setting of fallen and reshaping empires - just like from known history, only with magic, demons and angels... To add pathos and glory, you know.In addition to DS I formula ""take x levels with the skill - do y damage with that skill"" there was added perks - to enhance the benefits of choosing one specific path (class) rather than do them all but just on the average level (still, multiclass with some magic is better than pure melee).While the first Dungeon Siege was quite straight forward with only the very little need for backtracking, the expansion of DS II added BOTH the variety and size of different locations AND the need to go back-and-forth on the same landscape. While there exists a system of teleports for quick-travel, just the need to return to the base or some previous location every now and then feels very distinct in comparison both with the DS 1 and DS 3.What good do I see in the game?First, the developers made some work with the level design, to the point where dungeons and paths between them are not looking like intestines - like it was with DS 1 and many other similar games.Second, while the story lost more of the previous ""abandoned (Roman) legion"" lore, it become more original. Now it's the tale about power-obsessed meglomaniac and some wannabe mercenary, who unintentionally gets in the way of the ""New World Order"". On his way to make some score with the bad guy, our hero-by-chance will be loosing and gaining friends, step-by-step evolving into rebellion leader. Sounds epic, right?Other than story, good level design with bad constant backtracking quests (and some good quests thereto), and somewhat original (at its time) character grading system... I have to say that the game is quite dated. And even back in time when it looked good, it wasn't the brightest star even between so-called ""Diablo-killing"" action RPGs. Not to mention more pure RPGs like Bioware stuff... There are some nice little things - like the spells to make looting more easy work - but they can't outweigh the main issues, like the general fun-out-of-the-game (which can't be measured, but can be compared).As a summary, game's not a bad one. It's decent, like 7/10 in my book. But would I recommend it to the new players? Hardly. If you have desire for old-school gaming, find the real brilliants, like early Bioware products, Divine Divinity or Arcanum - don't start with ""somewhat original"" copycats, unless you want to grow a dislikeness to old games in yourself.

												I like lots of things about DS2.  I like that item shops are useful, that they tried to give your companions actual characters, and that the female models wear sensible armor.  I liked the design of several boss fights, and the efforts they went to (in some areas, anyway) to disguise the basic linearity of the game.Unfortunately, DS2 is one of those games where you had to buy the DLC to get the actual ending - DLC that doesn't seem to be on Steam.  So this game gets to the climax and goes ""HAHANOPE"".  Completely unsatisfying.			"

												Is it just me or did anyone else who's attracted to women fall madly in love with Taar? I've been hooked on Dryads for years because of her.The game has some age on it. It's not super complicated like others that are available now, but it didn't have to be. Trying to keep your party alive in a skirmish was enough to make you wish you had a diaper on. The story was great and most of the characters where likable. The voice acting was ok.I think it's way better than the 3rd installment.The dryad Taar had an INCREDIBLY sexy voice. Srsly. She could read a dictionary to me any time.Make sure you know where your hot key is to use potions as well as the hot key to select specific members and the whole party. Health drains fast. Even faster when a caster's mana dries up.There are different skill levels for the game. They encouraged you to up the skill level in an interesting way. Not sure if they're the first to do it or not, but it was effective - you could have more characters in your party if you choose a higher challenge.Which leads me to one of the greatest things about this game! The dialogue!! (Oh, and do yourself a favor and find the mod that takes care of the issue where everyone stops talking and you miss out on that part of the story if a bad guy walks up and attacks. Which happens ALL THE FREAKIN TIME!) The inter character banter is flawless. No matter what combination of characters you have or how many, they all interact naturally in conversation. They seem to develop sort of complex relationships between them. They say different things to each other depending on who's there. I've played the game through a billion times over the years and I'm constantly hearing new things.Someone needs to make a NPC follower of Taar for Skyrim and all other sandbox games I like. WHERE IS THE FUNDING FOR THIS!?!?The game does have a massive inventory of weapons, armor, rings, amulets, shoes, reagents, bathroom accessories, nicnacks, etc etc.. Also, look up the mod that changes the size of your stash box to 255x255 squares. There exists one to do the same with your pack mule and your own inventory. Bump up the resolution and collect some loot!It's also a pretty long game. You're not going to beat it in a few hours. Even if you cheat via the console, it'll still take a few days. There's SO MUCH territory to cover, puzzles to solve, banter to listen to, cut scenes, missions, shopping.. The boss fights are also super long. Not that they're oppressively hard (though they can be on Legendary), they just require a lot of tactics and strategy. And the bosses have insane HP pools.Games as of late have really lost the charm this little gem has. Yeah, the graphics aren't what games have today, so don't get your hopes up if you come across a mod that makes all the girls sans clothing. Though the world does look pretty good. It also doesn't have much in the way of DLC and fortunately you don't have to bust your wallet out and type in credit card numbers every five seconds to get one item you need to progress like those lamentable ""free to play"" crapsterpieces.  When you enchant items, you don't need a doctorate from MIT like the spells in Lichdom.But, you do have to be careful where you spend your skill points, lest you ruin a character. You do have to plan ahead. You do have to be quick on the keys. But most importantly, you are definitely rewarded for it all.If you've made it this far, you prolly will buy and play the game. I'd like to leave you with one piece of advice that will save you much frustration, and it has to do with elevators:When you put your party on a lift to go up or down into a new area, there is one glitch in the game that will bone you. Even if you get all your characters on the platform; for whatever reason, when you trip the lever to move, one or more of your people will say ""I'm out, peace!"" and walk off the platform before it stars to move. Often times dumping you into a mob of baddies you simply can't beat with only half your members (or even sans one).So here's what you do. Arrange all your peeps on the platform. Move one of them right next to the lever and use them to pull it. This way, when you go down, if there are a billion bad guys, you can use that same character to bring your party back to safety before anyone dies.If you can't get them all to go up or down at once, and this happens, here's the strategy that I have used for years.Set everyone's AI to aggressive. Try to get your magic users to all go down. Leave the Melee and archers behind except for one (which you will keep selected and control) next to the lever. The reason why you do this, is because a melee character will run off the platform as soon as it touches down and end up toast. The magic users will stay on the platform and hit everything from a distance.KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON HEALTH!! If you're fighting low level creatures, come up once the lowest health meter is at 1/4. If you're fighting high level creatures, come up as soon as the lowest one is close to  1/2. If they're super high creatures (and this is actually a good strategy to kill them period) then go down and only say there long enough for your mages to charge their spells. They'll continue to pelt the baddies as you're coming back up. While you're in your safe zone, use that time to heal and let your mana recharge.Love and cherish Taar. She is the soul and conscience of your group.			"

												A great overhead RPG with a simple combat system and a great story. the graphics aren't the best and the inventory system can get sort of cramped, but hey, at least they're voice acting.And i could have sworn there was an addon for this called ""Broken World""... oh well.			"

												I spent many hours playing this with multiple character builds before I got it on steam, lots of fun had. I bought the Dungeon Siege bundle x3 on steam expecting ease of use, functionality and no drama in getting it to work and sorting out CD keys and updates on multiple computers of my family...Started game Multiplayer disabledNot cool.I normally would give this a big thumbs up but the steam version has multiplayer disabled because the online servers are no longer in existence, the problem is that local/LAN has also been disabled along with that for no reason at all other than laziness I guess, because they just disabled the multiplayer menu button in the main menu. Even when I played this by myself I used the multiplayer function so that I could use my characters when I wanted to play with friends and for certain features in the game host settings that were not in singleplayer.So you are better off getting it somewhere else.

												Dungeon Siege II...what can I say but awesome indeed.  Gas Powered Games built on the success of the original game and released it in 2005 after some delays.  They listened to the community who said the original was too linear, so they made the quests a bit more tactical and also made combat  less automated in this continued storyline.  Later in 2006 they released the official expansion  Dungeon Siege II: Broken World.			"

												Classic Duneon crawl hack & slash Rpg style game, Simple chracter development, great grp managment, inventory sharing, extra storage space located at all city teleporters.  I played this game years ago, great story and even still find it some what additive.  The difficulty is based on level ranges you choose at beginning of a campaing so you can scale everything to your chracters level. It also has and import and export feature so you can choose any character you create and start at that level you extported them at on a new campaing.  Graphics will full you at menu, but they get normal. Dosen't support HD resolutions and 32 bit max on graphics, but still gets good fps and for the time period this game is not that bad in graphics. Easy camera controls once you get use to hotkeys and keyboard and mouse gaming incase your rusty at em.Fan of classic Dungeon crawls, hack & slash you ight get a kick out of this game. This game is similiar to Dungeon siege 3 but game play ui, and combat are really different is some ways.Edit: Steam really messed up the installation of this game and it fails to install the expansion properly.Trying to follow the fix, but it requires you to edit the PC registry which can really mess up your PC if you do not know what your doing.  ****** if you attempted to fix this on your own, Back up your registry before you begin********** Steam if your going to sell this product then you need to work with the developer or something to make sure it installs correctly. Edit: I found a post on Steam that some one made the fix and includes all the stuff Steam fails to install correctly.  it's in a Zip folder i tested out the file first on my Virtual PC.  Its safe: no virues or hacks cause i don't trust anyone, but my parents.Still worth playing its just a real pain to get working 100%			"

												Great game that I replayed many times.DS1 was a great start to this series and DS2 expanded on it wonderful with still a great deal of freedom in character/group construction.DS3 destroyed the series compeltely when they removed all of the good points and added many horrible additions.DS2 tho? Great great game.The only reason I can't go play DS1 every once in a while for fun is because DS2 is just so much better/expanded off of it. Pause combat at it's best (if not a little old).			"

												You get way more in game than what you pay for, it's fun and very enjoyable. The story is really enticing you will find yourself actually konwing the areas and the name of the characters also there is a huge amount of lore involved in the game. There is a specific feature in the game which is that you have to type in your spells in a pedestal by using your keys and it will grant you the buffs, I found that pretty neat feature in the game there is also the characters that are involved in your trip eachone has a specific personality according to their race which is another great feature to have a game that this cheap not to mention the loot and the dungeon crawling is fun and rewarding mostly because there are tons of secrets and areas to explore.

												Dungeon Siege II features more of the action and party mechanics that made the first Dungeon Siege a hit, but with better graphics and story. Still, it all feels a bit old by today's standards. It's unlikely that this game will now appeal to any but those seeking a nostalgia kick for 2005. "

I have had this game since the year it first came out in stores and was ecstatic when it came out on steam!! I play many different ways with different characters. Experimenting with allies and pets and skills is what keep me pouring hours into the game. there is replayability with this game as the dialog of certain characters is worth building different parties. I think this is one of those games that will have me hooked to the day I die XD brilliant!! 10/10 Mate!			"

												Having played through DS1/2 before a few years ago, I got this as part of a package deal (DS1,2,3) and didn't notice that it didn't include all the DLC/xpacs. IMHO if you're going to play Dungeon Siege 1 or 2, you play it with all the DLC/xpacs. Even more so if you're going to play it in multiplayer, which simply doesn't work as is in the STEAM version.If anything, they probably bundled this to get people into buying DS3, which is nothing like Dungeon Siege 1 or 2.

												One word.....WOW!!!  I have bought so many games where I have either returned them for a refund or played once and never bothered again.  This is the 1st game since Football Manager that has the potential to cost me a divorce as football manager nearly did.  Bye bye wife.  Hello Dungeon Siege 2.  The game is just brilliant.  Yes the graphics are dated and yes there is aot to get your head around but it is so much fun.  Unlike other games in the genre like Torchlight you dont just get given loads of loot.  Yes there is still plenty but it feels so much more rewarding to get new weapons.  For example I had a 2 handed hammer that I couldn't use until I hit melee lv 5 and unlocked a certain skill from the skill tree usinf skill points.  Once I met this criteria it was so satisfying to equipt my new hammer and smash everything up with it.  On other similar titles in this genre you just seem to get given weapons or there are too many weapons.  This game puts them to shame.  I love the story as well.On a final note as well this game is an excellent way of losing weight in the same way football manager was when it owned my life.  Normally I just eat and eat and eat but I have played this for the last 7 hours solid and never thought of food once.  Actually now that I come to mention it im absolutely starving here so im off to raid the fridge now.			"

												This used to be one of my favourite games. Saw it on sale 75% off and thought I had to get it; I read the reviews, people complaining about graphics problems, how you cant play multiplayer anymore, how it doesn't even come with the expansion. I thought, i'd ignore them. Bad choice. Game loaded, of course no multiplayer or expansion; so I started the campaign, changed the graphics settings to max and the game crashes, I restart, change it to default and yet again game crashes before anything even loads. Repeated several times, reinstalled, cant even load up the title screen it just crashes. The fact that steam sells the product in its current state is a joke. Do not buy it as it is until they change it.The game itself, having played it before is amazing probably 9.5/10, but there is no point in having a great game if you cant even load it.			"

												Dungeon Siege 2 keeps the same format as DS1, with a few improvements. Now there is a single player replayability target. In order to really complete the game, it is necessary to finish it at least 3 times using the same character, due to the XP level suggested for each difficulty level.Now it is possible to craft special items, instead of waiting for them to appear as loot, there are special powers that can be used sometimes during battles. The inventory part suffered some small changes, but keeps almost the same as the first game. The main change in character development is that now it is possible to improve some type of ability as you level up.For fans of the first game it is as good as that one. unfortunately, as DS1, DS2 steam version does not include the Broken World expansion, but even like this there will be many hours of play time.

												Truly representative of the party based RPG genre, Dungeon Siege allows you to build your party in a myriad of ways to represent the characters that you want. Want to be a spellslinging archer who can dodge out of the way of attacks in melee? You can do it. Want to be a master of all weapons? you can do it. Want to be a true mage, master of every discipline? You can do it. Want to be a warrior that augments his own prowess with buffs and summoned companions or even normal animal companions? You can do that too.Experience freedom alongside an interesting story and more threats than you know what to do with. Play the game again on a higher difficulty with the same party, and then do it all over again. Play online with your friends.The only thing I can complain about with this game is there is a tad too much combat, making finishing it a significant investment of time. Especially if you want to make cross discipline warriors so you need to find all the enemies and repeatedly train. My other issue is that it is remarkably...well, easy. Maybe it is just me.As for the story, it is pretty much a direct continuation of the first game after a great deal of time has passed. The world is not the same. It has undergone changes and entered a new Age entirely. The game explains this all in the early stages.(Overall 7.5, Story 8/10, Gameplay 8/10, Graphics 6/10, Sound 7/10, Replayability 8/10)			"

												just beat this game and it was a really great little diablo/torchlight type game.you can really customize your characters skills and have up to 4 total party members that you can switch out with others as you find them.(others will wait in the inn if you want them back. you can also add +1 additional character after beating the game and going into the next harder mode with that group only).Classes are mage - with fire, lightning, death magic.healer - with a few support spells.warrior - tank or 2 handed melee or dual handed.range type - with either bow or thrown blades.you can mix classes, i usually give my warriors a few points into healer so i can rez other party members after a tough fight. ( you have 400+ mana, might as well use it )you can play any way you want = 4 mages or 1 archer and 3 warriors go ahead.you can also add pets scorpion wolf spider and more, all with diffrent roles.you can add armor, weapons and spells and have an inventory for each party member.you also get to add the skill points for each party member as they level.if you have played the first dungeon siege you know that one felt more like a crawler, were after every battle demanded a save, this one is more fluent less likely to die arcade type.cons: the enchanting was not that great.you cant have more than 4 party members untill you beat the game and get to the next difficulty level.(so you beat the game and want to create a new character and start on medium you cant do that.)when you do play the medium level you have a chance to re-invite the party members from the first run thru with all the skill points reset, but its bugged so only a few you can release from the inn and it wont let you re-invite if you already have them.some of the uniqes and set items you find are way out of your level, im getting really nice lvl 13 items at level 45....if you send group members to the inn, they wont level and some will, 3 levels below your main.

												I've started playing Dunegon Siege II as a continuation to my adventure on the first one, and even if it has some points in which it does not remind its antecessor, it's really nice to see how you get stronger by each chapter that passes.DS II may be a 10-year-old game, but it easily surpasses in difficulty and gameplay some of the games nowadays (do not expect much of the graphics since it's from 2005)I recommend this game to people looking for an RPG similar to Diablo and that look for a very good background storywith lots of sidequests.

												just beat this game and it was a really great little diablo/torchlight type game.you can really customize your characters skills and have up to 4 total party members that you can switch out with others as you find them.(others will wait in the inn if you want them back. you can also add +1 additional character after beating the game and going into the next harder mode with that group only).Classes are mage - with fire, lightning, death magic.healer - with a few support spells.warrior - tank or 2 handed melee or dual handed.range type - with either bow or thrown blades.you can mix classes, i usually give my warriors a few points into healer so i can rez other party members after a tough fight. ( you have 400+ mana, might as well use it )you can play any way you want = 4 mages or 1 archer and 3 warriors go ahead.you can also add pets scorpion wolf spider and more, all with diffrent roles.you can add armor, weapons and spells and have an inventory for each party member.you also get to add the skill points for each party member as they level.if you have played the first dungeon siege you know that one felt more like a crawler, were after every battle demanded a save, this one is more fluent less likely to die arcade type.cons: the enchanting was not that great.you cant have more than 4 party members untill you beat the game and get to the next difficulty level.(so you beat the game and want to create a new character and start on medium you cant do that.)when you do play the medium level you have a chance to re-invite the party members from the first run thru with all the skill points reset, but its bugged so only a few you can release from the inn and it wont let you re-invite if you already have them.some of the uniqes and set items you find are way out of your level, im getting really nice lvl 13 items at level 45....if you send group members to the inn, they wont level and some will, 3 levels below your main.

												I have always loved this game.  Years ago, a friend of mine got me hooked.  It was my first action RPG, and this game made me fall in love with the genre.  I measure all other games by this one.  In truth, I had never played RPGs before, and I recommend this if you are new to action RPGs, or even RPGs at all.For those of you who loved turn-based, and/or more micro-managing tactical, this may not be for you.  This is a game where I can just ""veg-out.""  Decisions do not matter, and you are guided on one path, but you do get to take party members with you and build each up with one of four different classes:  Melee, Ranged, Combat Magic, or Nature Magic.  (Side-note:  each party member has their own small and optional side quest.)This game has great replay value, since you can customize your character and pick one of four classes (listed above) and one of four races.  Character customization is a MUST for me.  You can choose gender for Humans and Elves, but Dryads are only female, and Half-giants are only male.Happy Gaming!			"

												This is by far the funnest of the Dungeon Siege series! You don't have to play the first game to understand the story (which is pretty decent by the way). The gameplay: It's similar to that of the Diablo series, it's point and click movement/combat, except that you can control a party of up to 6 characters (it's easier then it sounds). You can set each character to automatically perform a certain attack or spell. So the only character you have to actually worry about controlling is the one you choose to select as the leader. You gain skill points that you can spend on certain active and passive skills: shield block, less mana consumption for casting spells, dual wield extra damage, etc. The active skills you earn are based on what passive skills you choose. Example: by investing skill points into the passive skill ""increase cold spell damage"" you earn an active skill that blasts several shards of ice that do massive damage.  Adding the skill point system really improved the oversimplicity of the first Dungeon Siege leveling and combat system (don't get me wrong though, the first one was still fun too). Another addition, is that you can enchant items by finding or buying certain ingredients. You can make some really powerful armor/weapons. This feature definately adds more strategy and depth to the gameplay. Lastly, the environments are very dynamic and beautiful. There are lots of fun extra dungeons/caves to explore.I definately recommend this game! "

												why do I like this game so much?? The story is awful, half the setting is ripped straight off LOTR, more than half of the mechanics are ripped from Diablo, the textures are fugly, the voiceacting's despicable, and the range of characters you can add to your party is way too limited.It's just really fun and plays so smoothly. The skills from the different classes compliment each other well and it's persistently satisfying to run around as a self-sufficient MMO group forever free from idiots, incompetence, AFKers, bickering, leavers, jerks, etc. And DS2 really benefits from an easy pause mechanic where you can take a minute to look around at how your party is doing: tank up front getting hit like a champ, mages and archers frozen casting fireballs and shooting bows, and healer behind everything. Behold my synergy.			"

												Wow this game is awesome. I've been playing games for 25+ years and this is one of my favorites. The stats on weapon drops from the drops is fun to compare, the fights are fun, you can pause the game to switch party members and switch weapons/spells/etc. by pushing the space bar which is really fun for strategizing, the game doesn't feel linear because you can explore out a bit and there are side quests. The story is nice. The cities are cool. There is an elf city which has a lift to get up which is pretty cool as well; really enjoying this one. I'd give this 9/10. The graphics are still decent, but it's the gameplay that makes this one shine.If your trying to pick one Dungeon Siege game I'd go with 2, followed by the first one, and then the Dungeon Siege III.

												A great game - it was everything I expected it to be and more. The dealbreaker however is that the game is terrible for handling saves.No matter how diligently you save there is always the risk of the game rolling back several hours to an earlier position. I was unfortunate enough to have to pretty much go through most of act 2 again, despite saving dozens of times since a particular part of the quest progression.I eventually gave up and uninstalled. There is no use beating a dead packmule.(Ignore the hours played. I was working from a shortcut)			"

												One of my favourite RPGs :)From back in the days if you didnt like Diablo or wanted something little bit different you had DS1&2, and both are great.Love on how many side quests  you can stumble upon and then it takes more than one chapter to finish them, makes you explore and discover hidden paths to finish those.Story good vs evil, sword vs shield, what is there not to like, classic fantasy to enjoy :)Too bad they turned servers for multiplayer off :(And also if you are thinking to get DS3 after playing this one then just dont, its only a name slapped on some crap to milk the money.

												Dear fellow steam users,Growing up in the 90's, games like these are my weakness and I find myself trying to go back to them to relive some old memories. If you are in this situation or you have never heard of this game and would like to try it please DO NOT put money in Steam's pocket and read on....This game is neither optimised for computers Windows 98+ nor recommended... After messing around with compatibility settings and other graphical settings for hours I came to the conclusion this game is completely unplayable. The cursor has a habit of disapearing on the game menu, you are unable to select any character customisation, skipping some cinematics causes the game to crash and of course frequent in game crashes (if you get that far) every couple of minutes. - All the above have been noted and debated in LOTS of steam threads...After trying on different computers I settled on the fact this game cannot be played so I decided to take it up with Steam Support... I have had a ticket open for 2 weeks so far and the only reply I got was an automatic ""check your game files"" nonsense...Steam... your customer service is s**t and utter shambles... And this needs to be acknowledged...I realise I will never get back my £5 and I ask that if you are reading this you actually google and see for yourself the rubbish... I loved this game when I was younger and the fact Steam are putting it on their system, charging money for it and it not actually working in the basic sense is the same as going to Curry's and buying a TV with a smashed screen with duct tape over it.Steam remove this game from your store.Fellow Steam users...avoid this game.Kind regards,One ticked off Steam User.

												I'd say the game predates better design, but that's not true, it just suffers from bad design.  There are two serious issues that cripple what honestly seems otherwise a reasonable game.  First is movement.  Point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, etc.  Come on, seriously?  No constant movement like Diablo of YEARS before?  No directional keys to move and attack at the same time of later games of this same era?  That's pretty terrible.  Second is your attacks/ abilities.  You have immediate access to a rich array of spells and attacks, but you can only use one at a time.  No hotkeys for spells?  You're kidding...  Nope, you have to go up to the corner to click on a little button to change to one of a select few that you have put in your ready tray, likely bumping the edge of the screen while at it which changes your camera view/rotation.  This is just a UI failure all around.  If I could hold the mouse button to move and hotkey 4 spells/attacks into the 1-4 keys to swap ablities in combat easily, I'd be all into this instead of detailing why you shouldn't bother with it.  A third issue of note is that there is VERY strong discouragement in the tutorial that you should pick an attack and stick with it, meaning melee, ranged, or spell.  Great, except for the fact that spells use mana which runs out, the other two are infinite.  Yep, infinite arrows, finite mana.  So, you CAN'T stick with spells, you MUST swap out to something else, which again isn't easy by design and starts to impact your development apparently by the warnings.  Fundamentally obvious design flaws they could have easily fixed and made this a total win.			"

												A good classic-style dungeon crawler RPG, this game has been a constant in my life. It has a good system of character creation, keeping the feel of the previous game and it allows for a handful of good different playstyles. The mecanics are simple enough that anyone can pick them up and the story is just intriguing enough for you to keep playing. With exciting loot and diverse characters this game is solid all round.

												This is a great game. I like this game a lot as I played it when it first came out and I hadn't played it since then until the Steam version came out and I bought this game a while back. Yeah the graphics might be dated and other things but I love the pause feature in this game and ability to mod it. Even just playing the regular game without mods is very fun and I have spent quite a bit maxing out characters. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who wants to hardcore game on it because this game is more like you grab the good items as you go along and rarely needs farming ever. I really love how it is not a grind and I can continue just going through the story and relaxing back while playing. I also see people complaining about no multiplayer. Do you really expect a game made over a decade ago to have multiplayer? That is a waste of money for the company to host servers on a game this old. Overall I'd recommend this to anyone looking to relax and have fun time playing a game instead of being in a constant grind for items and levels.			"

												Dungeon Siege was a childhood classic of mine, and picking it up for under 2 euros was a really great experience. Reliving all the morbid humour, the awesome loot caves and the small easter eggs. Compared to other titles the story may seem weak and inflexible while combat systems doesn't seem too inviting, and I may have to agree. This is a simple game, but one thing that I would really recommend trying out if you haven't is a party system, which is what makes this game unique: You can have up to 4 people, 5 or 6 when replaying on a higher difficulty, and that is what makes this game really shine. Being able to actually use all the loot you get instewad of being forced to sell that bow because you are a One-Handed Rogue  makes it really seem like a forgivable game. 50 hours of hacking and slashing down the Haku for a price of around 2 bucks is worth it if you are into casual gaming, so buy it on sale but keep in mind it is a fairly old game.(Oh and people complaining about not having DLC or multiplayer: It doesn't matter♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game is still awesome)			"

												I was looking for a basic dungeon game with a skill tree, treasure, and magic items to augment your character.  I just wanted a game to dive into and kill some time.  This game is the perfect fit.  I've only played it for a couple of hours, but I really like it.  The world is pretty fluid, I love the click to move, treasure is realistic, and though I'm playing easy mode, it's not extremely easy.  Kiting is realistic as the AI will follow you for a bit, then give up on you.  What a steal it is at $6.99, thanks Steam.			"

												I played and beat the first dungeon siege way back in the day, so thought lanning this with a buddy would be fun. Turned out not so fun, we're running windows 10 so game is broken out of the box, we fixed that, then had to install fixes to get multiplayer enabled, couldn't use the default exe to get the game functional (hence the 7 minutes play time listed for me) but we got it working thanks to community fixes and some tinkering.The game itself, just isn't very good. The party AI is so awful it makes the game a giant chore. Case in point, your healer just wants to make a bee line straight into a new pack of enemies and die. Without a healer you front line melee players go down in seconds vs an evenly leveled foe. The only party commands are positional, which is almost completely worthless, and manually controlling every character individually is impossible with the UI. You need to constantly adjust the camera, it's such a pain the butt.To add salt to the wound, ressurecting in town makes you lose ALL of your gear. Saving and exiting automatically spawns you in town as well, and the sparse portal locations make traveling a giant chore. All in all I can see why this franchise ultimately failed, technical issues aside, poor game mechanics really make this game not fun to play.			"

												The game begins pretty cool. You are part of an invasion force working for the bad guys.  Now that is awesome!  I thought the developers came up with an interesting story, where you are not saving the world like in EVERY other Rpg.But immidiately after the introduction you get captured by gay elves. And from then on you are working for the ♥♥♥♥ing elves. Was a bit disappointed by that.It is still a good game, though I didn´t like it as much as the first Dungeon Siege. Graphics and gameplay are almost the same in both titles. So if you have the choice of getting DS1 or DS2, better choose the first.			"

												So this game is somewhat repetitive. But it's still fun as long as breaks are taken occiasionally. I've got a friend who says this is his favorite RPG ever. I can't see why. This is by no means a bad game but there are better ones. If you've played Torchlight a dozen times, crushed all the orcs in Lord of the Rings Online, and slain the ultimate boss in FATE then this game will give you something new.There is no 1 town you go to. No shopkeeps you keep going back to. No place you will call home for more than couple hours of gameplay. This game has you travel through countless areas as you progress down the storyline. From a dense jungle, to a barren desert, to misty mountain roads, to woodlands infested with all sorts of monsters. Pros- -Don't stick in 1 place long enough to get bored with it-Loads of varied inviroments-A party system. And a fairly good one at that-Good story-Variety in everything from weapons to monsters to shopkeeps and townsCons--Can be repetitive-Boring to play for hours on end-You have to play through the game multiple times to get a full party. You start with 4 and can get up to 6 by completing the game twice-Graphics have aged horribly. Like really badly. All the characters and mobs are super chunky. As is the enviroment. "

												I used to like this game so much that I had to get it once I saw it on Steam... I guess my ability to put up with♥♥♥♥♥♥decreaed with the years.This is, to be blunt, the most frustrating game you'll ever play.Your ranged characters will stroll right in the middle of the fight before attacking, your fighters will run up to where their target was a minute ago and attack the air, and you'll be going up and down lifts a lot.Screwing up a character permanently is as easy as an accidental click on an icon, or forgetting to change a skill after you used it, or changed a mage's weapon. Before you know it, your wizard knows martial arts. Especially later in the game, you can't let a thing slip without gaining several levels in an unwanted skill (which will slow down progress in those you want), this is the most unforgiving interface I've ever seen.Save yourselves some stress.

												I was a little dissapointed over the quality of DS2 over DS1, graphics are truely better. You can only play on Easy diffuculty untill you finish all 9 Chapters (last two-three chapters are pure fighting with bosses and hordes of enemies between them). I was surprised I achieved level 44 by the end even though Mercenary difficulty is limited to 39 level.Half of the game is no challenge untill you meet some strong bosses with higher level than your best member. Game includes a lot of story telling and side quests. Creatures are respawning after getting over a little area out, so firstly cleared area can be full of enemies again.Usually you have teleporters at every few meters forward and you can easily move between three main cities. I was a little frustrated by the end that there was no teleporter and I did not achieve to kill final boss at first chance so I had to fight the hordes of enemies between him and last and closest teleporter.Though I was not satisfied with the beginning of the game (probably until level 20), I enjoyed slaughtering through hordes of 38-40 level enemies.You can specialize your characters into more styles of fighting, for example mage for melee and magical attacks but less  efficient armor and weapons you will be able to equip on him if you do not stick to one style. There are also armor sets which will add you some nice bonuses.I am happy about the story but the enemies could be more balanced, even though I did not know how the power attacks and other things are, I managed to easily go forward.And big con for stupid AI, my members were driving me crazy, when some of them got lazy to walk and stopped so I had to go back to them or when they got into strong enemy and instead of running with my selected one away to heal, they all ran towards death. I found out pressing R solved this problem, but I only found out by the end of the game.You are offered with few puzzles in dungeons, mostly simple ones, but there are few you have to think through a little more time. Nice addition.It took me 50 hours to finish the game. The hardest part of the game was at the Chapter 7 when I had to fight multiple bosses at once so I basically finished all possible sidequests to improve stats and equipment and after that just slaughtered them. Even though I improved only from level 40 to 42, it helped me a lot against them.Another con: you can only save in one slot by pressing CTRL+S so no older saves possible but not needed. You just need to save while you are in town or before boss fights. Otherwise you will die and get automatically teleported to the town with butt naked. At least you have your inventory, so if you have secondary equipment or something in your chest, you can take it and reclaim your lost items easier.Bugs: enemies sometimes get stuck in the wall so they do not attack but your heroes barely attack them too and it is hard to get their loot if you do not stand close enough. Sometimes enemies, especially last remaining of the horde assault will stop attacking you until you strike them (it may be intended as losing morale over dead allies), but to me it looks like bug. Some enemies and even your melee characters tend to circle over their opponents to strike them from another angle, which has no special effect on damage. Ranged attackers tend to shoot walls and ground if below or behind the terrain and you have to manually move your selected one deeper to enemy lines to move whole party. But still these bugs do not destroy whole game experience, it is not disaster.			"

I was about to drop it competely after experiencing how intensely penalising dying is in this game, but I saw you can set invincibility mode on by chanting +drlife. (-drlife removes it). At the very least I can go get my gear back.Also, Taar is absolutely amazing! I hope to encounter such a character again in another game.			"

												Most of my PC gaming life was with the first Dungeon Siege and Legends of Aranna. The gameplay was easy to understand and honestly preferred it over Diabalo, graphics were pretty amazing. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game if you expect it to be similar to the first of the DS series.I don't know if it's just my computer (which runs games like Chivalry Medieval Warfare pretty well) or it's the game, but the textures aren't as good as you'd expect for the second game of the DS series, heck the first DS looks better and even more crisp. The second thing I don't like about this game is they seem to have thrown the party options like having the whole party target the weakest or strongest enemy, being able to highlight and select all party members to regroup.The next thing is more of a personal preference but I'm not a big fan of having to continuously use the right click to attack. I'm more used to the DS1 single click and let everyone do the dirty work.Next is the lack of game settings, there isn't a whole lot you can adjust.Lastly (I think) everything seems so cluttered, mostly the objects in the game like crates you can't destroy followed by other nit-picking like how fat the cursor is.Now obviously I haven't spent much time ingame but to me DS2 was a disappointment in comparison to DS1 but it's all the matter of personal preference. When I think of ""Dungeon Siege"" I think of an idle action packed game that's simply point and click while you manage your party's health, but this game is trying to be Diablo with some differences here and there. (Diablo is a cool game, but just not my style)Unfortunately I cannot recommend the game if you've come from the DS1 world, I'd consider it as a downgrade. Although, for $7 I guess it's okay			"

												This is the DS 2.  Not many people know about it because it wasn't very popular at the time.  It was quickly overshadowed by other, more well-known handheld systems such as the Playstation Portable, the Atari Lynx, the Sega Dreamcast, a fluffy kitten, and the Nintoaster.  I recommend getting the physical DS 2 instead of the download one, because the screen on my download one keeps falling off, and I have to re-download new ones.			"

Unless you are a big Dungeon Siege fan, I would skip out on the game unless its going for around $2.49.			"

												this game is honestly very good but just pirate it or get an actual copy of it... THE ISSUE the steam version for this game is literally trash, alot of people don't have any problems with it but atleast for me (windows 7 x64) the game crashes after the first 10 seconds, also the one time i managed to start a new game before it crashed it had REALLY bad fps and my pc while being♥♥♥♥♥♥still goes over the minimum requirements... which lie, the game under the minimum requirements says ""1.0 GHz"" and then i install and launch it and get a pop up that says "" need to have minimum 2.0ghz"" which is also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because if you pirate this game you won't have preformance issues... but the steam version is just♥♥♥♥♥♥in all regards, and also the game lied on that pop up about my system requirements like "" you need to have minimum 32mb of video memory"" which mine is way more than that... GAMEPLAY Played this game first in 2006 and a couple more times since then, for the gameplay side this game is like diablo or other games, very fun and fluent , simplifys alot of stuff but is still very fun, there are 4 main classes you can useTank who uses swords and shiedsranged bowhealer that can summon animalsand a mage that can use mostly fire attacks can also summon animals and usually does the 2nd most dpsclasses in your group usually, tho i can't explain much more about the gameplay trough text just know that it's well worth a price tag above 30 euros/what ever you use STORY (spoilers) the story is about getting all parts of a shiled that was destroyed by an acient powerful sword that is in the hands of a powerful monark, he is your main enemy in this game and the person you chace after after he betrays you and your best friend when you both fought in his army, in the story you mostly just follow his trail untill you get back home and you find out most of it his destroyed, this is really where the game gets good and i won't spoil anymore other issues  so asside from the fact that the game runs like crap and lies about the requirementsfor NO REASON at all the game disables the multiplayer (only on the steam version btw)tho you can enable it again trough means but even so theres no reason for it to be disabled...the broken worldwhy is there no option to buy this or why doesn't it come with the game? you can still enable it trough other means but it's just dumb...fps issues as i already said that for no reason on a 2006 game runs like crap my opinion honestly if you can get a physical copy just do it and if not just pirate it... theres no reason to buy a broken version of the game when you can pirate it and have no issues... as for the game itself it'd say it's a musthave for any person that likes dungeon crawlersfun and easy to get into, tho i'm still going to be giving this a negative just because of the steam version ;/ "

												Despite warmest memories from my childhood concerning Dungeon Siege I was surprised how different DS 2 actually is from it's precursor. Although the gameplay concept didn't change much, DS 2 presents itself more complicated and somehow contraintuitive about the controls, if you come from DS 1. I have a hard time getting started because of that and die a lot. On the other hand DS 2 presents some improvements like an arrow telling you where to go, respawning enemies and a portal system to speed up the journey and making revisits of old locations much easier. On the other hand, this assimilation to standards kind of takes away a piece of the uniqueness of the first part. If compared to other rpgs DS 2 sadly doesn't rise above mediocrity. I also have to admit that I found the graphics poorer than those of the first game. I had the impression that at least the first sceneries are grayer and somehow more practical than aesthetic. I especially disliked some of the character faces and their portraits, although they are not as important as what they have to say. Usually I am not into graphics that much and prefer the pure story, but it really stroke my eyes.I don't think that DS 2 is a total waste of time. I'm sure, if you have the time and dedication you could have lots of fun with the game, but I personally do not want to spend so many of my resources on it and I do not recommend the game for most other players, who might be frustrated with it as well.

												Dungeon Siege 2 is one of those games that is a bit too old, and only demonstrates how fast the PC gaming had advanced. I remember playing the original Dungeon Siege (and Legend of Aranna) and rather enjoyed it, even though it involved a lot of pretty endless side-tracking as you go up and down hills and follow paths and attack monsters and whatnot. Turns out this is about the same thing, albeit with a bit more ""heroic"" story... You play this character who was in a bad guy's mercenary unit, hit a few battles, then was captured and released to do a few good things for amends. He picks up companions for different roles such as fighter, archer, combat mage and nature mage (he himself can be any of the four). The game is pretty simple mechanically, and while there is a ton of loot, most of which are pretty forgettable, as Dungeon Siege at its heart, is 3D Diablo. You'll find various items to improve yourself, and you will swap items trying out different ""packages"". The game's graphics are horrible, but that's really no surprise for a game that came out in 2005... It was state of the art THEN, it's horrible now. Character polys are low, fighting's clunky. The fighter mechanics also changed, and not always for the better. Instead of just fight, each character now has a ""super-move"" that you can unlock as you gain skills. A fighter, for example, can do a shield-bash, or perhaps a two-handed sword smash-strike, that does like 10x the normal damage, if you unlock the prerequisite skills. And each skill be further improved in skill levels, with additional skills only unlock when you reach a particular combination of prior skills. This complexity, IMHO, actually made the game worse. Supermove requires recharge, but how it recharges isn't explained very well. The world's big, but it's a single path through, with SOME side areas to explore, but not that much of it. A cave here, a building there. The plot is pretty simple... and cliche. Bad guy is about the conquer the world, and the only guy who can save it doesn't even realize his destiny. Then there's this sudden deus ex machina twist at the end, like WTF? The end result is not nostalgia, but ""Why did I think this was cool?""Play Titan Quest or Diablo 3 instead.			"

												Very good old single player hack-and-slash/magic RPG, but forget multiplayer (would be great though). It's a good adventure and has great character development. The quest has high replayability and the combat is ""Diablo"" like. Overall, I would say DS2 is worth the time.[Makes one wonder why Steam, a big as they are, dosen't pick up the obsolete dead-server sevices. Many of our old games would be revived for multiplayer.]			"

I have spent ages of my life on this game (none of it wasted) and when I saw it on steam I was absoloutely overjoyed. Whilst there is no multiplayer, given that the game is an absoloute gem, it's still great for its value.			"

												I've played a lot of action RPG's over the years, MMO's included. In terms of the action RPG category I honestly have to say Dungeon Siege 2 takes the cake as the best game ever released. The speed of play and game mechanics are perfect, especially for their time. Unlike the Diablo series, Dungeon Siege 2 takes a less of a ""run and gun"" approach to the game. What I mean by this is when your fighting adversaries you actually have to stop and put up a fight. Those who have played Diablo know that if you're playing in a big party you pretty much never stop running while mowing down enemies in the process. I prefer the Dungeon Siege approach because it feels more like a role playing adventure, which is what I am looking for. As for the mechanics, they nailed it. The loot is always great, there are tons of different items, magical, unique etc. There isn't really any one thing about the game that I can honestly pick apart and say ""I really wish they had done that"". Every good aspect of action RPG's is contained in this game and the bad left out. And the storytelling? Second to none.Graphically this game is 10 years old now from me writing this review. That said, in the year 2005 3d graphics were certainly nothing new. If graphics factor heavily into your purchasing of a game, this game will probably never live up. But it still looks pretty good. The environments are very beautiful, and the team who made this game definitely took their time putting work into every little detail.The last thing I will say is when you buy this game.. it comes with glitches. If you have a windows 7/8 computer you have to download some direct x patches (from the microsoft website), setup some commands to enable widescreen, and also I had to do something to get the mouse to appear. If you want to play multiplayer it is disabled, but there is a workaround possible, and you can play with friends from around the world by setting up a virtual server. If you can figure out all these things you can get the game to work as it was originally intended in all it's glory.My rating of this game 9/10 :)			"

												(I've been playing Dungeon Siege since I was a kid, when you needed the game disk to play it, before Steam even existed. I've got no clue how many hours I spent playing that franchise in my lifetime. All this to say: don't trust my Steam hours played - I'm very familiar with the franchise.) With that being said, Dungeon Siege 1 is fairly nostalgic to me, but Dungeon Siege 2 brings more to the game than the previous one did. _______________________________TL;DR: Very good game that surpasses the first one in terms of classes, combat, and story. For those who are unfamiliar with the game, do not let the outdated graphics fool you; this game has a lot to offer and has proven more fun and addicting than most other recent games I've tried. A must-play for all who call themselves PC gamers._______________________________Here it is more detailed: The classes have skills that allow you to specialize in the role you want each character to fill. Rangers are far more potent now, but are comparatively the weakest class still. I have one in my party and have no problem with it nonetheless. Love it and will keep using it, but they could use more DPS. The cities are far more returned to than the first game. Teleporters connect the entire world, promoting revisits as you unlock means to interact with thing you couldn't before. There are clear quests now, and you have a storage safe for your items after the intro stage. Overencumbrance and lack of inventory space is a thing of the past, as you have the access to shops to sell your stuff very early. The story is smoother, better brought and told to the player, and I dare say the game in general is more immersive than the first one. It's a must play for all PC gamers; considering how old the franchise is, you could even call this a classic. And it's also conveniently cheap for the same reason.Once you get used to the simple game mechanics, and what does what, it's very difficult not to enjoy this game. If you enjoyed the Elder Scrolls, Pokemon, and MMORPGs, you'll enjoy the Dungeon Siege franchise. (NOTE: Go into your game options and set the combat back to DS1 for it to be generally easier, until you want to implement kiting into your playstyle later on. With it on DS1, your selected character will keep attacking until whatever you're fighting is dead, instead of having to hold down the attack button for that, or clicking for each individual attack.)

												Dungeon Siege II is definitely worth the cost and is the best of the three. It includes new features that the first did not have. Definitely better than Diablo II.Pros:New Specialties(passives skill tree) and PowersThree subclasses for each of the four classesAmazing dialogue from NPCsImproved graphicsInteresting StorylineMany SidequestsThree difficulties which are unlock for your character/party when you complete it (Like Diablo II) :  Mercenary Veteran(Complete Mercenary to unlock), and Elite(Complete Veteran to unlock)Fun Party Management 4 party slots in Mercenary 5 in Veteran and 6 in EliteI keep coming back to this game cause it is amazing with great replay value.You can have pets instead of companions/friends or both in your party.Summoning creatures which do not take up space in your party.ConsControlling your party can be difficult when you're trying to dodge a projectile or avoid a melee attack on just one specific character (reason why players would rather play solo or a small party. However you can just use rampage and pause to switch characters and move them)Steam version does not have/include DS2 expansion (Broken World)Overall this game is great and i would highly suggest anyone to get this.9/10Add me if you have any questions about DS2			"

												This was my second RPG back when it first released in '05 (My first being DS1). Solid game with interesting storyline and great characters. Even though the graphics have dated a bit, they still hold up fairly well considering. Each class is useful and can be used on its own if you prefer to play solo, or can be accompanied by others with varied classes so you can build a team how you want.Each character also has their own side quest, something you can use to get to know them more and realise how well thought out each of them were. Not the best game in the world, but compared to what we get today, it's a damn sight better than most. This and Dungeon Siege 1 & 1.5 were and still are my fav RPG games to play.

It takes a lot of what you loved about 1 and puts it into 2 while adding more stuff that just adds to the game as a whole.  Really great series. NOT going to talk about 3 as it has no place in this glorious game package.  I can't recommend Dungeon Siege 1 and 2, and each of their expansions (minus 2, haven't tried it yet but judging by the quality of 1 and 2,  I can't say it would be bad).Don't get 3, it seems pretty terrible but hey, if it comes with a package deal, ok then.

												Have always had fun with this game. Played this game when I was a young one. Loved it then, and love it now. Would suggest this game to any one who enjoys a Diablo-esque, party-based RPG. This game is quirky in all the right ways. It has a substandard story coupled with being a pretty short game. On the upside it has an easy to use and fluid-feeling combat system. Character traits, abilities, powers are simple, but intuitive. The game takes you on a very immersive journey and keeps you coming back.I recommend this game.

Unfortunately the game just isn't as challenging as DS1 thanks to features like two-way teleport to safety.  There are also weird game balance issues will mean that you can spend 2 hours on a large side-quest only to get an apparently ""unique"" piece of equipment that a random monster dropped earlier in the game.

												Amazing game. Reminded me alot of Baldur's Gate when I first played it back in the day, with a splash of diablo. However, while the loot system is very satisfying, and the out-of combat secrets and goodies are worthwhile, the skill trees, spells, and skills in general are a little too simple for my liking, and some are completley useless while some are incredibly overpowered. The end result is too little replay value for the kind of game it is. They do let you pick your race, and you aren't locked into a class, but if you don't specialize in one of the four skill types, (Melee, Ranged, Nature, uhhh... well the fourth one is damage magic. Can't remember the name.) you will end up very underpowered as they punish you severely for trying to multiclass in this game, One very cool fact is while at the middle-to end of the game most party members are leveled up so much there really is only one way you can build them, the few you get at the beginning you can basically mold into anything you want, to work with whatever role your character fills. I won't give away all the features of this gem, but with a tiered playthrough system similar to diablo, you can carry your experience, loot, and party members (unlocking additional party slots when you reach the harder tiers) through another playthrough, making up for the ""why bother"" rolling a new character. Pick this up if you like Diablo-esque type games, it's a fun one.			"

												This game is not your average RPG. This game is one of the best RPGs I have every played. It is about a 50 to 60 hour game. It may seem like a long game but it is worth it. I would Recommend this to more hardcore gamers than casual. I play video games alot and would consider my self a Hardcore gamer. But this game still challenges me to wear the game is not really easy but not to hard.			"

												So far this is one of the best RPG I've ever played. First played back in 2006 or so, and decided to buy on Steam now, just to refresh memories. Already spent dozens of hours (playing a patched steam version, see the links and explanation in game community, that's why in my profile you might see a low hours in-game) - and more to come.Ideally you need to play on per quest basis, otherwise you may forget details and such.Highly recommend this game, well worth its money (and even more).

												Very different from DS1. In Dungeon Siege 2 (as in Diablo 2. Hmm...) there are character classes, and linear levelling. Humbug.Good story, good controls, fun characters. I seem to recall not worrying terribly about my equipment, but it's been a while. I remember the game being very easy to play, and the levelling system being largely responsible. I also remember the bosses being terribly easy once you figure out each one's trick.Not a bad game, but not really anyithing special either.B-			"

This game is quirky in all the right ways. It has a substandard story coupled with being a pretty short game. On the upside it has an easy to use and fluid-feeling combat system. Character traits, abilities, powers are simple, but intuitive. The game takes you on a very immersive journey and keeps you coming back.I recommend this game.

												Definitely worth a shot. 8/10This game is a classic ARPG that differs from a lot of third-person or One-Man ARPG, where you can control up to 6 characters in your party. This feature keeps the game interesting throughout as you spec up your main starter character and have the ability to improve your other party members and try out their skill sets. The voice acting is pretty decent, and the storyline is interesting. There's a heap of side quests to do as well, and some are pretty challenging and have puzzles that you have to solve to move forward in the main quest or open a chest to find epic loot.My only concern was toward the end-game it gets a bit grindy to reach the final boss, and replayability is good but would be better with friends as you play through game again on a harder difficulty (similar to Diablo II's difficulty levels). Boss fights are at first challenging but once you get the jist of their mechanics they are pretty easy. With the resolution configure making it 1920x1080 with v-sync, the game looks pretty decent for it's age (2005 I believe).Overall it's a classic Action RPG with interesting combat system, able to control up to 6 party members and fairly decent choices to focus your character on i.e. a Mage can focus on Fire, Lightning or Death Magic, or Summoning Skills.

												Dungeon Siege 2 picks off where the previous one left off, but greatly improves on a nubmer of mechanics.  It is a longer, but still very enjoyable game, with some quality of life changes to streamline the story and gameplay.  Overall I enjoyed it, and would recommend to gamers who enjoy old-school top-down RPGs.  It's very enjoyable in that regard.  The story was also improved, in my opinion. Personal ConsClick system change:  The changes to the original click system felt weird to me, making it feel more like Diablo, but I eventually accepted it and enjoyed it. Talent System:  The talent system was an interesting addition, and gave more depth, but it was rough because you couldn't ever change them.  Without playing you weren't sure what would be benefical later, which led to some talent points being wasted.Party size reduced to 4.  Part of what made the original Dungeon Siege fun was the party size, but I understand why they wanted to make the change, especially for balance reasons.  Some of the itemization was strange to me Boss Fights: Some of the boss fights, especially the last one, felt so clunky and obnoxious, which shows the games age.ProsLong, and decent story, was fun to explore.  It was a little annoying that it did not connect with DS1, but was very great. Great exploration feeling, lots of fun areas.  Some of the backtracking was annoying, but overall it was great.  Buy it if it's on sale, and you wanna kill 30-40 hours on an RPG.			"

												Still fun, 10 years after my first playthrough... Surprisingly modern feeling for a 10 year old game. Can be played casually, but allows for more advanced things like kiting, orb walking, animation cancelling. Items are complex enough to add depth and a good level of ""spreadsheeting"" (crunching numbers to identify the best gear combo's etc...), and the skill systems are pleasant and rewarding. Some classes do out-shine others (archer seems to be the strongest in Vanilla by far) but due to the game not being too difficult, you are not forced to play with the strongest - just play with whatever you want.Overall , still a great game even now. Would be nice to see a modern version - There are other dungeon crawlers out there at the moment (Diablo 3 is great) but not quite play like DSII. But for the price, I would not hesitate to recommend this.			"

												I've played a lot of action RPG's over the years, MMO's included. In terms of the action RPG category I honestly have to say Dungeon Siege 2 takes the cake as the best game ever released. The speed of play and game mechanics are perfect, especially for their time. Unlike the Diablo series, Dungeon Siege 2 takes a less of a ""run and gun"" approach to the game. What I mean by this is when your fighting adversaries you actually have to stop and put up a fight. Those who have played Diablo know that if you're playing in a big party you pretty much never stop running while mowing down enemies in the process. I prefer the Dungeon Siege approach because it feels more like a role playing adventure, which is what I am looking for. As for the mechanics, they nailed it. The loot is always great, there are tons of different items, magical, unique etc. There isn't really any one thing about the game that I can honestly pick apart and say ""I really wish they had done that"". Every good aspect of action RPG's is contained in this game and the bad left out. And the storytelling? Second to none.Graphically this game is 10 years old now from me writing this review. That said, in the year 2005 3d graphics were certainly nothing new. If graphics factor heavily into your purchasing of a game, this game will probably never live up. But it still looks pretty good. The environments are very beautiful, and the team who made this game definitely took their time putting work into every little detail.The last thing I will say is when you buy this game.. it comes with glitches. If you have a windows 7/8 computer you have to download some direct x patches (from the microsoft website), setup some commands to enable widescreen, and also I had to do something to get the mouse to appear. If you want to play multiplayer it is disabled, but there is a workaround possible, and you can play with friends from around the world by setting up a virtual server. If you can figure out all these things you can get the game to work as it was originally intended in all it's glory.My rating of this game 9/10 :)			"

												Very good game.  Graphics, story and music are improved from DS1, and the Baldur's Gate influence shines throughout.  Unfortunately the game just isn't as challenging as DS1 thanks to features like two-way teleport to safety.  There are also weird game balance issues will mean that you can spend 2 hours on a large side-quest only to get an apparently ""unique"" piece of equipment that a random monster dropped earlier in the game.
