												I don’t like real time strategy or tower defense games, you can’t out click a computer and they usually cheat.  So it’s seem odd that I would even buy this game, let alone log 196 hours (wait, how many? I’m not even done with the Play+.)  What made the game appeal to me was the RPG element.  I like RPGs, it’s reassuring to know you can grind and level up to make up for your lack of skill and intelligence.The game offers 25 stages plus bonus levels that are all replayable (didn’t realize that’s not a real word) at not just different difficulties but also with a different mix of enemies.  There are only six characters (towers) but each has 10 or so skills which adds to the variety.  There are 19 enemies including repallets (figured that wasn’t a real word) and five bosses.The best part is the characters.  The dialogue and interaction is engrossing often hilarious.  The replay mode unlocks Azra’s diary with extra (also hilarious) insight to her background and the other characters (SPOILER ALERT!! Slak knows how to read and write.)  In conclusion (that never gets old,) Defender’s Quest: title too long is a great mix of tower defense and RPG.  Most importantly, it’s fun.  If you had to pay all 15 bucks for this game, it’s worth it.  If it should happen to be on sale around Thanksgiving or Christmas (or whatever other holiday you celebrate on your fast track to hell) you’d be a fool not to buy it (unless you’ve got something better to do with 196 hours, like work.)

												You start it up and notice the game doesn't rescale to your desktop native res and you feel like just passing it by but with all those great user reviews I stuck for a while... and the game itself is rock solid. Fun RPG/Tower mechanics with a lot of variation and the reward for succesful experimentation is goodies that enable to tackle even harder challenges. The story/characters in the game are fine and entretaining as well but it's the gameplay that will keep you enthused and enthralled and maybe even captivated till you fully master it. Even if you just beat it all on normal mode it's well worth its asking price. Pick it up and enjoy, easy to recommend even for non genre fans.			"

												This poor game has been languishing in my library for ages without getting any attention from me beyond the intro, only to finally be given a proper playing yesterday evening. It's now 7 in the morning, and I've only just now turned it off because it is just that good. Honestly, when I first got it I had a set of other ""big budget AAA"" style games that I decided to play instead because they were basically ""shinier"" and supposedly great, but so far I'm having a lot more fun with this game now than those games then. I wasn't expecting much from a tower defense style game, but it actually has a story, humor, some challenging gameplay, and rpg elements (all the things I thought I would have found in those other titles). In short, I should have thrown out my preconceptions initially and just played this game, I'd have had a lot more fun from the jump instead of just now months (maybe year?) later.			"

												7.5/10If you ever need proof that Flash Games can be worth paying for, take a look at this.With so many TD games out there, it's hard to choose a good one. This is a good way to ease into the genre, with solid mechanics and just a sprinkling of plot and simple yet engaging characters. Mix in a little touch of RPG elements for upgrades and skill trees for your human ""Towers"" and here you are. There are many routes to victory, and challenging achievements to encourage you to try replaying with a different strategy. You get what you pay for and because it's built in flash it runs on ANYTHING! Worth a pop at the price, even more so in a sale.			"

												This is a surprisingly good little tower defense game with RPG mechanics. As a commander, you can recruit troops, equip them with weapons and armor and control their few skills when leveling up. It is pretty basic, yet very deep. The levels are single screen and grid based. You place your characters down and they automatically attack as enemies approach them. There are 6 classes, a basic melee, long range, healer, ice mage, slow defensive breaker and all powerful dragon with short and long range attacks. It costs PSI to place your characters, and more PSI to retract them (to move them).How do you get PSI? Well you start with it, but then as you kill enemies, you gain more PSI and you have a maximum of course. You are defending a summoner against the waves of enemies and the summoner (your player character) can take a beating and has plenty of HP, so the game is forgiving, but rewarding if you make it through the level without being damaged.You can 'boost' your characters at the cost of PSI. There are many levels of boos that enable skills that you've unlocked through leveling up your characters. When you level up your characters, you select their perk. Which has a simple perk tree of skills and passive abilities. It is a nice little system, but I find myself making the same perk choices instead of diversifying.Oh and death is not perminant for your characters. If someone dies, just use PSI to bring them back. If your player character dies, you lose the level and need to restart. These levels are quick, especially at 4x speed, so nothing is really lost.While the game boasts a rich story.... I found myself hitting the skip button. I just don't play games for the story. You read the story as you unlock new levels and progress through a Mario World style map with all of the levels plotted as map points.The game is very easy to pick up and play, but not just that, it encourages replaying the levels with 3 different difficulties (and a 'casual' difficulty as a 4th). If there's an insurmountable level.... replay old levels *cough* grind. But replaying old levels never seems like a chore, its more of a joy. Even if you keep replaying the same level on the same difficulty, every playthrough is different, since your characters level up and you can change your tactics.The game is a lot of fun, and while its deep, its never overwhelmingly deep. There's not an overwhelming micro management either, even if you can micro manage everything.I highly recommend it. Its a fun little game, relaxing and never gets all that intense. I found myself playing it on 4x speed and that seems like it should be the average speed. Is it worth the $15? Its a game you can sink hours and hours into, so you'll get a lot of relaxing playtime for your dollar.			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Defender Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is a 2D game with a unique blend of TD and RPG from Level Up Labs. It features characters / companions who act as 'towers' and need to be strategically placed around the map to defend your main character Azra. Unlike a tower defense game, however, you can level up and equip items for your companions to help them improve in combat.You take the role of Azra, a royal librarian of the Kingdom of Ash which is currently being ravaged by a plague. Azra gets infected and thrown into 'The Pit', a place where all dead or dying are placed to keep the kingdom safe because those who die from the Plague become 'Revenants', undead monsters that are immune to physical harm. Azra soon discovers that she has the power to enter both the living world and the 'Half-Way' world, a place between the living realm & the realm of the dead. In this realm, she can summon her companions to fight the Revenants in their spirit form and eventually kill them.PROS:+ Refreshing new mix of genres+ 8-bit sprite art style that works well with the game+ Character / Companion progression is deep and extensive+ Well designed Maps and Mazes+ Very challenging difficulty levels+ 6 base classes (towers) which can progress into different builds depending on your play-style+ Dialogues between characters are humorous+ Steam Workshop supportCONS:- Cutscene art work could use a lot of improvement (especially the character designs)- Story is a bit weak- Balance issues (some classes are outright better than others)- Some necessary but boring grinding sessions to progress- No real 'HD' or Widescreen Support- No Steam Cloud SupportCONCLUSION:It is a GOOD GAME and one of the better tower defense games out there. I can easily recommend this game if you're looking for a challenging and unique game since it mixes RPG elements to the tried-and-tested Tower Defense genre. The 8-bit sprites, animations and effects are nice and work well with the game's art style although the Cutscene artwork could really use improvements. The levels are very well planned and are fun to play. Finally, the in-game dialogue between your companions is funny and quite entertaining.I can easily RECOMMEND this game even at full price since it’s only $14.99 or your regional equivalent. With simple graphics, this game is not system requirement heavy and can easily run even on netbook computers making this a perfect game when you're on vacation, working, passing the time, or in any other situation where you are not with your main gaming system.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												One of the best TDs that I have played. There is a very nice background history in the game, very nice (and challenger) lvls, achievements, rewards and, well, everything I want to see in a TD. There's a lvl system for each unit, making it unique, where you can equip with some unique items. Awesome, worth every penny.			"

												To start off, I just wanted to state that I am NOT a fan of tower defense type games. I find them repetitive, grindy, bland, and not innovative.BUT, Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is a true gem in the tower defense genre. It combines the elements of a tower defense game along with rpg elements, which gives the game a surprisingly fun twist. Instead of just placing troops that do not have meaning around, I was able to level up my characters and as I progressed I learned their stories.Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is not only a tower defense game, it has a story, unlike many games of the same genre. The story was nothing special, but there was a story nonetheless.If you're an achievement hunter (♥♥♥♥♥) like I am, then you'll be disappointed because a few of the achievements are a bit grindy. On the other hand, the developers were nice enough to allow you to go into the Options and increase exp and gold gain by 300%. I cannot stress enough how this option is amazing and that I think more devs should implement it, because of how grindy some achievements are. This also makes the game a little bit more on the easier side. I hardly ever lost a round. I can count on both hands how many times I've lost. The game is very simple, I was able to beat the base game without generic recruits. I did recruit the generic characters in order to obtain all the gold stars/side quests. The UI is also very simple. Skill trees are simple. Everything about this game is very simple, easy to learn, and relaxing.If you're looking for a casual game, then I'd definitely recommend this game. A lot of times, I find myself on this game when I am watching tv or a movie.Overall, I'd definitely recommend Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten. It's a true gem of it's genre and should not be dismissed so easily, just because it's a casual tower defense game.			"

												At first glance, Defender's Quest appears to be a silly little indie game with big dreams. The characters are bright and cartoony, and their dialogue is marked with sass. Their battle sprites display whimsical touches, like the ranger who spins her bow before firing. One of the promotional spellbooks Azra can equip, the Book of Face, introduces the Internet's beloved Trollface to the otherwise sword-and-sorcery setting. Focusing on the one-liners would be simple, as they are good. However, the core plot has heft: it would make a good Dungeons and Dragons campaign or fantasy adventure novel. Royal librarian Azra must survive in a quarantine pit the size of a small nation, while she's pursued by mysterious figures. It features conspiracy, betrayal, and explosions. Careful gamers shouldn't be surprised a USDA-certified English major wrote the script. The wacky comedy and childish in-fighting among Azra's companions allows the team to quickly bond. These light-hearted intra-party friendships and feuds add personal stakes to the more pervasive dangers of the pit. The story is delivered in slideshow style before every town and battle, tying the narrative neatly to combat.Combat is handled like a tower defense game. Enemies travel in waves from spawn points. As they walk into the attack range of stationary heroes, they suffer the effects of the heroes' attacks. The heroes are unable to move from where they're summoned, as they're doing combat on a spiritual plane where bodies just get in the way. The cornerstone of battle strategy comes from placing the six types of heroes in the appropriate location. After recruiting story characters (such as Slak, the madcap, murderous berserker), faceless extras of the same type become hirable. If that's all there was to combat, it would be a delightful diversion. However, each character gains experience points, which can be spent to learn new combat skills or boost existing ones. Once learned, most of these skills can't be used immediately. Characters must be boosted in battle, which draws from the same Psi pool Astra uses to summon allies and cast spells of her own. It can be a challenging balancing act to position the proper allies, keep them boosted, reposition troops to respond to new threats, and maintain wide scale battlefield control with Azra's spells. Thankfully, slowing the game's speed (and pausing it altogether) are simple options. The keyboard commands are simple to learn and encourage faster play, but nothing's wrong with the mouse either.With all the moving parts that go into battle, the multiple levels of accessibility are a nice touch. Each character has nine different attack modes including ""attack the strongest enemy"" and ""attack the enemy with least immunity to status effects."" Understanding the interplay between these attack modes isn't necessary for most of the core game, but integral to completing the optional levels. Furthermore, failure isn't necessarily punished. The default settings infer experience and money penalties for losing battles, but these can be changed based on individual preference. Redistributing skill points to explore different character builds costs money, but not a fortune. The steepest cost is the time it takes to click through all the advancements. The largest concession to the casual-vs.-hardcore debate is the option to increase experience points. Players who care more for the story and the thrill of rapid advancement can run with it. Players who want their hardcore bragging rights can lift their noses at the low-hanging fruit. True challenge-jockeys can set their sights on the more exclusive achievements, many of which are challenging even with gushing wells of experience points.Defender's Quest is a short game, but provides plenty of options to extend the experience. Completing every level at the highest difficulty takes about twenty hours; increasing the experience and money levels in the options decreases the playtime. However, the New Game+ mode, which becomes available after completing the base game, adds considerable challenge. The core story stays the same, but combat's modified with new enemy powers, new maps, and new bonus stages. The New Game+ also provides a delicious means of upgrading the magic items earned in the core game, unlocking unique modifiers for each relic. As enjoyable as these new features are, Azra's journal is the best addition to the New Game+. After every major battle, Azra updates her journal with commentary on the story. In the process, she details her internal struggles and fleshes out the world. The extra character moments in Azra's journal are enjoyable enough that their inclusion as bonus material seems strange. They'd serve the story better as part of its body rather than as bonus material.In spite of all this praise, Defender's Quest isn't perfect. Despite the snap and crackle of the script, it features several glaring spelling and punctuation errors--especially in Azra's journal. Purchasing equipment isn't as interesting as other elements of character customization, but the numerical benefits encourage frequently clicking through upgrades. The music is initially encouraging, but loops quickly. Thankfully, it can be toggled independently of the sound effects, which provide texture and valuable combat cues. The final battle song is a notable exception. That beast should be blasted loud and proud.Between its addictive gameplay and sliding difficulty scale, Defender's Quest offers gamers a great deal for such a small investment of time. It probably won't make a true believer out of anyone whose parents were killed by tower defense games, but it's good at what it does: drawing people in and refusing to let them go until they've finished ""just one more level.""

												Now that we have real reviews I wanted to give this game a better response.As a long time tower defense player, I have to say this game is in the top 3 of all time. I'll try to explain why I love it so much, and why I'm so excited for the sequel that was recently announced.MechanicsThis game provides somewhat traditional mechanics if you're familiar with TD games. Players can build units on the perimeter of the path only, so there is no blocking/routing mechanics to worry about. Unit's have different attack types that are better and worse for some situationsWhat is unique about this game is that units level up in a persistent manner between levels, allowing your units to grow over time, This included an entire skill tree for each class of units that can be customized to your play style. Additionally, units have a weapon and armor equipment slot and the game does a good job of making this meaningful by introducing rare equipment a bit later in the game.Levels are replayable so you can grind your team a bit if you feel a little weak or would like to beef up a bit before a boss level. To compliment this aspect of the game, each level can be played on different difficulty levels, which provide bigger rewards at the cost of a higher difficulty. This aspect of the game kept me going back and trying to beat my records and old levels in order to get some of the better rare gear.Lastly, the game features a fast forward mode which is a welcome sight for those who play a lot of tower defense games. It really helps grinding out those later levels.StoryIt's rare for a TD game to have an in-depth story, but Defender's Quest does a great job with this. It's not ground breaking, but it certainly sets a nice tone and even introduces a bit of moral dilemma that plays into the unit mechanics later in the game. I won't spoil it, but I will say that the level of narrative impressed me, and kept me engaged until the end.Graphics/SoundsAll standard stuff here. You can look at the screenshots and get an idea of what you're into. In general I'd say that the graphics do a good job of matching the needs of the gameplay, and the animations are smooth and crisp even during hectic late game levels. The graphics change into a pleasant style during story segments and do a good job of relaying the emotion and facial expressions of the characters.SummaryAll in all, this game really scratched a Tower Defense/RPG itch that I'd been craving for a long time. If you can pick the game up on sale and like TD games I'd recommend buying it without hesitation.			"

												The crack cocaine of Tower defense/RPG. Excellent writting (especially when you get to new game+ and unlock side missions and the Journal), funny and memorable characters and addicting gameplay that can make hours mysteriously disseapear; while the main quest is resonable in length, a completionist run will probably take you 60+ hours.

												Defender's Quest is the best Tower Defense game ever made.  It combines a well-done story with solid RPG mechanics and crisp short tower defense scenarios.  If you are on the fence about TD games this is the best way to ease yourself into the genre.  In fact, this might be the only TD game you'll ever enjoy - and that's totally ok.  It's as good as this genre gets.			"

												I've played a lot of tower defense. I used to play Warcraft III custom maps where the tower defense genre was cut from. Defender's Quest does a nice job of putting a well developed story with well developed characters into tower defense gameplay without it feeling pasted on. It keeps it simple. There are only a few basic towers to choose from, but each tower acts like a character in your party and you can equip most of them with weapons and armor (no weapons or armor for a dragon and no armor for the barbarian/main melee guy). The maps are laid out well enough that consideration to where to place your troops does make a big difference.There is also a nice take on the gameplay by offering 4 difficulty levels. You get rewards for completing the level, but you get bonus rewards for not taking a single point of damage. If you do that, you can get a lot of extra scrap (money) and unique items.What I'm doing on my second playthrough is going as far as I possibly can while only buying recruits and never any items on the easiest mode. When I hit my first failure, I go back to the very start and try to complete each level on the hardest mode possible. After I fail once, I will go down to an easier mode and so on until I am right back at the easiest mode and therefore, the furthest out I've ever been.The main game is not that long and there isn't a ton of replayability to this game once you complete it. That is why it is only worth a few bucks...but it's worth a few bucks. I hear they are making a Defender's Quest II and I hope that is at least as good. Even when it is, this is still a pretty fun tower defense and something that feels more refreshing than you might think when you come back to it after a long time.			"

												When I bought the game I thought ""well, there's just another TD game"". But, it turns out that it's not your average build and kill game. For the first 4 hours I've been trying to finish up the story of the game. The story took me in and I just wanted to know how it all ends. If you are thinking about buying this game read on to see why you probably should. After playing 12 hours of the game I have finished the main story and went on to do some harder difficulties and other challenges. This game is fun in it's own unique way. Not only do you get an interesting story to follow, but also get stuck in character menu thinking how you should level up the skills for each fighter. The only hotkey you will probably need to remember is ""space bar"" for pause. That is the only thing you will constantly hit to allow yourself some time to think before everything goes to hell. The game can be challenging even on the normal level. ( The level difficulties go as follows: Casual – Normal – Advanced – Extreme). After your done with Normal, you can move on to a New Game+, which is way harder and more challenging. And yes, this is an RPG game. You will probably spend more time looking at the level up menu for characters rather than fighting monsters. It's not bad at all, but be prepared to think and compare different builds for the same class of fighter. There are 7 types of characters – Berserker, Ranger, Healer, Ice mage, Knight, Dragon and Librarian ( who is the thing that you actually need to protect).The simple graphics was also done in a pretty good way. All characters are different and you can easily tell the difference. Everything looks the way it should in this kind of game. The only thing I noticed is that when the Ice mage casts his spells it can be quite hard to see the enemy and how much health they still have. On a positive note, the graphics look smooth overall and you won't feel like your playing the game from the 80's at the same time. To add to this I can also point out that the soundtrack is very good. It fits the theme of the game very nice and allows you to feel emotions from the battle field and from dialogues. I am yet not sure how many hours you can play until you finish everything, but I would guess it's quite a bit. I think this game will keep you from sleeping for at least a few hours after you should have gone to bed. I honestly think that this game is a must have product for not just RPG and TD lovers but also for average gamers. If you have missed the sale don't worry, you won't regret buying a game for a full price.  "

												EDIT UPDATE!!! THIS GAME WAS ALREADY AWESOME BUT MR.LABS COMMENTARY ABOUT HOW DELUXIFIED IT IS HAS MADDDDDEEEE MY DAY. cAPS ftw.<3 Also still a great hilarious game.To be honest, when I saw this game I only  picked it up cause it was cheap, but damn if i were to talk about a game that game me the most value for my dollars, well it would have to be this one. If you're a fan of playing games through again, with like a second more difficult mode, that gives more insight into the story, well then this one is definitely for you.If you're a person who likes turned based rpgs, there is alot of the elements of being able to take your time and strategize, while all the same, you can just charge through really quick once you know your strengths, and how to use them most effectively.And lastly, If you love a good laugh that was written and delivered amazingly, you should totally name all the main characters after your friends and loved ones. It makes for a good laugh, and you think of your friends, slightly helping the social aspect of the brain, while completely being absorbed into this great single player game, that will make you think your not alone in playing it for so many hours...and if you're not really alone inside your head, well that makes the adventure even more interesting!

												What can I say?  Watch the videos above.  Look at the user reviews.  People LOVE this game.  The Devs, LOVE the people who love this game.  They gave us a FREE HD remaster.  They even give you a Demo to try before you buy.  What can I POSSIBLY say about this game that hasn't been said already in all of that?  It is one of MY favorite TD games, if not the best TD game out there.  It's simple, not too flashy, not too frustrating, humorous and has RPG elements.  These Towers aren't just thoughtless machines driven to kill because you ordered them to...  No, that one there?  That's Slak the shirtless Berserker with the deranged mind and the awesome sword ripping up those ghouls on the tip of that island, right in the middle of the carnage where he can do the most damage.  GO SLAK KILL, KILL, KILL!  BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!  Yeah, these guys are my peeps, my group, MY ARMY.  They ARE SO MUCH MORE than towers.  So what can I say?  PLAY.  THE.  GAME.   ~'nuff said.  >:)			"

												Unreal that this has slipped through my radar for almost 3 years. A tower defense game where your towers are people that you actually care about, not just fire tower #23. The mixture of RPG elements just puts it over the top. Extremely worth the money and I'm only 2 hours in!P.S. The writing is pretty damn funny at times.			"

												A mix of RPG and Tower Defense. This was my first game on steam, and I bought this because it was on sale and very very very cheap. So I dip my finger on the steam pond because of this game, and now I am drowned in a sea of games. Buying a very cheap game, I don't have any high expectation about this, but instead I got a very good game, a quite funny story, and for me personally because it combined two of my fave genre. If it happen to be on sale with a very very cheap price, then buy it...			"

												Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is one of the best tower defense games I've ever played.It's simply like that, easy to learn and hard to master. The normal gamemode is soo easy even if you only play with the main characters (for the achievement). But after you completed the normal gamemode, you get the harder mode, where you play the story again, but with additional missions for specific characters. There it's going to be impossible to beat the game without using your brain.Totally worth its money! Gogo buy it, you'll have many good hours ;)			"

												Well, reviewing a title that is available for 2 years now seems useless, yet i'll do it anyway :-)Judging by the graphics i wonder why i even bought it. Maybe because i like Tower-Defense-Games.But i was suprised with this cute little quillet.What exactly is it?It's a TD-Game without towers. But with people. Typical RPG-People like berzerkers, mages, healers and rangers and...And you'll keep your ""Towers"" throughout the game and they'll receive XP and level-up. You can even color them and give them names.You move through a story with cutscenes, but mainly you'll fight waves of enemies with your party.The good: Borderless fullscreen AKA non-exclusive Fullscreen. Yay. Scaled to your resolution OR changed resolution. Nifty! Don't like the speed of advancement? Change XP/monetary reward to 300%! Or 50%. Leveling and outfitting your ""towers"" is a nice approach. You'll have veterans and noobs to place on each map. Speed adjustment from 0x (pause) to 4x. Nice. Pausable at all times. No pressure there. You can adjust your partymembers fighting tactics and even make them persistant (attack which target first, use high power abilities on lower foes etc.) Beside your party you'll have your main hero that has misc. spells at her disposal. TD-like you can play each map in different difficulties with proportional rewards. It pays to replay an older mission on EXPERT! The way they make you ""like"" their facebook/twitter-page was really cute. I almost felt bad NOT to click :-) Workshop! For those extra hours to waste It has a real story with cute cutscenes. I admit to have skipped much of it, but for some it may add immersion.The bad: For some, it may possibly lack depth of strategy/difficulty. It looks more like a ""casual"" tower-defense. Ok, to be nit-picky: The skills you're able to choose are too few. No big descisions to make, you're getting themall more or less anyway.TL;DR:Bought ""Defenders of time"" at the same time and it seemed much more promising. Oh boy was i wrong.Kicked ""DoT"" off of my HD after 2 minutes and played this one for hours. Graphics is not everything.This is a fun and refreshing towerdefense-game where you keep your ""towers"" and level them up. Also you'lltry to outfit them with better weapons and armor. I surely had my fun. Would be even worth fullprice!			"

												I have played a lot of tower defense games.  Overall I would recommend this game and would rank it in a top 10 tower defense games category.Pros:-Extensive gameplay-Smart balance and upgrades-Good amount of levels-Good and unique character balance-Demo gives you a good taste of what to expectCons:-Level upgrade limits to 9 (desired one or two more)-Limit of character upgrades of 60-Due to the two above, there are a last 2 or 3 levels that were not possible to complete.Desired (or recommended to the Defender's Quest team):-The map is a cool concept but felt there could have been a couple of paths in the desert with some unique desert concept or monster-Custom level designer			"

												Like many others have said, let me start this by saying I don't like tower defense games. At all. Those have never held my interest for too long. Despite this, I bought this game after Rock Paper Shotgun showcased it many, many years ago.If I had to choose my favorite indie game, it would be Defender's Quest for sure. Nothing else comes even close. The developers have done a great job at supporting the game throughout the years, first by releasing a Gold version (that is the current Steam version) as well as planning to release the HD version of the game that comes for free for all owners of the game on Steam. Defender's Quest 2 is also in the works as of writing of this review.If you like tower defenses, get this game. If you like witty dialogue, get this game. This game shows what an indie game can be when it's done right. I can't really find any real flaws out of it.			"

												A mix of tower defense, strategy, and RPG genres combine to make what is Defender’s Quest. The game revolves around a linear campaign to save the world from the forces of, um, evil. My only strike against this game is that the RPG element feels rather tacky; for awhile you actually care about the skill points you assign to your party but once you have a solid dozen or more of characters you pretty much don't care anymore and just assign skill points in a sometimes arbitrary manner. That said, Defender's Quest is a good game that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys thought provoking tower defense games.			"

												It's like Final Fantasy finally meets Tower Defense!Defender’s Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is yet another tower defense game on the list. But surprisingly, this one comes together with a little twist attached to it. It’s an RPG Tower Defense Game! Yeah, you've heard it right. Someone actually combined both of those genres. Initially it may sound like an unlikely combination, but like salt and caramel, they've really complemented each other in surprising ways.This game is a 2D game with a unique blend of Tower Defense and RPG created by Level Up Labs. Rather than having ""towers"", you have party members that you need to strategically place them around the map, of which purpose is to defend your main character Azra. Unlike a simple tower defense game, however, you can level up and equip items for your companions to help them improve in combat. A very nice combination indeed!You take the role of Azra, a royal librarian of the Kingdom of Ash which is currently being ravaged by a unknown plague. Azra gets infected and thrown into 'The Pit', a place where all dead or dying are kept to maintain the kingdom safe from plague. Those who die from the plague become 'Revenants', undead monsters that are immune to physical harm. But Azra soon discovers that she has the power to enter both the living world and the 'Half-Way' world, a place between the living realm and the realm of the dead. In this realm, she can summon her companions to fight the Revenants in their spirit form and eventually beat the crap out of them.There are around 30 levels to survive, but you'll lose more time than you think while playing them. You can actually go back and try to beat levels on harder difficulties. (The range starts from Casual, continues with Normal and Advanced but doesn't forget to include the Extreme difficulty.) Doing so, throws a tougher, more varied group of enemies at you that offers greater XP and loot to help you in your journey.During battle you can change the attitude of your party members. You can tell them to favor boss monsters, to attack only the weak enemies, to use the more powerful skills on stronger enemies and so on. In addition, your companions have boost levels that you need to increase in order to give them access to their strongest skills. However, doing that you spend precious energy, called Psi in the game, every time you boost their abilities, which will sometimes force you to make tough decisions.You're also given a tremendous amount of control when it comes to the game's speed. You can pause everything, while still being able to place units and upgrade them, or pump the speed all the way up to 4x if you're the impatient type of gamer. Defender's Quest is very respectful of the player in every number of aspects. Controls and hotkeys are configurable, cutscenes and conversations can be skipped and rewatched later if you choose so, and I'll tell you a secret. The rate at which experience is earned can also be increased from the options. The developers put a lot of love in their game as you can see. That being said, you can get to the end on normal difficulty in five hours or less. But personally, I've spent more than 14 hours going back and forward to complete perfect runs on every stage. There's plenty of optional content that will make up for your hard earned money.Other than fighting through the story, at a certain point you will gain access to a list of challenge bonus battles (including two endless battles). These will offer you yet more experience as well as precious unique books to augment your main character fighting skills. Bonus battles will automatically be unlocked once you earn enough blue and yellow stars from fighting in normal battles.Once you complete the normal game, you will unlock the New Game+. Which is the story written all over again, but at a much harder level, with even better rewards and the ability to upgrade all those unique items you've found during the normal game. The New Game+ will also have it's own bonus battle list.Pros- The Deluxe version of the game just got released! And has features such as: From improved graphics to expanded new story content, better performance and more of everything you've loved about the original version!- The in-game dialogue between your companions is funny and quite entertaining.- Friendly developers that are willingly to fix any bugs you're reporting them. They are hard working to create the best experience for their game even after four years of the release!- Support for Achievements, Trading Cards, Steam Workshop and Steam Cloud.- Now available in 60 FPS.- Behind the scenes journal detailing the game's development.- RPG elements and clever options keep replayability high.- Lots of levels and difficulty settings.- New Game+ included.- Awesome plot driven gameplay to keep you entertained the entire game.- Multiple endings to keep you coming for more.Cons- Not many actually, I love it exactly how it is now. The Deluxe version improved every aspect of the game, fixing everything that was wrong or poor made.- Steam Workshop disables achievements.- No voice acting included in the Deluxe version.- Defender's Quest 2 isn't out yet, give it to meeeeee already!ConclusionI just can't say how good this game is. It's the definition of perfection. Defender’s Quest let's you change from a casual to an insanely difficult game without having to load a different savegame. From a slow moving battle, to a fast moving one. You can grind endlessly for experience or take your battles to the doorstep of impossibility. This is a game for all the types of gamers. And also a great way of introducing someone into the Tower Defense genre. You choose exactly how you want to play it. This game deservers to be the indie Game of The Year and in my heart it will always be the best tower defense ever made! I highly recommend it even at full price for reasons such as: They've created an upgrade for the actual game even after a few years of the game's actual release, keeping it FREE for the owners of the original game!This review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to both Steamified and Level Up Labs, LLC for providing the key for review purposes.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

You progress nicely through the levels to become a badass party. Kinda interesting story, good sound and soundtrack and easy to hop into. Graphics are retro and are nicely done.

												Defender's QUest is a tower defense game that has a heart. The video trailer is pithy, suggesting that the game and its creators don't take themselves seriously, but don't be fooled. The story is simple but effective, not avoiding the cliches but embracing them and making them its own, but not with the wink and nod of the lampooner, but of a storyteller with an earnest wish to convey to you the world they've imagined. I found myself playing this game long after the challenge had worn away, drawn not so much by the game that had grown to be child's play after intense leveling, but rather by that very soul the creators instilled in it. I found myself surprised by this, and was sad to find it 100% completed and with nothing more to offer. I will pick you up again in time, my friend, for the happiness you offered was not forgotten.

												Surprisingly entertaining. Simple play style, very typical tower defender. The little cutscenes were well written and fun. If you are the type (like me) to enjoy tower defense and other point-and-clicky type games, you'll probably like this. Hell, I definitely got my three dollars worth of entertainment out of this (hail steam sales). The horde-type bonus challenges are neat, and I like the little option to customize palettes for your troops. Makes it easier to tell at a glance who is who, which actually matters since you can level and spend skill points differently making even identical character classes possibly very different in combat. Even paying full price for this would probably be worth it. I can think of PLENTY of expensive triple-A games that I didn't play for almost 50 hours, or get nearly as much pleasure out of playing.

												While this is a decent little game, I think it fails to really deliver on its core promises. It's worth some money and time, but I wouldn't recommend paying full price for it.The game bills itself as primarily a tower defense game. Tower defense games generally require you to come up with a strategy to defeat the enemies given a particular map and set of resources. Defender's Quest maps are much simpler, and to a large extent don't require much strategy. That's where the ""RPG"" part comes in. There's not really any role-playing going on, but your characters get stronger and you can buy better weapons and armor for them. The maps don't rely so much on strategy as on having characters that are high enough level and have good enough equipment. And that generally means grinding for XP. So when it comes to the advanced and extreme levels, it's not that the levels are possible but you have to have a better strategy. The levels are simply impossible to start with, and the only way you can beat them is by leveling up your characters.In short, it's not a good tower defense game (because the challenges rely primarily on having high-level characters not strategy), and it's not a good RPG (because there's no real role-playing, just ""numbers going up"" as you and the enemy gain levels and equipment). So I think it rather fails the ""tactical depth"" promise.The second promise is customization, and it does have options to rebind all the keys and change the XP scaling, character names and colors, etc., but I don't think it's a big deal. The developer also put thought into how he could accomodate people with certain disabilities (like epilepsy), which is nice.The third is story, and I suppose that's where this game does best. The story isn't great, but it does give a reason to keep playing and it is fairly humorous in some parts.Technically, the game is well-made, even if it appears dated. I can't recall any bugs in the game, and it has been very stable. The game runs at 800x600 resolution, which is fine for me. The sound effects and music are well-done, but lack variety, which is okay for me.I just wish the game rewarded thinking more than it rewards grinding. It's worth a try if you can get it on sale.

												This is my favourite game in years.It's a tower defense game where each of what would normally be a tower is actually a character that levels up, like in an RPG, complete with a customizable skill tree, equipment, etc. These levels are earned from level to level, so you're constantly improving your party.This superficially simple gameplay concept is backed up on all sides by a great story, deep strategy elements and amazing replayability.StoryAzra (or the name you choose) is the royal librarian that ends up in The Pit, a wretched place full of zombie-like creatures called Revenant. Using mysterious special powers (that excellently explain the tower defense gameplay) and the help of a band of ragtag adventures you'll pick up it is your job to guide her out of the pit. There is more at stake, and the plot has plenty of developments to keep you interested, but what surprised me the most were the story's pacing and its humour.No story segment lasts more than a minute or two, excluding the ending but not the opening, yet it tells a cohesive and engaging story. You'll never feel like the levels are just there to pad out the story or vice versa.Strategy & ReplayabilityWithin levels you get to place your defenders along the paths your enemies will take to reach Azra. Doing so spends mana, so unless Azra has a lot of Mana (maximum mana increases by increasing her level) you'll need to consider which allies to summon. You can 'boost' these allies to unlock more attacks and increase their core stats, up to 5 times, this is equivalent to the traditional tower defense game's tower upgrade. Combine that with being able to place allies whenever you want, advanced targetting settings and certain allies working very well together while others negate some aspects of other powers (frozen vs. burning) and you have a deeply rewarding tactical system.Is this required to enjoy or finish the game? No.The ability to play and replay any level you've cleared at any of 4 difficulties means that you set your own pace and your own challenge. On the lowest difficulty you can basically breeze through the game and just enjoy the story, never having to put a lot of thought into tactics or grinding, and the hardest difficulty will have you either rethinking your tactics or grinding a few more levels.Clearing the game once, with any of its 5 endings (only 2 distinct ones really, one just has 4 different versions) will unlock new game+ mode parallel to the regular game mode. This features new powers for all enemies, several sidequests telling the story of one of the characters relevant to the plot, the ability to understand the 'ancient language' spoken in some of the dialogue and a 'journal' that offers lovely (and often hilarious) glances into the protagonist's mind as her journey progresses.It will challenge you and reward you, and this is completely free extra content that was released months after the game was originally launched that is automatically included. I've put dozens of hours into this game and still revisit it regularly to see if I can't beat a few of the levels I still have problems with on a higher difficulty or to work on my Hero Mode run.Summary:+great plot+great tower defense gameplay+great RPG-style customization+replay levels+multiple difficulties+multiple endings+best way to do new game+-graphics are serviceable, but nothing to write home about-no voice acting (which to me is better than bad voice acting...)-Defender's Quest 2 isn't out yet, give it to meeeeee!

												I really love this gem. Is one of those games that keep you thinking even when you are not playing. Also one of those games you want to play one last round even when you shouldn't (even with the 16x fast forward option making each round last between 10 to 15 minutes, be ready to stay up all night).It has an awesome level design that allows you to test different strategies. The game offers plenty of options, even when you are using the same type of units, you can customize them to suit your needs. For example, you can have an archer causing bleeding next to another archer causing armor-piercing damage.Developers released few months ago an HD update for free. So, this game has basically everything you ever wanted from a game. Good gameplay, good replayability, good story, options, customization, short/long gaming sessions and awesome developers releasing updates even when this game was first released back in 2012.			"

												This is one of my favorite games of all time, and I don't typically like tower defense games. The gameplay is very streamlined and intuitive, and the progression/difficulty curve stays very balanced throughout. Each class is unique, and while the skill trees are not as complex as they could be, they do definitely have an impact on gameplay, especially later on. The humor is excellent, and the additional story bits and journal entries make New Game+ worthwhile. Also, beware the sheep.			"

												I've played the pre-steam version a bunch. Back when it had ugly art (it's still ugly, but it improved a lot!), but it already had the soul it had today. It's a solid tower defence with RPG elements. It just works! I especially love how you can change xp/gold rates to amounts you want, so you could play this game without grinding at all (which many TD games tend to be flawed in when it comes to RPG elements). The story is OK, the writing is OK, but it's all extras for the main course: a solid lengthy TD game. Well worth a 10 buck price point if you're fan of the genre!			"

												I feel bad for letting my love for this game unshared for so long, so I'll take advantage of the steam promotion to atone for that fault. That game is just the best tower defense I ever played. The story is great, the mechanics are innovating and the hero mode and the RPG-like skilltrees make you care for your teammates (which act as your towers). The NG+ and NG++ have alternative stories that give you a great replayability, and there are side quests and hidden achievements as well! And if you don't like the farming side or if the difficulty is too high for you, everything can be adjusted directly in the menu, and the game data is crystal clear and can be modified to cheat to your heart content if that makes you happy ^^ 97/100			"

												As tower defense games go, this is a really good one!  I really like that on each level you can change the difficulty from calm to challenging to frustrating - so I can set it for whatever mood I feel like playing in.  And leveling up as you go, then going back with stronger warriors to beat older levels on higher difficulty really feels rewarding.The story has some humorous and somewhat interesting bits, but it's a mostly simple backdrop to the tower defense that drives the game.  Once you complete the story, you can go back for the more difficult story+ mode which adds several sidequests to fill in some blanks.  It gives the game a nice bit of extra replay value.			"

												I tend to find Tower Defense boring, if it doesn't have a gimmick, or mix in other genres the way Orcs Must Die does. Here, the gimmick is RPG elements, and music reminiscent of Final Fantasy IV. That works for me.There is a ton of content; each map can be replayed on two higher difficulties for increased rewards, after beating it. And then you can replay the whole game in NG+ where enemies have altered behaviors. You can also change the game speed at will, which is something I'd love to see in more Tower Defense, to speed through the parts where I know my towers have things covered and I don't need to watch enemies walk into them and die.

												This game. This is most likely the biggest surprise in my entire library. I originally bought this game about two years ago. The Steam Trading Card system  had just launched into beta (remember when everyone thought it was going to be huge and a card could be worth $5?) and I had gotten in. Curious to test the system out, I found I at the time did not own any games on the short list of applicable games. I immediately did two things. First, I purchased Half-Life 2 since I had played that game on another account and knew it was good. Second was I started scanning the list for cheap games. This was on a daily deal sale the following day. I checked it out and saw that is seemed like a pretty generic, if solid, tower defense game. Felt like one of those particularly good flash games on something like Kongregate or Armor Games. Still, for 5 bucks, I figured it was worth a shot. And I wasn't entirely wrong in my expectations. This does very much feel like a buffed up flash game in a lot of ways. And then I asked myself if that was a bad thing. The gameplay is simple and understandable yet plenty difficult. Creativity is encouraged and different strategies will be required. The graphics weren't amazing, certainly not HD (though a HD update is on its' way at time of writing) but I feel like the art has character to it. This of course is helped by the fact that there actuually is a solid storyline in the game, more than many games I've played. The characters don't have a lot of screentime for development, yet I still feel like they are real. All in all, this game I found to be a very good surprise. Don't expect a AAA level game, but do expect a game whose simple charm and solid gameplay will leave you satisfied. This game doesn't amaze, but it does the one thing that all games have to do. It's simply entertaining. The devs (who btw are super communicative and dedicated to their games) really did a great job with this one, and I look forward to their future work. 9/10 - Highly Reccomended			"

												Defender's Quest is a huge little gem of a game. I believe it offers the most hours of fun per megabyte of any Steam game I've played yet. I really enjoyed playing through it twice and sweating enough to unlock all the achievements.The game scales in difficulty exponentially. This means that the easiest battles are actually the earliest, and that the game gets harder as it progresses. This is a welcome change from most games, but it's taken to an unnecessary extreme at the end. Finishing the final 10% of a full 201 star playthrough will be where you spend the majority of your time. Thanks to the level cap - which you will get to - you'll hit a wall in your ability to improve. That makes it feel repetitive and slow, because you're just repeating the same few battles over and over again, trying to make little tweaks to survive. Most of the game isn't like that, but it's a frustrating way to finish.The game's story and characters are quite memorable and well-written. The dialogue is funny. I wasn't expecting that at all, especially from a tower defense game. It's actually one of the main reasons I'm looking forward to the sequel: I want to know what happens in this world to these people.The graphics are a huge let down though. With no way to scale the sprites are locked in a tiny window. I found myself squinting just to tell what was going on. And I heavily considered lowering my resolution just to make things bigger. Thankfully an HD re-release is in the works, but the level of fidelity as is leaves the game looking like a B-level mobile game. Defender's Quest is not without flaws, but if you enjoy challenging tower defense gameplay where the story compels you to move forward then it's well worth a purchase.			"

												By far my favorite tower defense type game. Between the original flash based release on Kongregate, the standalone version after I purchased it, and the Steam version that was added later I'd guess I have 3x the time listed playing this.What has impressed me as much as the game itself are the continuous updates the game has received WELL after the launch of the game. New Game+, more quests and backstory scenes, art overhauls, etc.If you like tower defense games I would definitely urge you to give Defender's Quest a try!			"

												Top notch tower defense game. The graphics style is fairly simple but the game design works brilliantly. You level up your towers (heros) so they are stronger for future levels, or harder modes which gives you a sense of progression even when you are failing a round terrible on your first try. Very fun and totally worth a few dollars. 9/10			"

												This is a beautiful little game. If you like tower defense, and you enjoy RPG mechanics and tropes, just get this game. Easily one of the most enjoyable TD games I've ever played. The dev has also just released a deluxe version for free for all owners which redoes all the graphics into high resolution, expands the campaign, and brings the game up to 60 fps. So apart from being a good game it has solid devs which are worth supporting.I buy a lot of indie games, not all of them work out or make me glad I bought them, this is one that definitely did and continues to.

												My first sleeper surprise this year.  Hardly anyone sings praises of Defender's Quest, with its basic visuals, repetitive music, and seemingly cloned gameplay.  I'm sure other games have tried combining RPG and Tower Defense (just as Puzzle Quest did with RPG and match 3 puzzles), but I was sucked into this game quicker than I imagined.  The story is dumb but you come to like the silly dialogue and characters, and the stages tend to change just enough (at least on higher difficulties) so you have to keep on your toes.  Some levels will remove your archers for example, while others may force you to prioritize on certain enemies rather than the collective.  This is a great game for people who enjoy Tower Defense with the loot collecting and skill customization of RPGs.			"

												A straight and forward tower defense game. If you like the genre, I very very highly recommend this game. If you don't like the genre, I doubt any game would be able to change your mind, and suggest that you carry on.Defender's Quest managed to impress me by literally exceeding the average in every way I can think of.+ Not a rehash of another tower defense game - it didn't really do anything extraordinary within the genre, yet I can't think of a single game I'd call it similar to.+ Holy ♥♥♥♥, the story is actually good, the characters fun, and the funny parts actually funny.+ There is no ultimate strategy that works for the game (build/upgrade order, etc). Each map forces a new strategy based on the availability of locations to place your characters, and enemy monster types.+ There are dozens of maps, with 4 different difficulty settings, all of which have a New Game+ version which play differently. This game will take many dozens of hours to complete.+ The music is good. Nothing spectacular, but for the genre and the pricetag, exceeds standards.+ Lots of things to play with in the options menu.+ Family friendly - I would see absolutely no problem in an 8 year old playing this game.

												Greetings as always!  The short of it is that if you like tower defense this is a good addition to your collection.  Even without a sale the price is worth it, though this game could have been more appropriate for a tablet I didn’t feel cheated and was left satisfied overall.Graphics and Audio:  The art is basic, no way around that, but it gives a certain charm with that understanding.  Unlike many games this one understands that the core is gameplay not graphics and audio.  Instead of doing a poor job I feel that the developers made the most of they could without cutting quality or requiring a tripple A budget., can’t really complain and the second game looks like they are bringing it to the next level without cutting that charm.Tower Defense:  The game is simple enough, you ‘build’ towers by summoning characters and level them during the match which dramatically increases their power and unlocks a new attack (assuming they know the skill).  The combination of skills needed (like piercing armor or slowing) along with the unique pathing of each unit type gives a lot of strategy.RPG:  The leveling system is decent but a bit shallow; this really isn’t an issue as the game’s leveling mechanics do exactly what is intended.  Along with some gear (weapons, armor and books) and a small bit of color customization for your characters it certainly could be better but I left the game content.  This small addition gives you something to work towards, a reason to 'grind' levels over and a method to make levels harder wtihout require silly levels of micro or creating a game that simply overrun with templates and walkthroughs that anyone can copy.Story:  The narrative is good, the background and story told is very interesting in the premise although it could use a bit of work in the telling.  The mix of silly humor and playful tones keeps the game light without undermining the games overall serious story (looking at you Slak!), no, you aren’t getting BioWare story telling, but you aren’t getting generic forgettable story arc A either.  I’d definitely read a novel based around this fiction.I’m not really sure what else to say, it is a solid game, especially for the price.  Even more so if you are looking to scratch that tower defense itch that seems to be dried up for now.  I hope you manage to enjoy it as much as I did.			"

It has good gameplay, funny dialouge, likeable characters, and pretty graphics (both old and HD update graphics are available)! My only complaint would be the character skill trees since I prefer each characters of a class being exactly the same but if you like to have a more diverse cast of characters (gameplay diversity that is) then you'd like this even more.9/10 totally worth full price in my opinion.

												[Spoiler-Free Review]Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is the definition of a hidden gem. The game is amazing, but criminally overlooked.The game plays something akin to a Fire Emblem: Tower Defense where stat and character growth elements are mixed with strategy and storyline. Acquiring new gear for your party (via extra challenges) as you progress through the story arc elicits the same feeling of excitement, joy and wonder I had when I was a child exploring Final Fantasy for the first time in glorious 16-bit. The music is genius in it's simplicity, the graphics are a throwback to the olden days, and the story is interesting from the get-go.If there's fault I can find within the game it's that the difficulty balance in some of the stages leans too heavily on the easy side (when set to normal difficulty in-game). I find myself pining for an extreme or endless mode, or better yet, a colosseum with extremely rare equipment and rewards.Buy this game; It's going to amaze you.			"

												Being a sucker for tower defense games, I snagged this game up fairly quickly when I noticed it was on sale. This game is simply awesome, it has everything a TD enthusiast could ever hope for. The game is quite challenging, which I consider a plus when playing TD games. I hate when TD games are overly simplistic and require very little strategy to win. Even when your characters are max level and you've obtained all the best gear it's still quite hard in the later stages of NG+.  Unit placement is extremely important as well as choosing the right skills/passives for your characters based on the level you're playing. On that note, the game has quite a few levels in the main storyline along which a bunch of bonus levels in the NG+ mode. The artwork is nice and the story is pretty decent. The characters are very likable and a bit comedic at times. I usually mute games and play my own music but I rarely did that with this game, the soundtrack is quite enjoyable. Overall I would give the game a solid 8/10. Looking forward to playing the second game when it's released.  "

												I didn't come into this game with any expectations. I hadn't even heard of it before I saw the trailer on the bundle, but this game actually ended up being fantastic. I couldn't put it down once I started. The gameplay is well-balanced, leaving you with many levels just barely cleared once you get to the higher levels. While I did expect more from the RPG aspects (I literally built every unit from every class identically), I enjoyed the story, and found the game keeping my interest for quite awhile for an indy title.Though, out of everything, I have to say that the best part of this game was its music. The soundtrack for this is amazing. It definitely makes every battle feel epic, and does change to suit the mood at certain key points.Overall, I'm so glad I played this. Thumbs up from me.			"

There's the ""kiddie"" games that try to be completely unoffensive and appealing to all ages, and the ""mature"" games that are filled with blood, but there's hardly anything that successfully matches the charm of the former with the seriousness of the latter.

												A fun spin on the tower defence genre. Adding character growth and party management similar to something like Final Fantasy Tactics stop it from becoming stale like a lot of other tower defence games. The stat trees don't seem especially deep, but they're interesting enough in the early game and everything seems well balanced.The story is simple but well told, the art style is also very simple (the 6th party member/character type in particular looks a little goofy) but the character of the game shines through it, and your party members are all expressive, interesting and actually quite charming. Lots of good, strong female characters here as well which is refreshing.Each level has an advanced and extreme version, which will require you to come back later when you're stronger. They're unnecessary to progress, but they will give you extra goodies if you go back and do them.Currently on sale for $1.50, which is a steal, I'd consider it well worth it at the regular $15 for fans of good tower defence or tactics based RPGs.

												I'll admit I am biased; I absolutely love this game.The writing is smart and to the point. It gives these characters who could've fit a dull archetype much more personality and energy. There is both levity and gravity. Our leading ladies are represented very well and are good examples of female characters.Gameplay is very user friendly, but in a good way. It doesn't matter if you are new to Tower Defense games or a pro, you can customize the game to fit your wants. Want a challenge but don't want to grind? Crank up the exp and only use the main characters. Is it kicking your butt? Decreased the penalty for losing. It's very intuitive.Music although noted to be repetitive suits the mood very well. The mood of peril and danger is conveyed very well and the music is catchy enough to be memorable.Here's a TL;DRThe Good+Great writing+Challenging but not required+Anti-grind measures+Replayability with New Game PlusThe Bad-Flat character designs-Certain maps with a lot of action can slow down computers-Will likely have to resort to using the lightning spell which makes it a click-festAmong the many, many other TD games, this game rises far above crowd.

												You know, just when I compared the genre of tower defense to a 90's boy band and most aspects of Final Fantasy as tedious wank, there comes a game that I probably would be beaming hate rays at. This is that game, and I can't beam hate rays onto it because it takes all the irritating bits out of Final Fantasy such as grind and artificially lengthened gameplay out, and combines it with what makes tower defense ♥♥♥♥ing awesome: Intensity, efficiency, control. It would be up there with the classic Immortal Defense (and if you haven't played Immortal Defense, rectify that), but the story, despite being written by a 'real English major', flat out stands there and doesn't do anything. It doesn't ♥♥♥♥ me off either, though, so I guess it can stay. The game's still pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good!			"

												If one were pessimistic or dismissive, it would be easy to look at this Tower Defence game and dismiss it for being generic and dated-looking. However, that would be doing the game and the developers a real disservice.Granted, the 16-bit style is one you're either going to like or not, but it is executed very well indeed, as the use of colour is very done so that it remains pleasing on the eye and never jarring. The execution and balance of the game overall is very polished, and belies the developers' size - it really appears to be well-tested and difficulty is a very smooth and progressive curve. Pacing is similarly excellent, and it definitely evokes that magic ""just one more go"" response. The icing on the cake is the story, which is nice and humorous without being too cheesy or vulgar, so it greatly appeals to a wide audience. As comedy is a very difficult thing to write, they have done a fantastic job here; it's very tongue-in-cheek, and it fits the game perfectly.The meat of the game lies in having characters as your ""towers"" to place on a map. You can purchase extra characters to a maximum of 6 of each, and level them individually. The range of characters are well-defined (such as straight-up brawlers, archers, mages, healers, and even big ol' dragons), and afford some forethought as to their placing on the maps.The length of the game is good, running at a good few hours minimum, but with the added replayability of New Game+ and more. Whilst the game might seem a little high for something that looks like an old game, it is well worth money, as it will entertain you from start to finish.For fans of the genre, this is a must. Even for casuals, it's highly recommended.			"

												TL;DR: If you ever even remotely enjoyed a tower defense type of game, you seriously need to play this one. If you haven't but like rpgs, this is your best bet to find out what a great TD can be like, with the RPG elements to help carry you along. Really, if the (very generous) demo to this game doesn't get you hooked, then tower defense may simply not be your genre, and at least now you know. ;)*** ***Defender's Quest is one of those games that without too much fanfare and fancy graphics simply get gameplay right. The rpg elements are well embedded, the story is not just an excuse for progression, the dialogues are well written and funny, the music is good and sets the mood nicely - but it's really all just about the balanced, fun, just-one-more-level gameplay.It takes place in a plague colony, where the afflicted are turned into horrors controlled by a necromancer master villain. Your hero realizes she's capable of bringing herself and her allies into a halfway world, where the horrors and ultimately the villain can be fought with. While this is a simple enough premise, the way it brilliantly ties the story to the game's mechanics is one of the stellar design aspects of the game. (More on that here[www.fortressofdoors.com], if you're interested in game design).Due to the fact that you customize the appearance of your pawns, equip them with weapons and armour, and train them towards permanent experience that you can put towards an interesting skill tree, you end up becoming more attached to them then if you just had ""towers"" to play with. Especially your set crew of 6 archetypical towers/heroes is a fun bunch with entertaining banter in the (skippable) cut scenes, and by the end of the game you are genuinely interested in their actions and story decisions.I appreciated the attention to detail that allows you to customize both the difficulty and the game experience: active pause, different speed controls, highly configurable hotkeys, customizable general difficulty on top of the ability to replay maps on different difficulty levels (which actually play differently, instead of simply increasing the number of enemies or turning them into sponges). And then there's the Game+, which may just be even more fun to play than the normal game - if you can survive it. Plus, there's the sheep. Good luck with that. ;)With its 30+ grindable main levels, the endless levels, a couple of different endings, a Game+, side missions to unlock and many interesting achievements, there is a very generous amount of content there for the price. Plus, a full HD/60 FPS upgrade is coming soon, for free, with redesigned graphics (the one aspect of the game that many may find lacking), so what more do you want?Maybe what you want is Defender's Quest 2, which is expected to come out some time in 2016 - giving you plenty of time to finish playing 1 first. :)			"

												Legitimately good TDPros:-PERMANENT progression with characters/""towers""-Challenging as hell-Lots of post-story content-Items are nice-Script is pretty humourous-Good TD mechanics. No mazing, but the mazes themselves are alright. Tower placement is emphasizedCons:-Only a few types of towers, and you usually don't get enough Mana to build many/upgrade them anyway-Some classes outright suck compared to others (cough, dragons, cough)-On the other hand, some classes are NECESSARY to complete every level (assuming you're not playing on baby mode)-Unlocking everything is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥, don't bother unless you want to spend 800 hours on this game afking while your towers do the work for you			"

												One of the best tower defense games I've played. Not only is the narrative solid (and hilarious), but the game itself just mechanically works out really well.

												This game is absolutely incredible. It takes tower defense to a whole new level, and the fact that each ""tower"" has a whole hilarious character to it is great. I have more time logged in this game than Steam is showing, because for some reason it didn't track right, but that's only a small bug. The only real issue I have with this game is that the Journal is a little bit messed up. A few of the entries continue well off of the page, so it's impossible to read them in their entirety. Besides that, I cannot recommend this game any more than I already do. Buy it. Buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it. It's great.			"

In this pixelated game, graphics aren't that great, though the gameplay makes up for it if you are the sort that can handle other low-graphic games.Only thing about this game I can really complain about is the repetition in game style.8/10 Will play more of.

												I think I picked a good time to play Defender’s Quest: Valley of the Forgotten (Deluxe Edition). The graphics are much better, the game has improved performance, a x16 speed is included, and much more. The smart changes and relentless support make this an extremely good and content rich tower defense game. I didn’t care much for the main story though, but more on that later.I rather start with the gameplay where this game shines its brightest. As you progress through the 6-hour campaign, you unlock different heroes that function as your towers. Each hero you plop down on the field has four boost levels that can be purchased. You can only place heroes on predesignated spots as the game isn’t about mazing as much as thoughtful placement in a level’s limited space. Each hero has a distinct role to play such as Knights being able to pierce and destroy armor or Healers keeping everyone alive since some creeps attack and casting debuffs on enemies that amplify your damage. There are six hero types in all – Berzerker, Archer, Priest, Ice Mage, Knight, Dragon – that can be used to defeat the Revenant horde.Heroes and the player character, Azra, can also be equipped with items. Azra can equip two different books that can enhance spells or affect the stage such as heroes having a free Frenzy buff when placed. Books are earned from bonus stages which are unlocked via the perfect stars earned from completing levels without letting Azra receive damage. Heroes can either equip a weapon, armor, or nothing at all. You can purchase equipment and recruit more heroes at towns. You can also earn unique items from tackling the higher difficulties for specific stages. The unique items are worth it as they can also serve a purpose in NG+New Game Plus adds a significant amount of content for both the reading type of player or TD lover and does more than make the enemies tougher and stronger. You’ll run into new side-quests that provide additional story content or jokes and run into a couple of new characters. One of them is the Hermit, a crazy person who can upgrade all the unique items you’ve earned and give them new, powerful properties. There are also new developer journal entries that can be unlocked by playing if you want even more things to read. Those entries can be surprisingly interesting to read since you can see the thought process behind some of the decisions made for the game. You can also read about what the different inspirations were for other parts including the names of the unique items or the Ash religion. Both the side-quests and dev entries came with the Deluxe upgrade.Running back and forth between the standard game and NG+ to perfect all the levels, collect uniques, and upgrade the items will probably take a bit more than 20+ hours for players if the standard settings are kept. Keep in mind that you can alter the experience, scrap (currency), and penalty rates in the accessibility menu which is a great thing indeed. Don’t forget about if you ever start to feel as though the game is becoming grindy as you go back and forth between stages in order to level up or earn more money to overcome the later levels. I had my fill of the game around the 20 hour mark and have no desire to go back for the time being.Now we come to the main story. I did not enjoy the story told through the cutscenes for almost 90% of it. I thought the main antagonist, Zelemir, had some interesting qualities that were revealed during the later levels, but then there’s also Slak, the Berzerker, with his loud and wacky personality that felt really forced or possibly not meant for my age group. He came off as pretty lame with his style of humor and insatiable need to murder things. Maybe I just disliked how he spoke with Capslock. I thought the writing in the journal entries were better and more interesting as were some of the side-quests in NG+. Some of the journal entries explained the main characters in more depth and made certain events much more meaningful due to understanding the significance of certain actions. Some were tainted by Slak’s handwriting and jests which didn’t make me laugh.Finally, I’d like to cover some other parts of what this game has to offer. The game saw heavy usage of the speed multiplier from me. I didn’t use the x16 multiplier very often, but man, what a time saver for when you have a solid strategy prepared for a level. You can also go in the other direction and slow down time, but I used the Pause feature instead with Spacebar. B, for boosting, is also another good hotkey to know. In addition to the x16 and performance optimizations, the game runs in 60fps which makes fast forwarding very pleasant. There is also the HD art style version of the game which is on by default now, but you can go back to the older graphics if you wanted to when you’re in the overworld map. The drawings for the cutscenes are vastly improved and I wouldn’t want to go back to the original. The retro aesthetics might be preferred by some people though, so it’s nice that you can switch whenever.  The game is very good with all the options it offers in general. Oh, also Steam Cloud and Steam Workshop are there now.Defender’s Quest is an incredibly solid TD game with enough content to keep you entertained for a while. That’s assuming that the gameplay sinks its hooks into you as I don’t think the story is the major draw for players, unfortunately. The accessibility options can also make the experience friendly to newer players. DQ has been one of the better Tower Defense experiences I’ve had in recent memory so I hope the sequel turns out well too.			"

												Defender's Quest breathes new life into the dusty genre of tower defense by mixing it with the story and characters of a role-playing game. I must warn you that it is incredibly addictive; it contains oodles of extra content as well as multiple rewards for choosing more difficult paths through the game. And once you're done with it all, you can begin anew to see if you can complete the famed ""Hero Mode"". Add in mod support and a gracious team of developers and you can see why this game has something for everyone.			"

												I generally don't like Tower Defence games but I've loved this one- RPG elements and missions-based story progression keep any one gameplay session getting tedious and the characters are customisable enough to allow different builds for different situations. The dialogue is genuinely amusing too. Recommend to play in ""Hero Mode"" (without extra recruits) as it really makes you think hard about your unit placement. Give the demo a go, at least.			"

												Rating: Highly Recommended!One of the best tower defense games I've ever played and a truly compelling role playing game as well.  The execution is almost entirely phenomenal bar some minor hiccups: overworld navigation can be a bit slow paced due to camera/view, potentially a bit too much humor at times,  and a couple sporadic difficulty spikes.  I also believe some of the new game+ features/areas shouldn't have been removed from the first playthrough, but the initial playthrough is still very engaging regardless.  The accessibility and extensive options of this game really shine and open the game to all sorts of players and styles.  There are a couple features that would make this game a bit better; Steam Workshop modification integration and maybe an expanded built in level editor.  Overall, a well-executed, deftly-plotted, and damn enjoyable experience that deserves your attention and support. Don't pass this one over without giving it a fair shot.P.S. Still not convinced?  Try the demo and embark upon your own quest.     "

												Defender's Quest is a fun tower defence game infused with a little RPG element while having a strange yet humorous plot. The majority of the game isn't much of a challenge, so I would recommend this game to those who are new to this genre. However, that's not to say that avid tower defence players would not enjoy this with its strategic gameplay consisting of many unique map designs as well as the combination of old school tower abilities such as slows, critical damage and AOE effects. The RPG element in this game is very minor (you have the ability to upgrade skills and buy or find equipments) and without it, this game is your typical tower defence game. This is a great game to pick up to play for all kinds of gamers and non-gamers!			"

												I first played the demo version on my old laptop (R.I.P) four years ago after seeing it on XGen. I was really addicted to it, even though it was short 'cuz it was a demo. I was amazed by it's unique gameplay, setting and mostly the music. I remember that I kept humming the soundtrack for it all the time. I then forgot about the game, and soon, my laptop broke. Fast forward four years later, seeing this on sale in Steam. When I saw it, I thought ""Hey, why not buy it after all these years?"" and so I did.The game now looks different, however the soundtrack and the gameplay is still the same. Then I looked into the options and saw you can change the art style to the original one. Obviously, I picked the original, since the game feels more better that way. It's better to play it like you've played it before. I really recommend this game because of the unique gameplay, and you could probably fall in love with the soundtrack. I am currently humming the map theme now as I type this review. There's really not much else to say, since it's better if you experience it first-hand. Go on, get it while it's on sale. Totally worth it.			"

												I bought this game over a year ago and I still occasionally like to play it.  It's a satisfying, simple tower defense game with RPG simple character tech trees and RPG items, along with a story.I tried to ignore the story, but some parts of it can't help but seep through as I'm playing, and I think the story adds a nice dimension (especially when compared to other tower games where it's map after map and nothing to tie it all together).Because the ""towers"" are characters, and those characters level up, every puzzle tactical area eventually becomes easier.  But also every tactical area has 3 (sometimes 4) levels of difficulty, so it adds some mileage to the whole game.This is so far my favorite tower defense game and the most compelling.			"

												Defender's Quest is a fantastic TD game. It looks basic, but beneath the surface lurk customisation through talent trees for every unit, and the protagonist (who must be protected in each stage). The games retro style suits it, as it's a classic TD game that doesn't really introduce anything new to the genre. However, this is not a bad thing as it is a very strong game and doesn't need anything 'special' to draw people in. I'm a huge fan of TD games, and this is definitely one of my favourites.			"

												Don't be fooled by the modest visuals - this is a fantastic game. As an RPG Tower Defense hybrid, it's a blast. Solid mechanics that allow you to micro-manage as much (or as little) as you like, while offering simple tweaks to XP accumulation, allow for a high degree of accessibility. On top of that, the story is great. It does its own thing without relying too heavily on established fantasy tropes, and also mixes in some really successful humor - it actually reminds me a bit of Avatar: The Last Airbender.If you're going to pick the game up, I'd highly recommend heading to the game's site. There's a sequel in development, which will have a score by no other than Nobuo Uematsu, and pre-ordering it there will net you a free copy of this game as well.Bonus Note: For a more classic RPG experience, don't pick up any additional recruits in the towns you visit along the way. Instead, use only the characters you get directly through the story, and bump up experience gains to 300% - this will lend itself to a few special achievements, minimize micro-management headaches, and generally let you bask in the glory of your awesome, uber-powered characters.Bonus Note+: The New Game+ is incredible, and so worth playing. It adds side quests, and a journal (which is actually really well written), giving loads of meat to the story and characters that was only hinted at on the first playthrough. Stick around for it - it'll be worth your time.			"

												This is a simple but excellent tower defense / rpg hybrid with an entertaining story told comic book style with great writing and is overall just a ton of fun.The built in main story provides a lot of content, but they have gone above and beyond by making NG+ more than just the same game with an increased difficulty.  Instead the NG+ version has new side quests, new monster types and mechanics, etc so its actually almost like a full addition to the game (although with the exception of the side quests the story is the same).  The game also comes with multiple endings, multiple difficulties for each level and a set of bonus challenges so all told there is easily 30 hours of content and probably much more for a completionist.The game is quite easy on the lower difficulties but involves a ton of strategy and efficient management on the harder challenges.  Overall it strikes a good balance in letting you set you own difficulty and providing plenty of challenge without frrustation.10/10, great value.			"

												Ok, let me start with by saying this is an enjoyable time killer. I binge played this game while being forced to stay indoors because of a flu and tooth removal. It literally erased 2 days of my time and now I have to go back to work.The game in general is very solid tower defense game. Mechanically it's flawless, and the RPG feature which lets you build your characters and upgrade them definitely adds the charm. Overall, if you enjoy tower defense type games and have nothing better to do for few hours/days, I highly recommend trying this game. It also has a good demo, which lets you play good part of the game for free. So there is no cost of initial admission.However the best part of this game is the active developers. After the devs being almost dead-silence for 2 years (prepping for a next game/sequel), they returned with HD version and constant updates and patches, which are really nice. Considering the game is over 4 years old, it's nice to see dev sticking to their games. So I recommend the game.But, I have to nitpick few things before I leave. While none of these were deal breaker for me, your mileage may differ. The story arc is generic, the characters are not really new (by which I mean you saw all of these character archetypes somewhere), and humor in game are at best reddit /r/jokes level. The game is an infinite grindfest unless you change the reward level to 200~300%, which then lets you play a fair game that allows you to progress through all levels. I like the fact that devs included option to choose your own difficulty, but why the default values so low just boggles my mind. Finally, the default graphics option is not very optimized and you should turn off some graphical settings and sprites to prevent the game choking your CPU. All in all, it's a solid tower defense game you can enjoy for few hours/days. I recommend the game to anyone who likes this genre.			"

												This is a simple but excellent tower defense / rpg hybrid with an entertaining story told comic book style with great writing and is overall just a ton of fun.The built in main story provides a lot of content, but they have gone above and beyond by making NG+ more than just the same game with an increased difficulty.  Instead the NG+ version has new side quests, new monster types and mechanics, etc so its actually almost like a full addition to the game (although with the exception of the side quests the story is the same).  The game also comes with multiple endings, multiple difficulties for each level and a set of bonus challenges so all told there is easily 30 hours of content and probably much more for a completionist.The game is quite easy on the lower difficulties but involves a ton of strategy and efficient management on the harder challenges.  Overall it strikes a good balance in letting you set you own difficulty and providing plenty of challenge without frrustation.10/10, great value.			"

												Well, through 6 hrs playing, my first impression is that this is a decent RPG mixing with some tower defense elements. As a tower defense game, it is too simple in strategic depth. You don't have too many strategies available in game. But as a RPG, it is not outstanding as well in comparison with other typical RPGs. Its attraction to me is that this game is story-driven and the story is engrossing enough to keep me playing for hours. At the start, a dying girl is thrown into a pit to accept her destiny. But she doesn't. For unknown reason, she returns from the halfway to the hell. In return, the terrible experience on the verge of life and death gives her a new spiritual ability, making her capable of leading people to fight against the undead. As the game progresses, the mystery behind uncovers. This girl gradually comprehends her unavoidable destiny. She would meet many companions like warrior, archer, monk, mage and even the dragon. They would give her a hand on her road to save the world...			"

												I'm not convinced that RPG progression + tower defense is a very good model. Or at least it's too underdeveloped in Defender's Quest. There aren't nearly enough varieties in skill trees or enemies or items to justify the levelling and equipping. And while the levels are well designed, the balance isn't quite right and I ended up playing through most of the standard game on max fast forward (granted I was doing +300% hero mode, but large parts of the game seem pressuring to go hero mode).That said, this game is absolutely adorable and totally worth it on a bad laptop.

The RPG elements can't be overstated; they give you a reason to care about your ""towers"". The character writing is chuckle-worty at times, and the story, while it's not Oscar worthy, is very good. I've been looking for a ""play a round or two at a time"" game to play, and Defender's Quest fit that perfectly (except I would end up playing ""just one more"" more often than not).

												You might be forgiven for overlooking Defender's Quest. Exceedingly generic title attached to yet another tower defense game... of course, you'd be missing out on a whole lot if you let that get in the way of you playing this game.Let me get this out of the way first: I don't like tower defense games. They usually bore me or frustrate me, and in worst case scenarios they do both at the same time. Defender's Quest deftly combines core tower defense play with RPG elements, a story that'll actually hold your attention, and beautiful artwork in and out of combat.Say what you will about simple spritework: it looks fantastic here. Units are distinctive, animate well. I absolutely love the artwork out of combat, and the writing is fun as hell. I came to really love the cast, and was sad when it was all over- well, not for long. Game features a New Game+ option that not only ups the difficulty a ton, it gives you access to plenty of sidequests and some very powerful items if you play your cards right. I've seen some complaints about this game lacking in depth of strategy- I don't find this to be the case, especially in maximum difficulty New Game+ battles. But one of the many wonderful things about this game is that its accessibility options allow you to tune the difficulty to your liking. Are you terrible at tower defense but want to see the storyline play out? They got you covered. Still having trouble? You can grind experience on earlier missions, too. Do you want this game to give you a merciless red-♥♥♥ beatdown and make you hate your life? Also an option! A+ to the devs for making sure the widest audience possible could enjoy their story until the very end.Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is a wonderful little gem of a game that should not be ignored. Highly recommend you give it a shot- I have a pretty good feeling that almost everyone is going to find something to like here.			"

												Buy This:If you love tower defense If you love 8 bit era RPGsIf you enjoy a humorous adventure starring a bunch of misfit heroes. Defender's Quest is another tower defense game with a few twists that put it above the curve. For starters, rather than building soulless towers that you have zero attachment to, you employ RPG style characters to defend your ""Librarian."" These characters can be named, stylized (to a slight degree with color options) and then leveled the more they're used. They each even have a system of perks that can be unlocked through the course of the campaign. You can employ as many as you can find the dosh for, but each requires ""mana"" to be deployed in battle. This is a finite pool that is replenished by killing baddies. The maximum mana you can have increases as your librarian levels as well, so in essence it is a clever way of keeping the player from throwing 70 towers up at the start of a new mission and steam rolling. The game also has a pretty humorous story line, and memorable main characters. There's unique items you can unlock for your favorite minions, and even a brutally hard Game+ mode if you desire even more once you finish the campaign. With such a low price point, this is a must have for people who like old school RPGs, tower defense style games or both.			"

												Defender's Quest is a novel rpg take on the tower defense genre. That in and of itself would make an interesting game, but the designers saw fit to include an interesting story to explain away the game mechanics as part of the plot. While the central theme of plague and the risen dead is dark, the dialogue between characters is lighthearted and oftentimes funny. Such a combination of serious undertones and bright interplay amongst the characters helped me enjoy the game quite a bit.Insofar as the actual mechanics are concerned, this is not a ""maze building"" tower defense game. The enemies will come in waves along pre-defined paths with limited placement for your defenders (the towers, essentially) available. Defenders can be upgraded by ""boosting"" them through five levels which unlocks any abilities they may have earned through levelling and a rudimentary talent system. Speaking of levelling, this is where the rpg mechanic comes into play; every level gained by a defender gives you talent points which you can use to tweak the character and gain new abilities. While the talent system is very basic, it does give you a feeling of satisfaction to distribute your points when a defender levels or you gain access to a new class. While there are only six classes of defender to use in the game, the customization inherent in the rpg progression system means there is the possibility of some differentiation. Additional defenders can be recruited in towns across the game's story map, wherein the plot is advanced and new battlefields are opened up. In battle, these defenders are placed with the same resource you use for upgrading, but recruiting new defenders gets progressively expensive with the game's story mode currency (won through battle). That same currency is used for equipping your defenders with weapons and armor, so there is an opportunity cost. As additional currency can be won by going back and fighting harder versions of prior story mode battles at any time, you never truly feel strapped for cash.As the game is 2d, the question isn't whether the graphics are advanced, but how good and cohesive they look. Cut scenes to advance the plot are drawn with a style which gels extremely well with the battle sprites and look pleasing to the eye. Opinions on art styles will vary, but the cleanliness and cohesiveness of the game's visuals can not be denied. There are no sloppy looking sprites in this game and your defender's colors can even be customized to a limited degree to further suit your tastes. Unfortunately, while the animations of your defenders (and especially that of a certain antagonist at the very end of the game) are fluid and pleasing to watch, the animations of the monsters which you are tasked to kill are very basic and stilted. Still, most of the time said monsters are drowning in a sea of pleasing damage numbers as your defenders are chopping them to pieces, so perhaps some gamers will be able to overlook this as I did.According to steam, I was able to extract 13 hours out of this game and there are still bonus challenges to complete and a new game plus mode to experiment with. Whether that is worth the price of admission is a decision that I encourage you to weigh carefully if you would normally pass up a game based on length: it is lovingly crafted and an enjoyable experience that I can recommend to any rpg fan, even those who aren't familliar with tower defense games.The long and short of it: 8/10, buy it.

												This game is so Awesome! If I was some award giving guy I would give this game so many awards. The writing in this is Fantastic! and will make you smile, Unbelievable! The characters are Incredibly! likeable and because of that you will like them, Astounding! The gameplay is Wonderful! as well and what you would expect from a Tower Defense game of such caliber, Extraordinary! It is literally my GOTY, Miraculous! Other note worthy things to say is that Striking! Stupendous! Thrilling! Breath-taking! Thaumaturgic! Superb! and some might even say Radical!The Story is what really shines here, ""You"" basically almost die but don't, instead you come across your first companion Truth and Justice not to mention Thunder, Lightning, Carnage, Chaos, Triumph, The Executor, and lastly of course Khan and Charissa, where you'll need to slay a bijillion and one Revenant and collect their Magic Skulls in order to make the Ultimate! Rye Bread with Noodles Dish and save the world.Literally the only negative is that I beat it and now finally over, at lease until I get alzheimer's (Can't Wait!)My only advise is don't mess with the EXP gain option until NG+, it is an RPG hybrid after all and like all RPG's it's easy to over level and things might get too easy, Don't let that happen! So stick to the defaults, and be sure to play the NG+ for even more story, Inconceivable!Oh and you can trust this review I'm an expert. Astonishing! http://i.imgur.com/P5mez.png "

												I am not a huge fan of tower defense games, but this one reallycaught my interest for long. The storyline is interesting and characters are well written, even if not completely serious. This game mixes traditional tower defense with some RPG elements. For example instead of towers you are using characters that can level up, gain skills and better equipment, even the thing to protect is simply your main character.Visuals are not this game's strength but they don't distract from the game and do their job well enough. If you don't hate tower defense games, try this one out.			"

Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten (DX edition) is a fun yet somehow shallow tower defense game. It's one of these cases where Steam's binary review system forces me to give a 'thumbs up' rating followed by a long text with all the caveats.TLDRIf you're looking for a relaxed, not-to-deep tower defense with colorful graphics, thematic music and some tongue-in-cheek dialog you might try this out. If you're looking for the best-in-class tower defense game, this is not it.detailsThe game has us accompany Azra, the royal librarian of a fantasy land, through her journey across the land where she must overcome various evils. You wouldn't play this game for its story per se but the dialogs and well crafted scenery and overworld make for a compelling reason to keep playing. Via overlay tutorials the player is introduced gently into the actual gameplay of placing and managing your figthers. While the start is great you soon realize that there isn't a lot of depth to the gameplay. I've played Warcraft 3 custom maps that had more mechanical variety in their tower defense than this game.The mechanics merit a closer look because they are the Achilles' heel of this game really. There just isn't a lot to do other than the basics : placing your figthers (towers) and upgrading them, using your global hero powers now an dthen. There's no option to call a wave early for extra cash, no towers that teleport mobs to the beginning of the maze, no flying units that ignore the ground paths altogether, no possiblity to send your own troops against the enemy, etc., etc.Mostly you'll be fighting against zombie like creatures which is justified by the story but it gets stale fast. There's a missed opportunity here for including a much more diverse set of enemies that challenge the player to adjust their strategy and tactics.Outside of combat you'll have the opportunity to manage your party by purchasing equipment, acquiring new fighters up your fighters by assigning points in a talent tree. The game limits itself to 6 classes of figthers (towers) all of which are nicely integrated into and justified by the story. Every figther has a unique role and there's little possiblity of straying from that role via the talent tree. You want your archers exel at ranged combat and your freeze mages to excel at slowing down foes. That is that. I dare to say that this game suffers from a mild sort of RPG syndrome: the inclusion of RPG elements (experience bars, talent trees, interchangeable equipment) for the mere sake of it.The developers have included many interface features that are very useful in this type of game, like being able to slow or speed up time at will or being able to reuse your previous tower layout if you failed a mission. Being able to control the game's speed at will makes for relaxed play sessions and there's even the option to scale experience points and loot rewards if you feel the pace is to slow or to fast. One of the decisions that astonishes me is that the developers decided to hide away some content like side missions and additional dialog in new game plus (ng+) mode. Since this game's story and presentation are on the strong side (for this genre) this baffles me. I've tried my fair share of ng+ and In the way of difficulty or mechanics there isn't much that varants a second playtrough. Defender's Quest is rather the kind of game that you play through once to see the plot come to its conclusion and then move on to something else.This game supports the Steam controller ouf of the box and the layout is quite sensical. When using it though, the game would often hang in dialog scenes or null pointer crash. No such issues presented themselves however when playing with well though out keyboard layout.All in all, I've had my fun with Defender's Quest and I'm looking forward to see the devs expand upon it with Defender's Quest 2 which is currently in development.Edit: the game supports modding via the Steam workshop. While there aren't very many modifications available as of writing (February 2017) this is certainly a big plus!			"

												Not a good game.It was as if the devs made sure it had all the elements to sell, but none to make it fun.Not an enjoyable 17 hours.  I wasn't smart enough to stop.(1)  The tower defense gameplay was poor.  The appeal of tower defense games is usually to try and optimize your defense to be efficient and effective as possible against the oncoming force.   In Defender's Quest there are very few places where your characters can be placed rationally.  In other words, there was only one strategy to place your characters when you setup.  Since there were no other real elements to the game, this made it very boring.  When you lost a mission, you couldn't try and refine your process as there was nothing to refine.  You just needed to level up to get stronger.(2)  The character leveling up process was poor.  I decided to buy the game because the game boasted an RPG leveling-up process.  Although this is technically true, you DO HAVE TO CLICK A BUTTON in order for them to get more powerful, it could have been done automatically as your choices were thin, uncreative, and obvious.  Again, there was no game element in it.  You put the point where it was supposed to go and done.(3)  The storyline was not worth it.  I don't remember the storyline other than it seemed shallow.  The characters were the best part of the game.  Each character seemed unique and full of personality, but the storyline needed more to take away from the poor gameplay.  Because I liked the characters and I thought they were unique, it was a big letdown to find out later that you get more characters just like them gameplay wise.  Here you thought you had a unique crazy berserker guy or a badass ice mage, but no, they are just one of many.(4)  The enemies were uncreative.  The enemies were similar across the board.  At no point do you need to change your strategy based on the different types of enemies coming our way.    Some tower defense games have VERY uncreative enemies, but they don't need varied enemies as the game element is in the placing of the towers/characters, abilities, and tower synergy.  Defender's Quest did not have that.			"

												Although the concept for this tower defense game is neat and the gameplay is somewhat entertaining, the progression is a little too slow. After 9 or 10 stages, I found myself having to backtrack constantly to keep up with the levels of the monster waves. Granted, it's possible to adjust the experience and scrap that you gain from encounters, but the standard difficulty shouldn't have to be modified just for that purpose. While the artwork and story seem to have drastically improved from the original work, a couple of errors can be spotted every now and then, and the plot remains a bit mediocre. Although I'll continue to play this game to its completion, I doubt I'll purchase the sequel if it largely resembles this first title.			"

												This is a great game within its genre. It's an atypical tower defense game with a cute story that's interesting enough to keep you playing. Although the gameplay itself does that sufficiently enough, it's a good addition to a genre that usually lacks such features. Your 'towers' are people and due to it having a story, some of these characters have a personality and that makes it a lot of fun. You can level your towers and have them learn new skills as well as equip them with better weaponry. The game initially isn't hard, but the option to make it so is available for those longing for a challenge. All in all, if you enjoy tower defense games but are looking for something new, I'd say you can't go wrong with this game.If you're not into tower defense games, you might still want to give this game a try as it does certain things common amongst games of its genre differently, and that might just be enough for you. I had a lot of fun with this game and picked it up rather cheaply, for having put over 20 hours in this game I cannot do anything but recommend it at this point. I am looking forward to Defender's Quest 2, it's coming people!			"

												I am leaving a positive review not to go into details (other reviews do that better) but simply to recommend this game.It is a tower defence rpg but is an excellently well-rounded experience.  I had not played a tower defence game before so my opinion of this game may be coloured by the way it introduced me to a gameplay genre/set of mechanics (but that just is what it is: this game incorporated the mechanics in an enjoyable and compelling way).

												Oddly one of my favorite games that I continue to go back to.  There is no mindblowing gameplay or jawdropping graphics.  What it does it does small scale, but it delights in in each area.Story:  A very solemn themed game about war, sacrifices, dark gods, etc.  Fortunately the main cast have great (sometimes insane)  personalities and have wonderful, surprising, and often hysterical interactions.  This is where the writing really shines and is honestly probably the strongest part of the game.Gameplay:  It's pretty standard tower defense.  Each class has skills, attack range, hit points, etc.  Set them up in likely positions and away you go.  Fail?  Try a different set up.  Characters also level up with experience for new skills, high attack, so forth.  Getting too easy? There's a Newgame+ with harder enemies and achievements that will test you.Graphics:  During gameplay it is high quality pixel art style, detailed and well done.  Cut scenes before and after battles are...I'm not sure what to call it.  Cell shaded stop motion?  It's nice and it does the trick without being flashy.Like I said, I just keep coming back for more, figured I might as well review it.  If you like tower defense games with interesting stories and well written characters, get this.			"

There's a real sense of accomplishment when you finally beat that super-hard level on the highest difficulty.

												A delightful indie gem, Defender's Quest combines some of the funniest writing I've seen in a game with a terrific twist on tower defence. The campaign is cleverly designed. Each battle has four difficulty levels. You can push through the storyline on a low level, and indeed you need to at the early stages. However, there is plenty of incentive to come back and try it again for special items, experience and rewards. Battles are short and varied so there is not really a sense of grinding; indeed, it is interesting to come back with new options through skills and classes.There is plenty of scope for strategy in the battles. There are six different classes, each having different skills and attributes which can be levelled up. They can be boosted during the battle, and can be recalled and replaced. There can be incredibly tense moments late in a battle when a powerful enemy is closing in and you have to frantically recall fighters to put them into better positions. The ability to pause or slow time means that success depends on your strategy, not your reflexes. The variety of battle maps and enemies make for a different experience in each battle. There are genuine laugh-out-loud moments throughout the campaign, which adds to the pleasurable experience of progressing through it.The New Game+ is the finest example of this mode that I've ever seen. It's not just another run through the campaign at higher difficulty, it actually adds side quests, wonderfully-written journal entries and other bonus to make it well worth playing through again.In short, I highly recommend this game. It's one of the best I've ever played.			"

The ""towers"" you summon are actual characters that level up, learn new abilities, equip items, and apply stat points. The difficulty is definitely challenging, but worth it.

												If you like tower defense games, this one is one of the best. The layout of the game makes it easy both mass up towers or to just play with only a few towers and still win the game. While there is no option to advance the different waves, the difficulty of levels often makes you want to find ways to stop new waves from spawning. The RPG elements included in this game do not take away alot from a traditional tower defense game, but actually add a bit more strategy elements into the game. Like most games based around a story line, replaying the game usually ends up with you skipping the story elements in the game (yes, there is a skip button!) but I would strongly suggest reading the game+ version of the story as there are more plot twists and interesting parts in that story line than the orginal story line. While the game might not be worth the 15 dollar price they are asking for, get it on sale and you will not stop playing it. "

												Both the gameplay and story are fairly good and would be able to hold their own, but together, it becomes something else. Something awesome. The whole is definately more than the sum of the two parts.+ Well written story, very tight, no plotholes+ Strong characters, that despite fitting into their archetypes, are not cliches+ Suprisingly hilarious humor+ adjustable grinding (despite grinding being a staple of RPGs, it's nice that you can skip over it)+ useful units. No unit feels useless, they all have their part to play.+ New Game+ has a ton of new content, both story and gameplay that can set you up for hours more- The cut scene art takes a little getting used toOnce in game, read the directions and tips. They are actually very helpful.			"

												Defender's Quest is a solid tower defense game mashed up with classic RPG elements, a humorous story and a very well crafted progression system. XP earned from battle is used to unlock new class skills and fill out talent trees. There's a bit of depth and replayability here.I have a real craving to keep returning to title title until I earn every achievement, but with New Game+ and the challenge to beat the whole darn thing with only your base units, I unfortunately can't see that happening.9/10			"

												Defender's quest is a mix of a tower defense + rpg elements and the result is a very addictive game.You're Azra royal librarian casted into the pit because you got the plague, but for some reason you get a strange vision about a golden man and discover new powers capable of destroying revenants for good, now gathering new allies you on a search trying to get out of the pit for your freedom, but also learning why you're special.During the game you will unlock a total of 6 classes of heroes each with different pros and cons, archers low dmg but great range, knight high dmg but slow attack speed, berserker high attack speed medium dmg, ice priest area attacks with crow control skills, priest healer and buffer and dragons overally awesome.There's a total of 30 levels each can be replayed on higher difficulties for more rewards (xp or unique gear for your defenders) but doing higher difficulties requires higher leveled defenders so they can unlock/upgrade skills and passives, unlike other TD games you upgrade the hero to give him a bonus in all stats and unlock his following active skill, which requires previously to level them up outside, kind of confusing but easy to understand as soon as you can see it.There's a set of really hard achievements such as get 180 gold stars without buying generic heroes, reaching wave 100 on endless challenge, and killing a extremely overpowered sheep.Once you beat the game newgame+ gets unlocked, tougher waves, newer gear, 7 side quests which some of them add a lot to the plot, journal logs after every level for more detailed lore about Azra's thoughs about everything than been happening, and items to upgrade the unique gear obtained from doing 3 star levels in normal play, can switch back and forth between both styles at will.Highly recommended even at full price, good TD system and interesting storyline with some (a lot) of funny scenes, i even played 4 hours on a row without even realizing.

												Once you've played one or two tower defenses, you've played them all, right? YES. Well, almost completely yes.I hate this genre with a passion. I enjoyed those first one or two tower defenses I've played, and I'm consistently disappointed with every successive iteration that there is basically no variation whatsoever, especially given how crowded the genre has been. I think it's to do with tower defenses being easy to make, in terms of design, programming, and graphics, so that a lamentably successful game can be made on a dime.However, I do have to give this one game a recommendation. As much as I dislike the genre, this one definitely feels fresher. It blends significant RPG elements into the usual formula. Firstly, it has an engaging story, with plenty of humour and quirky characters. The levels support the story, including the occasional boss fight. Your ""towers"" are in fact your party members, belonging to six classes, who gain experience from encounters and level up to gain additional skills, or hone their own skills further. This allows for plenty of variation amongst your party, although I found myself sticking to a single formula for each of my types.The gameplay itself is not typical of tower defense. There's no placing your people so that they block enemies; they must be placed on the sidelines of a preset path. Also, there isn't an emphasis on placing more and more towers to increase the length of the gauntlet. Although you can place all 36 members of your party in a level, doing so is generally not recommended, because it is far more efficient to simply upgrade the party members you have. The end result is a far more sparse tower defense game, one that greatly favours tactical placement, and consequently, can be fun for the most jaded tower defense anti-fan.I also appreciated the difficulty system, whereby you can choose from three difficulty settings when playing each level (and a fourth that doesn't exactly count, for casual gamers). You can also come back and play the level on a higher difficulty setting, with different enemy types and levels, to get greater rewards (like unique items). It really added to the longevity of the game. Add in some challenges to complete, and you well and truly get your $15 worth.So, for the first time, I have played a tower defense that has left me wanting more! I'm keeping an eye out on Defender's Quest 2, which is currently in development. If you too are as jaded as I am, don't instantly discount this one. Give the demo a try.			"

												A delightful indie gem, Defender's Quest combines some of the funniest writing I've seen in a game with a terrific twist on tower defence. The campaign is cleverly designed. Each battle has four difficulty levels. You can push through the storyline on a low level, and indeed you need to at the early stages. However, there is plenty of incentive to come back and try it again for special items, experience and rewards. Battles are short and varied so there is not really a sense of grinding; indeed, it is interesting to come back with new options through skills and classes.There is plenty of scope for strategy in the battles. There are six different classes, each having different skills and attributes which can be levelled up. They can be boosted during the battle, and can be recalled and replaced. There can be incredibly tense moments late in a battle when a powerful enemy is closing in and you have to frantically recall fighters to put them into better positions. The ability to pause or slow time means that success depends on your strategy, not your reflexes. The variety of battle maps and enemies make for a different experience in each battle. There are genuine laugh-out-loud moments throughout the campaign, which adds to the pleasurable experience of progressing through it.The New Game+ is the finest example of this mode that I've ever seen. It's not just another run through the campaign at higher difficulty, it actually adds side quests, wonderfully-written journal entries and other bonus to make it well worth playing through again.In short, I highly recommend this game. It's one of the best I've ever played.			"

												This is precisely how tower defense RPGs should be done. Your progression and choices actually matter, but there's always room to go back and correct your mistakes. There's a real sense of accomplishment when you finally beat that super-hard level on the highest difficulty.

												One of the hidden gems of Steam right now.  Coming from a guy whose never really understood the interest people have in tower defense games, this game is just flat out fun.  The story is decent, characters are a little obnoxious but interesting, and everything about it is just so darn likable.  The combination of RGP, Stratedgy, and tower defense elements is something I personally hadn't seen done before, or at least not so well, and works better then it has any right to.  While the main game is relatively short, the amount of extra stuff to do and see in new game+ is a testament to just how much post-release work the developers have expended on this game.  Defender's Quest is an unquestionable labor of love and it really shows.  I picked this up on a the cheap during a steam sale and loved it so much I bought another for a friend and pre-ordered the sequel.Is this the best game I ever played, probably not, but was it great experience, definitely.

												Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is an RPG/Tower Defense hybrid. At first, wasn't sure how well the genres would mix. Now, I can say they mix well, at least for this game. It reminds me a lot of Shining Force meets tower defense with realtime combat. The storyline is great, and not overbearing. I enjoyed reading the cutscenes quite a bit. Good sense of humor put into the game as well. I have not beat it yet, so this is based on what I have seen a few hours in.Positives- Great writing/story. Enough character development to understand the story and the role you play in it. At the same time, not necessary if you just want to skip to the tower defense part (though it is worth reading, I assure you).- Decent variety of tower/class types to choose from. You can choose if you want to specialize in a particular type of defender rather than being forced to use them all. Like most tower defense games, you will want some variety though.- Many quality of life features such as individual settings to save for each defender, prompts asking if you want to place defenders in the same place as last time when repeating a map, quick sell options when upgrading equipment, dialogue skip buttons, and many more. The developers were very considerate of our time to include efficient options.- Good replay value. Can go back to the maps you have done before to grind or to try a more challenging version for better rewards.- Well composed music. The music assets are very fitting and relaxing. A great addition to an already entertaining game.- Very robust controls. Clear usable keyboard shortcuts for almost all functions. Many different time controls to slow down or speed up combat to a pace you are comfortable with. And of course, with the ability to pause.- Permanent gear and skill upgrades for the defenders. As opposed to many tower defense games, there are progression elements that will stick with your defenders between maps. Buying/earning better weapons that will stay with your defender until you upgrade helps this feel more RPGish. Skills can be retrained for a reasonable cost of in game coin.Negatives (To be honest, there are not many negative points for this game in my opinion)- Lacking in character customization. While I realize the game is telling a story, I would have liked the ability to choose the gender of the main character. Perhaps if the campaign is completed, there will be something after that for the end game. Not sure.- On the matter of customization, I would have liked to do more than just change the colors of the defenders. Hair styles, a few different faces, nothing major.- Not enough variety in character drawings. This one is a bit nit-picky, but I am struggling to find complaints :p The only time you really see the character drawings in a form that matters is in the cutscenes. The problem with that is the same stances and reaction drawings are recycled throughout the game. I would have liked to see a bit more unique drawings for varying situations.- While the music is a great asset to the game, it does not repeat or transition cleanly in some cases.- Some of the skill progressions at low level seem a little lackluster. For example, a 2% chance to bleed targets per hit feels a bit useless when many of these things die relatively quick. I would prefer either high chance or guaranteed trigger with low or weakened effects to balance it. Granted, I am sure these abilities work well on bosses and larger enemies.TL;DRA great game with a mix of RPG and Tower Defense elements. Excellent musical scores, and a good storyline to boot. Well worth picking up at full price or on sale. I highly recommend this game.			"

												What a surprise this little indie game was!To sum it up: it is an RPGish Tower Defense game, with great story, great difficulty curve, hours of play, good music, nice humor... all in all, one of the best TD ever, periodThere are so many great and new features in this game: the RPG part is not to be overlooked, since your towers are characters that you encounter, befriend, explore the past... and upgrade like a tower! The scenario is very well thought and written (I laughed with some characters jokes, and got annoyed by some others), there are SO MANY levels, SO MANY items to buy, and it is SO HARD to finish the game on Hard mode (I gave up, I have no time in this short life) or find the secret side paths (I KNOW there are some dammit!).No seriously, I had NO expectations for that little game, but wow! I was impressed. I DO recommend and I look forward to this studio's next game!			"

												Tower defense with rpg elements... that sounds... curious if not insane doesnt it? And yet if its possible at all to pull it off, defenders quest did it in a non cringeworthy, astonishing way.Personally, im greatly against mixing genres just in order to appeal more potential customer groups. More often than not, these crossovers result in shallow, trash experience. Yet from time to time, games like this one pop up where every part of the game is as its supposed to be, while at the same time, they still manage to blend perfectly.If for absolutely nothing else, you have to praise defender's quest for the execution. Its something that seeks its equal.If you are into tower def games. GET IT. Highly recommended.			"

This game, however, feels fresh and original, adding the necessary spark to bring life to it's gameplay. Here the defense elements are integral to the story, the progress, and the action.

												Verdict: A wonderful take on the often stale Tower Defence genre, with light RPG elements, solid gameplay, excellent art and soundtrack and a simple but endearing story. 8/10Story: The story is simple and humour-orientated, but endearing and, at times, surprisingly engaging given that is delivered through static art cut-scenes and text speech bubbles. The characters are distinctive, fun and memorable. 7/10Gameplay:  The gameplay is solid Tower Defence with light RPG elements. You equip and level up your heroes, which you place as towers to fight off the waves of encroaching enemies. Placement is key, such as placing your ice mages a good distance from your fire-breathing dragons as their abilities will counteract one another, or ensuring your knights will be able to shatter the enemy armour before your archers rain down their arrows for maximum impact. 9/10Graphics: Simple, pixelated graphics are stylistic and get the job done but have been done better elsewhere. Sprites look good, environments are dull and a bit repetitive. The cut-scene art is fantastic. 6/10Sound/Music: The sound effects are basic and appropriate to the pixelated presentation. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is superb. 8/10			"

												This game mixes the Tower Defense genre with RPG elements.The gameplay is like a normal Tower defense: you must protect something from the enemies that comes from some paths. The  ""towers"" are berserkes, archers, dragons and more. You get the first new unit for free, which is a character that interfieres in the story, and then you can recruit more. Each character has his own level, and with levels you can teach him more skills. You can (and should) also buy them equipment.Ingame you can level up these units so they can do more damage and use more skills. Your main character can use spells to help your units, so you can attack enemies actively, heal the allies, etc. All of this is not free, of course you need resources.I can't talk too much about story because I'm skipping most of the dialogs, but it is not crap. The characters are good (one of them, Slak, is a ♥♥♥♥ing god).The difficulty... well, I can't say too much, because if you get stuck on one level you can beat previous levels on a higher difficulty level to level up your characters.I really recommend this game to people who like tower defenses.

												Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is perhaps the best tower defense game I ever played. It introduces new enemies and heroes (turrets) at a comfortable and accessible rate, so you never get swamped or overwhelmed, and with 3 difficulty levels for each stage, there is plenty of replayability and opportunity to level up your team.Every unit and enemy has visible health, damage, range, bonuses and stats readily available for you, such that there is no information or mechanics hidden from the player. You even have complete control over the timing, being able to pause the game to micromanage, or play at various speeds from 0.25x to 16x game speed.The in-game world has enough charm, and the characters enough personality and depth, to drive the story and the gameplay progression.I say tower defense, but there are also plenty of RPG elements, such as buying and upgrading weapons and armor, upgrading abilities, and even naming your recruits and heroes, and customising the colour of your recruits' clothing. Naming your knights after King Arthurs' Court of Camelot, for example, or your Mages after your favourite magical girls, lends tremendously to immersion.The performance is excellence on almost anything. I get around 40fps on an old dual core Thinkpad at 1152x648, thanks to the native C++ engine and the game's 2D nature.A staple of any tower defense library. I hardly can wait for the sequel._____________________________Note: I have played through this game several times before the Deluxe upgrade, when it still used the Adobe Air framework, (if I recall correctly,) which was bothersome to install on Linux, and had a resolution cap of 800x600 and a framerate cap of 30fps. The Deluxe HD upgrade allows 60fps gameplay at almost arbitrary resolutions.			"

												Fun game, if somewhat limited and repetitive after a while. The undercurrent of humor makes reading the story particularly engaging, and the battle tactics, while somewhat simple, are still deep enough to be well worth checking out.If you need more challenge, there is an achievement for running through the game with no generic troops that makes you think more about optimal placement. New game plus adds some side stories, but they are in addition to playing the whole game again. Still, it was interesting to see all of that.Also, the recent graphical upgrade makes it look much more smooth, and that's always nice.Haven't played much since that to see what else they might have added, so there may be more to like than what I've mentioned.

												I bought this one because I remember playing it as a website's free flash game and I had very good memories of it. This game makes a perfect mix between Tower Defense (something I love) and RPG (which is a 'meh' to me). Defender's Quest may look like a 10 minutes casual game but it's not. It has an incredibly long story and it's full of challenges. You have a great control over difficulty in this game as each stage has 4 levels of difficulty, which also makes this game very replayable, as you'll need future gained strength to beat the 4th level of past stages.Despite of my lack of interest in RPG, the mix with Tower Defense is so good and balanced that I really enjoyed that part. You can have your very own and custom gameplay, as you plan your own team, choose how they evolve and choose the gear they equip.Defender's Quest is a great tactical game, it gives you a lot of freedom to test different strategies and it can give you different gameplay experiences based on your own choices and it doesn't get repetitive, something that is easily found in any other Tower Defense game.Gonchito approves this! (Yeah, I'm so great that I speak about me in third person).			"

												At first glance, this is a decent TD.Each map has dificulty scaling from brain-dead-easy to challenging-enough-to-keep-you-on-your-toes all the way to so-hard-you-will-have-to-come-back-once-you-have-leveled-up-more.The story is more engaging than many RPGs and shows great humor.The achievements are a decent mix of ""collect as you go"" and ""work hard to get this"".The upgrading and customization of your ""towers"" adds a lot of strategic depth which is only hightened by the weapons and armor you buy/upgrade.And then you finish the game and find out that there are achievements to play with just the story dependant heroes (Hero Mode). And the challenge increases by a factor of 7.And then you finish the game doing Hero Mode and find out about New Game +That's where the game really shines. Because not only is there a whole lot more story, greater challenge in all the previous maps, more achievements AND extra maps... there is also Hero Mode +And then there are all the bonus maps...The game is bursting with content, oozing challenge out of every pixel and spurting out humor.No. Don't wait for a sale. This is not a game you MIGHT want, it is a game you can't NOT have.PS: There is also a sequel coming. Oh, and a free HD version for everyone who has the game.These are the kinds of devs you support.

												An excellent tower defense game that's very fun to play. The story is engrossing and well written and it has a nice difficulty curve. It also sports the best new game + modes I've ever played. I plan to buy the sequel to this day 1, and I plan to play the awesome free HD update that this game is getting from beggining to end. I'm hard pressed to think of any part about this game I didn't like. It can be a bit grindy but that's only if you decide you want to try to beat all of the difficulties in 1 sitting. For those of you who like to slap a game into hardmode from the getgo I guess I'd advise you to stay away because hard mode will kick you in the nuts, light you on fire, and then throw you out the window unless your characters are ready for it.Great game from an awesome indie dev team.

												This is a tower defense/RPG hybrid where your towers and home base are all characters that level up between battles, giving you points to spend on stats and extra abilities. No tower mazing is involved, and there are enemies that can attack your towers, necessitating armor, dodge, and healing abilities in addition to strong damage output, slowing attacks, buffs, debuffs, and knockback. Defender's Quest succeeds in blending tower defense and RPG gameplay thanks to strong design on many levels.pros:+ core gameplay is fun -- character and enemy design are good and placing/upgrading your characters always feels strategic+ excellent balance and tuning with multiple difficulty settings+ the interface is intuitive and well-designed+ there is a good amount of content in the game+ graphics may not be fancy, but they're attractive enough and nothing is an eyesore+ good soundtrack and SFX, although more length and variety in level music would be nice+ somewhat engaging but not overly distracting story with effective world-buildingcons:- weak customization: although there are many global spells and character upgrades to choose from, there's rarely more than one viable choice for top effectiveness.- the comedy in the game, while quite funny in its own right, is very silly and can clash with the dramatic aspects of the writing, hurting immersion and undercutting character development (looking at you Slak)Overall, this game is a real gem and I highly recommend it.

												I usually prefer to wait until I finish a game before I review it (barring episodic games but even then I finish the episodes that are available THEN review) but I enjoyed this game so much I figured I'd might as well review even before I finished it -- especially since it seems like there's so much to do! First of all, I'm not normally a tower defense fan; I actually picked up Defender's Quest as part of a Humble Bundle female protagonists deal. I don't even remember why I decided to try the game on a whim but I'm SO glad I did. The story is interesting and, even better, funny. There's tons of really good characters and the devs have done a good job of creating a story that walks the line between silly and serious pretty well. In terms of the gameplay, like I said -- I don't particularly enjoy tower defense, mostly because the ones I've played previous to this have all seemed far too complicated to be worth the time and effort. Prior to Defender's Quest, the game that I've enjoyed the most in the genre was Plants vs. Zombies. Defender's Quest is a step above that, really, because DQ actually attempts to have a story and character development, though the basic goals of the two games are the same. I'd say DQ is a little bit tougher than PvZ, if only because there's a lot more variability in the maps, whereas PvQ was a fairly straight-forward flat plain. DQ offers maps with multiple enemy spawn points (three is the most I've seen so far), different terrain (e.g., water vs. land), and various restrictions in routes for enemies (and placement for allies). I especially enjoyed the way you can change battle speed to slow down -- or pause -- the enemies spawning to catch up or speed up (4X is amazing) if you're sure your allies can handle the enemies without much management. It's a nice mix that I liked, because I prefer to micro-manage at the start, rather than during the battle. Even better is the different battle difficulty settings, so you can go back and replay battles on a harder setting (same map, different enemies) PLUS bonus challenges and (so the achievements would suggest) a new game plus mode -- means there's tons of stuff to do. Playing DQ actually makes me want to go out and find similar tower  defense games to play because I enjoyed this one so much -- which is probably the best compliment I can give a game!			"

												There are tower defense games, and then there is this game.  Typical tower defenses are simple romps through forgettable waves and stages but when you attach a fleshed out game with a complete story and your standard RPG elements, you find yourself enjoying this one.

												This game is quite a treat. I love its art style and combat mechanics. Its a refreashing take on the Tower defense genre with some fun rpg elements mixed in. You name you heros, level them, and find new equipment for them. Then these heros are used in a tower defense acting in place of the towers. The combat is like Final Fantasy Crystal Defenders.The conversations are quite amusing and the story thus far has been pretty entertaining and is keeping me hooked and wanting to learn more. I also love puns so this game gets points there.There are two big complaints I have for the title though. The biggest is that you have to run it at a fixed resolution in windowed mode. The window is so small it could very well fit on an 8"" tablet. This means playing for an extended period will likely hurt your eyes. I really wish I could make the game bigger without having to use fullscreen. The second complaint is the sound. It gets very bad when you have a healer and ice hero on the field. Especially a 4x speed. I would recommend turning the sound off and either listening to the in game music or playing your own. There is not voice acting so you wont be missing anything.			"

												Here it is almost 4 years later and we're about to get a HD remake and then the sequel. This game still holds up as one of the best tower defense games of all time. It's got RPG elements like leveling, skills and equipment alongside an engaging and entertaining story. There's plenty of depth and content and with the upcoming HD remake I'm looking forward to playing through it all over again. The graphics still look alright despite the age, there's a certain charm to the cutscenes and art style in general. This is going to change once the HD remake comes out but it will still be there as an option for those who want it. The music's good and everything in general is really good. There are a multitude of difficulty customization options and even challenges for achievements or in game rewards, such as never hiring anyone and running through the game with only the story characters (which is really hard) and then running through it again on New Game+ with these same people and getting all the levels beaten on all difficulties (which is almost impossible). There's so many strategies and options available that you will be playing this many many times.			"

												An original approach to story design and a nice take on tower defense, Defender's Quest places you in the role of Azra, a librarian who gets epic powers to fight the otherwise invulnerable undead.The story has been designed from the ground up: taking the game mechanics of upgradable towers who gain experience to become stronger (""like an RPG""), a story to fit the mechanics has been devised. Quite like when you were presented with the task of making up a story and including certain words or characters, only Level Up Labs made a game out of that. The benefit is mostly avoiding pitfalls growing out of weird game mechanics. IMHO, while the story did not blow my mind it is still very fine and the result works quite well.So, like any tower defense, you defend a place from creeps that have different stats and abilities by placing ""towers"". In this they're game characters who have their own class and the associated, developable skills, i.e. attacks, buffs and debuffs. Azra summons them up and places them into the labyrinth in suitable locations. Every character is useful and has their role: to spell it out no one works as an instakill device against everything. The enemies always follow shortest path towards Azra, so you can plan accordingly even when some enemies can swim. Finally, if the troops fail, you can beat the horde back with spells. Everything uses kills for money.On the world map, you move along a linear path that sometimes diverges for sidequests. Every space is either a level with attacking waves of enemies or a town where you can buy weapons and armor and recruit troops. Story advances in every space so you're never bored unless getting stuck in a difficult level. That does not happen often, for the easy levels are really easy and you can even go to casual difficulty and/or set experience and money gain to 3x normal for faster leveling up without any penalty. You do get better rewards for higher difficulties, and to master a level it has to be beaten on extreme: this always rewards you with a special item granting the incentive for beating them all, if the associated achievement won't do it alone. You can also return to beat the levels again after you've grown in strength.When the levels run out, there are several ""challenge"" levels to beat, two of which are of endless type with ever-so stronger incoming waves. After beating the game you can also give it another go with NG+ that is more difficult with monsters getting additional special abilities. NG+ also adds several additional sidequests and its own version of the challenges.While the flash graphics aren't eye candy, the music is engaging and the residing mechanics will let you enjoy the game for several tens of hours. However, trying to beat every level perfectly can become tedious, for the levels get tougher and tougher as you advance. Typing this, I've yet to beat the last few levels on extreme. Still, I would heartily recommend the game for tower defense fans: I sure got a blast with it. I especially recommend going for the Hero Mode+ challenge (and to lesser extent the Hero Mode++).			"

												this game has bad artthe rest is AWESOME. story is good. gameplay is solid. if i were to describe the gameplay its something like an rpg, except the combat has been replaced by tower-defence. each character you meet that joins your army can be placed down on the map, then it will attack with whichever move is off cooldown at the time. it speaks for itself that you have to place these ""towers"" in an tactical superior way, so they help each other kill the revenants (zombie type mobs with a variety of mechanics such as, but not limited to, attacking back, being able to swim,..).RPG:despite this being part rpg this does not contain any ""choice"" as regards to storyline (except maybe 1, though its very clear which one is superior). you do get to pick traits out of trait trees and make every character unique in its fighting style. also you can equip all your characters with weapons and armor (except the last kind, though you will understand when you get there). different weapons do no have different boons, the more expensive ones simply do more damage. same goes for armor, the more money it costs the more defense it gives. the customizability is in the trait system, definitely not the equipment system.tower defense:each tower is unique, and at the end of every match you get xp and perhaps a trait point (lvl up) to decide how you want to build it. you can improve your tower during the match though, with the match currency called spi, this will give him/her access to more moves. you can not block paths, or build any kind of obstruction to make the mobs change course. this is one of the tower defense mechanics that is missing (can't have it all).overall i would have gladly payed the full price for this game. it took me 20 hours to finish one playthrough 100%, and a short dabble in the new game+ feature. that is less then 1 euro per hour.played it on a windows 7 ultimate laptop, 3.3Ghz, 8GB ram, 3GB nvidia gpu with only 2 crashes, and very rarely some fps drop.

Every second you spend reading this review is a second you could've been playing this game.  Stop reading and buy this game!  Did you buy it yet?  Why are you still reading?  Go!  Buy!  Play!			"

												A highly-recommended tower-alike game where the difficulty ranges from ""cakewalk through the game to see the ending(s)"" to ""oh my god, son, you gotta grind some more"" (protip to everyone - turn XP gain to 300% in the menu, just trust me, it's helpful and if you intend to play over Basic difficulty for more gear/do the ""plot characters only"" achievements you'll want this). Has an astounding new game plus feature with almost as much care put into the difficulty balance, adding sidequests, a new gear tweaking system, and a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ move or twelve in endgame. You also get spells to control the flow of the battle more, a half-speed option for tougher segments or micromanagement if you prefer, and none of this will ruin your sweet, sweet achievements in any way. Game wants you to play it, not get stuck in place for weeks on end.Top 3 of its genre, guaranteed, and I only say top 3 because I know some people disagree with me on what the other two'd be. (for what it's worth I put this above Defense Grid, but I thought Defense Grid blew compared to Sol Survivor and its multiplayer).			"

												If you love tower defence game, you will not regret picking this one up. So ok yes it only has fixed path maps, but it just does them so well, and with the character skill trees it really does vary it up just enough. The game does have a few problems imo but honestly I didnt even really notice them till I was well into new game + cause I was having such a great time with it.  So yes the skill trees could have been mapped diffrently, yes there could have been more map variety, yes weapons & armor were really really vanilla, yes there was soooooo much room for spell variety, yes there was so much more dialog and story your left wanting in the end. But in spite of these flaws the game completly shines over them. And to me did it in an endearing, charming way that really made me fall in love with it. It really left me just wanting more of it (which made me squee when I heard there making a DQ2)But at $15 us it would have been worth every penny, let alone the $5 I got it for. I just cant recomend this one enough for td fans. I will even go so far as to say its a must have for td buffs.			"

												This is a great tower defense game with lots or RPG elements included.  Instead of towers, you have heroes you position along a path to defend your leader.  As these heroes fight, they level up and can be built into different styles of tower depending on the skills you take.Pros- Lots of good tower defense gameplay- Lots of well done RPG elements so you can modify each hero and personalize your play style- Good story and interesting characters- Lots of great items to equip to make your heroes (towers) even more effective- The game rewards replay of older levels on higher difficulties by giving your heroes (towers) more experience and the ability to unlock special items- Lots of replay value with all the difficulty levels and all the things that can be unlocked.- Challenging maps that sometimes require you to think outside your normal setups.Cons- Older graphics- Gameplay can be repetative if you're just interested in the storyOverall this is a great game that I would highly recommend to an RPG or tower defense enthusiast. The game gives you the option of both relaxed gameplay and very challening maps if you want them.  (It also rewards your party for completing said maps.)			"

												I'm just going to say it--this is the best tower defense game on Steam.  No, really.  It has RPG elements and will make you a completionist whether you already are one or not.  2-D graphics, a simple playstyle, but very challenging.  You beat it once and you're thinking, ""Oh, that's cool, I beat the game..."" and then New Game Plus comes up and it is DIFFERENT than the first game.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game and if you own it and are sitting on it, stop it.  Play it and then buy a copy for a friend.  One more time:  THE. BEST. TOWER DEFENSE. ON. STEAM.			"

												A qualified upvote == ""Tower defense"" games tend to be too similar to each other and that is this game's chief fault.  You can increase the difficulty but there's not a lot of real strategy.  5 troop types and overpowered range troops make the game a cakewalk in 90% of the scenarios.  There's virtually nothing new or surprising about the gameplay.  The humor and simple story line were consistently amusing though.  Bottomline?  If you like tower defense games, you'll like this one too.  A 7/10 game.			"

												This game was amazing back when I first got it for cheap cheap from a Steam coupon. I saw it was a tower defense game, and I said to myself, ""This is only a few bucks, I'll try it out."" Oh my, I didn't know how much I would love this game.Defender's Quest is a tower defense game with RPG elements, mainly experience points, skill trees, and a good story inbetween the gameplay. It the game has humor, which is rather welcome. The gameplay is where this game really shines.This is simply the best tower defense game I've ever played. You may have played a tower defense game before, but you haven't played Defender's Quest. It has a lot of depth to its gameplay, it has a very intuitive UI and an unobtrusive tutorial that is very helpful. Tutorial can be turned off entirely in the options, if you really want to. While you're at it, you can increase the experience and gold you get from the game to make it easier, or crash it into the ground and make the game harder. The music fits the game's atmosphere perfectly. I haven't even mentioned that you can mod every aspect of this game yet. Go look in the workshop; the creators of the game made a free sci-fi version of the game just to show you how much flexibility there is in regular modding.Everything I've mentioned was made better with the recent update. I recommend this game wholeheartedly. 10/10.			"

												Never thought RPG and Tower defence genre could have a great cross-bred like this!Like any other TD games out there, your main mission is prevent any enimies from reaching the party leader standing at the end of the road. The horde which is consist of a few types of zombies, slug-like creatures,... keeps coming in pre-defined routes. In fact, there's nothing quite unique in the mechanic of TD in this game.However, the true gem lies in the RPG aspect of the game. What's a TD game without towers? Nah, your towers now are replaced by class-based characters ranging from a psychopath to a cute dragon. Many elements of RPG genre are brought into the game like skill tree, equipments and again, classes. Trouble with fast moving creeps, you have an Ice Mage to counter, or facing heavy armor zombies with the might of a Paladin.Not every maps are so hard, but you still need to grind a little for exp and especially epic items. (well, not really that epic but atleast they have purple titles)To be honest, you can't expect a long and heart-touching story with dozens of play time for such a small game like this, but for almost 3 hours so far I'm quite satisfied. Finally, thanks jatan11t/GAR for this lovely gift :)			"

												This is a super addictive tower defense game.  Take on the role of a Librarian who is thought to contract the plague and tossed into ""the pit"" a canyon seperated from the rest of civilization where plague victims spend the rest of their days.  She takes on a mysterious power that allowes her and people she connects to mentally the ability to completely destroy the undead revenant that the plague victims become.  Like other tower defense games you need to protect the goal from hordes of invading enemies with units or towers that you place along the pathways to destroy the enemies.  However, unlike other games, this one has a story, and your characters stay with you, level up and grow along side your main unit.  This game comes complete with mod support from the devs so that you can change things in a seperate module as you like if you want a more/less challenging playthrough, as well as letting you change character designs and spell effects. 8/10 will play again.

												I forgot I had this game and I am ashamed that I forgot I had it. I had a lot of fun playing this before, as I did just now, but it is late. I feel it deserves my thumbs up. I'll tell ya why.You are a lady who finds people to join you and help out as the story progresses. The story is quite nice. The people are funny and will often make jokes and claim that they hate the hero, when really they don't.The actual gameplay itself is typical of most tower defense. You have a grid where you place your units (the 'people' that joined you), and they fight when something is near. What I like about this game is that the different types of units work together. I won't go into any detail about this because you'll probably want to experience it yourself.Each level is split up into four difficulties. So if you're feeling brave, you can try the hardest. Even if you fail your units will still gain experience points. If you're feeling like a wuss, try the casual setting.The units have skill trees which you apply 1 point on each level up. I find this to be very rewarding, although sometimes when you complete a level you may have to apply a buncha points (I had to apply about 20 before after one level). C'est la vie.It is well worth the whatever I paid for it. I don't remember buying it, but I am very glad I did. You'll not be disappointed if you're a fan of tower defense games with a hint of humour and a nice storyline.			"

Combining the tower defense & RPG qualities is done perfectly with a fairly balanced level up system & an excellent & fairly deep story line that gets you interested in the characters & the story & gives you hours & hours of tower defense + RPG goodness.  Even more hours if you are a completionest & want to redo the levels on the harder modes.

This deep and vast place was supposed to be her graveyard but instead, on the brink of death she learns of her new powers and purpose. Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten  is a tower defense mixed with RPG elements. It features a decent story spiced with funny dialogue between party members (unfortunately not voice acted). There's quite a few maps and the new game+ along with endless mode brings a whole lot of content to the table. It's also worth keeping in mind that the game gets really, really hard towards the end of the ng+ playthrough even with end game gear and abilities.Highly recommended for those who enjoy tower defenses.

The game does feel a bit under polished and the graphics are dated, but it does not subtract from the core gameplay.  The first playthrough of the game is alot of fun and when you complete it there is an option for NEW game +.  When reaching the higher levels i found it a little monotonous to level up your heroes but not a huge issue.  I'm looking forward to Defender's quest 2.			"

												Pros+ Fun tower defense game with great gameplay+ Can adjust difficulty+ Amusing dialogue+ Can customize units+ New game + adds new features that provide replay valueCons- Graphics are unimpressive- Music is repetitive- Cut scenes look like they were made in MS Paint- If you want the achievements, you can't utilize the unit customizationOverall score: 8/10Defender's Quest is a great tower defense game for fans of the genre. It is the only tower defense game I can think of that has a decent plot, which I think adds to the game's charm. You can also adjust the game's difficulty without any penalty. (300% gold and EXP is very useful when you need to grind.) I also like how I can name and customize my units. So many tower defense games have you fill the screen with identical units, so it's nice to create an army of unique people.I'm not very picky when it comes to graphics, but I think the game could really use better graphics and music. It's not a deal-breaker, but it does take away from game to some extent. Also, I like playing for achievements, but some of the game's achievements prevent you from using one of using one of the game's best features; namely, you can't utilize the unit customization since recruitable units are not Hero Units. I think that's a disappointment, but this is only a problem if you actually care about achievements.Overall, Defender's Quest is a fun tower defense game that has lots of charm. If you enjoy tower defense games, I'd definitely recommend Defender's Quest for some classic tower defense gameplay.			"

												I wrote a review for this about a year or so ago but thought I'd rewrite it as I have some different and new views on the game.First off, this is a tower defense game that revolves around a well written story with a nicely done narrative that includes all the who/what/when/where/why questions, along with moments of subtle humor and despair. On the first play through you get all the character dialogue that propels the story but not a whole lot more. On the second play through you get the main character's (Azra unless otherwise named) thoughts after each mission is completed. These journal entries go pretty in-depth for being subtext you don't even need to go through. There are some 30 entries and I do recommend reading them.The game starts with the Azra wondering where the hell she is and finding the first warrior, Slak, entering into a battle against the Revenant (the dead). The story progresses and you will find all the other characters (read 'towers'). There are six others you find and you can have up to six of them in that class, in total allowing you to have an army of 36 towers and Azra.The Berserker is a hack 'n' slash guy. He wields a sword, wears no shirt, and thirsts for blood.The Ranger is your snarky and quick witted bow expert. She often griefs Azra on menial things such as, ""not being pretty enough to have her plans work out.""The Healer comes off as overprotective and cautious but holds the team together.The Ice Mage is cold and has cynical tendencies but wields the power to stop hordes of foes.The Knight is rightous and pledges himself to Azra. He takes down the strongest enemies by ripping them of their armor.The Dragon is the last to join the group. She acts like a god and thinks the humans beneath her yet is impressed at how far Azra and her companions have traveled thus far. She also enjoys eating sheep.With these characters you can create varying strategies on every battlefield in the game. Some will require a near exact positioning that you'll figure out by trial and error, while others are more liberal in placement. You can pull off a ton of combos though and it's cool to find something that synergizes well.Now, along with all the characters, each has a skill branch (not tree since there are only two directions it goes) and with each level you get one point to put in each skill slot. Most of them are damage boosts for their attack tier (each character has a five tier attack that is upgraded through Psi that is earned by killing enemies in the level) and the rest are passive buffs. They can include skill cooldowns, range, crit/poison/bleed/blind/armor piercing chance, slow/stun/burn, group damage amplifiers and tagging enemies so they take more damage.Azra also has six spells she can upgrade. There are three damage and three buff spells. A direct lightning attack, an area of effect crystal explosion, and a full screen flame attack. The buffs are sending your characters into a frenzy to increase attack speed, massive healing, and pushing back waves of enemies. There are also unlockable spell books that can be equipped to provide boosts.There are three weapons in game that two classes can use. Swords for the Berserker and Knight, a bow for the Ranger, and staffs for the Healer and Ice Mage. Progressing through the story increases the price and damage of future weapons. Armor can be equipped to them as well, heavy and light variants. The max level each member can achieve is 60 so you won't be able to max every skill on each character. The good thing about having multiple in a class means that you can have someone with a high bleed chance, and give the other person the higher armor piercing chance. At any point you can pay a small fee of scrap (currency) to respec their builds.So that's the gist of the game. Pretty straight forward. Where things really get rolling are on the new game +. Much more challenging and rewarding. A new currency of ""skulls"" becomes used to upgrade the special weapons and armors you aquire through missions. It's pretty hard to get all the skulls as you'll need to grind to get your characters to a high enough level to beat the much harder than before levels. There are also a few puzzles hidden here and there that you need to keep an eye out for. I had some trouble with it and found a guide and without it there would've never been a way I'd have caught on.All in all, more than your run of the mill tower defense game, great story, fun and unique characters, scaling rewards that only get better and better through all the challenges, and tons of replayability as there is mod support. Oh, if you really want a challenge, there's an achievement to beat the game and new game + with only the original characters, not using any of the extra hired ones. And then getting 180 stars (awarded through level completion). That took a ton of time.			"

												A refreshing take on the tower defense genre. By adding some RPG elements to the mix and a quirky and upbeat storyline, along with charming and cleverly designed characters, every moment of this game feels tactical and enjoyable. There are also several degrees of difficulty to add as much replayability as you might want.			"

Retro 90's pixel art style, mixed with a ton of options and depth, mixed with a huge pile of scaling difficulty replay, mixed with a ton of clever scenarios and an overall mix of 'tower' people which allows alot of personalization and gives a ton of room for different play styles to all succeed.  So, yeah, if you like defense games, just get it, play it, enjoy its quirky story and characters, but stay for the *almost* never ending replayability			"

One of the rare gems of a game that gives you exactly what you would want & hope for from a game like this.  Combining the tower defense & RPG qualities is done perfectly with a fairly balanced level up system & an excellent & fairly deep story line that gets you interested in the characters & the story & gives you hours & hours of tower defense + RPG goodness.  Even more hours if you are a completionest & want to redo the levels on the harder modes.  If you like this type of game, this is one of the few that really deliver & you cant go wrong with this game.  A solid 9.5/10.			"

												As a person who started his TD career in WC2/SC i'd say this is some of the most fun I have had playing a tower defense game. Instead of using Towers you call forth allies to your astral plane (Current Map) to help defend yourself from Revenent's (The bad guys). There are several different Allies to choose from and each ally can be specifically tailored for any given purpose. There is a suprising amount of depth involved in deciding where to place your unused talent points. Each character is Namable and has cosmetic customizable options. Naming a Character after yourself makes you want to use that character which is alot of fun to role play. If your into that sort of thing.The town's have places to recruit new allies and buy new weapon and armor. The map plays out alot like Mario World or the equivalent and you can go back and beat older levels on harder diff's to get better gear and level. There is also a storyline written by some type of Wrinting/English major and the writing isn't too terrible. Some if it will give you a laugh and some will just make you scratch your head. But all in all this game is a lot of fun and is definitely worth the little money asked.-Casey			"

												As a fan of tower defense games, I play a lot of them.  This is one of my favourites.  Excellently presented, it feels sort of like a classic RPG in tower defense form.  Units have basic skill trees, and can be upgraded by leveling up or equipping gear.  Various overarching abilities and perks can be used by Azra (the main character) in the heat of battle as well.The story is also quite interesting, and didn't feel like it was just tacked on to the gameplay; both aspects are very well realized.  I highly recommend this one for fans of the genre.			"

												Don't be turned off by the graphics of this game.  It really is something special.  It's lane defense, pure and simple, but it does this so well, making it an rpg where all your towers can level up and improve through skill trees unique to them.  The graphics are a bit primitive, and the story cut scenes might turn some people off, but give it a chance.  The story is what sold me, as it's incredibly funny without having to go through the self aware brand of humor.  It's just really well written, with great jokes and comedic timing.  The gameplay is very satisfying and there's a lot of things to do, thanks to new game plus and challenge modes.  You can even tweak how fast your characters level in order to speed your game along.  I cannot recommend this enough because it's just fun and gives you so many options for play.  There's even an option to increase game speed to make those usually slow lane defense games super fast, for either convenience or increased difficulty.  Wonderful little title.			"

As for longevity, there is a new game+ mode that adds new side quests involving a completely new story line! There is plenty of incentive to go back and replay levels at harder difficulties because the rewards are improved and there are different enemies, which can drastically change how a level plays.

												I know there are a ton of tower defense games out there... and even a few that propose to add RPG-like elements.  Defender's quest is different, and different good.  The game strikes that perfect balance by replacing the ""towers"" with NPCs.  The difficulty ramp-up is near perfect for a game and gives you as much challenge as you want without subjecting you to any levels where you fall off a difficulty cliff.  If something's just a little too hard, or you're trying to get a better result?  Level up your guys or buy them beter equipment.Yes, the game runs at a fixed resolution and no, the cutscenes (which tell an engrossing tale) are done with limited animation, but that's really OK.   The limitations don't detract from the game and you can tell all of the love and time and effort went into perfecting gameplay and giving you plenty of it.  If you're lukewarm on tower defense because you don't like the repetition, this game's for you.  If you're a die-hard TD fanatic, this game's for you.  Accessible, perfect ramp-up, plenty of content, and a story.  Definitely this game is one to get.			"

												Defender's Quest starts off as a pretty simple tower defence game with a goofy fantasy story and basic presentation, but then you start getting deeper into the game, unlock all the character classes and upgrade your characters more, and you find that there is actually a ton of depth and playability here. What's more, it never loses its intuitive and elegant design as it becomes more mechanically complex, and the game does a fine job of presenting you with a tough challenge but essentially giving you all the tools you need to overcome said challenge. Success is not determined simply by grinding to level up your characters, but rather by finding a way to better manage your resources until you find the optimal way to succeed.This was one of my sleeper hits from 2013, and it's one of my favourite tower defence games on Steam, up there with Defence Grid: The Awakening and Plants vs. Zombies. It's a great starter tower defence game and introduces less experienced players to its mechanics in a very manageable way, but it also provides the depth and strategy that you just won't get from most of the free flash-based TD games you can find online. It's a fresh take on the genre and its very well executed...just don't expect to be too engaged by the cutscenes and character interactions that break up the combat missions. They're occasionally funny, but often rote and unnecessarily long. But that's just about my only criticism of the game - everything else is rock-solid.			"

												Puzzle Quest (the original one, at least) was an excellent hybrid of a fantasy RPG and a ""Bejeweled"" puzzle game. Defender's Quest is an excellent hybrid of a fantasy RPG and a tower defense game. I found the RPG elements and the story/premise of DQ to be well incorporated into its tower defense game-play, perhaps even more so than it was in PQ's ""Bejeweled"" game-play. The artwork in PQ was a little better than it is DQ, but DQ's artwork is stylistically well implemented and is arranged organically, especially in the maps/stages. If you love RPG's and tower defense games, or even if you love one and merely like the other, this is a great game to get - especially when considering how cheap it's going for, on Steam.			"

												I only played it for a couple of hours, and I have to say that I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME! IMO the best tower-defense game that is out there, with a little twist. You don't have any actual 'towers', you have characters, who gain xp, level up, you equip them with weapons and armor, and manage their skill trees. There is 5 difficulty level for every encounter and there is also a game+ mode if you finish the game, which means a lot of replay value :)This game wasn't even on my wishlist. If it weren't for the -90% steam sale,I would totally miss this gem. And I am already awaiting the sequel...			"

												This is one of my favourite tower defense games to date. Having your ""towers"" be unique characters that individually equip items and level up adds a surprising amount of depth and customization to the game. It seems so simple, but it's a huge improvement over the generic towers of most games in the tower defense genre. Also, the game does a really good job of letting players dictate how difficult they want the game to be, and provides a good number of incentives to replay levels at harder difficulties (including powerful unique items). More games need to learn from this; let players decide how they want to play!Add to that terrific targeting options for towers, fast-paced gameplay, steam workshop support, and even some nice music, and I am very impressed by this game. Highly recommended.			"

There is plenty of incentive to go back and replay levels at harder difficulties because the rewards are improved and there are different enemies, which can drastically change how a level plays. Seriously, this game is great value at full price and a steal if you ever see it on sale. If you like this genre, just buy it already!			"

												I know there are a ton of tower defense games out there... and even a few that propose to add RPG-like elements.  Defender's quest is different, and different good.  The game strikes that perfect balance by replacing the ""towers"" with NPCs.  The difficulty ramp-up is near perfect for a game and gives you as much challenge as you want without subjecting you to any levels where you fall off a difficulty cliff.  If something's just a little too hard, or you're trying to get a better result?  Level up your guys or buy them beter equipment.Yes, the game runs at a fixed resolution and no, the cutscenes (which tell an engrossing tale) are done with limited animation, but that's really OK.   The limitations don't detract from the game and you can tell all of the love and time and effort went into perfecting gameplay and giving you plenty of it.  If you're lukewarm on tower defense because you don't like the repetition, this game's for you.  If you're a die-hard TD fanatic, this game's for you.  Accessible, perfect ramp-up, plenty of content, and a story.  Definitely this game is one to get.			"

												This game really surprised me, I thought it was gonna be yet another meh tower defense game, but it's way better. You can gear up your defenders, find amazing items by completing the previous levels on harder difficulty, level up and place skills points to each of your defenders, recruit, shop, etc...The cons: Not that many different enemy types (around 20 maybe?), pretty standard graphics, memory leaks and low fps issues (you have to restart the game each 2 hours or so if you don't want an eventual crash...)The replay value of the game is not the best, but completing the entire game with 4 stars on every levels will take you at least 20 hours. The game took me over 35 hours to get 100% achievements.Also the game has a very funny comic style story. I suggest getting this if you're into tower defense games and even if you're new to the genre!			"

												This is one of my favourite tower defense games to date. Having your ""towers"" be unique characters that individually equip items and level up adds a surprising amount of depth and customization to the game. It seems so simple, but it's a huge improvement over the generic towers of most games in the tower defense genre. Also, the game does a really good job of letting players dictate how difficult they want the game to be, and provides a good number of incentives to replay levels at harder difficulties (including powerful unique items). More games need to learn from this; let players decide how they want to play!Add to that terrific targeting options for towers, fast-paced gameplay, steam workshop support, and even some nice music, and I am very impressed by this game. Highly recommended.			"

												As a person who started his TD career in WC2/SC i'd say this is some of the most fun I have had playing a tower defense game. Instead of using Towers you call forth allies to your astral plane (Current Map) to help defend yourself from Revenent's (The bad guys). There are several different Allies to choose from and each ally can be specifically tailored for any given purpose. There is a suprising amount of depth involved in deciding where to place your unused talent points. Each character is Namable and has cosmetic customizable options. Naming a Character after yourself makes you want to use that character which is alot of fun to role play. If your into that sort of thing.The town's have places to recruit new allies and buy new weapon and armor. The map plays out alot like Mario World or the equivalent and you can go back and beat older levels on harder diff's to get better gear and level. There is also a storyline written by some type of Wrinting/English major and the writing isn't too terrible. Some if it will give you a laugh and some will just make you scratch your head. But all in all this game is a lot of fun and is definitely worth the little money asked.-Casey			"

												Don't be turned off by the graphics of this game.  It really is something special.  It's lane defense, pure and simple, but it does this so well, making it an rpg where all your towers can level up and improve through skill trees unique to them.  The graphics are a bit primitive, and the story cut scenes might turn some people off, but give it a chance.  The story is what sold me, as it's incredibly funny without having to go through the self aware brand of humor.  It's just really well written, with great jokes and comedic timing.  The gameplay is very satisfying and there's a lot of things to do, thanks to new game plus and challenge modes.  You can even tweak how fast your characters level in order to speed your game along.  I cannot recommend this enough because it's just fun and gives you so many options for play.  There's even an option to increase game speed to make those usually slow lane defense games super fast, for either convenience or increased difficulty.  Wonderful little title.			"

												Tied in my mind with Defense Grid for best tower-defense game to date. Where Defense Grid's strength is the perfect distillation of the tower-defense formula, Defender's Quest remains toe-to-toe with it because of how it radically adapts the basic idea of tower-defense -- deploying stationary defenses along a path or series of paths -- to work with a highly original fantasy setting and a set of solid RPG-like mechanics. The presentation, while not sophisticated, is incredibly appealing, and the writing is nothing short of superb.  It's also endlessly replayable, and the New Game + mode actually gives you a reason to do so.Highly recommended to everyone, tower-defense fans and non-fans alike.  As with Defense Grid, If you're a fan, you will like this; if you're not already, this stands a good chance of converting you, and if it doesn't, then you never have to wonder about another tower-defense game again, as you'll know it's just not your bag.

												A fun little tower defense with RPG elements. The protagonist is a librarian cast into a plague colony, and sets out on a quest to escape. She quickly discovers latent supernatural powers that allow others to defeat the zombified infected. She serves as the objective that must be defended. Besides the standard ability to summon units to defend her, she's also capable of casting spells for harming or buffing, and can equip spell books to further enhance her abilities.Throughout the game you'll encounter characters who join with you, unlocking new classes of characters (berserker, archer, healer, etc.) that you can hire and summon to defend you. The classes come with simple skill trees that unlock new abilities or enhance them in some way, and every individual unit can be leveled differently from the other, enabling a more diverse army to choose from.The game is made for a wide variety of skill levels. New players and seasoned veterans alike will find something to challenge them when the game gets rolling, and you can replay maps as you please for practice or for XP/money. The map's rewards are better for higher difficulty settings, and can reward unique equipment for success. The game can seem like a grindfest, but the devs wisely included the option to increase XP/money gains and to ensure all units get equal access to it, regardless of whether or not they entered battle.The story itself is very competent. The characters are largely likeable and the writing and humor is enjoyable. The cast tend to have something of an emphasis on their quirks, but mostly avoid becoming bland one notes with varying degrees of depth.The game is not without its flaws. Completionists can find that the New Game+ might become something of a chore, the skill trees are rather simple in their execution, and certain parts of the story or characters can become tiresome (looking at you, Slak). If you can put this aside, you still have a fun and funny game that's worth a look. Grab the demo and give it a spin.

												Edit, update: apparently the graphics will be getting a *free* HD update, which is exactly what I felt was missing with this game. My recomendation is to WAIT for the free HD update before playing. Go ahead and buy it now if it is on sale.Counter review to all the fanboy hype for this game, as I just bought it on sale since it looked good and I needed something to play on my mac book.This is JUST any other tower defense game. Because every tower defence game has its own unique mechanics for upgrades. The only thing this game ""blends"" is RPG lore/tropes into tower defense as a theme. This is done in that you upgrade individual towers and each tower levels up on its own. That's it. The blend is just graphical, and it does that poorly because the graphics are poorly done. I don't want to be harsh because I want to give the indie devs the benefit of the doubt in that they couldn't aquire funding/talent for aethistics, but this is worse than a free flash game I could have played instead. Another problem which just elludes to really ameature/cheap UI development is that the game cannot go into fullscreen correctly. It just remains at 800x600 and the fullscreen option simply draws a giant black box on your monitor and centers teh 800x600 game. Why couldn't they have actually developed the UI before releasing it...? Not really a pleasing game to play, way better TD games imho. A game like ""Castaway Tower Defense"" has much better graphics/UI/visual-imersion than this for example and is free.As for the writing, it is cute but not good. Some of it is just wrong regarding vocabulary which is odd since one of the selling points was that it was ""actually written by an English Major"". For example, one of the bad guys loses his entire army and complains that his forces were decimated. Just bad and confusing writing, as the verb ""to decimate"" means to reduce by 10%. This is something that the Romans would do to their own troops to instill fear into them, to punish them, and to prevent rebellion. It is not something that would happen if you lose all of your army, that would be to have been obliterated or to annihilate.			"

												This is easily the best tower defense type of game that I have ever played. The difficulty starts off quite easy and gradually adds new unit types on both offense and defense. The regular game never really gets too tough but once you start up a new game+ the gloves come off and it stops holding your hand altogether. Persistant leveling and a well written comical story seal the deal and really suck you in. Cut scenes are minimalistic but very well done.I bought this game on sale without really knowing anything about it other than it looked cool and was really cheap yet I really wish I had bought it sooner. A lot of indies get a lot of undeserved hype while this one got none that I heard of. Really fun game that everyone should own.			"

												A good RPG, a good tower defense game. Gets all the basics of both right. Worth playing, even paying full price.The only bad part is the story is kind of stupid, and tried to explain the fact it's a tower defense game in probably one of the most bizarre ways you could imagine. The story itself isn't exactly bad, but it's the typical ""you are the chosen one"".My dislike of the story is a subjective claim, however the core game play is  there.8/10Dumb story, and could have had more depth to the skill tree.

												This is an AMAZING game. It is an RPG Tower Defence. Instead of towers, you have a party of people, which are put in to 6 different classes. You only get a max of 6 of each class, so placing them on the lvls more important than other tower defence games.As a bonus, everyone in your party gets XP even if they were not put out, which makes getting those lvl 1 guys you just got up to a lvl that they can be helpful much easier. Each party member has their own lvl as well, and each class has 5 different skills they can use in total. However, when on a lvl, you must 'boost' them to get access to the high lvl skills. This, in turn, makes the game very strategic. Do you put a few of your people out, and boost them to Max at the start, or do you put more people out, and only boost them to lvl 2 or 3. If you like Tower Defence games, and are looking for a challenge, then this game is right up your ally. And, as a bonuses, the story as actually pretty dam good too. XDThere is aslo a Game + mode, witch I am yet to start, so that will be interesting when I get around to starting it.			"

												An excellent tower defense game that is traditional in all the ways I love but innovative where it counts. Instead of placing towers, you're placing party members. Like a traditional TD game, there are resource points you acquire within a round that you can spend on placing new towers (i.e. allies) or buffing the towers you've already placed. In Defender's Quest, this resource is called ""PSI"", which is essentially the ""mana"" of Azra (aka: you, the commander).  Howevever, Defender's Quest also gives you two other resources to spend BETWEEN rounds: gold and experience. Experience is used to unlock abilities on an ally's skill tree, thereby making them available to use in battle. (Each skill is assigned a power level and is not available in battle until you buff this ally to that level using PSI points.)Gold is used to hire new allies into the party or to purchase armor/weapon upgrades for individual allies, which immediately and permanently boosts their stats (i.e. unlike skill upgrades, these are conferred immediately at the start of battle---no PSI points required.)Every level can be replayed as many times as you want to farm XP and gold, and every level has multiple difficulty settings that earn you better gold/XP rewards for beating them. (There is no penalty for running away.) Beating the highest difficulty on some levels earns you a legendary weapon or armor, far more powerful than anything you'll find in shops.The only bad thing I could possibly say about the game is that the art in the cutscenes makes the game's aesthetic somewhat comparable to something you'd find on a flash portal. By flash portal standards, the artwork is amazing. By overall industry standards, the art seems a little amateur. The in-game art is pixely and SNES-tastic. I criticize only the cutscene art here. But in the end, it doesn't even really matter, because the cutscenes have no effect on gameplay, and you can even skip over them all if you like. The game itself is A+.If you like Tower Defense, it's one of the better TD games in the Steam catalogue.			"

												I believe this might be one of the best games on Steam. It's a very, very challenging tower defense type game with a really good story and fun customization that can be changed quite easily if you end up going down a path you don't like. You can name each character and customize their sprite when you get them, and i believe you can get like 12 of each of the 6 units but I'm not entirely sure because there's achievements for beating the game with only the base 6 characters that I started with right off of the bat.This game also has a pretty large amount of content and challenges for you to comeplete, and I highly doubt you'll 100% this game to be honest.

												Buy this game now.  It's an extremely solid indie title that can prove quite addicting. In addition, t's the first game I've ever played that made grinding levels fun (and I HATE grinding in video games).  Mostly this is because going back to old areas on harder difficulties means you'll be fighting different monsters, so oftentimes you'll have to drastically change your strategy to beat the same stage.  On top of that, the difficulty can be finely tuned according to your tastes and playstyle (Want faster/slower xp gains?  Less/more penalties for failing?) WHILE you're playing the game, so the game never gets boring or feels frustratingly hard.			"

												When I bought this game, I expected I was getting a mediocre game that would help me pass the time while I looked for other, more interesting games to play.  It turns out that the videos on the store page somehow make the game look a less interesting than it actually is.There's something quite satisfying about surveying each level, and positioning your troops such that different types of troops are in positions that allow them to function as efficiently as possible.  It's fun to get progressively better at optimizing what your (growing) set of troops can do.The second playthrough was a little less interesting.  You're left with either choosing to grind for experience for your troops, or to turn up the experience multiplier (which feels like cheating to me), so I can't say there's much replay value.  However, that shouldn't stop you from buying the game and playing through once, if you're so inclined.7.5/10. "

												This one is a soft recommendation for meDefender's Quest is an interesting twist on the tower defense paradigm. This time, your ""towers"", are RPG heroes you're summoning on the battle field. This makes for a much more interesting story, with many characters voicing their opinions on what you're doing (usually to complain about it :p). The story itself isn't revolutionary, but it's servicable.Unfortunately, by making the game an hybrid of TD and RPG, Defender's Quest brings with it the bad aspects of RPG. Mostly, the grind. There will be times where you're facing a level which you simply can't win because your characters/towers aren't levelled up enough. So you will have to grind by doing other stuff (like replaying levels on a harder difficulty) before coming back. It's even more notable and grindy when you're trying to keep your adventuring party small, like the games encourages you to do (by raising recruitement prices, but also having some achievements that only unlock if you never expand your roster).Another problem with the small roster is that in many levels, there are some optimal positions to place your 5 or 6 people, and then you're pretty much done, you fast forward to see your team hacking and slashing away for several minutes until the level is done. There are some levels where you will more active, with your main character having to use its spells, and you having to replace some of your team in better places. But on the whole, it's a rather static tower defense, since you have limited number of people, an enticement to bunch them together (for increased efficiency) and a limited mana pool to summon.All that bad stuff being said, Defender's Quest is still way better than most tower defense. The writing is good, the levels are interesting and you can always stop at any point. The main game is pretty easy to finish, while the main game plus will offer a bigger challenge, but also new items, additional missions and optional quests to keep it fresh, and reward you for staying with the game. So on the whole while i wouldn't classify Defender's Quest as one of my favorite games, it does get a soft recommendation from me.			"

The story itself isn't revolutionary, but it's servicable.Unfortunately, by making the game an hybrid of TD and RPG, Defender's Quest brings with it the bad aspects of RPG. Mostly, the grind. There will be times where you're facing a level which you simply can't win because your characters/towers aren't levelled up enough. So you will have to grind by doing other stuff (like replaying levels on a harder difficulty) before coming back. It's even more notable and grindy when you're trying to keep your adventuring party small, like the games encourages you to do (by raising recruitement prices, but also having some achievements that only unlock if you never expand your roster).Another problem with the small roster is that in many levels, there are some optimal positions to place your 5 or 6 people, and then you're pretty much done, you fast forward to see your team hacking and slashing away for several minutes until the level is done. There are some levels where you will more active, with your main character having to use its spells, and you having to replace some of your team in better places. But on the whole, it's a rather static tower defense, since you have limited number of people, an enticement to bunch them together (for increased efficiency) and a limited mana pool to summon.All that bad stuff being said, Defender's Quest is still way better than most tower defense. The writing is good, the levels are interesting and you can always stop at any point. The main game is pretty easy to finish, while the main game plus will offer a bigger challenge, but also new items, additional missions and optional quests to keep it fresh, and reward you for staying with the game. So on the whole while i wouldn't classify Defender's Quest as one of my favorite games, it does get a soft recommendation from me.			"

Place them strategically in missions and boost their power to be more effective.The Steam version now includes New Game+ to take your party back through the game to face harder challenges and stronger enemies.  Endless mode lets you see how many waves you can survive.The story that links the missions together is boosted by a good sense of humour.			"

												Let me start by saying one thing: I don’t like TDs. Too many of them revolve around mechanics I consider boring, such as interest, and generally, they don’t offer much beyond the core, basic gameplay expected from the genre. With that out of the way, I’ll try to explain how Defender’s Quest won me over.It’s impossible not to mention the fantastic writing present in the game: The story is overall serious, but the script makes no commitment to sounding mature or gritty. To the contrary: while some may argue the cast is composed of very standard archetypes, it’s still highly varied, and the humorous exchanges between the characters are a joy to see. Ironically, it’s their likability that makes the story much easier to care about, not presentation or “visceral” experiences. Take notes, games industry.While I’m at it, the soundtrack is also a very strong point, and is included in the game’s folder for free. Plot and music are hardly all the game has to offer, though. As I said, I don’t like TDs and what impresses me the most about Defender’s Quest is how it carefully avoids annoying mechanics I’ve come to associate with the genre.In this game, you don’t have to worry about insane resource management (interest) or fast finger movement (since you can pause mid-wave). It’s only about character loadout and positioning. That doesn’t mean it’s easy, but that it’s the right kind of hard. That it offers depth.Going through the game should take you about five hours, but that can increase tenfold if you try to finish all level variations and challenges. For me, it clocked at just over sixty hours, and was definitely worth its price. I can recommend it to anyone looking for a twist on the traditional TD formula.			"

												This title is a quite interesting option for the Tower Defense genre. Besides having a simple and intuitive gameplay, it also has some nice graphics, a good soundtrack and also a decent story which helps with the game's immersion. Throughout the adventure you're gonna have the chance to upgrade your characters, which is something that I always thought that it was much better than just coming up with something new right away. As for the replay value, you may feel tempted to unlock some other achievements even after you're through with the main story, which is something nice, I guess. Just to finish, this is another option that offers the players trading cards, so if you're a fan of the genre, go ahead and give it a try.			"

												Hands down one of the most fun tower defense games i have played, the rpg element to it isn't too complex but its plenty enough to keep you playing and doing old missions to level up and earn scraps which is the money inside the game, which eventually becomes a non-factor if you play a mission more then once for each one, but if you just blow through the game things will be much more difficult as is any rpg game. The game stays challenging throughout the entire game with choosing 2-3star diffculities for each mission, and boss encounters on higher difficulties can be gruesome, unless of course you out level it.I have no complaints, aside from wishing there was dlc for more content, but i hear they are in the process of making a sequel so i am excited for that.

												Yes. 10/10 would buy again.This is a example of a good tower defense game coupled with an actual story. While one could argue that the graphics are low tier and would fit more as a flashgame it deserved its placed on the steam market. Why you ask? Everything fits in the big picture. There is not a single thing that seems out of place. It's a well thought out game no plot holes to fill only loot to get.I enjoyed playing it, revisited earlier locations to achieve my 100% on certain maps. I still didnt complete the whole game 100% because you can actually increase the game speed by a certain amount and sometimes on really busy maps the game crashes. Mostly near the end of the mission which makes it even more unforgiving.You will get your moneys worth of tower defense, the occasional chuckle during dialogues and the fullfilling feeling of the 100% hunt.

												An excellent tower defense game that is traditional in all the ways I love but innovative where it counts. Instead of placing towers, you're placing party members. Like a traditional TD game, there are resource points you acquire within a round that you can spend on placing new towers (i.e. allies) or buffing the towers you've already placed. In Defender's Quest, this resource is called ""PSI"", which is essentially the ""mana"" of Azra (aka: you, the commander).  Howevever, Defender's Quest also gives you two other resources to spend BETWEEN rounds: gold and experience. Experience is used to unlock abilities on an ally's skill tree, thereby making them available to use in battle. (Each skill is assigned a power level and is not available in battle until you buff this ally to that level using PSI points.)Gold is used to hire new allies into the party or to purchase armor/weapon upgrades for individual allies, which immediately and permanently boosts their stats (i.e. unlike skill upgrades, these are conferred immediately at the start of battle---no PSI points required.)Every level can be replayed as many times as you want to farm XP and gold, and every level has multiple difficulty settings that earn you better gold/XP rewards for beating them. (There is no penalty for running away.) Beating the highest difficulty on some levels earns you a legendary weapon or armor, far more powerful than anything you'll find in shops.The only bad thing I could possibly say about the game is that the art in the cutscenes makes the game's aesthetic somewhat comparable to something you'd find on a flash portal. By flash portal standards, the artwork is amazing. By overall industry standards, the art seems a little amateur. The in-game art is pixely and SNES-tastic. I criticize only the cutscene art here. But in the end, it doesn't even really matter, because the cutscenes have no effect on gameplay, and you can even skip over them all if you like. The game itself is A+.If you like Tower Defense, it's one of the better TD games in the Steam catalogue.			"

												There isn't much that hasn't already been said about this game, so I'm not going to write a super long review.DQ:VF is a very fun Tower Defense-RPG hybrid game.  I bought it with hesitation, very unsure of if I'd like it or not.  It's loads of fun, the story seems good so far, the characters are detailed with their own histories and little quips they say to each other, sometimes humorous.  The gameplay itself works like most TD games except you place heroes that act as your towers, and they can level up and learn new active/passive skills.  Outside of battle you can also equip them with different gear to give them better offense/defense.I got this game after they came out with the Deluxe edition (mainly upgraded visuals) and I'm glad I did.  I'm sort of a visual person, and I like what I'm playing to be pretty and polished.  I'm not sure I would have enjoyed the Standard version as much, but this free visual upgrade to Deluxe is awesome and well done.According to their website the devs have already started working on a DA:VF 2 and I'm pretty excited about it.  I'll definitely look into it as more info is released and most likely buy it.This is one of the best TD/RPG hybrids I've ever played.  The gameplay is light and fun, and you can tell they put a LOT of time into the story and characters.8-9/10 Would highly recommend.			"

												Tower Defense meets RPG, for real.Many games try to combine different genres yet few does as good a job as Defender's Quest. If you like Tower Defense games and are looking for something new to mix up what is becoming a stale and tired formula, this game is right up your alley. While allowing you to build your characters in the way that you want, customizing your 'towers' becomes a pleasure rather than a chore. The clever use of characters to perform as your towers is a fun way to almost get to know the defenders that you're using, and the story, something that most tower defense games shirk is actually quite amusing. Give it a try if you're wondering what it is about, this game delivers a lot of bang for your buck, offering hours and hours of replayability. The New Game+ feature completely mixes up the challenges so that even when you beat the game you're just getting started.			"

												Basic Graphics, reasonable plot, 6 varieties of towers to play with and 6 spells to help you win.It's not multibranching plot, but does have a New Game+ for expanded replayability. It's not got so many different towers you get confused. It's just simple tower defence and some unique characters.Overall a good game, but not one for much in the way of depth if that's what you're looking for in a game.			"

The highest settings DAMN thats a real challenge for real i read they are making a second game i cant wait for it. new game+ here i come :D			"

												Seriously greatness. It combines what is addictive about Tower Defense games, with my favorite parts of Class based Dungeons esque Party systems. I love skill trees from my MMO side, and there is a great amount of flexibility on the difficulty scale. Small learning curve. I've played it non-stop since I bought it, kind of game I can play for 3 hours, then jump back to whenever.TL;DR Buy the game, you won't regret it.			"

												Seeing how the game was flash based and not too heavy on visual details, I was skeptical about this game. I usually compare tower defense and flash to something on Kongregate, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. Its a Tower-Defense RPG hybrid where your 'towers' level up as you progress through the maps. Each stage has extra difficulties to come back to for additional challenge and rewards through unique armor or weapons that you can give to your teammates. You can change the AI for targeting, which comes in handy during challenge stages and boss fights. When you're done with the game, you can also replay the game with New Game+ and unlock your previous team (while facing minions with new abilities, and unlocking unique item powers). The story isn't anything new, but the characters are engaging enough to let that slide. The music isn't anything to write home about, but it strays from being too annoying like most flash looped music (the title screen being the exception).  If you like Tower Defense games, Defender's Quest is polished in the right places and worth the weight, especially on sale.			"

												Tower defense is not at all my jam, but Defender's Quest adds enough other stuff (and pulls of the defense part painlessly enough) that I've ended up really liking it. I'm only about halfway through, but, well, I was only expecting to dip my toes into it when I launched it today, and instead it ate up most of my evening.Essentially it's tower defense game with RPG mechanics and a story. Like, a proper story, that gives most RPGs a run for the their money.  That and the RPG mechanics give an attachment to your characters (who act as the ""towers""), and a sense of progression, that make this game so much more than most tower defense games. The game seems to reward focusing on a small but powerful party, and I just find ""making my friends way better at murder"" more rewarding than ""build a bunch of catapults."" Also, it's pretty funny.There are a few problems; the art for the cutscenes is pretty bad (although the pixel art in battle is pretty charming.) Some of the humor falls flat or, more often, breaks character. And adding the pointless subtitle didn't make the name any less generic. Still, it's overall a fun and addicting experience.			"

												Defender's Quest is a great fusion of Tower Defense and RPG. The approach to fusing those two (sub)genres is unique and done well. Primarily a tower defense game, I would recommend this to people who like that genre, definitley - and to people who apathetic toward tower defense games due to the RPG elements that make the game stand out from other tower defense games.However, if you just HATE tower defense games, then it's probably not for you. BUT you never know...there's always the possibility of ""the game"" that opens you up to a genre...To summarize, it's an awesome game. I started playing it way back when it was in alpha testing and watching the game progress from - a really good game then, to a polished great game. I give it 10 bags of popcorn ...and 2 kit-kat bars. </obscure reference>			"

												As far as tower defense games go, I normally play them a little bit and then grow board of them. That was not the case with Defender's Quest. I've found myself unknowingly playing for hours. As with all TD games, you raise your heroes, while managing your resources. After battle, you gain EXP which levels your heroes up and scrap (gold) to buy equipment to make them even stronger.You can easily choose to play with an army (up to 6 of each hero) or you can play with only the main hero from each class for an extra challenge. For those who dislike grinding for exp and gold, you will be pleased to know they have included an option to boost the exp and gold gain by 300%.I highly suggest this game if you enjoy TD games.

												Great game, if you can look passed the old fashioned graphics.Graphics style is dated back pre-Playstation (between NES and SNES).The gameplay is pretty recent, with a leveling system of your ""towers"" (defenders) that has talent trees. If a level is too easy or too hard, then you can just set the difficulty or adjust the handicaps to your liking.I hadn't heard any voice acting yet, it's all text style like those old school games, so do expect that.I honestly didn't think I would like this game very much, but I'm glad I bought it.

												This game has some interesting features to set it apart from other tower defense games, however it is so badly balanced that I cannot recommend it. About an hour into the game the difficilty ramps up so much that you are forced to go back and play levels you've already finished and play them repeatedly to grind enough xp and money to upgrade enough to be able to finish the new levels. If this one thing was fixed it would be a definite ""recommend"" from me.			"

												An enjoyable tower defense game with RPG elements.  (Characters level up and have skill trees that carry over, although you can reassign points for a fee.) The need to ""gold star"" everything keeps this game replayable for quite a long time, and there's a challenge to complete the game in its hard mode without the many generic units you can hire, making the game extremely difficult at times. (In fact, functionally impossible at the hardest versions of some levels. Fortunately, you don't need 100% completion for those.) The game is also pausable, for those who find some tower defense games too frantic to enjoy.  There are some points where you really need to set the game to slow-mo and pump out the spells you get as their cooldowns time out just to cling to life for another wave, though.  It can, however, chug when you get to very high levels, and have INSANE numbers of effects going on at once.  I've also had it crash from a memory overflow from having too many sprites on the field in one of the ""endless"" maps where they just send infinite units your way.  Beyond that one flaw, (which you can avoid by just not trying to play the endless mode truly endlessly,) it's a great game.  I highly recommend.			"

												At first I was not 100% sure about buying or passing mostly owing to the simple art style and the fact its a tower defense which are a dime a dozen now days, however after looking at reviews and seeing some high praise and checking the forms and seeing active Dev's interacting with the community decided to give it a try.The first thing I met was a user agreement which is fairly common now days however unlike others I actually read it was very simple and easy to understand made a nice impression and told me about their attention to detail before even accessing the first screen of the game, this attention to detail was further proven once within the game the customization in just the options menu alone warrants this game being noticeable, I can't say if you will find it worth your money but if you have a few bucks burning a hole in your pocket or see this on sale (well worth full price in my opinion) grab it.This game and its Developers are like a Unicorn in this day and age they clearly care about their players and the product itself Will be keeping a eye out for future releases from them.If you have any doubts look at a few of the stickied threads to see the developers love for the community and the game, and notice that to date there are 377 Positive reveiws and only two negative :P			"

												Are you looking for an old school RPG mixed with tower defence? ... No?... well you should because this game is awesome! Witty story mixed with fun combat, Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten will be the cause of taking you away from socialising for many hours. From the start where you have only one berserker defender who is about as inappropriate as a fat guy in a speedo... to the ending where you have a multitude of dragons who for some reason look like they are grinning at me in some kind of sneaky/pedo like fashion .  You will be entertained by the dialogue and the awesomeness of slaughtering more enemies than you can shake a stick at. Pick it up for $1.45 on the steam sale and you will not be upset.			"

												First off, I do recommend this game when it drops to around 5 bucks at most. I picked this game up on sale. At 15 dollars, no, this game is not worth it at all.This is a simple tower defense game which only occupies a few screens across the entire game. Really isn't much to it. Feels like you are playing in a room or two.The game is woefully unbalanced. For 90% of the game you can breeze by with only using Archers playing each level on it's hardest difficulty. This also means beating the game and then playing in game in it's second quest, which is just a repea of the game but harder. Problem is, the game is mostly a cakewalk until the end of the second quest where you hit this wall. And that is where the main problem is....Grinding. FOr some odd reason this game has you grinding. This game takes Tower Defense and ads the worst element from an MMO - Grinding. Now, to beat the game I have to grind the same maps over and over and over, jsut to beat the final few levels.Overall, did you find this while it had a 5 dollar price tag like I did? Buy it. It's fun up until the grinding hits. Did you find this game as it's full, overblown 15 dollar price tag? Avoid it completely.			"

												This is a very good game, if you like Tower Defenses. I got this when it was $1.49 but it is definetly worth the $15 dollar normal value. It has a VERY good story, good graphics, and fun gameplay. It is pretty fun to try to complete everything 100%, and also getting good weapons for it. All in all, it's and amazing game and you should get it.			"

[UPDATE: Less-amateur art, less-trash performance... still just a clicker.]Enjoyable at first, in the end, only tedious. No real challenge... or even tower defense.Where most tower defense makes you think about how best to place towers and what to upgrade when, this game is completely stripped of thought. You learn the optimal locations for each ""tower"" type early on, and, as evidenced by ""hero mode"", the levels are almost all designed with a choke or two that takes full advantage of a single group's optimal patterns, so most levels play like this:1. Plug one, rarely two, ""tower"" groups into obvious optimal sockets locations OPTIONAL: Spam archers2. Upgrade (Mostly whenever, you'll have plenty of 'power'.)3. WINThe ""RPG"" side certainly gives math nerds something to obsess over, but it's similarly simplistic:1. Level up!2. Damage +1 OPTIONAL: Reset points at any time, because you somehow screwed that upThat's it. You want your healers to heal, of course, (skip Holy Light completely) and to take advantage of each ""tower's"" secondary effects, (armor break, chill, bleed, range, light/blind, devour) but for the most part, you'll just have to decide which usually low-end skill or two to neglect. Usually the lowest. You can safely ignore most defensive skills. (The actual numbers are utterly pointless because adequate info to calculate DPS and some secondary interactions aren't provided, and you learn how effective everything is by ""feel""/sight same as any TD game anyways... but don't tell the math nerds!)And that's the game for you. The art is bland, the story is absurd, but occaisionally amusing. Nothing to see here. While not a ""worst game ever"", if you're out for an actually good tower defense/game, look elsewhere. You might enjoy this if you're a math nerd, part of the Number Enlargement crowd, or just want something easy and amusing to click on and only plan to throw a few hours away with it anyways. Don't expect the game to get better as it goes on, it just doesn't. It never could, because it's fundamentally flawed.[FOR OLD VERSION:] Unfortunately, I have to add: system requirements are a trollishly bad joke. The game runs in Flash/AIR and suffers from the usual ""looks like an old DOS machine could run it/practically requires a super-computer"" issues. On a less powerful CPU, it may take twice as long to get the same amount done, and you will lose input control if you button-mash the one spell you'll want to button mash. But don't worry, you'll only notice it at critical moments, and only cause you to lose your ""perfect"" completion on a couple 45 minute boss battles... before you learn. Or your RSI flares up.			"

												Defender's Quest is a Tower-Defense/RPG Hybrid (Think Final Fantasy Tactics meets Tower Defense).Defender's Quest tightly focuses on three things: tactical depth, customization, and story. That means no random encounters, no spikey-haired emo kids, no forced time sinks, and no tedious, repetitive battles.The battle system builds off of tower defense, with individual characters taking the place of towers. Each character levels-up, learns skills, and equips gear individually, allowing the player to customize their battle experience and strategy. The overall game structure is similar to ""tactical"" RPG's, but with a real-time battle system. Game speed is adjustable, and commands can even be issued while the game is paused.It also features an engaging, character-driven story written by an actual English major! The story strives to be fast-paced, snappy, and always relevant to gameplay. Events and dialogue explain things as they become relevant to the player, minimizing exposition. Finally, it's got options and accessibility settings out the wazoo, so that you can have the best possible experience!			"

												The game has me hooked, but it has severe design flaws. The game plays in a small window. Being able to tell your units what type of enemy to target is nice, but the interface looks like a Windows 3.1 era spreadsheet program. It's too easy to spend money on the wrong upgrades and then not be sure if you're playing a level wrong or you just need to grind. (I got crushed on Karsk repeatedly until I figured out that I needed to go back to the last town and buy my main ranger a bow). The interface is so sloppy that you don't even get an error message when you try to spend a skill point on something you don't have the requirements for, it just makes the normal sound but does nothing. Each character you recruit is a different class, but you can recruit additional mute copies of the class who you level up separately which is... messy. Is there any other game where ""boosts"" don't have a time limit?The two Soulcaster games did the whole ""Tower Defence where your 'towers' are people"" with better art, music, and gameplay.			"

												7/10 DQ is a tower defense game. Don't gimme that look: this one's actually unique with its own personality. DQ mixes RPG into the blend as well with character trees, equipment, and classes. Your ""party members"" serve as your towers. The story is pretty good; a lot better than most games of this genre. The writing is awesome and there's a lot to do/see.  Combat is fun, but there's no depth to it. Once you get gear and the basics, you snowball from half way onward, plowing through everything near-effortlessly. The game also suffers bizarre frame drops. Seeing that this game's graphics are 16+ bit, it's inexcusable to have to compensate for input lag on such an undemanding game.  The price is also a bit high. If you can find it on sale, definately pick up DQ!			"

												Defender's Quest is a case study in covering your weaknesses and emphasizing your strengths. Shoddy writing? A beautiful ""skip"" button in every cutscene and dialogue can be turned off. Difficulty? If you hit a brick wall in story mode you can go back and do slightly harder versions of prior maps to level up. Tower diversity? Unique equipment means your second Berserker probably won't be as good as your first, so it's harder to spam one tower. The slog of New Game+ not going fast enough? Triple experience is an option in the menus. All this lets you focus on the core tower defense game, which is best played at 4X speed.Plenty of weaknesses can't be worked around, though. Workshop mods are few in number, and the first one I tried locked up the game in the first level. Character level is too huge a factor in whether you pass a level or not, meaning few maps feel appropriately scaled to your level at any given time. The game has a fixed resolution, even in fullscreen, and in fullscreen Steam notifications will leave artifacts on the screen. It's a little too easy to fall into a ""two of each"" mentality, setting up two identical sets of towers on the two major paths of most maps, with the only major variance between maps being what towers you level up first. The tower ""skill trees"" don't contribute much especially for those towers that only have variants of ""melee attack"" or ""shoot arrows"". For all the weaknesses I've pointed out, there are few high points in the game. The boss fights are excellent, requiring you to balance ""kill the boss faster"" against ""kill the creeps faster"". Otherwise it's the usual tower-defense game of setting up your towers and watching them slaughter thousands of zombies. The game demands enough of your attention in boosting your towers etcetera that it's not a good ""put something on in the background while you play"" game, but isn't demanding enough to be a thoughtful or engaging experience.All in all, it's hard to recommend Defender's Quest unless you're just dying for a tower defense game where you make a bunch of bars go up a la Progress Quest.

												Weak recommend. It's a flash game. A very basic tower defense game. Casual, spend a few hours at most. There's role playing elements, but it's not a central theme to the game. It's very GRINDy, where there's so many incentives to just repeat levels to level up instead of rethinking strategy. Maybe that's the crux. Tower defense games shouldn't have XP points. If the game costs more than $3, I wouldn't recommend.			"

												AFTER installing the game I got to read the EULA in which Level Up Labs reserves itself the right to collect ANY data from you (personally identifiable or not), change the privacy policy at ANY time (they just have to announce it on 'their' website without even mentioning a specific URL). There are even some terms, that are illegal in my contry, therefore the EULA is VOID here (but probably not in the US). But that won't prevent Level Up Labs from scanning your computer for any data they might be interested in, if the choose to do so.I don't know if Level Up Labs has ill intent or are just way to inexperienced to write an EULA. But as of now this is their (more or less) legal binding EULA. Therefore I refused the EULA and didn't get to play the game.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME and only buy/install it, if you DON'T care about things like like this. "

												First of all, I can’t recommend this game.After the overwhelming reviews, I was really happy to finally see another good tower defense game. What did I get, a bland, mediocre and basic game…….What are my reasons for my harsh criticism??Here are Two:1. Characters and Story, are just badly written. For instance the Berserker: he likes shoes and fighting, that’s the whole character, no real backstory, no real emotions, no nothing.......Ok no character has a real backstory in this game or any real emotional turmoil.2. The game mechanics are so basic, you have 6!!! Different types of Towers…….Equipment is uninteresting because every item is just a stat boost in the same attributes, +1 Sword, +2 Sword, for example.The skill System is ok, but it doesn’t have a big impact in fights. Sure it changes your tactics a little but it’s not a big difference. Granted DD games aren’t known for their good writing and often mechanics in these games are basic. But to give a game like this overwhelmingly good Reviews ??????? WHY ?????Its ok, its decent, on a 1-10 I would give it 5 or 6. But for God damn 14 bucks I can’t recommend buying this game!!!!! (Maybe for 2.99). "

												Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is not a game for everyone and it is certainly not a game for me. There's a whole load of Tower Defense games out there in flash and they are free. Played several of them and they are certainly better than any games than this one. There are free games that are much better. If you had paid full price of 15$ and you felt ripped-off for buying this game then I don't blame you. When I started playing, I was not happy with the art or how it looks; just a matter of preference at this point. Just by looking at the price, the visuals and the gameplay, I would put this game to a place near Towns on my list of games to steer clear. Not to the point of Bad Rats though, because that one is so bad it is funny.Bought this in 2012 for 5$ and I felt cheated. That's why I should have seen the demo or screenshots back then. I certainly understand why this review would be disliked by many. I still regret buying this game and wish there is a way to remove it from my steam list along with Towns			"

Story is OK, some nice touches of humour. Class balance is a little off, as others have mentioned, the Ranger is a tad OP compared to other classes.

												A really outstanding game. Instead oif mechanical towers your have characters who take up position to defend. Lots of upgrades, a moderately interesting story, clever maps, and decent replayability. I found this low tech looking tower defence game to be a legitimate challenge with a thoughtfully designed flow. Lots of fun, and totally worth it.			"

												Bought this on a whim based on the RPS preview of it from back in January (it also helped that is was a daily deal, but still) and it's actually a LOT better than the Steam screenshots lead on. I was pretty turned off by the art style from the get go, but the tower defense gameplay is solid (with options to make it more or less difficult with xp/gold bonuses that you can adjust) and the RPG elements are enough to allow customization across classes that are otherwise the same in most other TD games, but not a big enough focus to detract from the core TD gameplay. I've yet to beat it, but based off the forums/achievements, there's quite a bit of content to go around once you're done, too.			"

												An extremely good example of combining RPG elements with Tower Defense style game play. The game itself is inherently simple: place unit, beat back undead horde, dont get your face eaten off in the ensuing panic when one of your units dies and the mob overruns you. Still, I find this game extremely challenging and rewarding. The dialogue keeps bringing me back, and I have yet to beat new game plus, but, if you have 15 bucks to spare, pick it up, set up your minons, and enjoy.			"

												A simple to learn tower defense game with a great sense of humor, Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten has an enjoyable campaign.  Each level can be played multiple times with different difficulty settings and greater rewards for completion.  Finishing the campaign lets you play again in a harder mode that adds a few extra cut scenes to the story.  Easy to jump into and play a quick level, but hard to put down after you get started.  Highly recommended.			"

												It's like FINAL FANTASY CRYSTAL GUARDIANS, except much better, with an art and humor overlay that is highly reminiscent of John Allison's brilliant SCARY GO ROUND webcomic.

												I absolutely love Defender's Quest Valley of the Forgotten. When I read tower defence rpg I was a little lost. I have never heard of the two being combined and wondered how it could be done. The rpg side of this game is based around the story of Azra; Azra is a royal librarian who found herself in the forgotten zone - a plague ridden part of the kingdom and things went crazy. Along the way Azra met people to aid her in her journy to find out what is going on. People like Slak and khetti (names can be changed I kept them default though). the players met along your journy become your towers and placed in a standard tower defence way, slak for example is a berserker who slashes and slaughters light hp targets, and khetti is an archer. The characters are leveld up over time so the player can equip them with gear and put points into skills such as slaks flurry to hit 5 targets at once. Now back to Azra; since the game revolves around her what role does this librarian play. Well in combat you are summoned to the spirit world to kill the plague ridden posessed citizens. Azra levels up with your characters so she can cast damage spells, buffs, and heals to your people during combat. The heal is very advantagous because your people will die. . . HOWEVER they can be resummoned. To prevent deaths one of the options is to equip them with armor which can be purchased and unlocked at certain points in the game along with other mercenaries.overall I rate this game 5/5  due to the 5 dollar sale price during steam weekly sale and the unique story and combat. The game also supports the steam workshop so that you can continue the game with player made levels which I have not tried yet.For the cons of this game I have not found any but some players might be turned off by the non applicable voice acting, all of the narrating is texted out.

												Very fun little game that mixes traditional tower defense with RPG.  I've played about 5 hours so far and I've had a lot of fun with it.  I haven't finished the campaign yet so I can't comment how long it will last, but playing through earlier levels as your characters get stronger unlocks lots of cool unique items.  My only complaint so far is that the item system could be a bit more interesting.  Nonetheless, it's a unique take on an old, and often, repetitive genre.  Buy it now for only $5!4.5/5 Stars			"

New game + is excellent, as it provides a whole new challenge to the game, and side quests that flesh out the story a bit and add new abilities to the enemies, forcing you to try new strategies. Especially for the cost, this game is well worth it. Edit: Also, the story and characters are actually pretty good, and there's some great humor in there as well.			"

The gameplay is where this game shines, and deciding where to place your hero's (towers really) is all part of the fun.  You get to level up your hero's, as well as your main character to add a litte more damage or utility depending.  It's pretty fun, would wait for it to go on sale though.

												This was and is a great tower defence game. It compares to Crystal Defenders, with the addition of leveling up charectars up. For thoes not farmiliar with Crystal Defenders, you have to defend set path befors the bad guys get to the goal. You defend it with units, Archers, warriors, magicians, etc, by placing them on route so that they attack the enemy as they make their way to the goal. You can power up each of the units every battle, upon victoy you will be awarded with experiance which will level up your charectars.Highly recomended, this unique style is unique and makes the game more enjoyable.

Some levels require strategic use of only certain units, and level layouts are such that you are forced to thoughtfully place units to maximize their contribution. Item upgrades were added recently, and New Game+ mode keeps the fun going for more than twice as long as the original game. I've played this game for a long time, since before it even landed on steam, and I still haven't acquired the highest level items. I still haven't finished beating levels. I still haven't gotten my fill of this fun game.			"

												This is a retro tower defense game. It is small in file size, but big in play! I like that I can easily run it in the background while I do other things on the computer.The story progresses nicely. The characters are engaging, and I was never bored with the plot. You can complete the entire plot in a day even if you take your time. The graphics are in pixel style for the gameplay. The cut-scenes were artwork with text underneath. The art would move in response to the text moving, like reading an illustrated book. This game has nice replay value. Every site on the map has 3 levels, easy, normal, and advanced. To unlock everything, you must beat all three. There are a lot of achievements in this game, and some of them are quite difficult to get. A single level can be solved in many different ways. And, the whole game can be played in newgame+ mode, which makes beating it a second time a new challenge.Once I finished the plot, I found that I don't like to play for hours on end. The game is relaxing for me. I take my time with the higher level achievements. It's a fun, simple game and I recommend it.			"

The game is great value, sporting nifty RPG mechanics that augment the tower defense gameplay and add a layer of replayability to the game that make it a wonderful bargain.

												Very fun little game that mixes traditional tower defense with RPG.  I've played about 5 hours so far and I've had a lot of fun with it.  I haven't finished the campaign yet so I can't comment how long it will last, but playing through earlier levels as your characters get stronger unlocks lots of cool unique items.  My only complaint so far is that the item system could be a bit more interesting.  Nonetheless, it's a unique take on an old, and often, repetitive genre.  Buy it now for only $5!4.5/5 Stars			"

												Simple, inexpensive indie TD with a nice twist. Each ""tower"" is a character and levels, equips and spends skill points independently. The campaign has a nice length to it. I'm not finished, but I'm over 20 battles. Each battle also has multiple difficulties that give greater rewards, including unlocking bonus missions.The native resolution is tiny, probably 800x600 if not 640x480 and there is no way to increase it in windowed mode that I can see. Also the generic characters you make have the potential to be clones of your main heroes, each class' talent tree provides customization but (at least at low levels) leaves little advantage to stray. It would be nice if each character could learn different active skills from their brethren that share a class.There is a sequel in the works and I look forward to it. It would appear they are addressing my main issues and thensome.Bottom line, I'm enjoying this title and while I'm a sale hound, if I had paid full-price I wouldn't have been disappointed. If you are not a huge TD fan, this may leave little to desire.			"

The first playthrough isn't incredibly hard, still poses a challange at times though but if you lvl enough you can manage. But then you unlock New Game +, and yea.. that's a nice challenge! There is a level cap! But the game keeps getting harder! Strategy definetly required. I love it. Also be sure to read the dialogs, especially tak is hilarious and had me laughing out loud on several occasions.

												This excellent tower defense RPG hybrid is a great way to pass some time. The overall setting of the story is very original casting the main character in a role of being afflicted by a mysterious plague. The combat system evolves over the course of the story introducing new strategies for dispactching enemies and bosses alike. The colorful dialouge keeps the story somewhat fresh, but the real meat to this game is in the combat and preperation. Each town will have new items or characters to recruit, making the necassary arrangements before a battle are extremely neccasary for your success. The way everyone in your party level-up and the skill trees associated with there classes adds alot of depth to the character progression. Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is a great merging of genres and a complete gem to add to your game collection.			"

												I usually don't like the TD genre, and find myself quickly bored by it, but this game made me dive into it and I found myself unable to stop playing it, so I can clearly say this is one of the nicest TD games I played.Most of it comes probably to solid RPG elements. When playing it, I experience that standard warm felling of joy and encuragement for every solved level, every piece of equipment or loot won, every level upped. The story is (so far) intriguing and the writing is simple and witty. Drawn cutscenet at first second look poorly produced, but quickly you start appreciating the web-comic art and clear drawings quickly start to engage you into the story and succeed in that sometimes even better than overpriced in-engine CGI cutscenes of the AAA producted games.So yeah, I recommend it. Go try it. Won't be dissapointed.			"

												The first hour or so I couldn't decide if i liked it or not and was wodering why it had such a high positive review. But now I've put in 11 hours and can safely say it's deserving of praise. I have always loved TD's and have been playing them since way back in the WC3 BNET days. In that regards it doesn't play any different than any other TD. However, the leveling up aspect is fun. Adds a grinding element which forces you to play several levels multiple times. Which gives you the opportunity to try out new strats to keep things fresh. Has plenty of replay value and for the first time in a while i feel the desire to grind out the achievements. The story line is alright: has several funny moments but isn't amazing. I do like the concept of a story TD and this pulls it off well. It's pretty awesome, I won't lie, and I personally believe it to be worth full price. 10/10			"

This is a wonderful game. The game has a (what I refer to) pick your own challenge setting which basically consists of setting your own EXP and Scrap(Money) multiplier/%. It can be set up to 300% which is by far easy mode. The second playthrough is more fun than the first and it has great replayability in my opinion.

With it's characters/squad. leveling up, weapon/armour equipping, and heavy focus on story, it's really an RPG hybrid.It's probably the story and characters that I've enjoyed as much as anything in the game.

Simple and clever, a game of tactics and patience that quickly became addictive. I really felt a sense of achievement when I got my 100%.			"

												Great Tower Defense game with advanced targeting options for all your ""towers"". Tons of replay value with challenges and New Game+ option once you're finished the first go through. Some RPG-lite in levelling up all of your heroe. Highly recommended for anyone who loves the TD genre.			"

												A really fun take on the Tower Defense genre that blends in just the right amount of RPG elements.  The game is well-balanced so that it's challenging but rarely frustrating.  The talent trees for each class are well-designed, and the game doesn't feel ""over-balanced"" to the point that everything is homogenous and bland.  None of the classes is blatantly overpowered (eh, maybe archers) or totally useless, but there are definitely options that are stronger than others and half the fun is figuring out what works best in what situation.If I have one complaint, it's that the writing is absolutely painful.  Generick fantasy schlock mixed with cringeworthy attempts at humor.  This doesn't really drag the experience down too much, though, since the plot is perfunctory and all of the cutscenes are skippable.			"

												I've been playing games long enough to have gone through many addicting games, and now it takes the best to have such an affect anymore. This game more than delivered through its rpg, tower defense, and rather funny story combination. I couldnt not stop playing, and even if it wasn't as difficult as Dark Souls or FTL, this gem is well worth the money. After playing this i looked all over steam for a game such as this and couldn't find a one. My only negative thought is that it wasn't longer.9/10			"

												Quirky, funny (REALLY funny at times), unique, fantastically well-written, challenging and surprisingly deep, this is the kind of game that only comes from the experiments of a truly creative mind. Combining tower defence with strategy RPG works fantastically well and the plot is truly excellent (Slak is one of the most hilarious characters I've seen in YEARS). About the only flaw I can think of is the handful of balance issues (Rangers are stupid overpowered on the first playthrough, although far better balanced on replay mode) and they aren't nearly enough to affect your enjoyment. Loved it, recommend it, waiting for the sequel with anticipation.			"

												Solid Tower Defense game. The story has a great balance of serious and funny, and I found it to enhance the experience. The gameplay itself is a wonderful balance between simplicity and complexity. Elements are added at a sensible pace so that you always feel like you have a good enough handle on the situation to succeed. Also in the late game there is a high enough skill ceiling to keep it engaging for a good long time. Easily my favorite Tower Defense game.			"

												With the update, I've should update this review. With the improved looks, which was my main issue, the question is it is worth the full price now? Just about, yes. I would still recommend playing the demo.There are still issues, but I feels like they are personal issues like the the skill system is somewhat off to me. Important part, to me. So overall, a fairly good game for it price.*old review*It a good game. Why is my review not Recommended? It eleven pounds! If it was a fiver, that would be fine, but 11?It look a flash game, it play like a flash game, but you can feel the work and effort put into this game. If you pay the full price, you will feel ripped off playing it.So unless the price has gone down or it in a sale, avoid. If it in a sale putting it near that 5, buy for these guys deservse it and it a game any fan of TDs. If you are not a fan of TDs, go to kongregate, you can play the first act for free and see if you like it.			"

												This is without a doubt, the best tower defense game ever created by humankind. The story is riveting enough to hold your attention from start to finish. The characters are wonderful in their own quirky ways. The gameplay is new and exciting combining the best of two genres. I've played this game since the very first demo was released all those years ago and the new deluxe updates just make me realize how far this has gone and how well it has aged. Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is just incredible and I hope a lot of people will come to recognize it as one of the best games online. The only problem.... Defender's Quest 2 isn't out yet. Just kidding. But seriously, please get Defender's Quest 2 out soon and make it as awesome as the first and keep creating more of this. These is a good game and any other works of yours that are as good as this deserve to be recognized for their creativity.			"

												Update: I am changing my vote to ""recommend this game"".I have accepted Fox's suggestion and set XP+scrap gain to 300%. Now the game is FUN instead of being frustrating. And it is still challenging, the ""extreme"" difficulty requires some skill (and a little grinding). I think that this should have been the default setting for this game.Now I also enjoy the side quests in the ""new game+"" mode.Bottom line : recommended !Just for the record, this was my previous review:I am somewhat disappointed from this game. I really wanted to like it - it has a genuine idea (combination of tower defense + RPG) , it is not expensive (on sales often) and the developers seem to care about the customers. Also I have to admit that the cut scenes are funny.However, it is simply a grinding game. Some levels are just too difficult, no matter how clever and resourceful you are. You have to go back and play earlier levels, until you grind enough XP and money to buy a better equipment. Then the level becomes easy, and you win it no matter what tactics you use. In other words, the game rewards you not for your talent, but for the time you spend playing it.In addition, the graphics and sound are just like from the 80's. Perhaps this is the designers' intention, but I didn't like it.I would recommend this game only if you are a tower defense fanatic and only when it is on sale.			"

												Fun Tower Defense game where your towers are RPG characters that you can equip with gear and upgrade the skills of.The levels in the story line have multiple difficulty levels, which throw increasingly more high level monsters at you. Going back 5-10 levels and redoing levels at a higher difficulty is a nice way to try previous areas with a higher level party (that has more options in terms of hero/tower placement).For the low price during summer sale it is definitely worth it. I've gotten a few hours of good fun out of this. Because the levels don't take too long to finish, it's nice to play if you have 10 minutes to kill while waiting for something else.			"

												Tower Defense meets RPG, and the towers are actually characters. I love how the story supports the mechanics, and the variety of personalities and their interactions. The art is colorful and stylized but the story is surprisingly deep. While there is not much branching, there's replay value in going through the battles at higher difficulties (as the monsters change, not just tougher monsters), Hero mode where you don't recruit additional soldiers (quite a challenge on some maps), and the extended replay which adds funny journal entries and weapon upgrades. I've only scratched the surface of that last so far, but that's where I'm going next.			"

												I always had a certain fondness for tower defense. In StarCraft, I'd spend more time stacking cannons than playing the ladder, and Team Fortress 2's MvM mode reveals a certain primal fun of killing tons of heartless, unfeeling dudes. To that end, Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten presents a well-rounded, core dude-killing experience, but the cracks in the polish are evident.You're given six classes to play, all fairly standard for the genre: heavy damage, light damage, healer, ranged, status effects, and tank. Upgrade trees for each class are fleshed out for the game's length, and most powers are distinct from the moment you first receive them. Leveling up your characters before and during battle using ""Psi"" adds a certain urgency to the fight, and doesn't feel forced.But between battles there exists some friction between the player and the imperfect interface. Between the fast-forward of battle and the clunky number-comparison engine to power up your party, you'll be wishing for a patch to streamline or automate the process. You could do worse but you could do better; not even trendy not-loading-but-loading-messages like 'reticulating splines' or 'powering up the thermal core' are to be seen. You might hope to find some solace in the story, but it's just as hacked-on as the interface and I couldn't be bothered to follow it.My first playthrough entailed of spamming rangers (long-range) with the range upgrade and blew through the game without breaking a sweat, but in Hero Mode, where you limit yourself to one of each class, is where the game's difficulty felt most appropriate. Oftentimes you'll have three or four spawn points to deal with, and you'll need to consider the most optimal placement to cover all your bases, evoking the puzzle modes of yore.All in all I'm giving this a weak recommendation. The game itself is pretty solid - gameplay is mostly balanced, and it can be as hard as you want it to be. The lore isn't engaging and you won't miss much from skipping it; on the other hand, if you're the type for a story maybe tower defense wasn't going to be your cup of tea anyway. If it goes on sale again for 90% off you'll get a fun one-off to pick up and play, not unlike something you'd find on a phone or tablet. Otherwise, you may feel you aren't getting enough bang for your buck.			"

While I do love this game, I don't love it enough to pay $14.99 to play this game on Steam, I found it for sale for under $2.

												Usually not a fan of TD, but this one has enough variety (and story) to make it a nice experience.A couple of interface decisions could've been done more smoothly (e.g. travel on the map takes some time, screen transitions are slow and it would've been nice to manually save setups for a level instead of a single prompt to restore the last one, also the escape key doesn't exit modal dialogs!).But overall recommended.

												Defender's Quest is a tower defense game with RPG elements.  It has a lot of good gameplay mechanics.  As you progress through the game, you gain new types of warriors to lay down to protect your tower.  But in this case, your tower is a female librarian who can cast magic spells.  Each class of warrior has their own abilities that you gain and level up as their level increases.  With each level or map having 4 difficulty settings, you can replay them to help improve your warriors.  The game boasts an entertaining story, challenges, and a new game + feature that increases difficulty but not to the point of making it impossible.  All in all, this is one of the best tower defense games I have played and I highly recommend it.			"

												There is basically nothing bad I can say about this game; but I have squeezed a few points in the con section of my review. This is a really fun twist on the tower-defence genre with unique gameplay, fun characters and a good story - with HEAPS of replayability.PROS:- Everything works as you'd expect it to do- Many levels of complexity- Many levels of difficulty, plus expansions on the normal game with ""new-game +"" mode for extra fun- Good writing with decent jokes (and a lot of references)- Attention to detail can be seen in almost everything- Nice art-style- Character customisability via skills, weapons and armour!- Many secrets and freebies to be foundCONS:- Enemy variety is limited (but in a way that makes sense)- Can get repedative- Sometimes the ""cut-scenes"" seem more like fillers than something with actual importance in the story-telling- No multiplayer mode (it would be a nice addition; something seperate from the story mode)TLDR:If you're into tower-defence games but aren't too happy about the current popular games' offerings and wouldn't mind a twist in the genre, then this game is a MUST BUY!

												Fun, addictive game. It's mainly a tower defence game, with some leveling up elements and a decent storyline. It plays well for the first few hours, but it starts to lose steam after you finish most of the missions. I still find myself comming back to this game to get some quick fun out of it sometimes. It can be quite challenging to get 3 stars on all missions, so if you are the kind of person who has to get the ""perfect score"", expect to put many hours into this game.			"

												Definately not another tower defense game, Defender's Quest is a hybrid RPG/Tower defense, where each character acts as a ""tower"" against all sorts of evil fantasy creatures. Characters level up and can have equipment, making them feel like an investment and creating a whole metagame about building up characters as you progress through levels. Also has a cheesy storyline...however thats not its main draw. The graphics are sorta too simply to the point where there there doesn't to have an unique artistic style, however it serves its purpose. Overall, highly recommended.			"

												Update: okay, so now with the new HD edition it is possible to play full screen and all the graphics look way nicer now. A great game got even better!This game is to Tower Defense what Puzzle Quest is to Match-3 games. Basically all the ""towers"" you place are actual characters from your ""party"": beserkers, rangers, priests, etc. They level up, they can equip some stuff... it's all pretty basic but in combination with the  Tower Defense mechanics it works nicely. The writing is somewhat dry and pretty funny at times. Graphics are a bit basic, and it is not possible to play at 1920x1080. However, the characters in the cutscenes are nicely drawn. Part 2 is in the making, but until that is released you cannot really go wrong with this one.			"

I'm glad to have been proven wrong.The RPG mechanics like the continuous progression / levelling of your party / ""towers"" and managing equipment makes for a really interesting and enjoyable game with quite some depth to it.

												Wow. I did not expect to like this game as much as I did. To me, the game had an original concept, a better than decent story, and a fantastic sountrack. Despite the core of the game being a tower defense, the levels did not really ever feel repetitive, and could be replayed on higher difficulties (which required different strategies) for unique character equipment. EXP and money earned can be adjusted in the settings to make the game as grind-ey or not as you like. The characters were a little two dimensional, but I still connected with them and enjoyed the slightly-simple sense of humor. This is definitely a game I would recommend buying on a steam sale and then spending a day playing.			"

Levels never out-stayed their welcome while also providing a fair amount of replayability. Having the right setup and clearing your way through at 4x was satisfying.I've never been one to spend a lot of time on side-stuff after completing the main story though so I don't think I'll put any time into 100%'ing the game or new game+			"

The music is catchy and fitting.

There's numerous laugh-out-loud moments.I bought this game hardly knowing anything about it, simply because the developer made Super Energy Apocalypse, so I already knew this one was going to be good. And it is. I just got the game and already put almost 11 straight hours into it. Haven't beaten it yet, but that's a testiment to how captivating the gameplay is.			"
