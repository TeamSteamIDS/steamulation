												For claification sake, I've played this game since Beta and I love the overall animation and playstyle imaged as a 2D platformer. I guess this really hit a nostalgia nerve for me and my yearning for the old Mario Brothers mechanics. And while I hate to bash something I fell in love with, this is no longer the game that I use to know.Back in the early days of MapleStory, you had your 4 standard classes: Mage, Warrior, Archer, Thief. Mage and Warrior had 3 subsets each; Archer and Thief had 2 subsets. Finding equipment and hanging out with friends was easy because there was just a few servers and not that many maps. The level cap was set as a crazy 200, but the mindless grinding wasn't so bad, cause you could easily be with your friends and if you found an equip you couldn't use, one of them could and vice versa.But Maplestory grew. On the surface, you would think this is a good thing; more people = more friends = more equips. True, but Nexon saw this as an excellent opportunity to milk its players through microtransactions. As the game grew, Nexon built more servers and maps, creating virtual spacial rifts between players. It became more and more difficult to get to the same map as a friend without using a teleport rock (a microtransaction item) or wasting a bunch of time. Nexon created pets, vanity items, world transfers, shops; all for real money. When that wasn't enough, they created more character types, those who couldn't share the cash shop items with the original characters, essentially urging players to rebuy cash items. The new characters also lead to the nerfing of some of the original characters under the guise of ""improved"" for rebalancing issues. Nexon raised the level cap to 250, milking players for even longer. They created a lottery system called gachapon for in-game items using real money, not to mention special event ""lotteries"".Don't play Maplestory. It's not what it use to be. The fun is sucked out of it. Don't waste tons of time and money on it like I did.			"

												MapleStory was one of the first MMORPG titles I've had the chance of playing, besides Runescape Classic (which was a looong time ago).After a revisit of this game (after many years of on and off playing), as well as THOUSANDS of dollars spent, I cannot say I am willing to recommend this game.FIrstly, MapleStory is one of the few 2D side-scrolling MMORPGs that try to mix 'cute' and 'breathtaking' together, and at times, they do it very well. Some landscapes are huge, the original lore and locations were very well done, and one can be trapped in the game's beauty for long periods of time. Heck, even getting lost in that game was fun. However, with the changes as of the last two to three years, a lot of the beauty has been lost. In order to cater to the broader generation of players who demand instant gratification, they have changed out most of the old expansive locations and replaced them with compacted versions - so that players can traverse the world much more quickly. However, by doing so, they've stuffed all the game's content into the newer maps, which makes most of the world appear small and claustrophobic.The music score for this game is wonderful. Whether you're inside the forests of Ellinia, or exploring the depths of Ludibrium,  the background music really amplifies the mystery and beauty the game world is trying to become.The original MapleStory had a handful of classes, and each of them were unique, but overall balanced. Now, each large 'class update' seems to focus on newer 'Hero' characters, most who severely outclass the older counterparts in terms of damage and flashiness. In fact, there are so many different 'Heroes' nowadays, it saddens me to say that you'll rarely run into the older classes anymore, except in the case of Legacy worlds. The Cash Shop isn't all too great either. In addition to the standard cosmetic items and EXP boosts that one would commonly find in Free-2-Play MMOs, there are also items which give you in game currency, some which would offer you lowered failure chances when upgrading items. The latter gives players who spend a huge lead over players who don't, and this is made obvious by the overly high prices those items fetch on the marketplace.Combine that with a marketplace that doesn't let players open one without forking cash (and depending on how much cash you're willing to spend, it also determines whether you'll have to stay logged in to sell items)(players are only able to trade, so they'll have to solicit people in the market entrances) and a bad support team, I truly cannot recommend this game to anyone. MapleStory's golden days are long gone, and what's left is a carcass of what was once a masterpiece.			"

												This game is like that really easy girl in middle school. You played with her for a while and got bored with her, but you hear her call your name and for whatever reason you go back to see if anything has changed, and every time you go back, nothing has ever changed. Now, almost 8 years since you've met her, and you two still meet up every once and awhile to diddle. This game, man.			"

												I've played this game since I was 10 years old when it came out in america.The best way to describe maplestory is a deep, deep hole out in the woods.When you are bored and looking for something to do you fall into this hole.At first you are scared, you panic and try to get out of the hole.But slowly, you begin you like it in the hole. You spend thousands of dollars on making this hole cooler, nicer, and do more dps. You meet friends, lovers, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥s inside of this hole, it begins to feel like a community.Then high school girl drama will go down, and you will sell all your gear and quit.You will struggle to climb out of this hole. And finally....you're out.You go back to the way your life was before, and you become happy again.After a couple of months...you feel this craving...this...hunger...You miss the hole. Sure, the hole has its ups and downs...but you...you were safe in the hole...you were...home...So you go back, and thus begins the never ending downward spiral of your life.10/10 would quit and play again.

												I played Maple Story the very first day it was released to North America and since then the game has changed a ton.The grind in the game was hard but when you got them levels you earned them and it was amazing hearing the stories of guys like Tiger making top Teir and Wizet really loved it's community. Normally in the old maple story you would see admins walking around talking to members as they passed by and it was exciting to see the community with their passion for the game making content like Dray86's Maple Kombat. Then came Nexon who montized the hell out of the game, took the world that everyone loved and threw it all over the place then they made these hero classes that made the orignal classes completely useless of which had the most insanely high damage you've ever seen. Many of the cool dungeons in maple story became empty which is really sad because they was excellent. Sadly maple story degressed into this sub par kind of game. I want Wizet back, I want my maple story. Do I recommend it to you? No, Nexon is a greedy company but you won't really noticed how screwed up the game is unless you was there from the start. You won't notice all the cool stuff taken out because they'll try to blind you with high numbers and stupid classes to ego stroke your ♥♥♥♥.  "

Review as follows: Simple version up top, detailed on ""read more"". Note: I have played this game for well over 2,000+ hours over the years, and long before it was released on steam; how I ever racked up that many hours I will never know, but the game is not worth even 1 hour of your playtime.The good:  A classic 2D action platformer  Many character classes  Many areas to explore  The Bad  Character classes are horribly balanced  Classes do not particularly stand out from each other  (their niche's all blur together now) There is a huge problem with botters and hackers (people using cheats)  Traveling is a serious pain, and they draw it out ALOT to make you want to spend $$ money to make it easier.  Items purchased with $$ have a time limit (usually 90 days) The Worst   The game is so horribly coded it takes approx 2+ minutes to start even on high end computers  it will often take several attempts to start the game in order to start up properly (you will be getting lots of errors) The game crashes FREQUENTLY you could be playing for 5 minutes and it will crash so hard you must force shut down your computer  The game servers frequently need extended maintanence (often emergency maintenece; occurs several times a week)They force you to pay $$ real cash to have or upgrade abilities your character should have to begin with (such as the ability to hit criticals with magic attacks; which is INVALUABLE)  They make quests and grinding require so much travel you are essentially forced to purchase teleport rocks or other timesavers  Dying is exceptionally easy at higher levels, even the best gear can get you killed in as little as 5 hits (which you can get hit about every second), if you want to avoid the 10% exp loss you have to buy consumable ""charms"" to negate the 10% exp loss (which is many hours of work at higher levels).  Looting is atrocious (essentially requires spending $$ to get pets and items to have them loot for you.  They create artifical demandOn to the detailed and truely abominable things that make this game horrendous, almost beyond words. Fundamentally flawedThe simple act of looting is to push the ""loot"" button which is both ""Z"" and the numpad 0. As you progress through the game the method for fighting ""mobs"" is at the bucket loads, you will be killing 4~12 monsters within every 5 seconds. Each monster drops 2~4 items which are money, a misc monster drop, a potion, and a ""ticket fragment"" of sorts to do a special instance run that is always dead (no one does them.). So for every item you want to pickup, you must push ""Z"" and you will find that you will quickly be pushing that key hundreds if not THOUSANDS of times every few minutes. And if you dont loot those items you make essentially no money. The entire economy is seriously inflated to begin with too. If you want looting to be convenient be prepared to shell out about $30~$40 every 90 days for a pet and its ""gear"" to make it run around to loot things for you.You are forced to struggle with inventory space. At first you may think that you have plenty of space, but you quickly find out that the ""Use"" items and ""misc"" tabs will quickly be overlowing from NECESSARY items (the several hundred or THOUSAND potions you will be carrying, and have to replace every few hours or so). while the ETC slot will be filled with quest items, materials for crafting, and of course the hoards of monster drops you will be picking up (which usually only stack up to 200).Items you buy with $$ are NOT account-wide. They use a nonsense ""cash inventory"" system which is only shared with other characters of the same class (except in some rare caes like the ""adventurer"" series of classes or the ""cygnus knights."" However after the addition of the resistance they have their own shared cash inventory as well. You may think that is good enough but it IS NOT! because there are 2x of all that combined in classes that have a cash inventory shared only with other characters of the same class (which is POINTLESS because then you would be leveling up the exact same thing all over again; as each class only has 1 build, a special exception is made few 2 or 3 classes which can be either 1 element or another). Please note I am not talking about how a magician splits off into ice/lightning or fire/poison, I am referring to how a single class with a single skillset can have skills you wont want to invest in because they have no real part in the only effective way to create your character; which can be ever so important as there are skills in future advancements that require some certain skills to be Maxed.).They purposefully make things that should be everyday and easy access functions, exceedingly hard. For example, if you want to sell ANYTHING to ANY players, you want to go to the ""free market"" with about 50 other people, all spamming trying to sell things. If you want to sell ANYTHING as easily as it should be, you have to spend about ~$5 to buy a shop that your character has to man (lasts 90 days) just to sell things, which is horrendous in itself because you cant play the game, and it has a tendency to CRASH FREQUENTLY, and so hard you will have to FORCE SHUTDOWN YOUR PC!. So if you want to sell things as effectively as it should be, you have to spend $10 USD+ just to setup a store that will sell things for you (you set prices), and those can last 1 day to 7 days (getting more expensive for longer, up to $30 USD.) Character balancing is pitiful They come out with new character classes OFTEN! I swear, whenever you start getting your character to a high enough level to be happy with it, they release something that will outclass you in EVERY WAY! and you will essentially be forced to play that newest class since the monsters only get stronger to keep competing with the newest classes. And dont expect your old class to get revamped any time soon! it took them well over 3 years just to update the adventurers ONCE. and over a year for most anything else. In some cases the skillsets even change so completely you wont even recognize what to put your skill points into! but it gets WORSE! because if you make a mistake you will have to spend the $5+ USD to reset your points and hope you get it right the next time. It used to be that you had to spend about that much to reset a SINGLE POINT! and most skills require 20 or 30, im sure you can see how atrocious that is (the complete reset is only a new addition too, if you wanted reset you had to wait until they revamp your class again, because customer service WILL NOT HELP YOU!Customer service from Nexon is essentially non-existant, in fact, 99% of any and all messages you will get from them are automated. And no matter how large or small your problem is, nothing will be done. Your account getting hacked, or a broken quest (some havent been fixed for 2+ years), maybe even missing items/progress from a rollback, you will not get any help.There is no acceptable passive regen's (% or fixed numbers) for being in or out of combat, the only class that had one (the Jett) was removed with their revamp. So of course you must rely on potions ENTIRELY for you healing (unless you are a healer of sorts). The only passive regen you do have is 10hp for standing still for 10 seconds, and at higher levels (something you quickly reach) you have 7,000+ HP easy. while mana regen's at 3, which your mana is easily over 2,000 regardless of class (mages can go up to 30,000).There are countless more horrible things I can tell you about, but i feel I have made my point, and I beleive this is enough reasons why this game is among the things you should never play. Comments and likes are greatly appreciated! lets get the word out on why this is an awful game!			"

												I have no idea if Steam will say at all if I've played Maplestory but I promise you all I have put a lot of time into this game and absolutely loved every minute. Unfortunately Maplestory just became completely uninteresting since I've tried to relive it. And it makes me really sad. Maplestory originally had the classes we all see in every MMO (no matter how hard other MMO's try to make it different) and of course also like every MMO it started off simple. One big difference of course was the fact that it was a 2D sidescrolling MMOPRG and it's done so beautifully. You can make different faces at people depending on how you feel which was really fun before the cliche ""lol"" and ""lmao"" texts we all now universally know. Getting weapons was also a little more unique since most MMO's just milk weapons. Now a lot of MMORPG's have bows with unlimited arrows and guns with unlimited bullets. Maplestory made you buy arrows and throwing stars/shuriken if you wanted to be a ranged class. And Mesos (Maplestory currency) was hard to come by at low levels making it even more challenging since you had to actually ask for money from time to time.When I originally loved this amazing piece of gaming art you had to use a taxi to get to different cities (which you still do at least) and use flying boats to get to different continents. This was a huge deal because it allowed you to just settle down for a short time and actually talk to people; and listen to music along the way. Now this is not the case. There were no overpowered and annoyingly voice acted 'Hero' classes that literally kill everything in their paths with ease. You really had to work to get more powerful back then and you also needed to manually know what your stats needed to be for your class. Maplestory added more powerful classes over time but they were never 'Hero' status. Yes they got more powerful due to their unique skills compared to the default classes; however you still needed to start off as a default class and work your way into the more unique class you selected and leveling was still just as hard for you as the rest. The music is still the same Maplestory anime music I know and love. I just wish it could be heard with the game I knew and loved. For all you new players out there reading this review it'll mean close to nothing probably. To shorten what I just said: Maplestory used to be a surprisingly vast game filled with lots of social opportunity and hours upon hours of questing and leveling. It's a shell of its former self now. This does not mean I say it's a bad game. It's still good and worth the try. But unfortunately you have missed the golden age that was Maplestory. It's all milked down and I can't recommend it in its state now. What used to take a couple weeks to a month takes less than a day now. Bosses that originally required a full team can easily be defeated solo and the monsters that were originally intimidating and powerful are powerless. The challenge is gone. I will miss you Maplestory.			"

												MapleStory is that one game you're probably never going to find another of its calibre. It has that feel of nostalgia, even if you're new to the game. Attractive art styles look cartoony and cute while retaining 2d and pixelation draw people in this game with its surprising uniqueness. Maplestory has been breathing since 2005, but is it stable breathing?-Leveling-Maplestory was in its prime long back when generation Y was around 6 years old (2005 debut). If you compare the leveling from old Maplestory to post-big bang Maplestory, youll notice a huge difference. Its easier to hit level 100 nowadays, but back then whoever was over level 100 was considered a god. Old Maplestory had challenging leveling, so challenging that it took months to hit just 50. If you see the game now, it's a joke to hit 50, a 5 year old could do it in an hour.Of course Maplestory's leveling system will never be as good as it was back then; it evolves for newer audience because Nexon know the older audience will eventually quit. This is an instant gradification era, people want to level up quickly, not like a snail, to a point where it bores them to level up only 10 times a week. So, Nexon implemented an easier leveling system. One could argue that Nexon actually saved the game from dying off earlier.I won't argue anymore about Nexon saving the game with the leveling system, I used to think it was a saving throw, but I realized it's pretty much easy if you have enough change in your pockets. You can buy your levels. That's right. Nexon milked the leveling system for money. (by buy I mean buying 2x coupons and smashing keys to hit 200 easy peasy granted you have the money)-You ultimately don't have to spend money, but it makes you look/feel like trash-Nexon milked this game so much that its clear instead of a thick white. You ultimately don't have to spend money, since you CAN get anything you need without money. Let me elobrate, of course its convenient to buy cubes instead of pressing your mouse to farm for minerals and craft one, so the obvious logic is to do illegal activites and buy nexon points with mesos, the ingame currency, from a shady dealer with -239 downvotes. This game isn't really Pay 2 Win, it's more of Pay 4 Convenience. P4C makes you look like japanese eyecandy to people who get turned on to pixels, and makes your equipment hit like train, if that train holds 5 billion damage per hit.But if you don't P4C, you look like absolute crap until you muster enough mesos to buy one permanent nx item that looks decent. Gaining mesos from scratch is a timewaster too, because to merch (the term for buying low, selling high) without staring at your screen and hitting up and down to cycle messages, you have to pay real money to get a stand that does it for you, for about a month. Then you gotta buy it again if you want to merch, or get Carpal Tunnel. Oh, also, unless you spend alot of time and logical thinking on cubing and boosting stats on CRA, might as well fight with a stick because you are doing absolutely nothing to bosses that matter.-The Community-It sucks. Everyone will screw you over. I've seen too many stories when people grow up and try something like CSGO and leave for a month and the guild they had a blood pact with kicks them out, no matter how much they've contributed real life money for. People rarely work together anymore with strangers, guilds are just IRL friend camaradies, or a bunch of snobs who have superiority issues. Nexon realized this, but made it worse because they've made the entire game soloable (of course with money.) The community is just like anti-social teenagers at that one lunch table, if those teenagers tell you to CC if you step into their precious room.-Conclusion-This game, stripped of everything but gameplay, is so great. I love Maplestory's gameplay. I love it. But Nexon made a semi-working money making machine off of it, and completely ruined it for the veterans. I still play it on and off like that one chick in middle school, but Nexon makes so many schemes for cash and I can't believe people are blindlessly falling for it. Don't be tempted to buy that 90 day hair. Either voice your opinion of change to Nexon, or leave the game. It's not worth your time.			"

												I remember waking up as a kid, excited and eager to start up my dad's computer, hopping into the world of Maplestory, ready to take on whatever the game was going to throw at me that day. Needless to say, I was hooked. The cartoony yet oddly satisfying visuals, the huge world that was set before me, the deceptively simple class system, all things that I adored about it. For a while, I couldn't get enough of this game. It was my first MMO ever, and, to this day, probably still my favorite. Nothing comes close to the fun I had while killing mushrooms in the starting zone, slaying Balrogs on airships, destroying robots in Ludi, and finally, conquering Zakum. I made many friends, joined a slew of guilds, and mostly, just had fun. That's what videogames were about back when I played Maplestory, and in a sense, it seems like they've kind of lost that recently, although that's a different topic entirely. Maplestory now seems to be much more oversaturated in terms of classes and things to do, actually making it an overwhemingly experience rather than an extremely enjoyable one, one that I had when I played. Needless to say however, I still had a HUGE amount of fun with this game, and is hands-down one of the best experiences, if not THE best, I've had in gaming. I cannot speak to the community now, but when I was playing, it was a bunch of generous and fun loving people, one's that were willing to help others when they needed it. I miss Maplestory, specifically old Maplestory, even more specifically v.066, when things were simpler and I had a bunch of NX to spend on a different hairstyle. I miss you Maplestory. Thanks for giving me the game of a lifetime.			"

												Oh man has this game died so much. When I first began playing which was in 2009, the Maplestory community was the best gaming community I had EVER experienced. The social aspect of the game was absolutely amazing. Back then, Factions weren't dead and every day I would find interesting people to play with and party up with. Now, maps are relatively quiet and empty, and you never get the party invites and friendliness that there used to be. People just farm to themselves and the amount of people playing has dropped  so much  that I feel like I'm playing on empty servers all of the time. People don't even bother talk to you and in the major cities all you find is afk players just sitting there waiting for you to rank up their fame. Gameplay has also changed for the worse too. Back then there were relatively few and DISTINCTIVE classes that were unique and gave the game a balanced and helpful feel. Nowadays there is just a bunch of classes that are very similar and their niches are intertwined so much that you feel like class choice doesn't really give you a new and fun experience anymore. They've also emphasized microtransactions too much that it just takes away from the game. Overall, you feel like you're playing in a largely empty singleplayer game that's not even fun because the social aspect has completely rotted to nonexistence and the large amounts of ""events"" that fail at trying to make the game more interesting. The game has died and I must admit that even if you pay lots of money to level up and look cool, it doesn't matter a single ounce in the end because you've wasted your hard earned captical on a game with a meaningless and dead world and community.

												A once-great game with a rather unique style, ruined by balance changes homogenizing all the classes, pay-to-win power creep, and no customer support.Aside from the graphics of skills being different and some classes requiring ammunition to use theirs, it's all a matter of using the fastest skill that hits multiple times so you can hit the damage cap twelve times in a single attack. With the occasional buff to prevent the bosses from instagibbing you with one of their attacks.The only challenge most bosses in this game have come from one of two factors: 1, Attacks that reduce your health and mana to 1, dispel your buffs, or take control away from your character.2. Having HP totals somewhere in the billions, and a short time limit to bring that to zero. Not a problem for people who hit the damage cap with every attack (50,000,000), but for people too self-aware to spend loads of dosh on cash items to upgrade in-game equipment they're impossible.Getting away from the game mechanics, the servers are infested with hackers and botters. How infested? There are more botters in the game than actual players. There's a ""Report to GM"" function, but if a GM actually responds to it, you should probably either buy a lottery ticket, or more likely slap yourself in the face because you are in a dream world where the impossible is possible. GMs only show up to host godawful events and spam emoticons while spouting lies.On that note, the game has an autoban function built into it, which 90% of the time bans nonhackers doing something mundane for no reason. On the off chance a hacker/botter actually is banned, they'll eventually be unbanned because Nexon likes giving people ""second chances"" and unbanning everyone who was ever banned up to that point. Why? Because hackers spend money too ya know! Gotta keep profits up!I said there is no customer support, but I was lying. There is a customer support ticket system, but it would probably better if it didn't exist at all. Tickets can go without a response for literally years. Nexon also has this opinion that having your account hacked into is the player's fault and refuses to compensate. One of the Global exclusive areas even has a quest line that mocks this, giving the middle finger to everyone who had their account broken into and laughing at them.Long story short, Unique art-style Platformer-MMORPG that crashed and burned and then was grinded into the dirt. Cause of death? Power creep, pay-to-win, and apathy and malice from the company that runs it. Avoid it like the plague if the plague were also on fire and making rude gestures at you.			"

												ATTENTION EUROPEAN PLAYERS: Avoid playing on European servers at all costs, it's trash. Just play on the NA one, the european server lags like crazy. Especially if you've got strong internet, in that case you won't feel any lag in NA, while there'll always be lag on the european server, as it's the server's problem.I don't want to beg for ""likes"", but please upvote this review so people can be aware of this.Thank you in advance :)			"

												First serious review, go easy on me.tl;dr version, everything died but the devs.review updates at bottomNow, I have been a loyal player of this game since around 2008, despite my hours on Steam. Originally, I played the game off of Nexon's actual download site so I'll take that into account. I've invested over a thousand hours into this game, and boy was it great! The community was very fun to just socialize with and everyone was nice. The party quests differentiated from each other so it wasn't too repetitive. Everybody also worked together to help each other level up, and villages were filled with friends; until about a year or two ago.. Those were the good days.I'm not necessarily saying the game itself is really bad now, but the community just went kablam. It's like napalm upon the nice people of the game. Henceforth, many players disappeared and the developers just turned the game into more of a pay-to-win aspect. ""Whatever happened to the people?"" I ask myself a lot. I always come back to this question as this was my all-time favorite game and community. I don't know. I miss the party invites from random people, and the occurence of running into strangers who become your best friend. Sometimes I think I'm all alone when I'm online since each instance is filled with afk people and others just walking around aimlessly, then logging off just like me, only to check if the game is restored to its former glory. There are also no players left that actually do party quests, an essential thing to leveling up efficiently. ""The tears that come out of one eye are from nostalgia, the tears that come from the other eye are from how bad the game is."", quoted from another reviewer, is similar to what I feel about the present Maplestory.Now onto the pros and cons.Pros:+Great concept of characters+Good storyline that provides a foundation for each character+OMAIGOD THE MUSIC+Many, many places and locations to explore, with hidden quests+Content (apparently still) being added every few months or soThat's all the pros I can come up with from memory for now.Cons:-Pay to win-Screwed over community-Dead servers-Unbalanced charactersWell, that's pretty much it. If I had reviewed this game much earlier, rather than 2015, I would've given this game a recommendation. Is this game worth playing at this point? Not really, unless you're just wanting to explore the game itself. That then concludes my review.If you actually read to this point, thanks for doing so!Update: Apparently, its much easier to level up now. So easy that the game essentially hands you the exp, whereas in the past you actually had to work for it using teamwork. If you're looking for that nostalgia, it's not there anymore. Also, remember the ship you took took to Orbis and the people you met on that ship? Well, nobody uses it anymore. There's no more aspect of exploration since you can just use a dimensional portal or something, or a click and go item.Update Update: holy ♥♥♥♥ what the ♥♥♥♥, people still use basilmarket to communicate. thats a plus i guess			"

												    After I have experienced SO much about Maplestory, from playing it since 9 years ago plus on various private servers, I think it is time to hit delete key and post a caveat for curious 12-year-old like you to see. This game does not hurt if you play with some friends. Honestly, being playing with friends is the only good way to play this game since they serve as a reminder that you still have a real life. Without such link to the reality, it is too easy to be sucked into the scheme of Maplestory that is deliberately, fundamentally created to exhaust both your mind and wallet    Because remember: the philosophy of any MMORPG is to encourage competition between players strictly on the level of vanity and facile values, being how beautiful you look, how much money you have, how high damage can you hit...... Especially when you are lonely in the game, this emotion is easily ellicited because the game encourages so in any aspect. But the trick is, we all understand there is no ending to beautiful cash shop items and the amount of currency you possess, why can't we/I keep from not coming back to torture ourselves in the grinding and trading that ultimately lead to no real satisfaction?    Because those game developers(e.g. Nexon) understand how pleasure works in us. What human desires is not a specific, final object, but a differential value through a growing experience. That is to say, pleasure is only gained through change; and after you arrive at a threshold, being it posed by the game or your brain, you are only left with emptiness. And this is when you want to start the loop again, again, and again. This is precisely why we only want to make MORE money, why we want to spend MORE cash items, and get MORE levels/damage without it ending at a specific number. This is why Nexon created so many new types of characters and jobs: they want to give you the pseudo-novel feeling each time you restart the experience, while in fact, nothing has changed about how your pleasure works. It's an everlasting loop.    So instead of clicking the ""Play Game"" button. Why not think about something more valuable in your life? Whether or not you are willing to participate in this collective subconscious hell of pleasure looping is your own choice. If you really want to play, play it with friends. I am lonely, I don't have friends. Since I understand all these, I decide to quit.			"

												In my opinion, this game used to be really good. It's still good, but not as good as it was.Maplestory has lost something that many older players found extremely valuable, community. While community still exists in the form of guilds, free market, and henehoes, the lack of rewarding party quests and party-training zones encourage most players to walk the path of a solo player; simply put, the game rewards you much more for playing by yourself. The game is still enjoyable. It allows you to spend your time to work towards achieving a certain goal, whether it be a higher level or new items. If you love grinding, you'll really enjoy this game.			"

												Disclamer: This is long, but my review of the game is towards the bottomAbout me: A friend recommended this game to me back in 2006 when it was still in its first few years. I downloaded it and was hooked immediately. Except for Runescape, this was my first MMORPG. My friend moved away but we kept in contact for awhile through this game, and I also ""met"" a lot of people in-game that i became as close as you can be in a fake world. I felt cool pretending to be 16 and people actually believing me.Starting out back in the day this game was hard. Hard in the sense that it takes a long time, effort, and collaboration even to reach the second job advancement at lvl 30. I still have my very first character at about lvl 26. This game hooks you in and keeps you grinding and doing quests all because of wanting to be like those who were lvl 70+ and had the cool job advancements. Over the years things started to get a little easier. With a new account and job classes like the cygnus knights coming out things were still looking good for this game. I was playing it more for time-wasting instead of sheer need/addiction (yes, looking back i was wildly addicted to this game). It was still something to play with my friends, but i still recognized i needed a life. Getting my first character to lvl 70 (an assasin) was a very big step for me, and when it took me forever just to get it to lvl 72 thats when i started to realize i needed to stop. FAST FORWARD 2-3 years and its summer and i think, huh i kind of want to waste some time. That summer i fell back in love with Maplestory, but for a different reason, it was so easy to level. I was able to get several characters to higher levels (60s-70s) rather quickly and it was fun to experiment with the wide set of classes that were new. But this is where Maplestory for me started to lose its touch. I would every few months or so log on and just think ""Oh i wonder whats changed this time"" and its always something. It isnt what I fell in love with anymore.Now in college i found myself playing this once in a blue moon if i had some down time and wanted to just relax. This game has a therapeutic sense to it that i just go around doing quests/grinding till 2AM. Nowadays it is so eay to level up i started a character and in about an hour it was at level 50. along with my 70 assasin, i have a 12X dual blade and my main character is a 135 Aran, one of my all time favorite classes (i havent really been interested in the new classes). So if you're still reading this, im almost done. Why do i still play this game? Nostalgia. Plain and simple. when you spend as much time as i have on something like this it is hard to give it up. I have wonderful MEMORIES of this game and i play now to waste time. ---------------------------------------------------ABOUT THE GAME: Pay to Win: A lot of people say its a 'pay to win' game but i have spent about $5 of NX just for looks purposes, i made my couple million mesos on sheer grit and luck with some equipment and scroll drops. Its possible without it, but it takes work. Art: This game is beautiful. Not much else to say really.Community: All about gone. As a ""veteran"" i can tell that it is all solo now, even the PQs can be solo. Also the free market is empty except for the stores, that should tell you something.Gameplay: If you like doing quests and grinding and doing storylines, its for you. If you're expecting something more, look elsewhere. As i have said before: this game was addicting to me, some may play for only a little but there are only extremes for this game. Either 10 hours or 1000. BE WARNED. Nexon: They dont really give a crap about their players so dont expect very good customer service (which is why i would steer clear of NX, you dont need it)Hacking: Theres in-game hackers and then there are people who hack accounts. Luckily after being off the grid for about 2-3 years i was able to come back on and have everything right where i left it. I guess i was lucky. Because of the time i put into it and how much of this game i have seen, from the beginning to the end, i can only recommend this with a word of caution. Dont invest yourself into the game but still have fun with it because it is a wild ride. I believe this game can only get a 1/10 or a 10/10 and i have to give it 10/10 for what it has been for me. You've been warned.I apoligize for the novel but this is what Maplestory has caused, it is a beautiful game and it is something that has been that nagging baby sister for the past ~10 years and it is something that i will always look back and laugh about and think of how much ******* time i put into that game.

												This is a game that SHOULD be fun. It really SHOULD be. It has everything it needs:Awesome music, amazing graphics (You get used to the character sprites.) and lots of things to do, tons of classes that function very differently the farther you go along, but eases you into them at first.So why am I not suggesting this game?Nexon isn't the 'best' company when it comes down to it. They have a Cash Shop. You want a pet? Cash shop. You want nice looking armor to RENT to display over your current armor? Cash shop. Teleport wherever you want? Cash shop. EXP boost? Cash shop.Literally anything and everything is a Cash Shop. Yes it's not the only MMO to have it, but it clearly abuses it so much and was (Likely) one of the first MMOs to truly abuse the heck out of the system. Don't worry if you forget about it, you'll get reminded with drops, quests, and so on that there is a way to buy your way out of everything.The community itself? If you've played an MMO, you know what to expect. Generally this consists of people who speak nothing to you most of the time- except in a market, in which case you get spammed with lots of things you won't know what they mean.The best way to compare the free market on channel one is like watching ants swarm a meal. It's fascinating and disgusting at the same time...and by the way, you're the meal.You can use the forums to get in guilds which aren't bad, but even then most of the lingo is confusing- half because MS has a text limit shorter than a Twitter message, half because they have a filter that is so picky that I could never state my friend 'is' something because it gets filtered out, even if I wanted to say 'is great'Another dislike about the game is the AI. 90% of the enemies you encounter outside of dungeons  (At least up to lvl 120) use the same pattern of ""I'm gonna run into you and damage you that way!"" which, yeah there's hundreds of enemies, but it's all just nothing short of a pallete swap if they all get the same functionality.In the end, Maplestory has a lot of ingredients to be a great game, but too many spices put into the soup end up making a good soup turn rotten (But still look pretty). And that's the best way to describe it.			"

												mapplestory used to be a great adventure where you grinded your way through pain and suffering just to get a level up. and the higher the level you used to be the more popular and pro you were. the community used to be fantastic and there used to always be hotspots to talk with people and make friends. now its a game where you level up much quicker get slightly overpowered equips, and items and the community could careless about you and your level. dont get me wrong this is still a great game that will easily lead you back to downloading it and playing it over and over again. play it if you dont mind quitting then coming back to it a year later as for the old users who used to play this well... you know my pain of how this game changed.

												I've been playing MapleStory off and on since the year it came out, I think I was about 10. Oh lord so much of my childhood was spent pouring endless hours into this game. Something about it is addictive and enticing enough to make you come back about once a year for a week long binge. That being said, it's gone through a lot of phases as far as games go. It started out gaining a huge amount of popularity by having one of the best communities I've seen in an MMO, cute graphics, unique skills in each class, but it was largely grind based. Grind based MMO's are more tolerable if you have friends around you that also play the game, but Nexon started making it more pay to win and so eventually it thinned out a lot. Nexon respond by throwing class after class, new world after new world, new maps, and tons of other extraneous stuff to entice players to stay/come back but without addressing the pay to win problem so the game died almost beyond recovery. It was still grind based, with only three basic forms of quests - killing monsters/gathering items, jumping on platforms with obstacles, or traveling across an ever expanding map that would just suck up idle time. Since then, it seems Nexon finally started tackling some of the main problems players have been complaining about. There are faster ways to get across the map, cross-world features to elliminate the thinned out player base, it's not necessarily as grind based, there are more unique monsters popping up, and far more quests and features. It doesn't seem as pay to win, and Nexon is improving on what they have rather than just throwing more stuff at players. It's more fun than I remember it, and I never thought I'd ever describe MapleStory as fun again. The community is still thin but there is more to do in the game and it's more balanced than ever. Overall it's worth a shot, but if you want your character to look remotely decent you're still going to have to spend money.			"

 Nostalgia and the big numbers blind me If you've never heard of Maplestory just skip it. To be completely honest with you the only reason I got this game on Steam was for the nostalgia. I've been playing this game on and off for so many years. (Since 2006) This game was fantastic, but it was ruined by it's absurdly high damage numbers, (which get so damn high that Nexon has to raise the cap on damage) The insane high prices of the free market, and the sheer amount of classes. (There's 32 classes! THIRTY TWO! I was so happy when Pirate first came out.) Oh and the community. Do you like 12 year olds? Well that's basically a majority of the community. Here's my recent adventures. Recently I played this game AGAIN for the 90th time. I chose Adventurer my bread and butter, I picked Magician and picked the Cleric tree.  As soon as you hit level 20 you get bombarded by all these alerts. ""JOIN THE NEW CHAT SYSTEM."" ""EVENT!!!!!"" ""GACHAPON GACHAPON!"" I got very annoyed very quickly. After a very quick leveling grind to level 100, I got my fourth job Bishop. I was very happy that I made it to level 100 because back in my day I've gotten a level 100 Dark Knight.  Soon after my 4th job I realised. ♥♥♥♥ there's 150 more levels. I gave up after that. The community annoyed me the grind was boring (Just spammed HS for bonus Xp) and I didn't want to spend any real life money to cube any items or scroll anything.  Final Verdict:  It WAS a good game. The game is no longer enjoyable. But my inner 12 year old makes me want to love it.  Nostalgia is the only reason I would see someone play this. The game on it's own is a grind all the way to level 250. The big numbers are blinding and are hard to track, the classes have no ""uniqueness"" It's all about DAMAGE DAMAGE DAMAGE.  5/10 Nice nostalgia trip, game isn't fun anymore Edit:Went from being most recommended negative review to not existing at all.If you can't take backlash for your dying game consider fixing it instead of hiding negative reviews. Thank you for hiding my review though!Proof: http://imgur.com/nVIs5tXMy review doesn't even show up. If you can't take negative reviews please just delete all of them.

												I really do wish I could recommend this game. I have spend many, many, hours on it. I was drawn in by the excellent storyline and seemingly endless levels.But then it hits you. The level curve is absurd. The content is either sparse or not worth your time (good luck leveling between 120 - 150) and the top play is just far too repetative. There is always a best build, and they are painfully obvious. All these status effects, elemental damage, forget them. Only element that matters is holy, and most enemies die before you can do whatever horrible status effect to them.Maplestory, gameplay wise, seems to be hanging you between faster leveling crowd attacks or better boss-killing single target attacks. Usually you end up a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mix of all of them, and it seems like that's the track most classes are now moving.Really, the only difference between most of these classes is their DPS and weapon of choice. While this one has to balance light/dark, this one rides on a panther, and this one is so adorably ridiculously pink, it doesn't make a bit of difference. You're either a bishop or a killer. Class synergy? Nope. Tanks and Strikers? Nope. I guess the best example of this are the boss battles, which just involve going down your attacks, drinking crap tons of potions, and watching a screen literally covered with colorful multi digit numbers. You do this for an hour, and if you can't do it under a hour, you lose. Fun.There is so much to like about Maplestory, but even more to hate. Honestly, I play it for the community. I'm not saying the game is awful, I'm just saying it is intensely flawed.			"

												I started playing this game when pirates came out. I used to love this game I really did. What I loved the most out of this game was the sense of being part of a community. The community is still active with an estimated 50,000-70,000 players but will continue to dwindle since less people join the game than there are leaving. I left because I didn't like the direction the game was taking.I can't say if the game is still worth playing.. All but one server, the Reboot server, are pay to win. If you have the time to do mindless grinding then the Reboot server is for you (keep in mind that you cannot trade anything in this server). Find yourself a guild and hopefully you find some nice people to chat with. I don't recommend joining the non-reboot servers anymore as the majority of the old veterans are one of the most etilist and toxic players out there, and that's coming from the veteran player I am. Pretty much the normal servers are kept alive by the whales who spend tons of money in the game still. Anyone willing to pay can to be on top but I decided to not spend the money myself, it seems pointless and unfun instead of working towards progressing your character yourself. One of the things I really disliked about this game was the introduction of the potential system. Potential widened the gap between rich and poor players. It divided the community even further. There are a ton of potential related items in the cash shop that give an unfair advantage to players with lots of money to drop in non-Reboot servers. Reboot is just a band-aid for the problem potentials created in this game. Reboot is a server Nexon created that solved many pay to win aspects, however this comes with many drawbacks, including the inability to trade with one another within the server. Another problem I saw was that Nexon was nerfing party related quests and raids, it was encouraging people to go solo instead of partying with other people which is what I loved from this game (as of today you'll rarely see anyone doing party quests, most people are grinding now instead of doing PQs/Boss Runs/Raids to level up). Now that the damage cap has been removed there is little reason to party with others to do stuff if you're decently funded. One other minor problem I saw is that Nexon created tons of servers, there was no reason to create more, the population wasn't even increasing and it further divided the playerbase. They finally merged many of the barren servers into single servers but are still even less populated than the top 3 populated non Reboot servers.The game gets minor updates monthly with the occasional major update every now and then, so the game is still alive in that aspect. Thanks to Nexon Korea's ongoing support for the game, there's many more things to do than you could do in old MapleStory which is one of the few things this MMO has going. If you are looking for a good MMO to play I recommend you look elsewhere, but if you really want to try it out, go join the Reboot server, it is the most populated server and hopefully you find some nice people to chat with.TL:DR The game is extremely pay to win if you're not playing the Reboot server (keep in mind that you cannot trade in this server). I recommend joining the reboot server only if youre willing to try the game out. The game has an average of 50000-70000 players at the moment.			"

												Used to play the game years ago, when Maplestory wasn't in steam, but Reboot and nostalgia pulled me back into the game. This game is for you if you love grinding, but thats pretty much all there is with this game. Socialization has deteriorated in this game because of faster levelling, faster transportation, and the evaporation of casual players. Unless you have friends to play with this game, you are mostly by yourself. I've never been into MMORPGs due to the grinding aspect, but this game has made want to re-evaluate what I am doing with my life. The only accomplishment I feel from this game is seeing large numbers in the damage I deal to mobs and bosses.			"

												I started playing this game before ludi and orbis came out.When seeing someone at the 3rd job was an excitement.When you had to wait for a ship to orbis about 10 minutes and get scared to die from the flying balrog on the ship.When a warrior that dealt 1k damage at lvl 30 to a giant slime at kerning PQ was a - ""WOW!""When illbi was worth 35m and you tried to get it from the vicious mushmom to get rich.When getting your first million was a great achievement.This is the maplestory i love Nexon made the game too easy which kinda ruined the game for me and a lot of peopleI still recommend this game because for new players it should be a very fun game and a time burner.

												To give some context, I've been playing on/off since Beta. So I have a nostalgia for this game I cannot shake. Therefore, at the time of writing this review, I have 912 hours of this game on my Steam account. But don't get me wrong. Most of this was just me AFKing overnight to sell things, because if you want to have a shop that you can leave open without playing the game, you have to pay a crazy amount of money. I think it's like, I dunno, $3 for a 24 hour shop. Yeah. Meanwhile, it's only $1.80 for a 3 month permit to do the same thing, but you have to be online. Seems fair, right? Yeah. Anyways, here's the review lmao+ Surprisingly fun combat+ Consistently updated+ Several different classes+ Levelling is straightforward and easy+ Reboot server takes the pay to win out of the game (but also removes other features as a result, encouraging people to keep playing on the P2W servers as well)+ Very cute style, have had a lot of fun customizing my character with gear.~ Simple Crafting system (Both good and bad, because those who don't like crafting in MMOs typically won't have trouble using it, but it also makes it boring for those who love in-depth crafting systems in MMOs.)- Pay to win out the ♥♥♥. People sell their godly weapons and armor on Paypal. Anyone with a few hundred dollars can become number one in a day.- Outdated, constantly lags and crashes, built on old framework and needs updating. The sequel, Maplestory 2, looks fun but will probably never come out globally.- Once you reach a certain level, your daily routine typically involves fighting the standard bosses for about an hour or two then keeping your shop open overnight to sell more and buy more gear/cosmetics. It's a massive grind til the very end.- Pay 2 Fashion. You have a very small, if even any, selection of hairs/faces at the beginning. The only way to change them is with NX. No joke, you have to pay real money to change your hair and face. Of course, you can just pay people to gift you a coupon with in-game money, but if you want to have enough in-game cash to pay someone to do that, you either have to beg or pay real money to get gear to grind for these things. In short, unless you're insanely patient or have wealthy friends, you're going to be coerced into buying NX with real cash. Because looking ugly in an MMO sucks. Oh, and not to mention, the best hairs are in Royal Coupons and the likes, which have a RANDOM SELECTION of 6-8 hairs, of which at least half usually look terrible. This game wants your money. That's why it's still alive. And it works.Overall: Giant cash grab. Still fun if you have the money. If you don't like looking decent and don't care about bossing, then sure, I can see how you can enjoy this game, but honestly, who's going to go to this outdated MMO and do that? There are better MMOs out there. Don't waste your time here.			"

												First of all I don't have 9 hours on this game. I have a few thousand on this game. I just played the client version most of the time. Honestly, when this game came out way back when in '05, I played the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. It was hella fun but it was also really hard. I mean if you were level 50 you had great respect. Now getting to level 50 can be done in 2 hours as apposed to 2 months of training 4 hours a day. I mean like if you got to lv200 back then people would waste money to acknowledge you for what you have done. Now if you get to level 200 its just a race to 250 or to get super high damage and solo bosses to make real money on paypal or some ♥♥♥♥. Then later on they made Big Bang which made it super easy. Big Bang continues on and now its hard again. They raise the level cap from 200-250. Still takes like 3-5 days to get to Lv250 is unknown how long it will take because no one has reached there yet. In my opinion, this game has become completely pay to win. Nexon has declined in their service from where they started. Before buying NX was for like for clothes that didn't do jack ♥♥♥♥. But then nexon was all like, ""Lets make every piece of equipment ♥♥♥♥, and put a bunch of NX items to scroll them, reset their potenial, protect them from being destroyed and a bunch of other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t."" That really made me mad and now I ended up spending more then $7000 on this game. I ended up making Close to $10,000 in paypal credit over time but that was only because I played way too much. I farmed bosses and scrolled and sold items all day and all night. I got sucked in and do me a favor, never get sucked in. I was lucky to make that much money back. To be honest, that was over the course of 4 years. Its not worth giving up even a minimum wage job for that kind of pay. Go get a job and make something out of your life. Back when there was only 4 jobs and it was super hard, those were the good days. Like the actually unbanned hackers recently just to get more attention back in the game. Wait i'm sorry, let me say that again. THEY UNBANNED HACKERS SO THEY COULD GET MORE PEOPLE TO PLAY THEIR ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME. I hate to say shiity but thats what it has become. Probably 70% of the userbase how is Hackers/Botters. Freaking Angel Prossecer is free and theres also BT that just allow people to level up fast and ♥♥♥♥. For christ sake the 3rd best highest level is a hacker. ZeroByDivide better known as Divide By Zero on Gamersoul (maplestory hacking website). He has some of the rares duped items and IGN's and so much more ♥♥♥♥. He has CLB's that hes always using to find exploits and hes also leveling super fast. This game is just not worth it any more. Stop wasting your time on this stuff. If your a billionare, then this game is for you. Don't waste your time.			"

												i played this game in its original day. the orginal four classes were fun and challenging. leveling actually was a challenge. it took a while to even get to your 2nd job change. now you can get to 2nd and even 3rd job in less than a day. now that they added all these new classes, the game isnt the same anymore. the new classes can solo bosses that used to take a whole team. the map is nothing like it was. and after a while it is just boring, you end up doing the same thing over and over and over again that its not fun anymore.

												Alright so this game is a mix with meBack then, I was a beta tester in 2002, a year before the game released. The game used to be randomized at the character selection including you as the player having to roll the dice for your stats as your beginning class. Now it just feels like the characters have no variety, with Phantoms, Xenon, Kinesis and other classes.It used to be just the explorers, warrior, archer etc and back then the commmunity was amazing.Now gamers in general are pretty anti-social, I could even say that communitys in games like Minecraft or any other indie games have better communities now.If only Nexon saw the worth in the nostalgia of the old maple. I know they made the reboot server, but that isn't really much to provide everything about the old Maple.MapleSTORY, this game at this point has no story. The story that we all took back then ended, the player was supposed to go through their own personal story and the game's story at the same time, but now it's just... nothing, no friends, nothing. Hackers are invading a lot and ruining the game's experience, and the big players aren't even around anymore. Areas like Henesys, kerning city just feels DEAD. Afk players are there but not really playing anything. I remember being a kid and talking about Anime and such around Henesys and having fun little arguments, and those were the times when people didn't take everything so seriously. Maplestory used to be pretty innocent, but now kids are cursing in the game and such and it ruins the experience. Nexon ruined the games by removing Gapachon and adding cubes and other buy to play stuff and it turned a game where socializing and playing with your best pals into a buy to play anti social place. Gameplay is the same but the characters feel WAY TOO OP, and leveling is way too fast. The HUD is different too, I prefer the new one though so thats fine. Character creation is somewhat better, more variety in hairstyles and some of them, you had to pay back then. Seasonal Events still are pretty dead and overall, this game is dead. I think old maplers such as myself placed down the maple leaf for the new generation already. BUT, if you have a group of friends and you guys want a game to play, PLAY MAPLESTORY! It's pretty fun with friends, even though you grind extremely fast and level up fast. I rate this game 7/10 but back then it would've been a 10/10 for me.			"

												Here is the thing, It isn't exactly the game itself, as much as it is the community. When the game first came out, the community for it was amazing! Everywhere you looked, you could see a player in every map. It was a game where you had to work together to make any progress. You knew the big name players; FangBlade, Tigger, CurryIsHot, etc. The community was there. It was loving, it was caring, it was a game that you wanted to play with friends instead of alone. It wasn't so much how long it took to get somewhere, as opposed to how you got there. Now the game is just too quick and easy to do anything. There are far too many classes, and instead of using skills from each class; (for example, one of the most famous party quests, the Ludibrium Tower PQ, you NEEDED to have at least a magician and a thief in your party otherwise you could not complete the party quest) is now replaced with 'HEY I CAN BEAT EVERY BOSS IN THE GAME IN 2 DAYS BY MYSELF BECAUSE I BOUGHT NX'. It just doesn't have the same player base, and I believe that is the reason so many people are quitting.As someone who has played since 2006, these 10 years have really brought a change to my eyes on the game I once loved.Here are some key points:1) The game is too rushed now. I know leveling slow sounds boring, but back in the day the excitement of getting to level 21 after hours of work so you can start Kerning PQing with your friends. Getting your 2nd job took work and then going to Ludi PQ was another fun adventure when you had friends to do it with. Getting tracks and looking for the best 'clicker' to get you into the PQs and what not. It was fun. Someone being level 70 back then was amazing. You'd look up to them. Now you can get it within 5 hours of playing hard. When Zakum first came out, for a long time there was a select few who could even dream about getting a zakum helmet, now everyone has one.2) Pay to win. They added all this new stuff to upgrade your items like cubes and I don't even know what else. Back in the day the only thing that NX bought you was cool hair, clothes and pets. Now, if you wana be the best at this game, you have to pay a lot of money for it with cubes, and other NX items.3) Simplicity. This is what is turning me off at the moment. Back when I played, there was only Mage, Bowmen, Theifs and Warriors (and the rare 'beginner' main), and it was awsome. Each class had strengths and weaknesses at different points in the game, and the world wasn't too gaint to explore. The old saying 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' I think. People enjoyed making one of each of the 4 classes (even more if you wanted Spearman, fighter, F/P mage, clerics, bandits etc). Now, when I opened maplestory, I see like 20 different classes at least, and each probably have their own sub-classes, it's just too much imo. Back then it was easy to balance (in fact they almost never had to balance any classes cause they were so equal) but, I imagine with this many classes now, sometimes they get out of balance and certain ones outshine heavily.

												I've been a loyal player of this game for the past eight years (I started back in the Summer of 2006), and despite Nexon's blatant destruction of the game with limited customer support and not giving a ♥♥♥♥ about their playerbase...I can somehow still enjoy this game. As of recent, I mainly stick around because, yes, the game is QUITE fun if you find your little clique of friends, and because somehow, I enjoy the story of Maple's heroes fighting against the Black Mage. A few of the Hero classes have one hell of a backstory to them, and despite clunky, unfair gameplay mechanics, I like it. Yes, I'm aware Nexon couldn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about how their players feel, and yes, they break the game continuously while providing ""patch updates"" to cover up their intentional ♥♥♥♥-ups.Long story short? Nah, can't really recommend it to anybody. Am I going to keep playing it? Probably; waiting to watch it burn is more like it. I can equate my experiences to sitting with a group of friends, enjoying their marshmallows around a campfire, when suddenly, a wild sasquatch arrives behind you and tosses someone into the flames. The question is: who will be next?			"

												Was and no longer is great.Maplestory retains that look and feel from years ago, but still falls short on the essential elements that keep people in-game enjoying content and off hotstreaks of haituses. The community was the reason to log back in everyday. Your friends from school weren't embarrassed to say they played, and if they were it didn't show when they were in game. Today, I feel I need to explain myself everytime I download the nearly 10 gigabytes of content again, and appear online abound with greyed out names of the past on my buddy list.It's depressing how a game that used to bring me joy is now devoid of any passion. Free to Play became a lie with the introduction of pets and store permits; things that should have been available for ingame currency or as rewards from quests. It's good business, because it's still tricking people, but poor practice. Veterans of Maplestory saw the decline years before the younger crowd that the game is now geared towards. It was reap what you sow and is now pay hard to hit hard.Maybe I'm stuck in the past, but the experiences I've had in the recent versions of Maplestory have cost me more than my wallet and is not worth even a half an hour of gameplay.

												Despite it having some pay to win features that help increase your damage, etc etc, the designers have been listening to the community recently so things are becoming more free to play again.  The game itself has been expanding to become less repetition and more game play.  It even rewards people for just sitting around doing jack squat, so you can be super casual about this game like me.

												I know everyone is dissapointed because the game has changed and it's extremely easy to level up now. I have played since 2006 and me and my older brother got to level 90 with an archer. I don't think it's that bad. Honestly, I keep enjoying this game just as much as I used to. So what if I don't actually work hard to gain levels. I still enjoy the unique art style and all the skills and class variety. I enjoy this game so damn much and I have one level 131 Dawn Warrior and one level 120 mercedes. And in case you ask, I am free to play. I didn't spend a penny on that game. Actually once I bought a pet for my shadower cause I thought it's cool but it was before I discoverd the steam version, don't let those idiots who say this game is bad, they are just dissapointed cause it's not EXACTLY how it used to be, so they just talk ♥♥♥♥ about this game. It's really fun, just sit back, explore, try new classes and if you don't know anything just check out on the internet. Enjoy this game. It's fun.			"

												Played the game back in 2009 and it was amazing. It was a lot like old school runescape but with a better community. The game took like months just to get level 30 of the 200 levels, so everyone leveled together to become legends amoung men and get level 120 or higher. This sounds ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for some people im sure but it was so cool to be that badass that was god tier. The game was a grind but you had to do party quest to level and get some of the best gear so everyone always worked together. Party quest being a huge part of leveling ment that what is normmaly a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ grind became make freinds and get rewarded for it. builds were not easy either, were as now the game holds your hand on were to put points, I remember seeing a dude who dumbed all stats into HP and nothing else and the dude was like level 60 tanking for our group of level 100's. It was cool to be like ""that guy"" who had a cool build. now after all that praise on what the game was what is the game now? dont talk to anyone and kill like 10 hours of time to get to level 90+. its world of warcraft now where its so easy, and so much better to do everything solo that everyone does. If you try to talk to anyone they will walk right past you. What point is an MMO that its no longer played as a multiplayer game? Party quest still exist but it group you up with a random person who just leaves as soon as the quest starts to solo the boss by themselfs because its more of a reward to just do the party quest and grinds by yourself. They ruined the community by making the game far to easy, and there is no way to go back. Not work the five hours of game time to have a charicter that plays and works jsut like everyone else your class, and then play by yourself at max level.			"

 This game... Thousands of hours into this game, and I  highly  do  not  recommend it. Only very few hours were recorded because I always played through the launcher and not Steam. Anyways;...Either one of two things will happen:1) You won't like this game, and quit playing after like 10 hours tops. 2) You'll really enjoy this game for the first 5,000 hours, then realize you wasted a couple years playing one of the worst MMO's out there. I enjoyed this game when I was a kid, quit playing it for a year, came back to it, quit playing, and so on. This game is one of those ""Pay-to-win"" games, where everything is based off how much money you feel like dumping into this game. And that right there, is what makes it so successful. It's a nice game, yeah, but not worth the time and money you'll put into it. After a couple hundred bucks put into cosmetics, ""damage"", any stupid ♥♥♥♥ there is, you then ask yourself what you're doing. ""Well, it's not a waste if you enjoy playing the game!"" I suppose so. That's what I said at first, but hey. It's your money, your feel to the game. I would recommend this game if it wasn't such an addictive pay-to-win game. The Pro's:+Enjoyable classes to play as+Countless different styles of gameplay+Endless outfits, equips, weapons, etc.+Kind(ish) community (Average MMO)+It's a good time-waster+Free world, do whatever you want+Cute graphics, nice way to express yourselfThe Con's:+Hundreds if not thousands of hours will be put into it+Pay-to-win game+Starts to get boring after a couple months+Too many restrictions (Treated as 10 year olds)+Terrible storylines, only thing that matters is levels+Grinding levels takes hours upon hours spamming the same buttons+Lots of hackers, scammers, spammers, botters, etc.+Above all,  waste of time. I recommend not even trying it out, and just leaving it there. You'll end up  hating  it one way or another. My opinion, is that yes, it was a great game growing up, but wasted many hours of my childhood while growing up. And money.  And money.

												I first played maplestory maybe 7 or 8 years ago and at first it was fun. (Note: my main interest is quests.)I remembered it was a game that, if you are a casual player, got harder and harder to progress as you went on. Eventually I stopped playing because it would take far too long to level up and make any sort of meaningful progress. Plus items like scrolls to increase certain traits of a weapon were pricey and overall the game was just slow.Fast forward to 2016 and I am back! It's a lot of fun now. Nexon have made certain parts of the game painless and have introduced new niche areas. Not interested in monsters or mapleworld? How about becoming a star/celebrity over at Star Planet? Want something different to the world of monsters and magic? Check out Friends Story, one of the alternative dimensions that's set in the modern world where you play a student!If you just want to do quests and wander about - the game now has a very good guide that will recommend the quests that are right for your level. I followed this guide and levelled up quickly, giving me more options to explore other parts of the game and even take on a big boss or two.Improving your weapons and equipment is now simple to do and doesn't take long at all.My main criticism of the game is that it seems like a neverending mess. Little to no structure and if you were looking for a main storyline to follow there isn't really one. Instead there are lots of short story arcs, or series of quests (one leading on to the next), which is great while it lasts but leaves you thinking - now what?Playing alone is fine, and I mainly solo, however playing with friends is a lot more fun.

												Pretty much a failed product after a long run. Old maplestory was much more of a challenge and everyone actually interacted. Now it's just a bunch of Cliques and groups that people stay in together and keep away the noobs. Expect to see smartphones and dumb cliche stories about high school life and pre-teen focused content. MapleStory was a fantasy world full of dragons and magical items with a feel of that little Warrior, Thief, Mage, Archer. It's just thrown out that feeling that makes you feel like a true adventurer and puts you in these cliche IM THE MAIN CHARACTER AND I MUST DO THIS IN ORDER TO BE STRONGER stories. It's honestly stupid. MapleStory has become a game where everyone is pretty much anti-social unless you join them in their talks about being ""azn"" and saying ""chuu~"" and ""imah pandah"" thus making them more comfortable enough to invite you to their little clique. The old days were full of nice people, people willing to talk with you and go on quests with you. ""Hey dude are you doing this quest to get this item"" ""Yeah wanna party up?"" was a very common thing to hear. Nowadays it's folk rushing to level 30 and farming spots saying ""cc pls"". It's disgusting. You don't have to agree with me it's just how I feel as to what this once magnificient game has become. By the way, almost everyone looks the same due to the popular looks taking over most of the population. Expect to see people with no pants, eyes almost closed, and hair that looks like it was straight out of Yu-Gi-Oh.RIP MapleStory. Big Bang damaged it. RED put into critical condition, Friendstory finished it off and cut life support.			"

												2003 maple story came out as the worlds first 2d side scroll mmorpg 2006 I started playing the game. maps were HUGE and not needed, item grabbing was so crazy just to get a rare drop, internet was Dailup and aol at the time, updates took forever and it got me excited, listened to experimental techno while staring at the backgrounds or waiting 5-10 minutes on an airship or toytrain/genie. Maple weapons were HUGE collectibles and it was just before they made the hero classes. Fast forward 10 years later to the same game and to call it the same is far from true... 10/10 would revisit old memories again if I wasnt 26 married college and have 3 bunnies to take care of.			"

												Repeat after me; ""I am not bored enough to start playing MapleStory again."" However, if you ever are bored enough to play MapleStory again it has most likely changed so much since the last time you played it that you experience it brand new again.If you are looking to try MapleStory for the first time I would go into it with the mindset of ""This game is meant for children, but that doesn't mean I can't have fun playing it."" Because the graphics, dialog, and even the animations are very childish but it is a fun game that will eat all your spare time for roughly two weeks, and then it will sit in your library for a few months. Then you'll delete it, then re-install it roughly one year later and repeat the process. "

												Played since beta in 2003.. even got all my screenshots from back then.. 10 years ago it was a great game! 10 years later the game is just horrible:Pay 2 Win: If your very high leveled and dont have a single piece of cash shop items or hairstyles, you will get mistakenly banned for being a botter, or treated like ♥♥♥♥ by the community.. oh and for the people who do spend money on the game you would be spending $15,000 USD or more to get the results you want.. (cubes and all) while spending $50 on the game wouldnt get you anything except a pet and all its lame accessoriesHackers Everywhere: Now i don't care how secure your account info is, or how many antivirus scanners you got, or even if you use that anti-keyloggable steelseries keyboard, YOU WOULD GET HACKED.. skilled people know how to manipulate nexon's database, exploit the pando downloader, or even right through the cash shop and gain access to your character and pin.. NOBODY in that game is safe.. best way to be safe in that game is not to brag about your gears or show off in youtube videosLame Economy: The in game Meso currency cap used to be 2.1billion but with so many complainers they finally increased it to 10billion.. though 10billion couldnt even buy you a decent weapon in that game.. since very great or even godly equipments cost about 60bill~120bill a piece..1. purchasing equips that cost more than the meso cap (which is pretty much everything in the game except pots) will require you to have a voucher.. you are 200.1% likely to get SCAMMED2. large trades through the trade window violates nexons TOS, your likely to get mass perma banned for having fradulent meso or even trading with illegal website farmers3. by the time you buy all the equips you want, you WILL GET HACKED.. nexon wont compensate you at allBotters Everywhere: The reason why everyone bots in the game is because the economy is so jacked up and expensive, no legit person can even afford a decent equips set.. alot of people resort to botting to accumulate alot of mesosCocky Players: Alot of the players in that game are self centered losers with 2million damage range or higher, if your damage is lower than theres they would either kick you out of partys and raids, or killsteal the map your training on.. oh this happens very often during 2x exp events unless you play on one of those underpopulated brand new servers but they even started to do that over there tooWrongful Bans: This happens ALOT and a good 85% of the people never do get their accounts back.. they have to start all over, some never play again.. you might be strolling through the free market, or henesys townsteet and walk into a map with a vac hacker, well your gonna get banned for hacking too not just that person, and nexon doesnt investigate nothing they just hellban everybody as they see fit, and when it does happen to you, their customer support takes great pleasure in refusing tickets and appealsI would recommend La Tale instead of Maplestory.. to anybody who plays it.. you've been warned			"

												I'm not as much of a reviewer that is going to dislike the game just because I have nostalgia goggles on, I'm going to give you a view of the game while including my own experiences to show you how the game is.This game as it is, in 2015, is an extremely pay-to-win driven game. Over the past 6 years (for me) they've consistently been dumbing down the game to where it practically plays itself with things like 100 level tomes which just make your character level 100 no questions asked, no effort produced. The sidequests are generally repetitive and unrewarding (and unrewarding isn't necessarily a bad thing if the quest was fun). They have special global quests (which when were created happened once a month or couple of months) every single day which reward you with gear for your level and experience automatically, you do not have to go out and kill mobs/bosses to get rare drops or complete a questline anymore.When I began playing Maplestory in 2009 it was a simple game that allowed you to do practically whatever you wanted, you had no guidance (or very little) and were encouraged to explore the entire world which made the game very fun, it was absolutely great at making you feel accomplished and as if you discovered something new. Now you have something called a Hyper Teleport Rock at almost all times (from the global quests mentioned prior) that can take you literally anywhere in the game, no long trekking, boss battles, or sense of adventure. You can avoid all of that. The game was more challenging which made it more enjoyable when you leveled up. Back then (pre Big Bang), to put how easy they've made the game into perspective, to get to level 30 generally took around a month and level 70 took maybe 4-6 months. Now, with no exaggeration, you can get to level 30 in an hour and level 70 in about 4 hours. You can hit level 200 (which pre Big Bang would have taken a year or more) in a week, maybe less.This game also never had a story, just quests. There was no ""ultimate evil"" or dedicated storyline, but they made that with the Cygnus Knights. I joined the game again just to play the Black Heaven storyline which was extremely boring. The character dialogue just droned on and on with no meaningful interactions, it was almost entirely just characters making cheesy jokes to eachother and other useless non sequiturs which completely dilutes the idea of an overbearing being, so I found myself just holding down my spacebar to fly through the dialogue a lot and I never felt like I missed any information. Then there were things you had to do, and you could tell it was just all filler content. You had to kill 30 of these robots, then go through the portal and kill 40 of them, then go through the portal and kill 60 of them and I wish I was kidding, you ACTUALLY do that up to 100 robots. And you do that a couple more times. You also do the same thing with collecting things from monsters you kill. They're forcing a story that has no weight and is so clearly thrown together that it hurts.This game is great if you're looking for just a straight casual MMORPG to just ♥♥♥♥ around in and waste time, if you want an experience and a challenge I would go find another game.

												With the direction this game is currently going in - No, I would not recommend playing MapleStory. I have been playing MapleStory for years, as such I've chosen to stick by it through good times and bad; but I have to say that I am not happy with Global MapleStory's choices, as of late. It seems that Global MapleStory wants to make itself the superior version of MapleStory, but it has a very half-♥♥♥♥♥ way of trying to achieve this. So far, pretty much every attempt at being different from the mother version of the game, KMS(Korean MapleStory), has been an annoying step-down from what could have been awesome. For the last few years, GMS has made unneccesary changes to content coming from KMS to make it seem like their version of MapleStory is somehow ""different"". The problem is, these changes have always been sloppy, and they've continued to hold the game back from being much better. In my opinion, what GMS should be focusing on is creating completely NEW content that could easily go side-by-side with anything we receive from KMS, rather than making nitpicky changes and removing pieces of content that players have been looking forward to for months. The main problem with the game is how Pay-To-Win it feels, and it is sad to see that unlike KMS, which has been slowely making attempts to make the game fair for non-paying players, GMS has continued to hold the game back in its Pay-To-Win state. For example, in the Korean MapleStory as part of the ""RED"" update they added things like an Auction House, allowing players to buy and sell items from other users without needing to purchase a permit with real-money. GMS has opted not to add this to the game, claiming that it had some ""problems that needed fixing"" but months have passed and we've seen no news on it actually coming for us. Another example of ways that KMS had attempted to walk away from Pay-To-Win (and another example of how GMS simply ignored those changes to continue on their Pay-To-Win path) is the ""Maple Mileage"" system which allowed you to optain mileage through playing the game, and having the option to pay for Cash Shop (real money) items using Mileage instead! This meant that anybody who played long enough could have the option to EARN Cash Shop items through playing if they chose to do so. Of course, in a decision that surprised no-one, GMS simply did not make any attempts to add this feature to our version of the game. There are many other features that helped even the playing field with paying players and non-paying players, and I could go on-and-on about what else GMS has decided to skip, but I'll stop there. (If you'd like, you could look up things like Additional Options which added all sorts of randomized stats to your items to help players who weren't quite powerful enough to fight Bosses for their loot. You could also look into how KMS added the ability to buy 'Maple Points' with in-game currency. Maple Points being an alternative to NX, which is what you use to buy things from the real-money 'Cash Shop'.)I continue playing this game in hopes that one day these things and more will be added to make the game friendlier to non-paying players, but only time will tell if any of these will happen. For now I would stay away from MapleStory, as it continues to give the Free-To-Play genre a bad name.			"

												I have played this game back in 2006 and I had a blast, everything was new to me, the settings, the people running around and killing snails on maple island then slimes and mushrooms in henesys hunting ground. Took many years of breaks in between, back and forth, but when they revamped the game and released big bang is when they started to lose the vast majority of players (slowly).I know that change is needed for games to progress, but so many changes killed the game.Pros:- if you're a fan of mario style games or platformers and like to see big numbers when you hit monster, then try out this game- it's not a grindy game anymore, *sadly* (at least not from lvl 1-200)- amazing map BGM's- a lot of friendly people still and so onCons:- p2w- bugs, bugs and yes, more bugs! ""yay!""- gets a bit grindy past 200 and gets a lot grindy past 200 if you didn't pay a lot of real money into it- the company NEXON America, doesn't care about their customers/playersI could go on forever with the cons and some more pros, but I'll stop here. If you're a new player, I suggest you try this game, but it won't feel ""magical"" anymore.Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game in the state it is right now. "

Ha ha ha ha!     xHermit1337: mesos plz     Nexon: Your NX transaction is complete. Thank you. I grew up playing this game as soon as it was out in North America, all the way back in 2005. I was just a kid then, not even a middle schooler. I spent most of my free time on the computer playing the game with my brother and his friends. Back then, leveling was SLOW; it would take a week just to get to Lv.30. The only way to level at all in your 2nd job was to PQ the same quests over and over half a dozen times just to level up once, and even once you did, you didn't find much content at the next level. Because of this, most of the original game was extremely social. The goal to getting anywhere was cooperating with other players, as interaction was key to success. Because of the snail-leveling, you would spend most of your time in one of the 6 towns, listening to gossip and learning important information, getting into Parties and Guilds, and making friends. This game was key to my survival, as I live in a hellish redneck ghetto town. My online friends helped me see the light through dark times, and I owe them everything; even a decade later. I stopped being very active after 2008, but did check on the game after BB. My original draft of this review was negative, but the modern maple is loaded with new content and 5x as many classes as the original game. Leveling is fast now; I could get 10 characters to level 30 in a day. Even then, there's still a lot of grinding. The EXP you need is a fraction of what it used to be originally. Money is still an issue, and the economy makes no sense to me. The cash shop is still a waste of money, and you are forced to spend real $ on skillbooks, or else your characters will be stunted in their later growth. The modern community is very antisocial because of the soloing aspects. It's not the same game I remember as a child, but this could still provide you hundreds of hours of content, and it's been free for a decade! If you're bored and want a free mmo to try, this would be one of your destinations for many years, and for good reason.			"

												TL;DR:PROS: levelling with quests and not just grinds, a lot of classes, findable good equips, great for new players (and old ones if they can get over the fact that the game isn't the same as it was 16 years ago)CONS: quiet community in-game, some party quests are completely deadI see a lot of reviews talking about how much the game has changed and how there's no nostalgia left for us older players. As an older player myself (I've been playing Maple off and on since 2006), I disagree. What brought me back to Maple after the last four year haitus I had was the nostalgia, but what kept me playing was the complete rehaul of the game.When I was a kid with dial-up internet, getting to the first job advancement was difficult. Fast forward to today: I have played almost every class through into the fourth advancement. Yes, it's been made a lot easier, but it's also reasonable now; any player can get a good diversity  of content regardless of experience or skill. The endless 10-20 level grind on the same map is gone, now theme dungeons and quests offer the best leveling chance, which is loads more fun. In fact, quests used to be altogether useless, so this change is super awesome.There's so many classes now! I was super happy when I came back to all the new classes. I actually can't wait for more to come out so I have more skills to try out. (I'm hoping there's an all-new class soon with new clothing equips and not just weapons.)The addition of spell traces and the equip enhancement system actually reduces the pay-to-win aspect that has ALWAYS (as in FOREVER, as in THIS IS NOTHING NEW) been a part of Maple. It offers people the chance to have good equips but without the ridiculous cost and rarity of scrolls. Equipment drops have been completely rehauled and now have hidden potentials, allowing players to find their equips without having to spend mesos or real money and to make a decent bit of mesos that help in the later game with pots and the like. (Side note: I remember the days of the scrolled out sauna robe, can't nobody tell me the new equip drop system is bad.)Us older players are not the major target of this game anymore and that's OKAY. It's for those kids coming in at the same age when we started back in the day. It's not entirely Maple and Nexon's fault that the previous audience left, a good deal of people left because they got older and found other games, particularly MOBAs. (Admittedly, the game community has gotten quieter and some party quests are dead, but, again, see previous point.)All-in-all, it's not right to make a crappy review on the game because it's changed over the course of over a decade and a half. The game is different, even easier, and that's totally cool. I think it's a great choice for new, young gamers with its cute graphics and background music. And if older players approach it as a different game than the one they remember, it can be really great for them too.			"

												**Edit** : If you look below my original bit, I went into a little more depth about how this game is pay to win, if you're not convinced. I don't cover all the reasons, but I do cover one of the main ones. Please, take my word for it, you don't want to play this game past the early game.EXTREMELY pay to win. The end game is utter ♥♥♥♥ for this reason along with various other problems ranging from lack of content to game breaking bugs that take forever to fix to extremely unbalanced classes.Nexon just doesn't care. Don't play this game, it's not worth your time. Find a private server, their service and gameplay is generally better.**Edit**I'm going to add this in due to some comments I've been getting about the game not being pay to win. Sorry if it's a bit disorganized, since this was meant to be a comment, however it went over the 1000 character limit :The potential system, to those who have not played this game yet, is basically an extra 2-3 stats tagged onto almost any peice of equipment. These stats account for the majority of a player's strength/damage, much more so than the stats you regularly get through upgrading items by in game means. These stats start out very poorly, and are rolled randomly by using what is called a cube. Occassionally, the tier of the potential will go up when you roll (This is quite rare, maybe 1 in 30 rolls give or take. Some people need around 100 if they're unlucky), giving access to better potentials. Note that these potentials are RNG, so as a warrior, you may very well get DEX, INT, LUK, M.ATK or any other useless stat 95% of rolls.To get a single cube through in game means takes up to a week, more or less. Crafting them is ludicrously expensive and trying to obtain them from killing bosses is pointless due to the ludicrously low drop rate ( To get one cube, you'd have to do a twice daily boss each day for on average a month, give or take. I say this from personal experience ).Of course, you could always BUY cubes. They're $1-$2 each (The $2 one is necessary for upgrading the final tier ), or they come in $10 and $20 bundles. Note that it's ONE DOLLAR TO BUY A SINGLE CUBE. Making a single end game tier item can take HUNDREDS OF CUBES, and that will get you almost NOWHERE progress wise. You need a FULL SET of these types of items to have a CHANCE at one of the end game bosses. This, coupled with the fact that group play is extremely discouraged in boss fights makes these end game bosses impossible (The HP on these bosses is in the hundred billions. Consider that I, a long time player who doesn't spend money can't shave even a fraction of their HP bars in 10 minutes. Now consider that most bosses have a 20 - 30 minute time limit).It is also impossible to make money in the game from 'end game' activities, because unless you have an extremely high damage range, all the bosses you will be able to fight have useless drops.I didn't even mention the fact that a lot of boss drops are trade locked unless you pay $2-$3 to untrade lock it for one trade.

												*Long wall of text sorry but this was on my mind for a long time*I use to play Maplestory a lot in the past, it was one of my most enjoyed games, like many I played since the early days, it was great, there was a whole lot you can do, even if there was limited classes at the time, heck not even 3rd job was in game but it was still awesome.Long ago tho I had lost interest within Mapelstory, not due to the game being boring, lack of things to do, well kind of, after a certain change it made the game become horrible in my eyes, due to making everything to simple, to easy and just lacking what Maplestory was long ago, causing it to lose what made MS fun and enjoyable.I know you might be asking ""what was the change that caused you to say such things, lashing out at this game, it is still quite fun and I like it."" the thing that broke the game was the addition of  the ""Big Bang"" update, what broke it wasn't the new classes or game play, the new areas you can explore and or the ability now to craft items and gear, no what to me broke Maplestory was that Nexon messed with the EXP tabels making it so you can hit max level without even trying.Sure it might not sound bad to you, tho here is  a list and examples ofwhat problems this caused for me and probably others.1. This update made PQs useless and really any type of party related things useless [PQ = Party quest] you would in the past need to make a group of 5 + people to go into dungeons, the dungeons would depending on where you had been in game need a certain group in order to play/beat it, like in Ludi PQ, you needed 1-2 mages, 1 theif, 1-2 warriors or so or a archer class in order to do areas within the quest, the theif would use their darkness skill [or what ever it is called] in order to sneek into a room full of mobs that 1 hit KO you, the mages would use their teleport skill to warp to spots others can't hit and the archer would use their bow and arrows for distance kills, the warrior was for dmg and tanking of the bossesI know this is a long text wall and I am sorry, the memories I use to have of making friends while in line waiting to do a PQ was awesome, having to do dungeon raids with them was great, the reason I also mention it makes doing parties useless is now that the exp tables have changed someone can solo lvl faster then when in a party, sure a nice exp buff from a Bishop is nice tho it isn't needed.2. The game is super easy to level up in now, in the past it use to take people atleast 1-2 years to hit level 200 sure I know that is a long time, tho now you can within 1-7 days hit that, since all you need to do is find out where high exp monsters spawn and grind kill them, now this is another factor as well, this will cause you to KS people [KS = Kill steal]  who happen to be doing the same thing as you and or would be doing the same thing as you.3. Changing of the classes, some for the good, the rest for the worst, I made a Dragon Knight, wanting to use it how it was in the past, you know with dragon roar, anyone remember that attack? I sure hope so, it was quite a scary and powerful attack that would hit 16 or so mobs within the AOE range for massive dmg and this was a warrior based class, that also you didn't have to be job class 4 to use it, only needed to be lvl 70, well now the Dragon Knight has been changed to be more of a spear based class, so dragon roar is gone, the most useful skill in my eyes for lvling up, I forgot the rest of the changes to it, tho it seems they gut a lot of classes for the worst.I will end this review here, I do like Maplestory, tho since the Big Bang update, it broke the game in my eyes, no longer do you need a party, you can just KS grind up to lvl 200 + by your self, they made the game to easy, if they could only add alt servers in that played like before the exp tabel changes but keep all of the new classes and what not, I think it would be more fun, since you would have to party up with people in order to get any where, it made me angry to see they would change their full game on their hard core fans like this and bring the game down the to such a level.

												Played Maplestory since 2008, when i was 7~ish. Constantly kept coming back to the game even though i told myself that i wouldnt. The game itself is very enjoyable, but the problem is that most of the playerbase is gone. I've played all the classes and gotten some characters to level 200+. Probably one of the best mmorpgs i've ever played. Most of the people you will meet are very friendly and will try to help you learn how to play. The game also has many events, most notably the anniversary events and seasonal events.10/10 would recommend. The reboot update on 12/2 will make the game less pay2win and will probably bring back some players/bring new players into the game.			"

												This game used to be fun, before Nexon decided it was smart to start adding new classes, essentially ending up with monster being set 1 area apart for leveling purpose. Before you used to have to work to gain in this game, now everything is practically handed to you like you're slow in the brain. An everything essentially good, they try to suck money out of you to get it.			"

												I've played this game for years before it became available on Steam. Loved it. Logged many hours on it. Met some amazing people on it. The artwork was engaging, and the gameplay was reminesent of the 2D scrollers I played in the 80s. To this very day, I still love it. But do I recommend it ? In its latest form, can I recommend it to the new players?Sadly, no.Call me an""old school Mapler"", but I can't recommend this game anymore. Why? For a number of reasons. Here is a few:-The core Explorer classes have been overshadowed by the numerous and, to a degree, overpowered new classes. Granted, this was all part of the overall storyline, but I still love the original classes more.-What hooked me most was the social aspect of the early days (year 3 onward...). Waiting to hop onto the big airship or waiting for the subway to come encouraged me to interact with the others as we waited. Since the big airship was all but replaced with the option to rent a private plane, the socializing is now almost non-existant.-Free Market now is a joke. Unless you can grind for hours in order to farm for ""mesos"", or can buy ""meso bags"" with real cash, nearly everything on sale in Free Market is grossly overpriced.While the features that were added over over time are helpful, I can't recommend this game to the new player. While it is still fun to play, MapleStory has moved to close to the ""pay-to-win"" mechanic that too many FTP games have become.			"

												The techno reboot of the theme music is so cringe worthy it needs to be banned.Not as big a fan now as I was with beta through the first five years. Too many one off classes. MAJOR MISTAKE in grouping servers, the Nova and Bellocan pair is the biggest mistake in all of gaming that I have ever seen - years later the two servers are still fighting to be what they were & bello's sh-tty market tanked the pair.On all servers: too many hackers, too many spammers, too many trash ""holiday"" events. I would've reccomended this 7 years ago.Bring back the MS that players came for, you've lost your OG & Beta players trying to make the game better when in reality the player count has never been lower and the customer service has never been worse.

												I have played this game since 2007-2008 and I can tell you the game has not only declined, it's plummeted. Hackers and botters were always an issue so I won't touch on that, as well as the P2W nature. We all know P2W is bad and I've sunk easily far too much money into this while I was still on my parents' alllowance. Still, many MMOs follow that route and I've become inured to it.No, what gets me is how far the game likes to think it's come when in reality it hasn't moved at all. On the one hand, I like the multiple character classes, as even though they feel just like all the others of their niche(Tank, glass cannon, rogue, etc.) there's little perks that make the classes interesting for a time(My favorite so far being Mechanic, though since I haven't played in ages they've likely been nerfed). That leads me to one of my main gripes: The lack of balancing for the numerous new classes. Not only that, but the game itself doesn't change to suit each new class and their newfound overpowered strengths or crippling weaknesses. This leads to many classes being pointless or obsolete(Who even plays as the classic four/five character classes anymore?) which clutters up the game.The game itself is very cluttered, as well. I get that traveling is a big part of any MMO or any game with a large world for that matter, but if your game is a 2D, linear style, the back and forth of traveling is a lot more tedious than choosing the shortest route in a 3D game. Not only that, many parts of the maps are just lines with no connecting rooms or hubs, leading to a lot of needless backtracking. However, this is another feature of the game that I got used to(Though pre big bang the map was a circle, which was very nice).Those are my two biggest qualms right now, though for the most part I don't feel comfortable completely bashing this game since I've had so much fun with it since when my brother introduced me to it as a young teen. I wouldn't recommend it in the state it's in, though. I'm going to try Mabinogi and other Nexon MMOs, though, because I've heard they're better now than Maplestory has been in a long time.			"

												Whut.Why is this game still alive?---Half a decade ago, MapleStory could be considered a pretty decent game. Four classes, places to go, and you can conduct social activities/experiments? Welp, sign me up!Except that was 5 years ago. Now, I felt that the game is just swamped with 'features' (being that they are a little more than gimmicks). PvP arena has, in my experience, died out after a few months of activity 3-4 years ago. I'm now swamped with event quests that I'm not even interested in doing. Hell, even the community as gone worst over the last five years. I still remember the times where, at the boat from Ellina to Orbis, the players, as passagers, would do some kind of crazy shenanigans to pass the time (hell, there are dedicated Balrog killers just in case one showed up). Now? you buy a plane mount, head to the station, go into transit, and then stare into the screen in boredom as you count down the timer. Now, if you are the adventuring type, prepare to lone-wolf the game 90% of the time; most of the 'social' groups camp in Henesys nowadays.And the grinding. Yeah, prepare to mindlessly grind your way through. At least a few years ago you would have parties that would happily join you. Now? *sigh*Five years ago, I would of recommended this game. Now? Nah. Look for something else, or do stuff in real life. Now, any task is more useful than this failure of a time-waster. "

												I started playing this game way back in 2005 when it was still technically in beta. I played for a long time.  It took six months just to get to level TWENTY!! Now... it takes literally 10 minutes.  There was something great and fresh about the game. At the time, it had four classes.  Now, over thirty.  To be perfectly honest.  Once the breaking (an event in game that reshaped the map and landscape) happened a couple years back the game went from being awesome to being unimportant.  No longer did I feel connected to my character or the world around me with its great stories and characters.  It became all about how much damage a character could put out and how fast you can max your levels (and with multiple classes).Maple Story is a game I love, a game I cherish in my memories and had some really great fun playing with many of my friends.  I would love to recommend but can no longer do that.  The game I love is no more.  I really just doesn't exist anymore. All that being said, I have read and heard others saying that they always come back to it.  I will admit, I usually check it out for a few days every 6 - 12 months.  Nothing has changed though... the lack of charm is still gone.  Sad.  Really sad.Miss my Maple			"

												To me I had fun in this game, it felt like a genuine adventure, a place to explore with unique landscapes and monsters. None of this ""save the world"", ""your the choosen one"", class backgrounds filled with melodramatic tragedy of a chosen underdog. Just a simple adventure game, like the original classes are called. Though I am sure that people who only know of this itteration of maplestory can't quite understand what it was like, but the best way I can put it is.... it could be frustrating and cruel but it was fun and forced people into situations where they could connect and converse. There was a time in which certain maps acted as chat rooms/lounges. People would show off their equipment and levels, share stories, tips, guide new players, tell jokes, help other players through leeching parties, trade valuable items. Sometimes people (myself included) would drop exccess gold or rare loot that we either couldn't use or were not interested in. This was before gold had value beyond pots, so items were goods that were traded for other goods, occasionally gold (for pots). It was a far less... toxic feeling place. Far less bugs too.Wrote a rant about how they simplified everything and stripped away the uniqueness and challenge of certain classes in pursuit of molding every class into the same thing with different visual animations. And with this story stuff it just feels condescending to it's target audience. They could write a better story..... I'll stop here.			"

												okay, so I've played this game on and off probably since I was 10 or 11 years old. I have put countless hours into this game and it will forever and always hold a speical place in my heart.That being said...The GoodThis game is MASSIVE! By virtue of it being such a long standing MMO, it has more conntent then I could ever hope to see.Grinding (And ooohhhh yeah there's A LOT of that...) has some suprising little challenges that make it more tolorable.It has a unique artstyle and gameplay as compared to most MMO's.It has a lot of charm if you're willing to sit through the other stuff.The BadUm... There's a whole lot.The comunity seems to have fallen appart. I've heard of MMO's with toxic comunities. Maplestory's is non existant. There's a group of max level players that seem to... enjoy? them? Selves? (They sit in cities waiting for people to ""fame"" them.) I Actively attempted to have social interactions with other individuals, and failed. Miserably. They're just... not there. Or they simply seem to not care. At all. It's so borring to do anything after a while. I've been playing since I was ten, and it probably took me 25+ hours just getting one character to level 100 (Which is less than half-way to max level) and... it wasn't fun after the inital 20 or so. I did it just because it was like my childhood dream to have a character at the final job advancement.Also, balance is non-existant. Certain classes are just WAY more fun and WAY stronger than other classes. That's just part of the game. (I guess that's not nessisarily bad. It's just something to be aware of)The UglyIt's... it's an old game. It shows. It feels like they keep trying to put more and more paint on it, and now it feels like it's just that... Paint. A facsimile of it's former self. Almost like someone has taken a dead relative and taxadermised they're corpse and prettends like they're still alive. (A bit of an extreme example, but acurate nonetheless.)The end.I am done with this game, it's not fun for me anymore. If you decide to play it, maybe you'll find something I didn't and have more fun then I did. I sinceerly hope you do. But I honestly suggest you play a different game. or wait for Maplestory 2 to come out. I know I'll be giving it a shot, haha. (Seriously, it's a thing give it a look.)			"

I went on after 5 years and had no idea what was happening. But it is still a fun game, coming off of a game that you pay for and has optional in game transactions I forgot how hard f2p games make you want to buy stuff in them. But now that nexon has actually gotten a support center after all these years and they helped me get my hijacked account back, un-banned, and un-bound from a steam account I can say that the game is now about 50/50. It's not as good as it used to be because games are now mainly in 3d and they stuffed to much stuff in and made it confusing, but it is still fun and nostalgic.

												This was my favorite game ever back then. Even if I couldn't get past level 40 (due to the sheer stupidity of a child's mind), I still played it daily and never got tired.Going back to this game a few months ago, for the sake of nostalgia or what not, it took me just barely a week to get bored of it.-The game, at its core, is now a complete grindfest for clearing maps of monsters every 10 seconds.-The community that was upon a time is now long gone.-You can speed through levels like nothing, what was once two week's work to get to lv 30 (a month's work prior Big Bang patch!), is now less than a day's work. There is barely any feeling for accomplishment left.- A LOT of party quests are now easily soloable. There is no point for looking for party members to do them (not that there is much of a community left to do so).In a nutshell, that's what I found of the game I once loved. I still do love it for what it gave me then, but not as it is and what it offers now.If you want a quick nostalgia trip, go for it. Install the game, give it a few days to a week or two, then leave it.If you're looking for a game to invest gameplay time in, take yourself somewhere else.			"

												This is a review based around the Reboot server. Reboot was one of the major goods the Nexon did to this game, and it was an update big enough to bring the community back to life in its last dying breaths. Nexon America, notorious for focusing only on pushing out content and collecting as much profit as possible, rose above and listened to the community for the first time in a while. They finally addressed the fact that their game was heavily pay-to-win based. I do agree that it was rather scummy to save this as a last resort instead of doing it earlier, but the fact remains that they did it, even at the risk of losing money.Reboot is a GMS server different from all the others, in that the only items you can buy using real money are purely cosmetic, aside from pets. Pets are definitely needed for fast grinding of mesos in the late-game, but even they can be earned by killing Hilla, a mid-game boss.MapleStory will always hold a place in my heart, even long after I leave. Through the layers of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Nexon coated the game in, there's a genuinely good game with an expansive world and a great community. I was long gone and done with the regular servers but Reboot brought me and tens of thousands of other players back, allowing everyone an equal oppurtunity.We can even see now that Nexon is slowly beginning to address bugs and balance issues. In recent patches, Nexon was also able to add new content that was meaningful and well made, while also balancing characters and fixing bugs. They also give out items if ever they make mistakes that mislead players or affect gameplay, fixing it right away as well.I have many other things to say about the game, but I think everything beyond what I've said so far is purely subjective and will be up to the player whether or not they like it.

 First a little background I have played maplestory since early 2006 and I've kept playing since then. I have 6 level 200+ characters amd will continue to make more. I am an MMORPG fanatic and I really enjoy the 2D side-scolling games. I recently got Maplestory on steam to avoid using the horrendus Nexon client. Review This game has a lot of grinding. A lot of grinding. Much like WoW, in Maplestory you constantly grind and are trying to level up your character to get better gear, a new job advancment, etc. That is one of the aspects I love the most about this game. In a game such as WoW you get new abilities every 4-5 levels depending on what level you are, in Maplestory you get things called job advancments. Basically, you have a certain moveset with certain abilities, you can upgrade these abilites until you reach a certain level, and then you get a new set of abilities. This is one of my favorite aspects of Maplestory and it really makes it unique. The player base in Maplestory is also awesome, everyone on here is extremely nice and it can be really fun to just talk to other players rather than grind. There are many other things for you to do besides grind of course; You can do ""dungeons"" where you are sent to a certain area for 10-15 levels and do quests for the NPCs there and have a lot of fun learning the lore, you can also fight massive bosses with other players (this is much like a raid in WoW). There are so many fun things to do in Maplestory which is why I have played the game for so long and will continue to do so.			"

												i have played this game since i was little despite what steam says, i have only had steam for less than a year. i have put countless hours into this game and absolutely say this game is pay to win. ignore everyone else who says this game is now pay to win, this game is very much pay to win. without paying you wont make it far at all in the game. without money you wont be able to make meso (the ingame currency) to support yourself with equips and weapons. not only do you need money to get the equips but these equips BARELY allow you to deal with enemies that are your lvl and still leave you lacking. early on in the game you will find that just to fight certain bosses you will need to be funded or rely on other who ARE funded. not only this but the entire free market is run by people who are funded and are selling items that drop from bosses you can only defeat with tons of funding. one certain area, root abyss, to defeat one boss you need a party of highly funded players just to defeat it despite the lvl req is 180 you will need to do atleast 4m damage per line if you wish to attempt it with a party or 15m if you want to attempt soloing. not only do you need to fund yourself but its a gamble in itself. the main way to use your money to adavance in the game besides buying the equips needed it improving your equips. without improving your equips, your equips STILL wont get you far into the game. the way to improve your equips is by buying an item from the cash shop called ""cubes"". in current maplestory, as of 7/22/14, there are red cubes and black cubes (black cubes cost more yet yeild an apparent greater chance of improvement). basically items have a potential which means the items have a chance to provide bonus stats. there are 4 tiers of potential: rare, epic, unique, and legendary. as the tier progresses, the bonuses become more usefull but only if the stats if provides are actually meant for your class. not only does this in itself make it a gamble but the chance of getting your own stat is pretty low. aside from that the rate to upgrade a teir is EXTREMELY LOW meaning you will have to pay more to get that low chance of an increased teir. this same ""money whoring"" cube system is also used for ""bonus potentials"" which is the same thing but just more rare to find an item that yeilds bonus potential (more money for nexon if you want to improve bonus potential too). aside from cubing you can also try scrolling items but as you would expect, the only decent scrolls only have a chance of working meaning if it fails, itll take up one slot of however many your equips has meaning the items max stat potential is decreased. not only do these scrolls have a chance of failure but some of these scrolls even have a chance to destory your item if it happens to fail, and the only way to protect your item if you wish to risk one of these scrolls (which are typically the best) is to buy a ""guardian scroll"" which is again, in the cash shop for a moderately high price.without any of this above, making it through the game will be extremely difficult, or even impossible. at certain points early in the game, bosses even become impossible to defeat without funding. this doesnt stop at bosses though, about halfway through the game it becomes too difficult to even defeat the enemies needed to train and level up.whether you take my word for it or not, if you want to try the game feel free to, it is a  free to download game afterall.

												I cannot fully explain how frustrating it is how Nexon destroyed this game. I used to play this game as a kid for hours. This game used to be perfect with a very large community, awesome party quests, easy and comfortable controls, awesome class balance, people spending hundreds of dollars on NX, and a community of Maple videos. The awesome video makers from dray86 to greencream to goldentot. I used to even make some of these maple videos. You can check them out at youtube/NaBeHobby.It was paradise if you loved mmo rpgs where you can easily make friends and have tons of fun for hours. People were having in game relationship and marriages for the love of God. This game was, in my opinion, by far a better game than WoW until... They completely ruined it after the Big Bang Patch. Everything is simplified, new classes overpower the older classes, people leaving the community, and devs only care about your money.This game used to be a 10/10 game for me. I used to spend hours and hours everyday throughout my middleschool and halfway highschool. Now it's 2/10. It's very frustrating when my most favorite game turns out crappy because the devs were corrupted with greed. I can only hope Star Citizen will be able to replace this for me.I will miss you, Maplestory. You were that hot girl that I had a crush on, were going out, but then cheated on me. You broke my heart. How could you. I will always remember the times we spent together.			"

But even then, i still say dont play it. its fun, but only if you like hings handed to you, the enemies die no matter what, there's no challange, so dont play it. i will continue to do so, hoping for the day when the game returns to its former state, and it requires effort. and i can see the days when maple story was great.... everything seems to be going to crap these days.

												I put a lot of hours into this game, it is very unique in that it's a 2D sidescroller MMO. In this review, it appears that I have less than an hour clocked in; this is due to the fact that you are locked into creating a Steam account and cannot log into an existing one. What a drawback. I really enjoyed the wide selection of classes that were available, but at one point, Maplestory only started adding classes for account-buffs or to attract returning players. The entire market is basical broken on a regular basis, and hackers commonly plauge popular maps. Hell, even I hacked to see how easy it was. Despite the boost that insta-teleporting, auto-macros, and godmode gave, the entire game was still just a slow grind to the next level. After that it's all about the equipment. For what though? Don't get me wrong, I loved this game for the longest time and I wish I could find that pleasure in it again, but Nexon has turned this game into a cash-cow, claiming 'free-to-play' in their advertisements. Trust me when I say it's free-to-start, pay-to-compete, hack-to-play, quit-to-win.			"

I made another character until he reached level 50, the next day  he was wiped and ive spent actual money out of my pocket on that account.

												This was one of the very first games I played to experience extreme power creep. Every few months, a new class is released, or an old one is comletely reworked to be stronger. 90% of the time this new/reworked class is the most powerful thing in the entire game and you see ~50% of the community playing it. This cycle repeats itself as every class is made stronger and stronger until the monsters of the game need to be buffed to compensate. There's also the horrendously pay-to-win microtransactions that make the power-curve between ""funded"" characters and ""unfunded"" completely incomparable. Maplestory is long dead. Move along.			"

												MapleStory is more of an Old-School MMORPG, and a good one at that which I'll give, but I just don't like how trying to level, hell, even get a job class is, it's more of a chore than ""fun"".  I mean yeah if it wasn't a grindfest or when trying to do something isn't a chore, I'll give it another go, but the game blew it's chance with me.  It's more of a Pay-2-Win than a Play-4-Free, I don't mind if a game has stuff you want that you can buy with real money, but when trying to do my job quest, I was so lost(As everyone would in any MMORPG) but until I found out what to do, were they challenging and fun to do?  Well, yes and no.  Why?  Yes, they are challenging and I like that, but, no, they have such annoyance and can be TOO hard to where it's not even fun, but a nuisance.Honestly, I just hope Maple Story 2 isn't as annoyance as this, and much less of a grind fest, or Pay-2-WinFor a side scroller, if you're annoyed by the nuisance it has, you're better off playing a 3D sidescroller called Elsword, which is basically the opposite of the bad I posted about this gameThis is basically an edit of my original review of this game, when first reviewing it I was a bit rash and having it come out to not turn out as a review.

At the start of the simulator, you are given a choice of a job and a title. Immediately afterwards, you are taught to hunt animals. You are to use the enemie's carcasses in order to earn money. You get stronger as you get more experienced in the art of killing.The most realistic part of the simulator would be the people in the game.

												tl;dr- no.Maplestory has changed a lot over its ten year career, but at its core it is still a complete and utter grindfest. Though the time it takes to get to an acceptable level to really explore the content that the game offers has been shortened, it still feels extremely long and drawn out. And even if you end up actually making it to this level you reach a point where getting gear overtakes leveling in priority, the cost of acquring entry level gear for fighting some mid difficulty bosses becomes pretty high. At this point is where the game really blossoms. There is a rather decentvariety of bosses and encounters, and are often rewarding and create a cool sense of progression and challenge. But, after this point is where the fatal flaw of the game lies. You reach a point where the only way to  progress is invest a major amount of money into gear, larger than many other f2p games. Aside from that, still a fun game, but lacks the same charm and community it had when it came out.+ Gives a great sense of character progression+ Many varied classes to choose from + Nostalgic+ Mushrooms+ Still addictive - Pay2win- Devs and customer support don't really care about their players just that sweet $- Huge amount of time needed to reach an endgame level (even for an MMO)- Lacks the same sense level of community it had in its earlier age- Gigantic gap between funded and unfunded players- Some Classes just don't have an even remotely competitive level of DPS- Even an equipment slot that holds stats is gated by a pay barrier- An Incredible amount of botters- After quitting there is a 100% chance of asking ""Why did i do this to myself""			"

												This game has wasted my life I have played since 2006. At first it seems boring and think this game is stupid but then after a while you get addicted it is absolutly no fun at all just press 1 button to kill something and keep doing that over and over until u lvl up.But the desire to get new better equipment keeps you going grinding forcing yourself to play through this boredom for better equipment.Since I started playing so much stupid random things have been added so much that any person who is not willing to play litrally 24/7 could not possibly do everything or obtain everything on this game, BUT you could pay nexon of course and save all that time to get your rewards and obtain whatever you want as long as nexon gets into your wallet.This game is pay2win nexon and the most greedy corporation you could imagine I played for sooo long at know the ins and outs of this game but still im considered a noob because I have bad damage and equipment because I did not pay any money for equipment or damage therefore I am noob even though I know exactly how this game works, have played for ages the fact that no money was spent I have very low damage.Nexon do not care that your accounts get hacked their support system takes ages to get back to you and when it does get back to you they do nothing to help you anyway. Hackers run the game and nexon pretends that they care. If you did pay money for this game and want to buy end game equipment well guess what? nexon says that is illegal your only allowed to carry 10b at one time and end game equipments can be worth 100b+ making scams easier. Don't waste your time with this game... Unless you are very rich and willing to pay thousands of dollars for some pixels.			"

												Maplestory has to many starting bugs and crashes in it that it doesn't function well at all. It crashed 5 times in the matter of 5 minutes with my 1,700$ computer and sometimes the log in screen crashes. This is not for people that don't have patience, good internet, or a good computer.The gameplay is fairly addicting for an RPG game. It's satisfying seeing your character level up and unlock new skills with gametime. You can choose between many classes that all have unique skills, so you won't get bored. But like all RPG games you must grind until you die. Grinding is a major part in this game and most RPG games, so if you don't have the patience to grind, I reccomend you not to play maplestory.

												Sorry Just can't recommend a game that takes 20min. just to get through a tutorial and that's just skipping through the dictionary of dialoge the have during the process. There was literally so much dialoge that after 5min. of reading everything and not even getting to any kind of action I just started skipping everything and still it took another 5min. just for me to kill some little rabbit things? I don't even know if i'm fully done with the tutorial I refuse to go back and check because of how boring it was just sitting there trying to skip everything and play the game. The game could also do better with a more readable GUI. Everything is extremely small and also crazy confusing. I had to change my controls also because it just felt too weird attacking with ctrl and jumping with alt. How hard could it have been to just implament a jump and climb mechanism into 1 keybinding as a default setting? Anyways clearly I have no write to fully go over this game as I'm still in the tutorial I think and don't even know how good it is due to the lack of enjoyment I had trying to just get the the part where I PLAY the game and not read 5 more chapters of bs they put in the beggining. So if you think the game is fun that's cool and all, but until they make a better tutorial I'm going to just uninstall this game as it bored me within the first 10 min. of hoping I could kill something or get to the action. Overall: 3/10Gameplay: ?/10 (wish I got to experience this) "

												Don't let my 12 hours fool you. I have played for a VERY long time. This game used to be fun. I remember spending HOURS grinding (which was FUN! Fun grinding. I KNOW!) and leveling my character. I remember how hard it was to chhose between the classes. They were each fun and awesome. Then everything changed when Aran was introduced. HOLY ♥♥♥♥. Some of my fondest memories of all the games I've ever played come from the experience of swinging a giant pole-axe around and wrecking face. But it was hard as ♥♥♥♥ to level. And I loved every minute. But I slowly got older. I stopped logging in as often. Why? New classes. The freaking new classes. The little ♥♥♥♥ of a dragon wizard was the last straw. I couldn't take it. What had they done to my beautiful game?Then, to blow my fondness and love for this game into tinier shards, BOOM! BIG BANG! (Man, ♥♥♥♥ big bang.)Changing the entie world? What idiot that that would be a good idea? Whatever. It can't be that bad! So, I decided to start playing again, and I realised something horrible in the first couple hours! HOURS! My lovely, cute, AMAZING game had been corrupted. With power creep. SO. MUCH. POWER CREEP. (If you don't know what that is, search it up.) Like come on! I got to level 80 (80!!!) with SO much ease. It sickened me. What had happened? What made it this way? Oh right. Money makes the world go 'round eh?I love this game. But it is a bittersweet love. I hate what it has become. I love it for the friends, memories, and good times it's given me. But I hate it for not telling me it was going to change, so I could play just a little more, cherish it a little harder. It's hard to find good MMOs nowadays. This is... WAS a shining example of a good MMO. Now, it is a glammed up, shiny, flashy carcass. A shell of a once amazing game. No. Not a game, but a masterpiece, because everytime I look at this game, I remember a happy time. And everytime I look at this game, a sadness for what once was creeps into my heart.♥♥♥♥ you, Maplestory. You beautiful son of a ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												I used to play Maplestory around 2005 while in highschool, and to me it was extremely difficult to get to level 120 as a Bowmaster. Every couple months since 2006 I wanted to play the game as a game I could sink some hours into just to get the grind out of my system, but due to compatability issues, I could never ever return to the game unless I went through these ridiculous changes to my OS and when I did, the game was so different and I felt I missed so much and the learning curve was so drastic at the point of where I was that I simply was dettered from rejoining the game, so my Maplestory experience so far ended there.Fast forward to 2015, I find out that Maplestory is now accessible through Steam. So I decided to do a little research and see if I could pull up my old account and start up my Bowmaster and just be higher average in the game. I get my archer back, but man EVERYTHING is different, but in a good way.Game was much easier to get into, the learning curve and leveling process was MUCH easier, there were a lot of classes to choose from, all with their own style of gameplay and storyline, and each as good as the last.Pros:- Easy learning curve- Every class is good and visually pleasing- Big numbers are oddly satisfying which there's plenty of- Grind Heavy, but time will fly easilyCons:- Grind Heavy- There are certain parts of the game where you can get experience bottlenecked for certain classes- The social aspect of the game is near none, so it's very hard to get a group or make ANY friends at all- Some microtransactions are neccessary to get min/max unless you play for a LONG time********TL;DR********Easy learning curve, a lot of classes to choose from and each one is as good as the last. Big numbers everywhere, but very grind intensive. Be prepared to play this game alone, as there's no socialness here.			"

												MapleStory is basically my childhood; I played it alot in Middle School, alot in High School and even some in college.  I spent two years getting to level 70 on a Page, which was one of the harder, boring classes to play back then.  It felt awesome getting to White Knight status (being probably the only one running around) after two whole years of grinding and socializing in-game.  Then, almost over-night, it all became for nothing.  The White Knight became seriously overpowered, the levelling system went from taking two years to two weeks to two days to get higher levels, and everything I knew and thought I had worked for became almost worthless.  The point is, this game changes really quickly (as MMOs should to survive).  The tactics I had painstakingly learned became obsolete, as had my dedication to being unique in the game.  The reason I can't recommend this game is simply because it's very polarizing in structure: either you're dedicated to playing full-time, or you're not.			"

												I had a quick try, and at the end I discoverd something, what the heck. This game is just to secure and the community is just... wow who am I co-operating with? Unlike most MMOs, you have to REPEATIVLEY kill enemies friendly or not, until you just get bored and give up on the quests. All the quests are is to kill monsters till you drop or talk to a certain person thats a few worlds away. This is also a P2W. Sometimes, the game just begs you to buy stuff (Mostly clothing). The storylines are just like the story authors just copy pasted a whole fanfiction onto the script. Another thing is, it gets bored after a while. Oh yeah, and before the game, good luck remembering a whole  bunch of passwords for the game.			"

												Where it says I havent played this game at all/a couple of hours. That's totally wrong. Ever since the 2005 beta started ( yes, i was 8 years old), I played the living ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. Its fair to say I have put tens of thousands of hours into this game. It was REALLY good when it first started. It really brings back good memories playing this game when i was younger. It allowed me to escape my depressing child hood life. That being said, this game has really declined from being an awesome f2p into practically a p2p. The reason it is a pay to play is that you either have to spend thousands of dollars in order to become strong. Or spend hundreds of hours hoping the farming will pay off just to get one item with 3 lines of maybe decent bonus potential.I dont regret playing this game. But, If i was asked if someone should play this game at where it is now. I would never in a million years agree recommend it. EVEREdit: I still don't recommend this game if you dont have the time to put into it. I played between october 2014 to january 2015 and clocked over 500+ hours (steam launch wasnt working from when i played some of the time.). I got to lvl 205 and 6+ other character to 120+.. That being said, I put over $200+ into just because I wanted better equips to go bossing. It's also pretty hard to get into training parties without hitting 500k+ a line. Was it worth it? at the time yes. But do i regret it? ♥♥♥♥ yeah i do...All in all, if you have the time to put into it, then sure, do it. If not, then dont waste your time.TIP FOR STARTING PLAYERS: You go into the game and they recommend you a very low populated server; dont do it and thank me later. Join either Windia, or Bera. Maybe Scania if you feel like being edgy.			"

												I've played Maplestory for 10+ years. I've recently decided to use Steam for it.To break it down, Maplestory is a fun game, provided you have a good reason to start and to continue playing. It helps with the fact that the game has constant events and promotions. But even more important than that is to have friends to play with. Like every other game, without friends, Maplestory becomes a bit dull.I originally fell in love with the game because I absolutely loved the fact that there were so many places to explore, so many hidden areas, and so many things to do, accomplish, and to figure out. I played pre-Big Bang update (Shoutout to players who played around that time xD), where leveling up used to be an accomplishment. Now, levels (at least early on) are given practically for free. With 2XP events going on all the time, and various different things that boost that even further like Cash Shop items, Maplestory ceased to become the thing I first fell in love with. But eventually, they added the new level range 201-250, and then I took that and started playing the game again. It had the same frustratingly difficult level system like before, but it was nostalgic.Maplestory is a nostalgic RPG game, still having most of its former charm, and it continues to draw in many players. Though many Steam players do not play the game because people on Steam are mostly there for the large online community of FPS games and the like, it's still an amazing game. I recommend it 100%, provided that you have the continuous motivation of playing the game.This game is a rather special game. The first of its genre (a Korean MMORPG), Maplestory was and still is amazing. I believe that Maplestory is a rather impressive game that has the potential to do much more amazing if they just made the game more multiplayer themed. As of now, all you can do is farming and party quests together. Though they did have the occasional PVP thing going on, the way Maplestory is set up makes that rather difficult. If they can find a successful way to integrate that or make more ways to play together, then this game would be the successful game in North America it is in South Korea.Oh, as courtesy, here's the summarizationTL; DR: Farming Simulator for over a decade, enjoyable with friends			"

Nightmares of meso sellers, @@@@@@ spammers, 'cc plox/gtfo KS'er, I report you', and many other similar horrors. *NOT* recommended to anyone, especially if you value free time and your very soul. Whether you take my word for it or let it pull you under the suffocating tar, is your decision alone.*Note* It may seem like a innocently fun game with a reasonable amount of grinding, don't let it fool you. The insidious nature of this time suck only serves to cement you into a mediocre experience that's really not worth your time. As much as I loved it for quite a little while, I can't even bring myself to care about it any more than to leave a warning *un*recommendation to ward off anyone sane from considering it.Now, if you like the game, fine..But just because ""You can and it's free"", doesn't mean you should.1.5 out of 5 score.

												2 years ago MapleStory was fun and easy to play, where you can easily reach to 170+ or the level cap (200), but at 2014 all of that changed, resulting many maplers to quit even with new updates, all training maps has been significantly nerf making it hard to reach the level you want, however this game offers many different classes to play and try. In MapleStory there are many servers (over 10 servers to choose from), but a majority of the servers contains unfriendly community and tends to lag a lot. I would recommend this game to those who are willing to play more than a year, but overall if you play for a few weeks you will quit. Not only that MapleStory contains a lot of hackers and the the company, Nexon tends to get DDoS attacks (at least once per month), this will affect a lot of games including Combat Arms and Mabinogi, which will cause massive lag and disconnection. Play at your on risk and avoid flamming and raging.			"

												Increadibly addiciting, but sadly due to a recent update I no longer reccomend this game. My reasons are this:Way back when, when the game was still new my sister showed me this game. I installed it and started to play. got to level 20 and had a bunch off goodies. Then something happened to where the game was unplayable. So I stopped playing.Now then, the second time around I saw it on steam, Thinking back to the fun I did have with it, I decided to give it a shot. Got all the way to level 30 and have good enough gear and items, knocking out quests left and right. Till a recent update to where the game does not launch through steam anymore. It goes to a black screen then remains running in the background but does not play. Unacceptable in my book considering this game was made long ago. The bugs should have been ironed by now. Once I am able to get back in game and be able to play without fail, I will take this down. But for now I do not recommend MapleStory for Steam Users.			"

												This game was good back then, dont even attempt to play it now. its so complicated that only beta/alpha players would understand how to play it. its an extremely fun game but its a wallet taker. Once you get into it, you're not going to want to get out, so be careful.			"

												No, maplestory is not fun. All you do is grind boring mobs/PQ's to max level. (Also I have over 500+ hours in non-steam client). I can admit at first it was fun, however, as I look back on it there was no point to leveling since the end-game content really sucked.			"

												MapleStory is a free to play side scrolling mmorpg.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok. Artwork is chibi style characters. This game was released in 2005.CONS:- Bug at the Please Wait MapleStory being launched has There is no Disk in drive error. = cancel 6 times to continue.- Changing resolution to what it recommended crashed the game. - The soft keyboard for putting in your PIC is a stupid idea the way it is made.- Has some annoying features.Try it, if you like side scrolling mmorpgs.  I don't suggest you invest real money on this game.For more info:

												Before it came out on Steam, I remember playing Maplestory with only 4 classes. Warrior, Mage, Bowman, and Thief. Over the years Maplestory has evolved into something almost completely different. Some old players have given it up because the game has grown at a rate that rivals other popular MMORPG's like World of Warcraft. The main draw of this game is cooperation. Without friends by your side, the climb to become the most powerful mapler in the land and the challenge of defeating the Black Mage, who has inflicted chaos on the Maple World is a very long one. Luckily the game doesn't require much to run and it's even easier to make friends on your first day of playing. I've met 5 people myself who I owe my well being to. They made me who I am today. Now what's different about this game? What makes it stand out? The art style. Today, 2-D MMO's have either died out, become obscure with about 500 players playing a day, and/or become a 2-D 3-D hybrid. Maplestory is one of a kind where you can compare it to those days of playing Megaman on your NES. 100% Sidescrolling, Shoot em' up, Beat em' up, RPG, Multi-Event, Party Questing, Adventure that anyone can get into. So what are the cons? Every MMO has 1 or 2. What's wrong with this game? Well, you remember how I said this game relies heavily on community? Unfortunately, the community has become more secluded/hostile than it used to be. Pre-BigBang you could jump on a ship that goes to Orbis and meet up with some of the most powerful players in the game or the weakest and have friendly conversations with them for about 20 mins until you arrive at your destination. Today, Maplestory has become elitist. So unless you come in with friends or decide to take a weak player under your wing it's a bit more challenging to make strong relations here. Speaking of relations beware of Gender Bender players. Quite a few players choose excessively appealing avatars to swindle money and items from people of the opposite sex through marriage. Yes, this game has marriage. Always a juicy source of gossip in the maple world, marrying someone who divorced a top player is practically the same as being a top player.Overall, Maplestory is an amazing game that not only has an entertaining storyline, but also has some of the most addicting RPG gameplay to date. Despite what many people say, unless they put in their first 8 hours the review typically isn't worth it. Give it a try! Play for 2 hours and watch your time fly away!			"

												After logging quite a few hours into this game over the years I figured it was about time I wrote a review. The game is fun but there's a LOT of grinding. Not like world of warcraft grinding where the quests are all different. Maplestory is go to this place, kill X amount of these, and repeat for every quest in the game. Once you get to a high enough level boss fights are pretty fun but that's after grinding up to that level. Party quests are fun to do though. It makes the incessant grinding a lot more bearable.The loot system is pretty basic where all the enemy's stuff gets thrown to the floor and you run over it button mashing to pick it all up. That gets kinda old after a while but luckily there's pets that pick up the loot for you! That you have to pay for... Gotta make money somehow I guess?One of the charms Maplestory has is the platforming. There's a few quests where you parkour around to get to the next one. Those were always enjoyable (if infuriating at times) and a nice breather from the grinding.Overall Maplestory is a pretty basic game. Kill this, get experience, level up to get new skills so you can keep grinding. It's more of a game you play if you have a summer with nothing really else to do. It's not the best game but it's not the worst either. The events were always really fun though and one of the reasons I keep revisiting this game. So yes, recommended if you have a lot of time to kill.			"

												To get to anywhere in Maple. 1. be in a town that has a quick move and allows you to go to dimension portal go to the town known as momijigaoka. from there ( if you are over lvl 50) go to the dimension portal again and go to the Party Quest area. Leave that map. when you come back out you should be in Mushroom Shrine. Find the Green Rock and it will allow you to go to Henesys. From there quick move to the Ship icon. Go down the ladder. Go up the rope until you find the interdimensional Portal in Pantheon. Click that and from there you can go to any town in Maple World.PS if you are under lvl 50, first purchase a nearest town scroll in the shop once that is done go to the right in  Momijigaoka until you find the map with cherry blossom trees. then use the nearest town scroll. this will take you to the mushroom shrine. PSS. After you leave the Party Quest area, you will be in ch 1.			"

												For the lazy people.Pros:- Vast world with thousand of quests, mobs, bosses, events and more to come.- Weekly update with new events, items and more.- Great diversity of classes.- Millions of character customization.- Insanely big community.- Unique graphic and music and it's own sense of humour.- Large of daily events and bosses that will keep you engaged with the game.Cons:- Large amount of grinding.- Pay to grind less.- Pay to get extra cosmetics. Neutral:- Contains ranking system.- Max level of 250.- 17 worlds with 3 world alliances and 3 stand-alone worlds.For people that want a more in-depth review.Maplestory has always and will always be a treasured baby of Nexon. The developers have implimented a lot of interesting events, bosses and mobs into the game. As of recent updates, Maplestory have come in contact with 2 huge anime series, Sword Art Online and Attack on Titan. These have been 2 of the biggest events in Maplestory. It's large community astonishes many people on just how great the game can be. And the large amount of diversity in the game just adds icing onto an already beautiful cake.Though this cake might not be like be everyone, as grinding is one of the core elements of the game. The game consists of hours of grinding mobs for exp, mesos (currency in-game) and rare drops. But these grinding will be reduced greatly as you level gets higher as you'll be going into the stage of bossing to gain more mesos, and leveling once you've hit the 200 mark will just not be as engaging.This game is not pay-to-win, this will be a statement that I am willing to make. This game if more pay-to-grind-less-or-just-have-hours-of-grinding-if-you-don't-want-to-pay kind of game.The majority of your cash is mainly to get cosmetic items that will make your character look very fancy. The minority of your cash will go to items that will enhance your gear, which you can get by grinding of buying it off others.Alas, this game at its core has achieved what the developers have wanted to achieve and it is not likely to change too much from the state that it is right now.

												TL;DR version:Pros+Okay graphics+Okay gameplayCons-Difficulty is minimal and the game is laughably easy-Long and drawn-out tutorials that are poorly integrated with plot.-Combat is essentially Slow-Time-Events-Dull and uninteresting plot.4/10I was really kind of sad coming back to this. As a mapler from a long time ago who was stuck at my second job, nothing feels like a challenge anymore. The skills are inconsistently changing and annoying, and overall my character feels either too powerful or too weak. There isn't a ""just-right"" tier for me, it seems, and I'm only at level 60. I really used to enjoy Maplestory, but now it's changed to the point of ""Who are half of these classes?"" In fact I remember when the Cygnus Knights came out; that was an interesting character class, compared to the other classes that are essentially all plot-driven for reasons that I could truly care less about.An example of this is the new and seemingly more interesting classes. I can't remember the specific names because, as stated, I could really care less, but one of the plots was that this fellow seemed to have a bond with the Empress and it involved teddy bears as well as some sort of accusation and revelation of evil chums...? Something bad happens and aforementioned fellow is injured for some reason. I enjoy the inclusion of plot in tutorials, but I also enjoy brevity. Most plot cutscenes were completely irrelevant to the tutorial which is exactly WHY I didn't care; because it wasn't teaching me anything impotrant that was integrated into my current objective or learning how to play as my character.Another problem is the fact that this game has done what I believe quite a few other video games have done; stooped too low to helping out new players. The game feels pathetically easy and there's no real motivation for me to continue playing the game... All in all, it's a bit like an old friend that you see after five years and it turns out they're almost like a stranger to you. Goodbye Maplestory.			"

												This game till this day is the best 2D side scroller RPG. That being said...When this game came out it was incredible, I was quickly addicted and like most RPG players I played on and off mostly during the summer. I loved the character sprites, the anime/chibi theme. The 2D  aspect was done really well, navigation was easy, combat was entertaining, and the frustrating platforming jump quests were proof that even moving could be mastered. Back in Maplestory's hayday Bosses took hours to do and were seldom done. People cared about guild leader boards, the game broke up grinding with enjoyable party quests, basically minigames but with a nice EXP reward. Maplestory also had a great social environment, not typically your hardcore game types but people of all kinds had an easy time finding a guild and friends.The elephant in the room....This game has many flaws, but i'm just addressing the two that KILLED the game.What killed this game is the horrific cash shop and formally MTS, even more than rampant hackers. For a long time now the cash shop has been sucking players dry with ridiculously priced non permanent stuff. You will pay up to $10 for a single piece of rental clothing. It gets worse, with the addition of cubes, Meso sacks and some necessary conveniences(pets, scissors of karma etc) Its a pay-to-win mess. Its impossible to play this without spending money at some point, or else you'd be wasting your time now that is so grindy. This is the WORSE implementations of micro transactions in a game i've ever seen. Its completely unacceptable. Nexon does not care about its customers. Maple is showing its age and what made it great is rapidly dying. Hackers are a big issue too. But At this point I can hardly blame them since its so hard to progress without real world money.If you want to play Maplestory, Go on a private server. Its still a good game, Nexon is not a good company. Worse than EA.			"

												I saw the trailers, the ""mostly positive"" reviews, and the cool trailers, and was expecting a simple, fun, casual game to play with my friends. Instead, the tutorial treated me to a forced stealth mission, which was probably the ♥♥♥♥♥iest ""stealth"" I've ever seen in a video game. After a few times of getting inevitably cased on the large, flat, open platforums with guards just walking back and forth, the game just teleported me past them. Later, in my fancy airship house, I had the worst time trying to navigate up the wierd 2D staircases and such. My screen was flooded with a million menus, all of which were rather un-responsive to trying to close out of them. Then I got my first ""real"" quest: kill mushrooms. My options: 1: a really slow and low-damage poke, 2: some move that sounded complicated and I never even used. 3: a jump-dash that did damage, but was super hard to aim and usually does more damage to me than the enemies, or 4: a double-slash on a large crowd of enemies that killed most of them instantly. Basicly, the whole fight was running up to mushrooms and pushing the ""kill them"" button. And it wasn't fun to do cool combos, cause my other moves sucked and the mushrooms dropped a ton of mana potions, and the move didn't even cost that much mana. Later, I got lost (like as soon as the game stopped railroading me) and found two areas full of enemies way stronger than me who just insta-killed me. Finally found one of those odd menus with way more stuff than I needed, but this one had a ""teleport to places you don't even know what/where they are,"" and I chose the mushroom one because it was the first one, and killing mushrooms sounded like a new-player thing to do. Found another quest: kill more mushrooms. While looking through my stats, I noticed that for leveling up, they had a convenient button of ""auto-assign points."" This sounded good to me: it would probably have some cool algorithm to balance strength, dex, and int, while still prioritizing luck (my class' main attribute). Nope, it wanted to dump every point into luck. I also noticed that after another one of my quests, ""drink instant-level potion"" I still had the potion in my inventory. I used it about 6 more times or so before it dissappeared, which could be either due to durability (which was not listed anywhere in its description) or a glitch. In short, the only thing I could really grasp about the game was ""kill mushrooms,"" which, as great fun as that is, doesn't make a game. Despite the ""massive multiplayer"" part of it, I didn't see a single other person on. My friend was trying it out too and we planned to meet up, but his game crashed, had trouble loading, and stopped itself because it ""detected cheating"" (and no, he wasn't cheating). I really wasn't expecting to be blown off my feet, but when your menus are more difficult than your enemies, then you're doing something VERY wrong.			"

												has a huge pay to win comunity its almost imposible to some classes to completion without either saving up money since you created the character or buying them in the shops in freemarket/ their store although it was fun for a while i played till i was about 120 but when was a blade dancer it wouldn't allow me to rank up without buying skills because i had spare skill point -_- so i payed for the skills and guess what i asked some people if i could do raids they said not unless you got this skill that either you payed 5 bucks for or kill a boss and pray it drops i killed the boss several times never got it -_- so i was mad and ended up quiting the game because of the fact that i payed for this char and it was about 20 bucks maybe more to rank up and your telling me my character isn't even strong enough to do some places BECAUSE the fact that i dont have this ultra rare skill that drops about less then 10% of the time you kill the boss ... also this boss requires you to get a rare item to even fight it so yeah i would give this game a lot higher of a score if it weren't ptw 2/10 becasue fun in the begining HORRID towards endgame.

												Very fun and addicting to play. Make sure you have a lot of time before you play this game, and a lot of money in your wallet due to the fact that to become strong you have to pay real money. Unless you start on the reboot server where it's in game money to get strong ( play reboot it's so fun! ) and the whole game is pay to look good. 😂 overall a great game but it doesn't have its flaws... I would rate this game 8/10 on fun, 9/10 on community  7/10 on refreshing content , meaning the ability to play the game for hours and hours.			"

												One of the few games I wasted so much time playing (steam's time is but a fraction) and regretted every single minute. It's a grindfest, the community isn't as close as it should be, and so much thing wrong with this game. Avoid at all cost, there's better time to waste it than here.			"

												I have been a mapler since about the time this game launched. The graphics are pretty good, there's excellent custimization, and as of late, there's a LOT more choices for classes. This makes the game a lot more fun and interesting to have multiple takes of the same general class. (EG - Mechanic Vs Pirate Vs Angelic Buster) The game has also become less party quest based (although PQ's are still fun and helpful), which is nice considering the game used to be almost based on this. There's new engaging story quests, and MapleStory as a whole has grown a lot since the original launch date. I hope Nexon keeps up with the awesome content for Maple, as this will always be my go-to game when I'm bored of everything else.Also, nexon, PLEASE fix the one-time account link. It should not be a one-time deal. I don't like that I have to keep a standalone launcher instead of just being able to launch through steam.			"

												I will say this, in my opinion, this is one of the best free-to-play MMORPG's you'll ever find it is so in depth and specific and so many different quests, monster, bosses, and events you will never be bored. But I will say this this a game where you need to work for your levels, in this case characters go up to lv 250, this may seem like a lot but actually u don't really need to go past 120, and in general if you find the right areas it wont be hard. This is a great game to play with friends in fact its almost recommended, but in my case since none of my friends play this game I just put a Youtube Let's Play on the side and its great. Background Information: Been playing this game for 3 years, am 16 now was 13 when I started and still love it.Defiinitely recommend it, so many classes to choose from,You'll definitely enjoy it its a great experience!

												I played this game from 2006-2013.  I have thousands and thousands of hours on this game.  The 200-ish hours that are logged with Steam is the winter break of 2012-13 I spent with nothing better to do.Here's the sum of it.Do you enjoy spending hours and hours killing the same enemies at the same place just to gain a level?Do you enjoy doing quests whose effort to reward ratio is even worse than the method mentioned above?Do you enjoy playing games where the majority of the (dwindling) community is under the age of 18?Do you enjoy games where the only thing that matters is DPS?Do you enjoy paying to win?If you answered ""Yes!"" to one or more of these questions, then you have every right to download and play this game.For everyone else, you're better off trying something else.Now you might be saying to yourself, ""I'm sure there is more to this game than that.""Nexon tries their best to add new content (which is either a mechanic that will be exploited to death or a new class that breaks the game) and apply balances (removing said mechanics and nerfing said classes).However, what hasn't change through the 8 years that I've spent on this game are the questions I asked you above.Are you familiar with the classic board game, Monopoly?Maybe you and some friends are hanging out one day with nothing to do, and one friend mentions a cool new version that has come out recently.  Being it that you're on an extended vacation with time to kill, you think to yourself, ""We've been down this road before.  We're probably gonna start up the game, sit down, roll the first pair of die, and instantly regret doing this.  But I'm feeling optimistic.  Maybe this time will be different.""  You turn to your friends and say, ""I'm down if you're down.""  So you and your friends start up the game and you're starting to get really into it, but a few turns later your friends are already sick of it and you immediately regret being so optimistic about this whole idea.Maplestory is exactly like that.

Recently last year, they had another giant patch and from then, the game  was destroyed. The repetitive character class moves are pathetic and everytime they attempt to create a ""new"" character, they fail.

												Pros:+Interesting World+Cute Cartoonish Graphics+Great CommunityCons:-Monotonous Gameplay-A bit P2W-Tons of Hackers that don't really affect gameplay, but are still there.I've been playing this game since 2008 and I'm currently enjoying it. It's a game where you can find enjoyment in almost anything, really. Don't like leveling up and having competition in areas to level up? Just hang out in main citys and talk with people to make friends, I'm sure you'll find some. The game can get fairly monotonous at times, if you're looking to ACTUALLY play it instead of hanging out with friends. I play this game on, and off, sometimes I hate it, sometimes I love it, and currently, it's good. It can seem p2w with some cash items being able to net you 200 million in game currency for 3 dollars. The graphics are cute, the community is pretty good, the world is full of life and is interesting... and hackers are there, but they usually get banned instantly and permantly.Conclusion: If you've played this game before (2008 - 2012) you may or may not enjoy it... it's all up to you to make the descision of downloading the game and trying it out.8/10 "

												The game itself is amazing. Some of the most fun I've had. It's just pay to win as ♥♥♥♥. You need to pay ~$10 to even LOOT efficiently. The game is so damn laggy most of the time it takes a lot of time to even loost basic quest items, it becomes a pain in the ♥♥♥. You need to spend $10 to get a pet that can loot for you.I'd highly reccomend this game, but not on the official serers. Look up a low rate private server. You'll get much more enjoyment, and a lot less lag, and best of all, no pay to win.			"

												This game use to be great before the big bang update happened. Game actually took skill and would take atleast a month or so to get a 70. Not like today where it takes about 2 hours to get to level 150+,and besides that it's a pay to win game. Nexon is money hungry and needs to atleast make a server dedicated to pre big bang maplestory (kinda like what runescapes doing) but I doubt they'll even try that. I would honestly say download a private server that is pre big bang for more fun out of the game.  It actually took time to get around the Maple World, but now they have pay 2 win rocks where it can teleport you anywhere. k im done with this mixed crap, don't play.			"

												Simple: Play with friends, Yes! Play alone, No!Having both good and bad memories of this game in the past I'm surprised to see it now on steam.I can't say it's the worst game or the best but I do still enjoy the designs and artwork, having it's little comedy into the action and the sound is what I feel is the core source that many other MMORPG's has taken influence from. Still what made it bad would be the  toxic community of very sensually active preteens seeking love relationships and harsh judgement from everyone for simple mistakes. It's like high school all over again!Would I recommend it? I have to say 50-50 on that because it sure is nice for being an old free MMORPG that still updates and make new changes but it's been years and I feel like no matter how much it tries to change it will be dull compared to other MMORPGs. There are better ones out there... But if you choose to play with friends then nothing could really go wrong!( From a personal experience to reason my hate for NEXON though is because I used to play back in 2007-2008 when it was still GLOBAL but later forced me into EUROPE region servers and seperated me from my friends as well as making me lose my hardworking character. I was still so young and that really depressed me. :/  )			"

												I've been playing for seven years so this might be a bit biased, but I personally enjoy the game. The animations are nice to look at, I enjoy the music, there is still a decent player base(at least on the server I play on), and it's kind of fun just creating your own training routes and seeing how fast you can level up.The events they give can also be fun, even if Korea gets them 6 months ahead of us.Though there are some cons as well, Kind of ""childish"" graphicsSome may like it while others will be turned off.PlatformingOne of the worst thigns in the game is the amount of platforming, I honestly refuse to play any part with platformign since it pisses me off.DeadspotsSome level sections have a deadspot where there are few training options and you'll usually level up slowly. Though through all that I find the game to be very above average, so I'd give it a 7/10. Which is higher then I give most games. Well over 2000 hours on the game in total, and I'm on and off every couple weeks. "

												i played 72 hours straight when i was in high school and played 20 hours straight on a regular basis and i started up again and stuffed 37 hours of play into the first weekend of play. please dont do this to yourself(the game itself is incredibly cute, with some bizarre + creepy quests [the old jane doe one from ~2007 and the current rien dungeon quests]. the music is memorable and honestly gorgeous. it's a lot easier to play casually + unfunded than people on the forums make it seem. there are a lot of events and they're nearly always worth it.there are almost as many typos in maple global as an ace attorney game, but they arent as amusing. the mechanic class is categorized as a pirate so very few outfits look decent on them. the magical girl class characters all look the same unless you use $$. hackers are everywhere and they're annoying as hell.)

												I don't know about my opinion policy, but there is something with me with liking actual mixed/controversal games.Its play this game for a long time, take a break.Try it again after 3 months and then play it for a long time again... Repeat.Being a person who has not spent a single penny on this game, I still probably found fun in this game. Possibly just because I like wasting my time because I have barely any games to play, and still at least have some satisfaction included.I'll go with some pros with the game.First is the graphic design... It has a unique appeal to it while giving itself a charm. Even the most evilest looking of all enemies look clean.From the attacks, there is a lot of ""WHOA HOLY CRAP THIS LOOKS SO AWESOME!!!"" ones cosmetically, while at times practically.Most of the notable characters in the present main story are pretty original. Cygnus, Neinhart, Orchid, and so on.and As part of the story, the clans within it are quite official feeling, the Black Wings, the Cygnus Knights... The black wings especially due to the amount of backstory with their characters.And now... the cons.As most of the people know, yes, this is a freemium game by all means. Making the game's experience the more fun using actual funds. As for the same time, there were a lot of freemium items I found that only had a 90 day trial.It is like valve making a system where you pay $30 to have a certain unusual for a temporary amount of time, Except less attention instead.The playerbase is 95% of people at the age of >13, the first time I encountered someone who chat with me and requested to play together, I denied the request in the most polite way I could think of saying... All he said was ""*********"" after that, and that is the only time I actually talked to someone out of the hours I played with this game.Also the amount of times I've seen someone who wants to get married using the shout system.Quests in a nutshell:FIND ME 150 OF THIS AND THAT EACH AND I'LL GIVE YOU SOME EXP!!!!Find me something that is almost impossible to do until you level up 50 more times.'I need you to hunt the monsters till they drop something, the programmers made it very lucky to find.and Classes are unbalanced that it felt like it was measured using kilometre rulers, and thought a 1Km difference didn't mind much. After playing the Evan class for a while, he started to lack power, tried out the revamped mechanic class and it was much more powerful.Overall, I give this game a rating sentence of...Very mixed, but finding fun without pay to win stuff is a likely chance with the right mindset.

												I really don't get why everyone is complaining about the leveling from now and to before. I understand that many memories were made back in the day and it felt like a great achievment to get that level. But, get over it. No matter how much you complain to Nexon about it, it isn't coming back. Anyways the game is fun Ive been playing ever since i was 6. Great amount of story, nice effects, in game currenct can be easily made, and a good community. Most end game equips can be easily bought if you grind the Mesos for it.			"

												Maplestory is a 2D MMORPG(massive multiplayer online role playing game). While the graphics are dated they are still appealing. The pros: -Pracitcally a single player game     -Free to play     -Multiple classes, +15 The cons:     -+15 classes: there are so many classes that many of the classes fit the same style of character.      -Monotonous: this game is the epitome of a grind fest. You grind for levels by hunting montsers from levels 10-250.        The quests given are typical MMO quests. The game is such a grind fest that when grinding a map if someone other than        you joins the map, people throw tantrums and get upset.     -No socialization: ever since the big bang update socialization was drastically hit. The bigbang update brought forth a          massive increase in the exp rate, only further supporting the grind fest.     -Nexons idea of balance: when the release new classes their idea of marketing the new class is to make the class stronger       the class before them. They repeat that cycle until the older classes get to far behind, so they have to bring the older        classes back to up par. Rinse and repeat that cylce.Another thing to bring the relation between Nexon and the community was terrible for a large period of time, no commmunication tickets going unanswered for weeks/months. The last several monthes something changed and Nexon is currently attempting to repair the damage they caused.			"

												This game has taken many leaps foreward and backward up until this point, and ultimately in the end I would say that the game is throughly enjoyable. However, if you want to hit the damage cap and really be the best, the game is 100% pay to win. Without paying you cannot even see the top. Another factor about this game that i would critisize is that nexon has dropped the idea of roles for bosses. You dont need a healer to defeat a boss, which means that parties don't use any teamwork. With that said, i do enjoy checking back into the game every once in a while, and theres SOO many classes! all in all fun game but pay 2 win :3			"

												Played since Beta... I occasionally go back to it for whatever reason if not just to check stuff out.You may hear the words ""pay 2 win"" a lot and it feels that way but in all acuality you dont need to spend a dime to get to end game. You can easily do bosses if you are skilled enough or made friends. It is however ""pay to proceed"" and by that I mean you will have to at one point spend some cash. Wether it be a pet, exp gains, or even a shop. You'll need to buy one of those 2 things to proceed to get to that ""level"" where all the kids with mommy's credit card are at. (Even if you have your own job you fall in this category by spending those insane amounts on this... game that will one day shut down) I'd still check it out if you enjoy Action 2D side scrollers, it can still be fun without paying anything.. Just frustrating.			"

												Ok so ive played this game before it came on steam so dont look at my hours played on steam. Ive been playng Maple Story for about 3-4years now and i have to say i regret it this is because Maple has a lv cap that was 200 back then Now the Lv cap is 250. I started as a Aran and ive got him to lv 187 and i just gave up from there. Even if you go and make new characters you just gona keep Grinding over and over again its really no fun cause most of the time your just sitting there and pressing 1 button to kill all these mobs do that till you reach a certain level then go to the next place again and repeat Its just SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BORING.

												This game was really good, and I loved it more than sleep for a very long time. Eventually, I started hating all the changes but kept coming back. Once I finished high school I quit because my college blocked the game. I came back to play for a while one summer when i found it on steam, but found myself bored since all my friends had quit playing. I have no doubt that I was addicted to this game in high school. The changes were okay at first, but then they became frequent and way too crazy. I was okay with a few simple changes, even when they added a new class. Then they started adding a new character every 5 minutes and it became hard to keep up with the game or the economy in it. Go on vacation with your family for a week and some of your most valuable items are worthless because a new update had a new boss which gave it out like candy.It's your typical mmorpg grindfest, and there's very little appreciation for a newcomer in older worlds... although they will complain that the server is too empty 2 minutes after making fun of someone for not knowing where the next quest is or whatever ""noob"" question they asked. I joined the game because of a friend, but then I kept playing because of the community, now I would I avoid it because of the community. I enjoyed playing for probably the first half of my time. Most of the second half I tried convining myself it was going to be fun again, and tried finding new people to play with. I thought it would be better once it came to steam but it didn't really help. Eventually I just stopped, and started playing other games.			"

												Some background at the bottom, clear cut facts here:  Pros:    - Unique.    - Free.    - Highly social.    - Virtually endless amount of story line to follow, I've been playing 10 years and I have not even completed half of it.    - Not a game you need to play every day, you can drop it for a few months and pick it back up no problem.    - Everything you can pay for, can be obtained through (sometimes tireless) ingame efforts. I did not pay for nx for the first five years.    - Consistantly updated, always being worked on.    - Great bug support, I have contacted them about obscure bugs before and (when they were at fault for it) they had a fix for it within the day, I call that response time. Like, for a MMO: fixing a obscure bug (flight with my classes mount) within the DAY has got to be the fastest MMORPG response time I have ever seen.    - Although it has a light overtone, it is actually quite a dark and graphic game. If you actually read the story line, the things that go on are quite morbid and macabre. It is not nessesarily a childs game.     - I see A LOT of older players on, the fact of the matter is that the younger demographic does not tend to interact with the community. The usual demographic for the social towns are around 16-30. Although there are many young players, they don't tend to be as prominant.    - The community, I mean.. Come on guys, It's maplestory! I have NEVER played a more social MMORPG, EVER. This game not only has a massive community, but I would say you are unlikely to run into some nasty people. It is largely populated by nice people! I mean, yeah. You will run into some nasty people, but that's the same for everything. I am a massive collector of chairs, and when I sell them, I spend about twenty minutes with a mercher on each chair to tell them about how I got it and what it meant to me. One of them said that they were literally crying and that I made him really nostalgic about the game.     - The story, It is beautiful. Not only is there a pratically endless suply of it, it is quality content. Their newest update black heaven literally made me cry. It was SO intense, I can not listen to the ending credits song without a tear rolling down my cheek. I can't tell you how amazing it is. My absolute favourite character to play is the Evan, it ties SO nicely with the other story lines. It ties seamlessly with Silent Crusade, Black Heaven, Glowing Sylph, and so much more. It is really deep and meaningful to me.    - I could go on, and on, and on. Just download it for Goddess of time's sake.   Cons:    - It is a grinding game, I would put this on my pro's list but a lot of people don't like this. It is a korean based MMO, it is the standard. Just walk in knowing this.    - The game can crash for a variety of reasons, although it is not near as bad as it used to be.. it is still a problem.    - PC Master race! I am a big hater for apple, however I can't run this on my linux machines - which is a major bummer.. Like, Through a windows wrapper you CAN, but it will be laggy.    - There are some botter problems, it is not often that you will run into one anymore.. but when you do it's annoying.     - Names. this game has been around for over a DECADE, there are A LOT of taken names.. But there is hope! this october (2015) they are releasing 15 MILLION names! That is a lot of new names to use! Be there to claim the good ones!!!    - Pretty big hog for resources if you have a dated computer.    - At this point I am struggling to come up with more cons, just download it.---------OLD REVIEW-------------I have played this game just short of ten years, I have never had a dull moment in it. When you're not off killing hords of unimaginable beasts, you're in town talking to friends from around the world. The game is brilliant, many people don't like the game due to the graphics, but it's the graphics that make the game. The story line is phenominal, in the Black Heaven update I cried - literally. It was a perfect addition to the story line. There are events on much of the time, so it's always tonnes of fun. This is not a pay to win game, I love it for that. I recommend you try this game fully before dismissing it :)			"

												I started playing Maplestory way back since Patch 1.83. Or 2007....The game has certainly changed much over the years...and will always keep changing, don't ever expect it to be the same for more than 3 months.  My main character has been level 200 for many years now and I have a 200 NPC In Kradia. So take my word for it, the game is now, just as playable as it ever was.  Many of the things we know and love are gone, like the challenges, or Temple of time being the most difficult location in the game (most players walk over pink bean now like he's a snail)..The direction of the game has changed, and is much more story driven now. Before you just made a character and made it your own story. But you can choose from several. AND I MEAN SEVERAL...different classes with a pre-determined story. And advance them to lv 250 (new level cap)  by grinding on monsters or doing party Quests.The game seems overwhelming at first, but once you get the world map down, you'll be navigating like a pro in no time. The 2D anime style chibi art makes the game much more social than any 3D MMO so feel free to take a break and grab a chair..(literally a chair) that you can buy or collect from events...and sit down and make some cyber friends! Or go gear up and be the God of Damage and solo every boss in the game and wow your friends. My major complaint about the game (and it's been this way forever) is that many ways to grow are all based on luck....nothing makes a person more angry than to spend Hard earned cash on a scroll, that ends up failing. It's always better to let other people do it....but on the other hand...you can sell sucessful gear at a higher price.This game used to be VERY ADDICTING...fortunately I was able to break off of it and do other things with my life after I hit 200, but the new update and all still hasn't pulled me back in. If you plan on getting into this game....you will certainly have a blast...all the confusion at the beginning is worth it and it has something for everyone!			"

												A painful login procedure followed by ads demanding your money. I remembered this game back in my high school days, when it flourished with popularity. The art even screams like it is made for children, sort of like how Gaia forums exploded while the adults would play World of Warcraft. The game lacks direction on who their target audience is and just wants to demand money off you now. A game like this cannot expect many adults to pay for, when there are some better alternatives out there. Kids would probably be more annoyed by the login procedures and would prefer something like Rift, Ragnarok or even Elsword.			"

												Used to play years ago, and when I saw it on Steam decided I would try it again. Tried making a character for about 30 minutes with no luck.  I would occasionally get a message that the name was already in use, but would far more often get a generic statement saying that I couldn't use the chosen name, with no clear reasoning why not.  Finally gave up and will be uninstalling it to clear hard drive space for games that will let me get past the character creation page.			"

												So I've played this game for a while now.  It says I have 0 hours logged because I've haven't been playing it on steam, but I've probably wasted well over a thousand hours on this thing.  There's this thing called the cash shop.  You can buy a crap ton of stuff from the cash shop, but there's a catch, it's all temporary.  You buy a thing and then it disappears after, say, 90 days.  I feel like this rips you off so damn much.  But if you play for long enough, you come by more than enough events,  So you don't have to spend any money.  But the thing is, if you actually want to get cool stuff like chairs and good looking clothes with amazing stats on them, you HAVE TO spend a crap ton of time in game grinding on mobs.  So if you want to get good at this game without spending any money on it, it's possible, but you have to have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of time on your hands on your hands.  Also, to be tolerant of this game, you have to be tolerant of anime.  If you want to be good at this game without spending money OR time, give up, it's impossible.  Unless you have someone else play for you... I guess...? But what's the point of that?  Overall I do recommend this game because of the nostalgia it causes to me and how fun and obsessing I first found it like 6 years ago.			"

Some updates and revamps aren't the best, but the suttle to easy-to-spot game references like Bowser in the Mushroom Kingdom TD make my day.

												(Ignore the hours. The account attached to this was lost.)With how the game has been getting, I have to say there is more reason to give it a positive remark. I do have negative views about the company and how they've make it into a cash cow with their games, but I won't digress too much into this review about that and suggest reading my Mabinogi review about that.= - = - = - = - = Positives about the game = - = - = - = - =Balancing of Classes:For a long while, there were many classes that were just too overpowered and needed adjustments. Luckily, they fixed that in December of 2015 by giving necessary nerfs and buffs to classes. Many people would play a specific job (like Kaiser or Dual Blader), while neglecting other classes (like Evan or Aran) because they rather play overpowered over underpowered. I do see some jobs needing rework, but there is likely revamps going to happen.No Pay-2-Win Server (Reboot):This was necessary for the longest time because of how people can just drop $10 worth of Nexon Cash and end up with like 200+ million mesos for their character. It put a huge difference between the players who work for their money (by bossing or gathering) and people who can just drop money into the game.Easier for Beginners:I'm a veteran of this game for nearly 10 years and I remember the hardship of being sustained in the game, especially if you were a magician that relies heavily off of potions. Now, this game hands out money and potions like candy and I do support it, especially in the methods of how Nexon has done it.= - = - = - = - = Negatives about the game = - = - = - = - =Finding People to Work With:Unless you have friends that play this game personally and willing to keep you there, the game gets boring and some content does require you to be in parties. Even for me, I can't do some content without the help of a friend and I'm fortunate that I was employed at Maple-Radio for a point to obtain some active, nice friends during my tenure. The game in the previous years were quite easy to get into a guild and work together, but these days--it's harder to do so and can be a challenge. You may want to spend some time trying to get into some groups.The Company Itself:I can go from one end of the earth to the other about this, but they have milked this game (and others) dry with the Pay-2-Win complex. Alongside, there has been times the company would say one thing, but then take it back and proclaim they ""never said that"" or you're ""twisting their words."" If you have a negative view or complaint about the company, don't even dare try to say that on the Nexon Forums or you'll end up with the Hime fans pouncing all over you or potentially banned. (I've witnessed and was a victim of this myself.)Dead Servers:The higher you go up the server list chain (exception of Reboot), you'll notice that the game doesn't have a thriving community in some servers. If you want to stay in a small server, fine; however, you will pay the price of how expensive some things might be and how some content might be limited to you because of the population and economy.

												Me and my brothers used to play Maplestory a few years back. It was actually kinda fun, even if it was horrendously difficult adn travel took forever.I don't know how they did it, but they actually made the game run worse than anything else I have ever seen. It lags constantly, and I don't mean that it has high graphics or latency. I mean the menus have so much input lag, it becomes unplayable.Moving past that, it feels kinda empty now. It used to be you had four classes to pick from, and if you reached level ten, you could turn that character into a knight. But they have added so much stuff, I don't even know what to do. Well, what I would do if the game actually responded to my input.In short, 9/10, worst game EVAR.- IGN			"

												Lore and StoryThis is something I found myself really getting into as I continued to play the game. The story has really taken off since Big Bang (a really controversial patch that was released in 2010). We actually started to get more information on who the Black Mage really was by this point, and beyond. We find out that he used to be a mage known as the ""White Mage"" as discussed in the Grand Athenaeum. He restlessly researched the light to see what was beyond it. He eventually realized that the ""Ultimate light can only be found in the ultimate darkness.""His research started to have more and more negative effects on the world, creating dark beings known as ""Omens."" Eventually he became corrupt by the power he obtained from the darkness. Not only was corrupted, but he allowed it to corrupt him. He eventually became what we know as the ""Black Mage.""These days, there are so many more lore quests to go through. Especially with Black Heaven out right now, it's gotten a whole lot darker, and a whole lot more interesting. I'd suggest checking these quests out if you plan on playing the game.Based on what I have experienced in the game's story: this is no mere ""childish game."" Unless you think characters dying on screen, and the occasional curse word (crap, damn, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the words that would qualify a game for a Teen rating) are childish.Just to add a bit more, you actually grow attached to some of the characters. You gotta play to find out why. I can't explain it all.GameplayVery basic way of playing a PC game, and it fits this style. Abilities are able to be hot-keyed to YOUR liking ANYWHERE on the keyboard. Especially your basic functions such as jumping, walking, attacking, etc. You can customize your hot-keys to fit YOUR play-style (and yes I will continue to emphasize that). It's not hard to get the hang of this at all. Some classes do require you spam the attack button in order to refill specific substitutes for their MP bar. Examples are Demon Slayer with his Demon Force, Zero with his Time Force, and I think there maybe one more in there. Can't think of it right now.Grinding is something that you do when you're bored IMO. It gives you something to do, and if you want to gain some levels then yay! You want to level up! Though, grinding is the one glaring issue with this game. The only problem I have are the stupid and repetitive fetch quests. ""Get me this from this monster"" or ""I need this many of this item from that monster."" That is actually one of two complaints about this game, and I don't have any other issues with it other than the ""Star Force"" system. -_-""HOWEVER! The grinding in the game used to be fun to a degree. You would often find yourself partying with strangers or friends to go level up somewhere. While you did that, you would sit for a few moments to chat. Most of the time you would make a friend. Hell I got invited to several guilds up to 100+ people, and with 300+ member alliances. I think it's still fun if you know how to take a break for about an hour or two, or just stop all together because it will actually suck your life away. It's that addicting.			"

The Cons I've seen in this game so far-Hard Magnus, Empress, and Gollux (at its highest difficulty) are too hard to kill-Lacking endgame contents-Too Boring if there's nothing to do besides grinding-Too many Bugs & Glitches Caused and takes too long for the issues to be fixed-Too Many Soloists for grinding such as those who macro their skills that says ""Sry full"" or ""cc plz"" which it gave people a struggle to get a party			"

												I've been playing Maplestory since I started Middle School (I'm a second year at High School) and I know that because I'm young I can make a few biases, but Maplestory is not a super, terrible, never-play game. It's a game that's only likeable to people who can make an honest judgement after putting a good few to several hours into the game and get to the in-game point and not just be an ignorant angry reviewer that makes a judgement after the tutorial (seriously, why do people do that xD).I will not lie, the game has it's pros and cons, some pros would be that the game is really fun to play with friends (especially for boss fights and Party Quests). There are a lot of unique quests, questlines (there is a difference xD), dungeons, and PQs (Party Quests) (These quests usually have stories that can be a little cliche, but, in my opinion, are still good). There is a vast amount of unique playable jobs (Somewhere around twenty to thirty). Each with a playstyle that fits almost any MMORPG player (I will admit, the jobs are really unbalanced but the game is 99% PvE so I tend to disregard that fact but it's out there)Some cons I will name are what take people away from the game (they're both good and bad reasons). One con that really takes people away is long-leveling (Really, let's be honest, can you name an MMORPG (that's pretty popular) that has a fast leveling system that doesn't get you to max level within 100hrs of gameplay?). Another bothersome (even for me) con is the amount of grinding (Ok haters, you got me there, grinding is a pain, but it's as well popular in a lot of MMORPGs). The worst con that people can't stand (for some reason) is the game is pay-to-win (from the reviews I've read) (That is ridiculous, I've seen the cash shop before and everything I saw was purely cosmetic or gave purchasable currency for events for cosmedic items).I know that this sounds pretty bias but a high majority of the things I've said are true, I've played the game for almost six years so I know what I'm talking about, I know this sounds a bit more like a rant but I'm just trying to convey the fact that this game is worth a try if it caught your interest, but I won't promise you'll like the game, but I'm sure it'll be worth the few to several hours you spend on the game. I hope you found my review/recommendation of Maplestory to be helpful or encouraging to you. I mean this game is free to play and you shouldn't spend real money on it if you're testing it's worth. Altogether I hope you enjoy your brief to everlasting Maplestory experience			"

												NGS Initilization Error.I played this in 2005 and played for a few years and then a few more years of randomly reinstalling it. I got that nostalgia itch again and reinstalled. I tried their launcher from their site first. I had a lot of issues with the old one and was kind of excited to see a new one. Installed 8 gigs and went to open, error. I looked all over online and only saw unanswered cries for help. I deleted all files and reinstalled. Same error. I tried opening it directly from the launcher file, no luck. I deleted it all again and installed it through Stream. The same. exact. error. I have no idea what changed, possibly OS issues?, but I can't play any version of this. Also they marked my account as ""suspicious"" for no reason years ago. I still cannot make any NX transactions. Literal years later and despite having done nothing questionable on my account, ever.

												DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU DO NOT LIKE DOING REPTITIVE THINGS, LAG, UNSTABLE SERVERS, CRASHING OF THE GAME 30% OF THE TIME, MISJUDGEMENT OF GAME MASTERS.The reason I have only 0.1 hours is because I use the game launcher.The game has lost so much ever since I came back to it. I remember back in the days when party questing was live, I was always looking forward to party questing with other people but now they took the fun out of it. In party quest areas, you may find like 1 or 2 peeps, that is not enough to get you into one, and they may be 80% be afk They may try to attract you to the game by putting up events but it really is not worth it. Try another game. Plus Game Masters look investigater and suspend/ban legit players who report real hackers and let the hackers roam while they put the legit players on the ground for a month. It is just absurd, they are taking the very incentive that makes us report hackers, to get them banned. The community is pretty much dead as well. If you are looking to play, don't, you will just be wasting your time as have I.-I got banned for no reason. I was not using any illegal programs nor was I violating any policy. I have been playing all day and suiciding on purpose to not over level so I could play with someone while I look for some equipments. I am greatly disatisfied with this suspension as there are real hackers that I see on the server and I am always reporting them when I see them, but instead, I am the one that gets falsely accused by the program. This is unfair not just to me but the whole community as well. People who do not use illegal programs, such as myself, getting banned while the real ones stay botting or w.e., this is to be not treaded lightly.     Their customer service is not implemented well, when asked to provide information on why I was banned, all I got was ""I understand that this is very upsetting, but any evidence obtained by Nexon is proprietary and we will not be able to release that information."" and they would change the subject towards abiding the Terms of Services before playing the game. These gamemasters would keep saying that they had checked their evidence and would pass judgement on me by banning me but when they are asked to provide the evidence, they would avoid it (I believe they randomly ban people, that is why they do not hand out proof on why people get banned). Every response mentioned insisted that I should have read the Terms of Services and that I should commit to the agreement before I play. As to my knowledge, I have never broken any of those rules, I have gone through the list that they gave me multiple times and still unable to acknowledge the ban because I have never broke any of thoe terms and conducts they have provided. In addition, my time and effort put into leveling up my characters as fast as possible is labeled as leveling exploit (I was leveling so fast because I was strong and using the 1.5x/2x they gave us and the buffs that came with the event). I basically got banned for leveling up too fast, and when I tried to appeal, they ignored my requests and gave me no proof; I bet they did not want to admit that they banned the wrong person. In conclusion, I realized that they do not give a rat's ♥♥♥ about what we have to say. If these Gamemasters were judges, I am pretty sure they would pass the wrong judgements upon people such as letting the bad ones stay in society; meanwhile, caging the good ones in jail.If you are looking into this game, keep in mind that you have no voice in what-so-ever.

												I've now played Reboot for a good 2 months and I can asy it's alot better. Pets are still of course basically necessary however the amount you'd have to spend as in absolutely have to is pretty low. Hackers are kinda rapmant right now and there is some issue with nexon nerfing a class skill and coming out with the same exact thing as a p2w option costing on average $150 (not avialable at ALL on reboot), this severely hurts people joining when I did. I can't get even half the mesos per minute that people at my DPS could get pre-kish nerf, that said they are supposedly 'buffing it' now.The newer classes are quite fun, 5th job is coming by end of year or so and also seems 'okay', it's mainly just Hyper skills 2.0 though it feels.ORIGINAL REVIEW PRE-REBOOT PLAYING : This was arguably the best MMO I played when it came out in 2003~ and stayed that way until it got super P2W. That said reboot seems like it should fix that issue and I intend to try it out to see if it's everything I've missed.			"

												This game went downhill since big bang update.- Too many new jobs which aren't unique.- Leveling has become a joke. Too fast for low levels and most level 250 players have botted.- Most bosses aren't rewarding, and ones that are, you need to 'pay2win'.- Speaking of pay2win, player's damage is strongly dependent on money spent for this game. Could be over a thousand bucks to ""win"" which is ridiculous.- People are more independent with bosses, no longer requires teamwork.- Most limited-time events are dull, only asking you to kill/collect.- Their customer support is slow and unhelpful.I know I did not list positives for this game but they are points for my decision which I DON'T recommend Maplestory. Even it's not recommended for old-time players because the game's nostalgia is completely gone. If anyone still wanted to try out this game, play at your own risk. Think of long-term commitment and see why this game is terrible.			"

												First of all, many people who played in this game's early years are unhappy with the game because of the exp curve after the Big Bang patch. Nexon America made reaching the higher lvls a bit easier rather than grinding for weeks to only reach level 30 (Level cap is now 250.) As a person who played in the early years and currently, I honestly understand that they're upset about it, but those people need to get over it. They give the game negative reviews because they don't like change. With that being said, here is my review.A lot of reviews claim the game is Pay to win which is true to an extent however there only thing that makes the game Pay to Win is the cubing feature from the Cash Shop. For those who dont know what cubing is, it's a way to reset the stats on your equip's potential (Bonus stats) which cost 1.2k nx or $1.20 each for red cubes. However, There are cubes that don't cost any money, but drop from boss monsters or can even be crafted in game.Other people complain thats the game is pay to win because aesthetics (NX equip covers) have to be bought with real money. Most games sell aesthetics for real money (League of Legends Skins, H1Z1 clothes, CS:GO gun/knife skins) which people pay for so that isn't even an issue.While yes, Maplestory is a game that can be made easier for you by spending money, if you put in the time and effort to fund your character in game by bossing, farming, and utilizing the Free Market in game, you can easily enjoy the game without spending money. The only reason people complain is because they're impatient, and is that really the game's fault?With over 30 characters to try and many different bosses to fight, Maplestory is much more promising than these reviews lead you to believe. If you don't plan to spend a lot of money on the game to fund your character, I would suggest trying characters like Demon Avenger, Aran, or Zero (Must have a level 100 character to create, but worth it.) These classes have high base damage on skills and don't require nearly as much funding to do high damage on monsters/bosses compared to other classes. They're great for first starting out in the game! You could also play support classes like Kanna, (3rd job has a skill to increase spawn rate) Bishop, (3rd Job has +Exp Buff)  or Beast Tamer (Exp Buff in Cat Mode.) These classes are always wanted in training parties, especially high level training because of the support skills that they  provide. For help with training, bossing, or even game knowledge, make friends and join a guild! There are hundreds of guilds in each server, you just have to find the right one for you! Also check out the Maplestory reddit and Twitch.tv streams for even more help!			"

												Maplestory is one of the best games ever, with a fun and indepth storyline, this game is very addicting, but sometimes boring because of the sidequests and the need to level up to get new story quests. I have played this game, not on steam, but just got it on steam because Maplestory does not work on my new laptop for some reason. This game is very grindy, but isn't that with all MMORPGs? They add new content all the time, so you'll never get truly bored of it, want a game with the nearly same elements of WoW? Well then this game is for you! Maplestory in my opinion is better than any MMORPG you'll ever find, sometimes P2W, sometimes Grind 24/7, but all fun.			"

This game will suck all your time, money, hopes and dreams away and leave you empty. The company doesn't care about this game anymore, they haven't for some years and all its content is money grabbing, trying to extract every last cent off people as they can before the game goes under. Every single thing that once made this game amazing is now gone.I'm warning you, this game is the lowest of the low, it's is the cesspit of mmos.The community is full of hackers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.This game was a precious gem and now it's like a dirty, slimy, freshly pooped turd.

												Grindy mess designed by greedy Korean hacks who would rather pile on more content instead of balancing what's already there. 99.9% of the game world feels empty because everyone floods party quests and endgame dungeons. You're pretty much required to spend at least $100 to be successful at the endgame level, and you'll spend hundreds more if you want to get there without carpal tunnel syndrome or an anyeursm. Steam only has 17 hours recorded for me but I've thrown at least 1,000 hours into this mess over the past 7 years, ever since GMS first came out. Play it if you want to test the waters, but unless you're the sort with a lot of disposable income, you will not enjoy this one bit.			"

												I've now played Reboot for a good 2 months and I can asy it's alot better. Pets are still of course basically necessary however the amount you'd have to spend as in absolutely have to is pretty low. Hackers are kinda rapmant right now and there is some issue with nexon nerfing a class skill and coming out with the same exact thing as a p2w option costing on average $150 (not avialable at ALL on reboot), this severely hurts people joining when I did. I can't get even half the mesos per minute that people at my DPS could get pre-kish nerf, that said they are supposedly 'buffing it' now.The newer classes are quite fun, 5th job is coming by end of year or so and also seems 'okay', it's mainly just Hyper skills 2.0 though it feels.ORIGINAL REVIEW PRE-REBOOT PLAYING : This was arguably the best MMO I played when it came out in 2003~ and stayed that way until it got super P2W. That said reboot seems like it should fix that issue and I intend to try it out to see if it's everything I've missed.			"

												I've been playing MapleStory since its initial release here in the US, and I sincerely wish that I could say great things about this game since I have so many fond memories of what this game was and the potential it had, but unfortunately I can't. This game has continued to warp itself into a twisted system for sometime now it's nearly impossible to really pinpoint when it happened. MapleStory focuses so much on just catering to the instant gratification aspect of human nature that they neglect to develop the team-play aspect of the game at all. It used to be, you needed a certain number of EACH job to get quests/bosses conquered but now you can either SOLO bosses and/or quests or just fill an expedition with all the same class and get the job done. The main reason for this is because MapleStory is so caught up with creating new classes that overpower its predecessors without focusing on gameplay aspect. Everyone wants to be the same class of character simply because it can beat out the rest with little to no effort and it is because of this that the economy in MapleStory fails as well. With so many websites to buy mesos and gear from, it's really hard to find anything affordable from other players at all. Everything about this game simply doesn't nurture any long term desire to stick with this game. There is no Team aspect like there once was, Market prices have escaped the realm of reason, and Nexon just keeps feeding this solo-play craze which simply defeats the purpose of an MMO all together. There is no sense of community here anymore, which really is a shame.			"

From myself and multiple threads on the discussion, 9 times out of 10 the game WILL NOT play from Steam due to a colorful assortment of problems. For me, each time I tried to start the game it worked up until I tried to connect to a channel. Then it repeatedly asked me if I had trouble logging in, preventing me from playing. It will always let me play from the website, and the game is easily on my top ten, so I would definitely reccomend it for people who don't mind having to go to the website each time you want to play.

												I have played Maplestory for so long when I was younger and recently i played it again. I like the game because of the teamwork that is needed but recently it seems that you can solo a lot of the things in this game. Although it is still majorly fun to level characters it just isnt the same anymore for any of you old time players who are looking to coming back to the game. Another thing about the game is that although it is free buying NX is a major part in regards to why so many people can solo bosses and dominate in the economy when they re-sell an item.			"

For the first 70 levels its boring, but as you keep leveling up and becoming more powerful, there are more possiblities and more bosses to fight. I can relate to TF2 in a way that this game has customization, but people mostly care about chairs. The chair design and ideas are great, and also the game it self is great. Worlds to explore, Monsters and Bosses to fight, Endless possiblities. Maybe you can challenge your self into using this crappy weapon against a powerful boss.

												I remember back in the day when Maplestory only had four classes: the Magician,Warrior,Thief,and Archer. The game was very social and leveling was very hard. It was considered an achievement to reach your 3rd job. I kept playing until the Big Bang patch, which made leveling so much easier. Reaching the 3rd job and 4th job was easy and not an achievenent since everyone could do it. I kept playing after the Big Bang for maybe a month or two after i reached 4th job and quit.After returning to the game, it has lost it's social aspect and there are so many classes it gets confusing. There are jobs for your characters, crafting, and overall un-needed features that just confuse the player. These days, the game is just a grind and level game. Although the game before may also be considered a grind and level game there were social aspects that made the game actually fun to play. Not just playing to level and get better gear, but a game where you played to have fun with friends and leveling and gear was a bonus.IN THE END:  The game is just about grinding to level whereas before the game was played to have fun with friends and leveling and gear was a bonus.I really wish i could recommend this game, but the game is just not what it used to be.

I played during when there was only 2 classes beginner and cygnus knights at the make a character screen and it was amazing. My older brother played it so I thought of playing it and it get me amazed, I didn't really know what to do because I was kinda young at that time lol, but I stopped played over 5 years and cameb ack to 2012 or 2013?

Beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of things is really satisfing to me.I've grown up with beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of things. Final fight, Streets of rage, King of dragons, hell even Sonic blast man II. So yeah, i really enjoyed this game and was a ""MIGHTY WARRIOR OF ANIME""I got around my 2nd job advancment and then, my eleven year old mind noticed something. ""HOLY FRICK I SPENT TWO WEEKS TRYING TO GET THIS"" and then i stopped playing for four years and got back into it with a new account because the eleven year old me was like ""FRICKING LONG PASSWORDS MWHAHAHAHAHA""Anyway the now fifteen year old me blasted to level 45 in one day and he was like ""Excuse me? b...but why? Last time i played this i CRIED BLOOD to get my 2nd job advancment. Now i can get to this high within one day? Jesus this game is so.....FUN"" And then i lost about a months worth of my life playing nothing of maplestory and then mysterously quitting it again.now we come to the present. ""WHOA, NEW MAPS?! NEW CLASSES?! EXLUSIVE SINGLE CLASSES?! WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA?!""I mean no disrespect to the new classes at all, i was just tooken aback when i first saw them. It was like the eleven year old me just took control a flipped the hell out.Even though i keep coming back to this game....I....I can't recommend it to others, no matter how hard i try too. Yeah the games charming but beyond that the game is riddled with problems.

												This game has lost it's vibrance, quality, and community since its first revamp a couple of years ago.I can't say that the Big Bang update did the game any good. It made it more playable for the casual side of the gaming community, but for players like me, who enjoy the serious and competitive nature of games, has either become apathetic or not able to find motivation to play the game.To tell you how great the game was before any of this, because it was a really good one, whenever I watch a video that anyone has uploaded about the old versions of Maplestory I will start feeling noglastic. It's not like the more you see the more it reminds you of the good times, it hits me straight on. I remember how I first reach level 30, 70, and 120. I remember how I made friends with people who I am still in contact with today. I remember my first boss run or training party that I was in with a guild who was so kind and had a growing community. Those feelings were shot straight into my heart as soon as I watched a video that was posted by my guild.What Nexon got rid of that made many veteran and senior players quit or leave the game was it's challenges. The difficulity of leveling up brought many players together, forcing us to make party and guilds to better fare against the monsters that we faced. Making these connections with other players also allowed us to make friends, a bond that both players can feel even through distances. I know it sounds silly but that's one of the things MapleStory taught me, friendship.I won't say that MapleStory is bad game now, mostly because I still play it. People can still enjoy the game the way it is now. However, players who played the game for longer than a month before the Big Bang updates will understand me on this: MapleStory will never be able to give us that same exceptional feeling when playing. It's time has passed and so have most of us.Anyone interested in this game can very well try it. It has become more suitible for the casual audience now. I will warn you already that many of the game's feature will force you either to spend tons of time on it, or spend money to at least losen up that time. Yes, MapleStory is what people calls ""Pay 2 Win."" However it wasn't always like that, it use to be just for extra clothing. You didn't need anything to make you progress through the game with real money.tl;dr I recommend you to try it if you have never tried it before. If you don't like it then uninstall it. If you're a returning player then I'm warning you, everything is not the same anymore.			"

												Maplestory is a 12 year old 2D MMORPG that holds a dear place in my heart. To put it in simple terms it plays like a platformer with all the classic RPG archetypes like Warrior, Priest and Rouge and some unique classes such as the melee Battle Mage and the spell-stealing Phantom.PROS------------ Tons of classes, plenty of variety- Never a shortage of quests and events- Still upated frequently after 12 years!- Unique artstyle and gameplay that no other game hasCONS------------ The Cash Shop. It's okay to offer cosmetics for a price but they also sell things that enhance your equipment that could only be bought with real money. As the late game becomes more about your gear, this presents problems. - Quests doesn't reward enough XP or gear compared to party quests and plain grinding. Leaves a lot of content untouched.- Some classes are rarely played (looking at you Jett and Marksman)All in all its a decent game that should be given a try. I played it with my friend for years and we keep coming back for some reason. Please send help.			"

												I remember back in the day when Maplestory only had four classes: the Magician,Warrior,Thief,and Archer. The game was very social and leveling was very hard. It was considered an achievement to reach your 3rd job. I kept playing until the Big Bang patch, which made leveling so much easier. Reaching the 3rd job and 4th job was easy and not an achievenent since everyone could do it. I kept playing after the Big Bang for maybe a month or two after i reached 4th job and quit.After returning to the game, it has lost it's social aspect and there are so many classes it gets confusing. There are jobs for your characters, crafting, and overall un-needed features that just confuse the player. These days, the game is just a grind and level game. Although the game before may also be considered a grind and level game there were social aspects that made the game actually fun to play. Not just playing to level and get better gear, but a game where you played to have fun with friends and leveling and gear was a bonus.IN THE END:  The game is just about grinding to level whereas before the game was played to have fun with friends and leveling and gear was a bonus.I really wish i could recommend this game, but the game is just not what it used to be.

												Maple story is a gamew here you play non stop pretty much. ( I did 2 all nighters on this game and trained the heck out of my angelic buster ). It has the concept to train 24/7 to get that max level. Most character you might have to fund but overral it's fun. I played during when there was only 2 classes beginner and cygnus knights at the make a character screen and it was amazing. My older brother played it so I thought of playing it and it get me amazed, I didn't really know what to do because I was kinda young at that time lol, but I stopped played over 5 years and cameb ack to 2012 or 2013? I became a Phantom and didn't even know what was happening, everything was different. For people who are new, I recommend you picking a mage. That's the end of the review. Also you mighth ave troubles with the cilent so. Yeah.			"

												Now i'm gonna keep these real brief. If you are into cute graphics/sprites with feel attracted to this game. I know i was when i was like 11, still am though. Mainly because i like the ""ANNNNNNNNNNNIME"" feel that it's got going for it, and alright, cute looking things beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of other cute things, why not? Beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of things is really satisfing to me.I've grown up with beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of things. Final fight, Streets of rage, King of dragons, hell even Sonic blast man II. So yeah, i really enjoyed this game and was a ""MIGHTY WARRIOR OF ANIME""I got around my 2nd job advancment and then, my eleven year old mind noticed something. ""HOLY FRICK I SPENT TWO WEEKS TRYING TO GET THIS"" and then i stopped playing for four years and got back into it with a new account because the eleven year old me was like ""FRICKING LONG PASSWORDS MWHAHAHAHAHA""Anyway the now fifteen year old me blasted to level 45 in one day and he was like ""Excuse me? b...but why? Last time i played this i CRIED BLOOD to get my 2nd job advancment. Now i can get to this high within one day? Jesus this game is so.....FUN"" And then i lost about a months worth of my life playing nothing of maplestory and then mysterously quitting it again.now we come to the present. ""WHOA, NEW MAPS?! NEW CLASSES?! EXLUSIVE SINGLE CLASSES?! WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA?!""I mean no disrespect to the new classes at all, i was just tooken aback when i first saw them. It was like the eleven year old me just took control a flipped the hell out.Even though i keep coming back to this game....I....I can't recommend it to others, no matter how hard i try too. Yeah the games charming but beyond that the game is riddled with problems. Hackers, scammers, botters, Non-existent Gms, and hostile community.You'd best stay away unless you want to turn into a demon....And not spend MILLIONS OF HOURS ON THIS GRIND FEST OF A GOD DAMN GAME.

												I have played Maplestory for so long when I was younger and recently i played it again. I like the game because of the teamwork that is needed but recently it seems that you can solo a lot of the things in this game. Although it is still majorly fun to level characters it just isnt the same anymore for any of you old time players who are looking to coming back to the game. Another thing about the game is that although it is free buying NX is a major part in regards to why so many people can solo bosses and dominate in the economy when they re-sell an item.			"

												MapleStory is a MMO RPG type game, where you play online with many others in different ""worlds"". The game is HUGE and has tons of stuff to do and things to purchase etc. The game is free to play, and you can fight monsters, join guilds, and train your character. Many customization options, updates are regular from the company, but the downside is the lagging and hackers in the game, and the ""good"" items cost real money, so I wouldn't recommend it anymore because of the massive lagging and hackers and they are always trying to get you to purchase virtual items!

												This game has lost it's vibrance, quality, and community since its first revamp a couple of years ago.I can't say that the Big Bang update did the game any good. It made it more playable for the casual side of the gaming community, but for players like me, who enjoy the serious and competitive nature of games, has either become apathetic or not able to find motivation to play the game.To tell you how great the game was before any of this, because it was a really good one, whenever I watch a video that anyone has uploaded about the old versions of Maplestory I will start feeling noglastic. It's not like the more you see the more it reminds you of the good times, it hits me straight on. I remember how I first reach level 30, 70, and 120. I remember how I made friends with people who I am still in contact with today. I remember my first boss run or training party that I was in with a guild who was so kind and had a growing community. Those feelings were shot straight into my heart as soon as I watched a video that was posted by my guild.What Nexon got rid of that made many veteran and senior players quit or leave the game was it's challenges. The difficulity of leveling up brought many players together, forcing us to make party and guilds to better fare against the monsters that we faced. Making these connections with other players also allowed us to make friends, a bond that both players can feel even through distances. I know it sounds silly but that's one of the things MapleStory taught me, friendship.I won't say that MapleStory is bad game now, mostly because I still play it. People can still enjoy the game the way it is now. However, players who played the game for longer than a month before the Big Bang updates will understand me on this: MapleStory will never be able to give us that same exceptional feeling when playing. It's time has passed and so have most of us.Anyone interested in this game can very well try it. It has become more suitible for the casual audience now. I will warn you already that many of the game's feature will force you either to spend tons of time on it, or spend money to at least losen up that time.

												I played this game when it first came out and have seen it go downhill. The more this game gets updated the worse it gets. Many of the highest ranked players have hacked or are continously hacking to reach the top leaderboards. To be able to fight the powerful bosses to get the best items you must pay REAL MONEY and spend it on cubes that give a small percent chance to change your crappy item into something amazing... something like .01%. This game is PAY FOR FUN when you reach higher levels. You will end up paying real money on 3'rd party websites where an employee or owner will log in and give you the ingame money that they have hacked for. Reaching high levels and getting decent items for bossing will require a MASSIVE amount of time, or a MASSIVE amount of real life money, or you just pay a 3'rd party website that hacks for the items to come into the game and give you what you paid for. This game is going downhill each year and loses players each year. The few that are left are die hard fans who spend thousands of dollars weekly to legitametly get good items. Overall this game is a 2/10 since at higher levels you are almost forced to use 3'rd party illegal websites. As they end up being cheaper than spending your real life money in the actual game!!!

												Well ive bin a 2009 player i got to say it changed alot. It's a cool game if you like to grind And it's endless fun with freinds you would see how addicted you are when you play it its hard to beat the game because you need to do all the classes witch would take years You can trade fight bosses hunt events Almost a million players play this not on steam on the web Theres many worlds you can choose and classes the one class i like is the Dual Blader			"

												I came back to try playing again, I had enjoyed playing previously, now I find that Nexon made it a bannable offense to setup a custom resolution so it fits your screen, and there are people using botting/hacks all over exploiting it. Not reccomended at all anymore. And even if you do get high level remember its Pay to Win.			"

												Been playing for 7 years, and to be honest I enjoyed it up to a few days ago. For an entire week the game has been completly broken to the point where 1/3-1/2 of the playerbase can't even load. No actual fix has been released, and no anouncement by developers. Tech support and customer support don't help either. They've just ignored us and ran away with our money. To add salt to the wound they also had a double xp event when no one could log in. I've given up on this game and you shouldn't waste your time on it.Edit:Well It's been about 5 months, and maplestory is up an running. They updated some of the UI, as well as changing a lot of the mechanics. The game is a lot easier to get into now, but harder after about lv 200. I enjoy the game, however i'd recommend downloading the nexon version instead of steam. Due to a few bugs it's had since launch.			"

												Ive been playing this game since the first two years it came out. It has improved by leaps and bounds since then, and I kepe coming back after brief hiatuses. Without a doubt, if you're into Asian RPGs, this game can be a powerful addiction for you...Pros:-Visually appealing for an Asian RPG-Decent community, and sizable population even after years of existing-F2PCons:-Very grindy. Lots of farming, though its amount is constantly being lowered.-can be very much P2W in the endgameEven though I have a hate/love relationship with this game, I would still recommend it in the end. At the very least, try it out and play through the base content, without commiting yourself to all the sidequests, endgames, etc. just to feel out the overall game.Speaking from a perspective that has been here for more about a decade (at the time of writing this, starting from 2006 until today Nov 25 2016), this game never ceases to surprise me with all the improvements it gives the players... although I say that because MapleStory had needed many changes to get where it is today.

												I have loved this game ever since I started playing it, and I have grinded my way to levels above 100.BUT COME ON! Every computer in my house on start up of this game has the potential to lock up and then I have to go to task manager to close it because I am stuck at a black screen. It works EVENTUALLY and then queueing up to joing an ""empty"" server also takes a century to connect, as with the annoying music you get greeted with.Was a good game, pisses me off sometimes, grinding is a bit much not as bad as adventure quest,you should restabilize. as you already lowered the exp curve in the reboot update			"

												I don't like the game anymore because it gives me no sense of accomplishment. When I reach level 120 in under 2 days, without having to no-life to get there that fast, it doesn't feel rewarding. I don't have to put in any time or effort to get to that point, so I get no sense of accomplishment. Taking time to get to high levels drove my sense of accomplishment, it also drove the sense of community I loved so much.The community is one of the worst parts. I remember being able to join random parties for party quests and enjoying my time with those random people, but now any people I talk to are just the... ""nicest"" people.They throw out new classes constantly, each one seems like they're desperately trying to come up with a new gimmick to grab the attention of those with short attention spans, and every class feeling overpowered from the start further removes my sense of accomplishment when leveling up.

												Maple Story can be an amazing game if you have extremely large sums of money you do not mind lighting on fire. Everything in the game is built around getting you to pay to get stronger, pay to trade items and equipment ect. But even paying partially you still might not get that upgrade for your item and will be forced to pay even more to fix the failed upgrade and then try again. At least the friends I have made from this sad game made it worth just that little bit more.			"

												All the negative reviews are truthful, all the positive reviews are sarcastic negative reviews (no, really, go read them for yourself) with witty humor thrown in from time to time.This game sucks. It's cute, charming to a degree, and was once a great way to meet great people, many many years ago. But it's a shell of what it once was, a  ""pay 2 win"" title of the worst kind. When you aren't in game, throwing away hundreds of dollars on NX cash so as to remain somewhat viable, you're wrestling with the game's frequent crashes and server downtime. In addition to that, hackers have been a looming problem in this game for as long as its been available, and they tend to not only disrupt the game's already struggling economy, but put you at risk for loss of valuable goods. It had gotten so bad at one point that players were pointing fingers at each other, essentially saying ""You should know what you can and cannot buy!"" and ""Even if you got it legit, you shouldn't complain, its for the good of the server, it has to be done!"".Flawed. Broken. Buggy. Filled full of unfriendly people, and is a shell of its former self. This game is a has-been.Its terrible. Avoid at all costs. It's sad to watch your childhood wither away like this, but unfortunately, it needs to die. They've ruined it.			"

												Why you should play maplestory:-If you play MMOs for the story, maplestory has several storylines you can follow, all of which are kinda alright (Like that anime which you kinda wanna watch cus it looks cool but it still looks bad but you do it anyway and its as expected but was a good time.)-Maplestory 2 is coming. Maplestory 2 is technically a prequeal but do you really want to come back to play this game afterwards? Get the old one out of the way.-It was kind of a revolutionary step in time. Being one of the first platforming MMOs it deffinatly has a decent ammount of appeal.-Killing things is some how satisfying despite the combat system.-The minigames are a ton of fun and if you can make friends in game or get your friends to play then its even better.-It defined a point in history that encouraged internet safety as many angsty kids stole from their parents to buy ingame items. THIS IS NOT NEXONS FAULT!!! The parents should have kept a better eye on their cards, the kids shouldnt have stollen, and to be fair they could have used it on anything else online.Why you shouldn't play maplestory:-The community does kinda suck.-Its hard to train on anything but bosses unless you are in a party.-The combat leaves something to be desired.-The cash shop will burn a whole in your wallet. (If you use it.)-Its kinda a waste of time-Good luck getting your friends to play it.Personally I'm just here to get ready for maplestory 2			"

												All the negative reviews are truthful, all the positive reviews are sarcastic negative reviews (no, really, go read them for yourself) with witty humor thrown in from time to time.This game sucks. It's cute, charming to a degree, and was once a great way to meet great people, many many years ago. But it's a shell of what it once was, a  ""pay 2 win"" title of the worst kind. When you aren't in game, throwing away hundreds of dollars on NX cash so as to remain somewhat viable, you're wrestling with the game's frequent crashes and server downtime. In addition to that, hackers have been a looming problem in this game for as long as its been available, and they tend to not only disrupt the game's already struggling economy, but put you at risk for loss of valuable goods. It had gotten so bad at one point that players were pointing fingers at each other, essentially saying ""You should know what you can and cannot buy!"" and ""Even if you got it legit, you shouldn't complain, its for the good of the server, it has to be done!"".Flawed. Broken. Buggy. Filled full of unfriendly people, and is a shell of its former self. This game is a has-been.Its terrible. Avoid at all costs. It's sad to watch your childhood wither away like this, but unfortunately, it needs to die. They've ruined it.			"

												MapleStory has always been a fun social game, with the added bonus that it was incredibly fun to grind on.I originally stopped playing due to the rampant botting, hacking, and pay-to-win allowed by Nexon.I recently began to play again because Nexon launched a new server, Reboot. Here, there is no pay-to-win but there's still many botters. The botters never bothered me since I always did my own thing -- that's the point of Reboot, you do you.I recommend anybody to play, even if just a bit.			"

												This review is based on the Reboot server.Maplestory is a fun 2D MMORPG to burn time. The game is very easy to get into for new players. There is ingame guide and given starting meso bags. Despite its grindy nature, MS does have a wide variety of classes to choose from and each class is unique. If farming monsters bore you, there are always party quests. For the returning old school MS players. Reboot is not the good old MS. Reboot resembles the version near the time shortly after the Big Bang update. The Cash shop is mostly cosmetic in the Reboot server. It's still good to jump in and play for a few hours to satisfy that nostalgia of good old Maplestory.			"

												Alright, I don't review games, but my friend tried to get me to play this. So I downloaded it through steam. Hit the play button got all the way to character creation and it crashed. Asked my friend why the hell an 7 year old game isn't running properly and he said don't blame the game you need to run it outside of steam. So I go and hit ""GameLauncher.exe"" and it directs me to Nexons website essentially saying that they don't let people start the game that way anymore. Nexon wants you to use their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ steam knock-off. If they wanted people to use the Nexon Launcher then why can you installl it directly from steam...TLDR: Game doesn't even run past character creation, and tries to shove their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ launcher down your throat by deceiving you by having the game on steam.

												Maplestory, a game that in it's early days promoted hard earned levels, items, and achievements. This premise of challenging gameplay where you had to grind away many days to earn the most simple goals is what originally attracted me to the game. The feeling of being able to achieve what most wouldn't dare to do, kept me coming back for more. I literally feel like I could write a book on my many years of experience in this game. So I want to keep this review short, and write that book later. From playing beta to now (2015)This game is always changing, and no matter how much hard effort you put into it, a year or so later it will be irrelevant.If you do decide to play this game, please do not spend so much on NX. It's a very hard temptation to ignore, but you will be less depressed in the end. I have spent way more in this game over the years, I literally could have bought a second vehicle, brand new. Not only just in money, but time. So my advice, play this with some friends, have a good time, and don't worry about having the most 'elite' items, because that only makes you fall into a money trap that you will regret in life later.

												This game has been absolutely terrible, i've been playing this game since the year 2000.  Throughout the years this game has been such a pay to win game. I've been banned on occasions for their terrible auto-kick system. The game progression has stopped in the later stages and forces you to spend money just to reach the ""DPS"" count. I remember specificly when i went to the support and asked about the bug issues, such as Gollux dissappearing platforms for no reason. And that is only one of the MANY MANY glitches/bugs they didn't fix throughout the years. I asked about why Kanna doesnt have a profession and they responded with ""We are working on it"" for all my questions. That is seriously dissapointing.			"

												I come back to this game for a month once every year or two and the game looks completely different every single time. Items that were worth something are now worth nothing for the most part. I feel like the community has gotten harsher as time passed but there are still friendly players around. The game is always changing and adding the most random ♥♥♥♥ possible so it is hard to keep up. The total players are split among different servers so some are completely dead even after server merges. Last time I played this game, the game was so bloated and not optimized that well but I am not sure if thats still the case. I just back from time to time and return to a dead guild and dead friends list, so if you make good friends make sure to stay in touch or you will lose them possibly forever. I wouldn't recommend this game to most people due to the fact that if you don't spend money on the game you will probably never be as good as someone who does. People drop mad money in this game to make their characters look pretty and others drop mad money to reach the highest dps obtainable. They will talk ♥♥♥♥ and look down on you if you even drop by their group of friends and say hi. It's like high-school with the cliques. You have the athletes who train non stop and you have the cool crowd.It can be a fun game, though but it gets tempting to drop $5 from time to time			"

												NOTE: This is a very big ""IF"" recommendation.This game is made by a greedy company that only cares about getting money. Wether the developpers of the game care or not, they are probably forced into decisions that realllly encourage paying.That is, if you actually plan on playing the game efficiently.This game is simple, unless you're going into high level end game raids with people, that is the only time I can think where this game gets complexe and requires actual planning.Until then, most of the game is litteraly just pressing a single OP power button and watching a screen full of enemies dying with massive numbers showing up on screen?So WHY would I recommend this game?Because somehow, MapleStory makes that sensless room clearing one shotting grinding for days entertaining to watch.Its not complex, its not complicated, pick the weapon with the highest stats, apply all your buff/debuffs, then just spam away with that one attack that fills the whole screen with pretty explosions and lights and make you feel somehow like you're REALLY powerful, way over the top, and just sit back and enjoy the fireworks.That's really all you do, and when you reach the job advancements, you suddenly get even cooler looking and prettier powers to enjoy.And now they have a 5th job advancements with even BIGGER and PRETTIER attacks to use.Their are so many choices, all the classes, all the different job advancements, just choose what looks the coolest to you, find the nearest NPC that tells you where to go to kill 100 enemies or collect 100 items of one type, go there, and just watch and have fun seeing massive numbers pop up.But if none of that sounds fun, if you're looking for a well polished, super complex RPG, you wont like this game for the first 100 levels or more.I've heard that the end game raids can be tough and require a planned out raid party, no idea if its true, I never got that far. But the time it takes to reach that level isn't as bad as it looks since this game loves its level up events where you get like 3 levels per level up, slicing the time it takes to 1/3 of the ammount. Either way, it still takes a bit though.And in the end, the game still isn't as complex as some other MMORPG, I'm not an expert but I've heard better from other MMORPG games, so look elsewhere for super in depth and interesting MMORPG games. But if you're looking for some time to kill, to just sit back and watch things die as you watch some stream or youtube video or you're just waiting for something to be done, this game does a surprisingly good job, for free. All the in game purchases are usually for people who want to level faster or who want to get end game stuff quicker or reaaaallly max out their characters but, if you're just trying to kill time, this game does an amazing job at entertaining you for a few hours before you move on with your life.I'll never take this game seriously, but if I'm ever bored and got nothing to do, this game is always one of my go to picks for killing time and simply having a casual fun time with the game.Once again, no idea exactly how complex this game gets at the higher levels, I'm sure it does get ""better"" later on as any hardcore maplestory player might say. But until you get to that point, it all depends on how much you enjoy watching hundred of enemies fall to that massive screen filling energy blast you just used.			"

It's like the buttbutter just morphs every few moments just when it starts to stop smelling gross WHAM it gives you another reason to believe there is a god and that he explicitly created you to live in a universe composed of nothing but solid fart matter.

												NOTE: This is a very big ""IF"" recommendation.This game is made by a greedy company that only cares about getting money. Wether the developpers of the game care or not, they are probably forced into decisions that realllly encourage paying.That is, if you actually plan on playing the game efficiently.This game is simple, unless you're going into high level end game raids with people, that is the only time I can think where this game gets complexe and requires actual planning.Until then, most of the game is litteraly just pressing a single OP power button and watching a screen full of enemies dying with massive numbers showing up on screen?So WHY would I recommend this game?Because somehow, MapleStory makes that sensless room clearing one shotting grinding for days entertaining to watch.Its not complex, its not complicated, pick the weapon with the highest stats, apply all your buff/debuffs, then just spam away with that one attack that fills the whole screen with pretty explosions and lights and make you feel somehow like you're REALLY powerful, way over the top, and just sit back and enjoy the fireworks.That's really all you do, and when you reach the job advancements, you suddenly get even cooler looking and prettier powers to enjoy.And now they have a 5th job advancements with even BIGGER and PRETTIER attacks to use.Their are so many choices, all the classes, all the different job advancements, just choose what looks the coolest to you, find the nearest NPC that tells you where to go to kill 100 enemies or collect 100 items of one type, go there, and just watch and have fun seeing massive numbers pop up.But if none of that sounds fun, if you're looking for a well polished, super complex RPG, you wont like this game for the first 100 levels or more.I've heard that the end game raids can be tough and require a planned out raid party, no idea if its true, I never got that far. But the time it takes to reach that level isn't as bad as it looks since this game loves its level up events where you get like 3 levels per level up, slicing the time it takes to 1/3 of the ammount. Either way, it still takes a bit though.And in the end, the game still isn't as complex as some other MMORPG, I'm not an expert but I've heard better from other MMORPG games, so look elsewhere for super in depth and interesting MMORPG games. But if you're looking for some time to kill, to just sit back and watch things die as you watch some stream or youtube video or you're just waiting for something to be done, this game does a surprisingly good job, for free. All the in game purchases are usually for people who want to level faster or who want to get end game stuff quicker or reaaaallly max out their characters but, if you're just trying to kill time, this game does an amazing job at entertaining you for a few hours before you move on with your life.I'll never take this game seriously, but if I'm ever bored and got nothing to do, this game is always one of my go to picks for killing time and simply having a casual fun time with the game.Once again, no idea exactly how complex this game gets at the higher levels, I'm sure it does get ""better"" later on as any hardcore maplestory player might say. But until you get to that point, it all depends on how much you enjoy watching hundred of enemies fall to that massive screen filling energy blast you just used.			"

												Where do I start here.. Man, this game is pretty.. lame honestly. The game itself is fine, but how it runs is atrocious. It has issues with certain headsets, keyboards, etc. Still hasn't been fixed.. and I've seen stuff about it since 2010.Overall, the game just would freeze every 4-5 seconds for about half a second for me, even without the set headset plugged in, and I couldn't figure out why. I've tried playing without any usb's plugged in, still nothing. I've tried messing with about everything on the game and still freezes every 5-ish seconds. For whatever reason the devs still have not fixed the issues with the game when you use those headsets/keyboards/mice after several years so I cannot suggest this game. Like, 6 years and you still don't solve an issue like that? lmao... My issue with the game doesn't seem to be with the headsets/etc. It just freezes constantly, and honestly its stupid. Well, if I want to play a game I guess I can go to every other game and it would work perfectly fine however this one doesn't. I can't recommend this when there are better 2d/fighter/brawler games out there. Especially when this one has had issues for 6 years not being resolved, then it just not working for me. For whatever reason anyway.			"

												This game, Maple Story, is truely a magnificent diamond. I first played Maple Story when the era ""Big Bang"" was on, at the time the game was at it's prime state. I don't know how long ago that was, maybe 6+ years ago.The game is not as good as it was before. I'm not going to butter this, the game right now is really terrible compared to what it was before. I detest it, and so do most other players that also played during ""Big Bang."" Nevertheless, I and many other people play the game because of nostalgia and big digits. I remember I met my first love and lost my virginity in Maple Story, which is why I love the game.  If I had the option to go back in time and tell my past self something related to Maple Story, it would be ""Kid, this game is going to destroy your life, but you will also reach enlightment and become happy."" Overall, I still crawl back to play this horrible game, reminds me of the good days. I personally enjoy it.			"

												I've played a little over 15 hours of the game. It's a great game under two circumstances: 1) You have a friend/friends to play with. 2) You actually understand how to play the game. Without these two things it gets really boring very fast, too much repetitive grinding for quests with drop rates being odd and sometimes making things last far longer than they should. It's a great game and I'm sure it was lots of fun when the community was bigger but there are just too few people online now and there just isn't enough information told in game. I hardly understood anything about what I was doing even while I was reading guides for it. After 15 hours I got to level 53 out of a max of 250, and the game just isn't entertaining enough for me to get those other 197 levels.			"

												Fun and cute game hindered by a big pay wall.  For instance, not many items are permanent which means if I take a break from the game, the cute items I bought are gone when I come back.  =c  I would recommend if you have the cash to spend otherwise it will be a very slow process to reach end game.  May be faster with events but I do not have time to log on at the right time.  Suffice to say, if you make it a priority in your life, it is doable.

												If anyone's played maplestory as long as I have, they can say that this game started going down hill since the Big Bang. (I probably have over 2000 hours off of steam) and since that the game has just gone downhill since.The game lost it's challenge, you can get over half the maximum level in just under a couple of days. They might as well just start you at the maximum level at this point.Honestly, I can't touch this game anymore, and I reccomend looking elsewhere for entertainment.			"

												This game has a long history. For many it was their first MMO ever played. While this game is still somewhat fun it has become considerably a pay-to-win game. With the introduction of item stat %'s Nexon introduced a Cash Shop item you can purchase with real money called a Miracle Cube. Cubes allow for the reset of item potentials and to even raise the potential to a much higher percentage at a random chance. If you want to deal a massive amount of damage and be an unstoppable boss slaying machine. Chances are you'll have to buy mesos, the in-game currency, or cubes to boost your weapons and armor.			"

												Maplestory is a gateway MMO of the worst kind. It's a bad game, a cluster♥♥♥♥ of story and characterization that isn't very well done by any aspect, but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive NX ♥♥♥♥♥♥ry and ERP. The normal anon can see this as the ♥♥♥♥ it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the game itself, regardless of their opinion, is plain bad.However, these very aspects that try to smear over the ♥♥♥♥ of its core make it a breeding ground for aspie, unsociable underageb& ♥♥♥♥♥♥s who engage in every kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ry both online and in the real world. The crossdressing pale white nerds all trying their hardest to look cute, the deeps, peculiar, colorful clothes, the whole night lord ♥♥♥♥♥♥ry and everything about the Maple world fuels their escapist fantasies, while the pity-party character backgrounds, emphasis on revenge, and overall preachiness of the series make it fit just right with the mary-sueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted self-importance towards the world. Exactly the kind of ♥♥♥♥ that makes little kiddies and underageb& ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ eat this ♥♥♥♥ right the ♥♥♥♥ up.			"

												I have been playing this game for over six years on and off, way before it was on Steam. I have really seen the game grown over the years, for better and for worse however it seems it has been for the worse. As Nexon releases updates, they have added many new classes that outclass and overpower the originals. These new classes are usually much more flashier and stronger than the orignals, making them more popular. The new classes can often solo bosses, something that use to be impossible and defeating the purpose of teamwork.Through several updates, the game has also become much too easy to level up, unlike how it use to be. Also, Nexon has made the game very pay-to-win like. Often people who have the money to spend on NX have the better equipment in game from the equipment enhancment system. As the game advanced, Nexon has made many changes which altered the game drastically. One of these changes made in game world feel much more smaller than it use to be. Many and almost all of the maps have been compressed into compact versions, making traveling very different than it use to be. The game world use to be much larger and you could get lost in it and still have fun.Finally, Maplestory has been a host to many bugs/hacks/down time. The game has been hacked many times, often causing damage to the econonmy and forcing server rollbacks. Hackers seem to also be quite common, seeing as a hacker(s) posted the login ID's of over 50 thousand players, including myself. The also game has more than a few bugs that can affect gameplay or quests, forcing unexpected maintenances.			"

												When I first made this review, I put no, because I thought the game had no purpose, but now i realise that a game doesnt need a purpose to be fun.Many people know maplestory as that game that was popular a long time ago but then Nexon bought it out and made the game totally pay to winWell that people, is wrong.Maplestory is no longer a pay to win game, I would say it is pay to progress, or pay to get higher level faster. Once you farm yourself to a higher level it gets easy to from millions, as there have been many features added to the game making it easier to get high tier items.Some Examples -- Daily boss runs can net you good experience and you can sell the potions you get which stack up in money over a while.-Commerci runs - if you farm this enough you can end up with items like sweetwater glasses and tattoos, which sell for over 200 mil each.- Easy gollux - this is harder to do, as there are a bunch of annoying prequests, but you can use the coins you get from farming gollux to get pretty good gear that you can sell.-Elite Boss Farmiing- This is something all levels can do but its totally based off luck if you get anything good, if you want to know what this is go check out a guide as it is pretty lengthy to explain.- Taking advantage of events going on - there are always events that are going on that can rack in some major dough, and can boost your damage pretty significantly.Some reasons I personally play maplestory are -- I enjoy the grindiness of the game, Its something I do when I am bored of the other games I am playing and if i play a bit every day it can add up in the long run.- Using twitch.tv, you can find a multitude of streamers to play with which add a totally different aspect of the game. These streamers are very generous with their items and will do a lot of give aways!- I like the look of the game and I love the classes that are available for creation, my personal favorite is night lord!These are just some of the reasons I play the game, and there are lots of people who agree with me. I know there will always be people who disagree but I am okay with that and I dont expect them to play it with me.			"

												The 5 minutes i have on record in this game is a lie, i could first add it to Steam today cause of region block, i have MANY hours of gameplay (i would say around 75000 hours, no lie), closing in on 11 years nowI cannot even start to describe this game... it's been a lifetime i've spend on it! And it just keeps dragging you back to the game as it has no end to it and constantly comes with new content (around each 1-3 months on avarage)Pros:- The community in the game, Europe version was epic!- A game for people who like damage and flashy skills- MMO 2D Supermario, what more do you want?- It's free!Cons:- It's Pay2Win!- The Bugs that never seems to go away that affects gameplay in a bad way (Seems 30 gets fixed, 32 new bugs comes each patch)- Bad communication between Players and Nexon which result in not so great supportIf you want to get far with Endgame, find some friends and team up with them as there is TONS of grinding for Endgame and TONS of farming for coins and items from bosses/events. Solo can get you far, but the hardest bosses like Lotus and Damien... those you won't beat in a VERY long time (even with a VERY strong team unless everyone hit cap damage of 50mill)			"

												For the sake of this almost being a successful game for 9 years, I better say something.Looking back then, I saw interest in an 2D MMO that was popular and successful? (Seriously, How is that even possible?)Anywho, Heres what you wanted to know.Pros: Very Fun, Different kind of feel for an MMO, a wide variety of classes, plenty of people in the community to play with, lots of quests/dungeons/ and areas to explore.Cons: The ""wide variety of classes"" may be overwhelming (Nexon is dumping out as many as they can), Grinding can be a pain in the ♥♥♥, Inventory can fill up quickly, Your character might not look so ""Exciting"" if you don't purchase a thing or two from the Cash Shop, Most Cash Shop items are only temporarily  **WHY :(**In a nutshell: I always find myself coming back to this game to see whats new. Gives you a great new feel since its a 2D MMO, and if you plan to play then bring a friend!			"

												As a person who played Maplestory back in...man, back when Ragnarök Online was still alive and kicking, I can say that Maplestory's early levels consists of agonizing grind...at least it used to. Now leveling to 70 is easy; however, anything beyond level 70 is a massive and agonizing grindfest consisting of burning so much money on XP boosting scrolls you'll find that at least 300 USD is needed to actually reach 120+, effort not included. To truly hit endgame requires level 210, and basically everyone at that level has so many cash shop items it's not funny; this is the norm for Maplestory. If you want to consider yourself as 'hitting the cap' in Maplestory, you'll have to spend over 500 USD, probably. Thankfully they got rid of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Jump Quest for whatshisface, the angry golem ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that spaminates your screen with more energy beams than a US player in C&C Generals. Don't even get me started on HP Washing and other cashshop item related tactics to forcibly boost your stats to absurd levels. It's that kind of game.-Update-With the levelbuying option and significant exp gain increases, reaching 120 is pretty much a cakewalk. This is extremely depressing for me, because I had to spend the better part of 2 months to get 3 or so chars to 120, with EXP boosts included. For those of you who did not have to go through this grind, I hate your guts because you all get to take the easy path now. Seriously, bugger off.			"

												Been playing this game for 7-8 years; started in 2009.Can say with experience that this game has truly grown and that it has had its fair share of ups and downs, but does not fail to exceed the limitations of any avid RPG lover, whether they are casual or competitive, new or veteran.Community, while beginning to lack as it ages, is very cooperative and expansive (if you go on channel 1 that is lol), but also requires some form of teamwork and strategy, a fun aspect.Gameplay, controls, menus, gui are really weird now since I haven't played for a while but is still user friendly nonetheless, and makes it easy to learn if you're new.Classes are unique, have great storylines and mechanics.Only negative things I would say about this game is that levelling up has gotten a bit too easy now due to all the events and x2 things but, honestly, that's how the game always has been with rewards, but it's a bit more HAM now.Overall, probably one of the best, groundbreaking games that I've played in ages, and I think that it will be for you too.

Lower populated servers have all really nice people. If you want a game where you can just make friends and spend money, well this is it. Has to be my favorite game of all time playing it since i was in first grade and im in tenth now. Sure the game is ""bad"" if you look at it in the way of just you alone playing by yourself, but when you have friends irl that play it, or you met people within the game, it gets a lot more fun, with not just bossing and party quests but also just being social with others. I rate this a yes since i've never not liked it in these 9 years. Its a gr8 b8 for ur money tho.

												If you do get this game, be prepared for: an elitist and toxic community who won't help players, use gazillions of dollars to buy cubes (items that change your equipment potential to great stats) to be actually noticed by someone, to farm the same spot over and over again in gaps of levels and to read megaphones with stupid people showing off their stuff bought out from their parents money.Don't get me wrong. the game itself its great and it has great potential, I had a blast playing it years ago and coming back from time to time but its players who are looking down on everyone just because they got lucky with a cube, because they're on a certain guild, or because they're friends with someone who is ""famous"" really bothers the hell out of you.The thing I like the most about this game are bosses, but they are ruined because you can either solo them if you're overpowered, or not do them at all because no one will like to carry/help you.This is a game for fun. Not a game to get serious.Unless you do have gazillions of dollars and want to throw them all away at buying cubes or selling in-game currency to buy overpowered weapons.			"

												This game is great for passing time. If you enjoy playing MMORPG's but dislike playing with people, this is the game for you. The levling system is very grindy. Unless you have a friend giving you an exp boost or increasing the mob spawn in the map, most of your time playing this game will be spent leveling alone. They have a 'Reboot' world that doesn't allow trading or purchasing item upgrades with real money, which I actually enjoy because it get's rid of Pay-to-Win players. All of you equipment actually must be earned on the character you are playing on. You can share the in-game currency, mesos, between your characters and a few usable items, but no equipment and such. They still have the other worlds where you can trade and spend hundreds of real dollars trying to upgrade a single piece of equipment, but I definitely recommend the Reboot world.			"

												Only have about 20 mins of gameplay.I don't hate this game as I did not spend much time with it but..If you want instant action don't expect it from this game.First you need to make a seperate account from steam, then make a character and there are so many names already taken that it will take you a very long time to get a name.Also there are several restrictions to name making, you can't have too many of the same letters, lots of words are blocked that are not even inappropriate.Skipping the tutorial, then getting put into what feels like a tutorial with characters chatting non stop teaching you things that you expected to skip, feels like you never get to experience the game.It just takes way too long to get to the action so I had to click uninstall. The videos make it look like it's fun and all but, I can not stand having to go through a rediculous amount of game setup andlearning tutorials.So, If you are like me and like to get right into the action and start having fun, don't expect to have that fun for what feels like an hour.I would much rather recommend a game like Terraria instead of this game as it's newer but it's not quite mmorpg.If you have the patience to go through all the steps and enjoy reading lot's of pop ups, then go for it. As I said before, I can't say it's a bad game. It's something you will have to just try for yourself.Also, at the time of this post, expect a update/patch of 500+ MB after downloading the game.Anyways, Hope you enjoy it more than myself if you do choose to try this game.

												If you do get this game, be prepared for: an elitist and toxic community who won't help players, use gazillions of dollars to buy cubes (items that change your equipment potential to great stats) to be actually noticed by someone, to farm the same spot over and over again in gaps of levels and to read megaphones with stupid people showing off their stuff bought out from their parents money.Don't get me wrong. the game itself its great and it has great potential, I had a blast playing it years ago and coming back from time to time but its players who are looking down on everyone just because they got lucky with a cube, because they're on a certain guild, or because they're friends with someone who is ""famous"" really bothers the hell out of you.The thing I like the most about this game are bosses, but they are ruined because you can either solo them if you're overpowered, or not do them at all because no one will like to carry/help you.This is a game for fun. Not a game to get serious.Unless you do have gazillions of dollars and want to throw them all away at buying cubes or selling in-game currency to buy overpowered weapons.			"

												This game... I swear. It has so many problems. Crashes and irresponsiveness are common, and everything is hard to find or confusing. Default controls are unfriendly, and remapping them are even more so. Character creation is the worst. The classes seem to have little difference, and often your character will disappear from the selection screen for no reason. Furthermore, names of characters that have disappeared will claim to be taken, as if name creation isn't difficult enough. The passcode required to create, play, and delete characters is very time-consuming, as the keys are randomized, as if the username and password aren't enough.With all these problems combined, I couldn't even get past the tutorial to see the actual game. Do not let its pretty graphics fool you. My rating is 2/10.			"

												This game is a big number generator. This game is good from levels 1-130 afterwards any improvement to your character is based off rng cubes and equipments that drop from bosses that are too hard to kill and equips that have an extremely low drop rate.  The only server worth playing is reboot but progress is slow and grinding takes forever to increase power levels. The community for this game is useless as anything important can be soloed and nothing requires a party as soloing gives much more exp than any quest or party quest. The 5th job is just a glorified hyper skill system that requires hours of grinding to collect arcade nodes and symbols. This game is not worth playing as it is basically legalized gambling to kids and should be illegal as the gambling practices are addicting and subliminal.			"

												It's not worth it! It's most likely the most pay-to-win game you will ever play, and it has even degenerated into a hack-to-win game instead of less because of the decreasing value of even the most essential drops despite of their increasing rarity. Even in-game upgrade items not coming from anything related to its cash shop aren't worth it anymore.Back then, we didn't have a gambling-based upgrade feature called the ""Potential system"" plus it has always taken nothing but your own patience and a single pay-to-win item called the ""Regular Shop Permit"" in which you only had to spend $2 and it's always been taking you far. First of all, the value of most items has deflated whilst the hardest-to-obtain items were not only expensive but also obtainable only from the hardest boss battles (something that only people who spend thousands of dollars in this game will likely not going to achieve). Second of all, the values of most drops were slowly decreasing even further along with an increasing amount of funded players obtaining drops from the hardest bosses, making the $2 Shop Permit even less powerful. Now valuable drops are either rare in-game, or only obtainable from the Cash Shop.Not only the game itself has degenerated into pay-to-win/hack-to-win, but also the vibrant community itself has turned into a more hostile environment where it's no longer an athletic competition, but instead more a mix of a bodybuilding and weightlifting competition with a twist of gambling as its performance-enhancing element. In other words, skill doesn't matter as much as I usually found this game before. Also, even though the game's features were being adjusted to favor the more matured demographic, even 22-year-olds don't act like their age and are harassing in their most serious ways possible, such as starting drama and reporting each other. It's a complete nightmare come home!Also, it is important to note the game's also imbalanced in the aspect where ever since an update called ""Unleashed"", you cannot hit anywhere near maximum damage even if you spend $2500 in this game, and this is more pronounced if you opt for high hits-per-second classes such as Kaiser and Dawn Warrior, or you cannot solo the hardest bosses despite you've spent that much for it. It does do a disservice to even a funded player, unless once in a blue moon you win a jackpot on a casino or something. Just to know how imbalanced the classes are, I spend $700 to fund a Hero (which is a warrior) whilst I could get about the same results by spending nothing on MS but the $2 Permit with less endgame gears or potentials. To make things even worse, they promised fifth job once and they said they'll not going to open fifth job any time soon, and they never did.Now, the only two things that are saving MapleStory are its original 2D gameplay that not even Elsword or WonderKing Online can compete with the original thing, in addition to Nexon's over-the-top events and MapleStory's vibrant community that they always have had. I wonder if this is any longer going to be the case, because I doubt so. I doubt it even more because of the nerfs that happened during the updates named ""Unleashed"" and ""Shining Star"" which made it even harder to gather up merchandise for your Shop Permit without relying on random reward features such as ""Gachapon Tickets"", ""Marvel Machine"", or ""Premium Surprise Style Boxes"", because of the amount of nerfs and HP increases pertaining to Party Quests, training, and boss runs. If they continue to nerf the game even further, you can kiss goodbye to this pastime you've loved too much.As far as I know, this is about one of the few games I ever know where the community is as bad the the game itself. I'm not sure if this is even worth playing anymore. I've played several MMOs and I found even Mabinogi is in a better state. I'm so disappointed with MS that I'm even going to give it a a 1-star rating.			"

												I started playing Maplestory years ago, and my god.. this is a fun game. When I first start playing I pick the old Dawn Warrior as my starter class and I ended up loving it. I put alot of work and money just to make it to 120 and.. I never did. Back then leveling up was much more challenging and I'd say it's alot of fun. Now after I recently played again and create a new Hero class called ""Shade""level up from 10 to 120, I said to myself""What the heck happen to the game?"" I thought I was a pro, but it turned out the game was now just too easy. I even got bored of training and nowadays, trainings is just a labor you want to do.Bosses are now too easy most only required 1 player doing a solo run,not even breaking a sweat.Now it's the amount of money i don't always likes, the poor amount of money after a lv.10 mob dropped is ranged from 8-20 mesos(in-game currency) while a piece of equipment lv.10 cost 1k and you might think thats easy but a lv.50 cost about 55k+.Still,it's not the money I'm complaining, it's the fun I had thats gone.I could have recommended this game but those days are over,the gameplay feels so hollow now.If you play this game anyway, you'll regret it.P.S I know it said I play zero hours,but trust me I play it on the official website.

												Maplestory is a pretty fun game to play if you have friends to play with you. I have mixed feelings about post Big Bang Maplestory. While it made the game much easier and a bit of a grind fest, lots of content had been added that makes the grinding feel fun at times. Since I lasted played I've heard they added some features to encourage group play which is also good. Many people say Maplestory is pay to win and it certainly does help; however, you can still get just as far for free. Overall, I'd say Maplestory is a good game to play if you have friends and some spare time. TL;DR: Play with friends 7.5~8/10, Play without friends 6~6.5/10			"

												Some long term players seem to object that this game is good; however, this game is good. I say this with an unbiased view simply because I don't have long term experience affecting what it is now and thus I'm not making that biased comparison. This means I'm giving this review based on the NOW -- reduces review bias/corrupting a review from a nonbiased standpoint.Now that I've said this lets get it started.I started as a Xenon and dove right into the Resistance in which the class begins to take on the persona of it's intended story line. After a few hours of play there seems to be a bigger change that kept making me quit the game in the past. This is the grind is much easier. Now I'm not sure if it's because of the current model or because the Xenon class is quite powerful for an all around class, but it is definitely much more easier to level in the game.If you like Anime and the storyline within Anime then you will quite possibly enjoy the game simply because it has some of that similar style within its dialog -- specifically the Episodes which is a short version of titles like Attack on Titan or Sword Art Online.The only down fall I'd say the game actually has is the navigation system. Now by this I do not mean movement of the character but instead the finding of NPCs for quests that need to be completed is quite hard sometimes. I had to do some google searching to find out where the NPCs for a quest is at so I can complete/begin them. In the end, if you can overlook the fact you level quicker in the game than years ago, and are able to tolerate the fact you may need to do some google searching on where the turn-in NPC is for a quest. Then you're going to enjoy the game so as long you don't dislike sidescroller games, and Anime. If you do dislike, then this game is probably not for you.The graphics are the same as they always were though so no real graphical improvements unless you want to talk effects... Anyways, try the game. If you wonder whether or not the cash shop is expensive or not then I'd like to say it isn't because your money does go pretty far if you spend it wisely. Now, if you don't do cash shop then that is fine because your not really missing anything other than maybe an auto-loot pet and the chance to win some in-game money to give you a good start at earlier levels.

This means I'm giving this review based on the NOW -- reduces review bias/corrupting a review from a nonbiased standpoint.Now that I've said this lets get it started.I started as a Xenon and dove right into the Resistance in which the class begins to take on the persona of it's intended story line. After a few hours of play there seems to be a bigger change that kept making me quit the game in the past. This is the grind is much easier. Now I'm not sure if it's because of the current model or because the Xenon class is quite powerful for an all around class, but it is definitely much more easier to level in the game.If you like Anime and the storyline within Anime then you will quite possibly enjoy the game simply because it has some of that similar style within its dialog -- specifically the Episodes which is a short version of titles like Attack on Titan or Sword Art Online.The only down fall I'd say the game actually has is the navigation system. Now by this I do not mean movement of the character but instead the finding of NPCs for quests that need to be completed is quite hard sometimes. I had to do some google searching to find out where the NPCs for a quest is at so I can complete/begin them. In the end, if you can overlook the fact you level quicker in the game than years ago, and are able to tolerate the fact you may need to do some google searching on where the turn-in NPC is for a quest. Then you're going to enjoy the game so as long you don't dislike sidescroller games, and Anime. If you do dislike, then this game is probably not for you.The graphics are the same as they always were though so no real graphical improvements unless you want to talk effects... Anyways, try the game. If you wonder whether or not the cash shop is expensive or not then I'd like to say it isn't because your money does go pretty far if you spend it wisely. Now, if you don't do cash shop then that is fine because your not really missing anything other than maybe an auto-loot pet and the chance to win some in-game money to give you a good start at earlier levels.

Maplestory is racist to japanese and muslim people because at nautilias has a ♥♥♥♥ing giant ♥♥♥ whale with bombs in it so it offends people who died at pearl harbour u ♥♥♥♥s. Thankyou for reading my review on storymaple.After further inspection of this game i have come to the conclusion that my ♥♥♥♥ was ripped out of my mothers ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by zakum and his friends. After 1 day of intense diarrhea and gameplay my ♥♥♥♥ was circumcised by an african slave. im sorry mum please dont read this. After getting to level 50 my chinese side of my ♥♥♥♥ kicked in and shrinked at least 12 inches which means my ♥♥♥♥ is now 8 inches. Maplestory is a really fun game but i had no one to play with. I met some asian guy who was at least 60 years old who had a fetish for feet. I am now writing this review as a vietnamese immigrant is with my friend and probably playing this game. I traveled to the heaven after the undead dragon came back to life and ripped the anal plug from a japanese mans ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												ive played this game off and on for about 9 years and id have to say i keep comming back, here are some quick pros and cons pros-can be fast paced combat endlessly-really cool/flashy spells and abilitys (mostly later on at higher lvls)-interesting classes and they all feel a little different despite having so many different paths/classes to choose-i find the world to be a good size, not to big not to small-allways alot of people around if you like to be social-ive noticed over time they make some really great improvements to the game so updates dont feel useless usualycons-can be extremely repetetive-there isnt really much insentive to get to max level like other mmos where you can do raids or somthing like that, basically not much changes at max level-can be hard to get good weapons and armor from the free market due to insane pricesover all that would be the things i notice the most, i like the game and enjoy it once in a while but it was never one that i could stick to and get addicted to, maybe thats not a bad thing but there was never much there to keep my apeal to last for a long period , unless you had friends who played but mine all quit about 5 years ago so it gets pretty boring pretty fast for me.if you want a game to log into and just kill monsters all day in a fast paced side scroller with wicked abilitys and classes then i would highly recommend this game, somtimes i just want to kill endless monsters all day and feel awesome while doing it and this is the game i log into to do it.

Some would call it a very childish MMO, I would say that in some asspects but yet its a very fun game that you can play for hours at a time. With new classes coming out every 3 months its a game that you cant get tired off because there is somthing new to always do.

You can customize your character with different hair styles and colors different skin colors cool appearance cloths for your character and stuff like that battle against monsters and bosses.The con's of this game is the company who run it they are lazy and cheap give people who exploit the game second chances and are rude to people who spend money on the game its really a shame the old company that run it was alot better then nexon.

												The best ♥♥♥♥ing MMORPG you'll ever play, if you can understand it, youll make it big, tons of big video game stars made it here. The customization is endless, ranging from modern casual clothes to a secretive ninja, and classes atrting at bowmen to people riding mechs everywhere, the people are unique in every world, and there are always people on so youll never feel alone. The stereotype that just because this is 2D does not apply to it, it MORE than makes up for it with all the classes, places to explore, variety of items, Maplestory is the BEST it gets to play a F2P MMORPG with updates still rolling out including MORE classes, events, bosses, monsters, places this game NEVER, EVER gets old!

Also good luck creating a character, I thought the game was broken at first but it only took 2 minutes for the game to connect to its own servers so i could create a character played for an hour got kicked off.  Gameplay wise its not bad if you enjoy games like the Diablo series, it's an endless grindfest. And for a final note the ""world map"" is the worst thing i've ever seen you can't tell where you are or where you need to go at a first glance and takes minutes of staring at it to find and useful information.

												The servers lags so much and they dont do anything to fix it, so you lag and watch your character die, slowly. Not only that the servers crash alot causing you to restart the whole maplestory thing and its annoying not only restarting the game but sometimes it glitches so it says your on it but the game isnt actually there so you gotta shut down and log back in just to play this game. And to top everything off this game feels like a pay-to-win because when you actually go and find people to talk to, you see everyone with these amazing cool itmes,high levels, and sh!t like that so you feel like your left out and everything is just a pain. I only say play this game if you have friends to play it with.			"

												I used to play MapleStory; I started playing four years ago. I met my best friend there. It was fun being a Fire/Poison ArchMage in the game before all the revamp updates. The game now is just grind, grind grind, bots in most maps, most people are power hungry. The newer classes are over-powered and no one plays the old classes anymore.Don't waste your time in this game; your wallet and social life gets sucked into this game.			"

												Although tossing money at Nexon will help in this game, it's not necessarily a P2W game.  I see it as more of a Pay-to-solo game. I see it as this because if you have a group of friends who all will play it and have teamwork and stuff (and get free stuff durring events) you will do ok in progressing and leveling up by questing and grinding (which both get VERY boring) well, probably up untill somewhere in the lvl 160+ area, where most people who are there have payed tons of moneys, and you feel seriously under-powered.  You can either spend time or money, and still be constantly grinding.			"

												Keep in mind this is my opinion.  I understand that maplestory is a very different game, and A LOT of people do not enjoy it. I have been playing maplestory for years, I believe it is a very good game.I joined around the release of the pirate, the fifth job/class to the hero Maplestory is a different type of MMO, you don't really do quest all that much in this game, it's always been more of a grind.This can be good, and bad.Early game is encredibly easy in every way, monsters killable, leveling stable/quick, and money isn't a problem.Later on in the game it can be a giant pain, you need funds to buy potions, you need to have ""godlike eqps"" each bought for tons of IN GAME money.You can play this game without spending a dime, personally I have spent a good bit of money on this game, but I do not regret it.~Pro/ConsPros: cuteeasytime wastercons:end game leveling is roughyou may not like the style of gameplay (grinding)people can be elitest if you don't have specific gear.

												I played this again out of nostalgia and was curious to see what changed. While the additions were interesting, it didn't take me too long to remember why I stopped playing this in the first place. The gameplay gets stale really quickly since all you're ever doing is hunting down monsters and collecting items. There's really not that much variety to the quests handed to you since it's always one of three things--kill a certain amount of monsters or collect a certain amount of items said monsters have dropped. This is probably why I stopped playing MMOs in general, but there were some that brought a little variety into things. It was a nice trip down memory lane, but I'm not surprised I lost my interest so quickly this time around.			"

												So I got this game while I was looking for a new MMO to play. Big mistake. This is literally the worst MMORPG I have ever played in my life. If you're looking for a game to play, literally pick any other game and you'll have a more immersive experience. The gameplay is literally the most unimmersive thing ever. The monsters in this game literally just walk around, and when you touch them, you take damage. Sure, a few of them might have an attack or something, but they're generic, or undodgable, or both. They are generic and  have no counterplay and are just not fun to fight. As for your ability combos, they don't exist. You literally just spam the same thing over and over again, except for a few different characters, but even they just cast the same abilities in a loop over and over again. You also need to apply an excessive amount of buffs before you actually go and do stuff, and then you'd need to reapply them in a few minutes again, which I don't get the point of. The bossfights consist of undodgable attacks that will apply status effects for a few minutes at a time, usually a silence which would prevent you from using any skill at all, so you're just stuck there doing nothing, or you could be forced to move in a certain direction without warning. And because monsters deal touch damage in this game, it could make you ram into the boss and die. Teamwork is also not a part of the game at all, as the only healing class in the game has low demand, and small player base. Players will literally queue and then leave the party to fight solo. You are not reliant on healers, rather you gotta spend money to buy potions and chug them as you get hit by attacks you can't dodge. Heck, some bosses have a life counter because they know you're going to die from the lack of counterplay.The game will try to draw you in by giving you abilities that will unlock at higher levels, forcing you to grind mindlessly for long periods of time at the unimmersive mobs. Quests in this game all suck, they just involve picking stuff up or killing things and don't have a high enough reward to be worth doing.Once you get to higher levels, the game will try to appeal to you with excessive amounts of effects and 10 lines of damage numbers even though your attack only hits the enemy once. Then it becomes pay2win after that. You literally need to spend thousands of irl dollars in order to progress from that point on, or you won't be able to fight 90% of the bosses in the game. In addition, you also need to level several characters to a very high level in order to boost your main's stats, and that will take a long time PER CHARACTER. The gear progression is very linear, and everyone just wears the same stuff because it is the best. There aren't any items that are different from each other, so you can't experiment and do different kinds of builds.There are also no interesting places to explore, because it's a 2-D platformer game with no interesting scenery or terrain.Overall, this is a terrible game and literally play anything else other than this if you're looking for a new game to play. This game is just a massive, unimmersive grind just to see larger damage numbers.Oh, and the female characters are not heavily fanserviced. Literally unplayable.On a sidenote, I technically don't have this many hours in the game, because steam would think this game was open even though it was completely closed			"
