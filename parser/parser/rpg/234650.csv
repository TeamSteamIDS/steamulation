												Now I've never played a Shadowrun game before, however I'm not exactly new to  turn based/strategy RPG games, having played games in a similar vein like the Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor series and Fire Emblem. However, I'll be the first to admit I'm far from a veteran in the genre.One of the key things I think Returns did right, is the tricky task of drawing me into the story immediately. It's pretty simple: your friend is dead, he's left you a ""dead man's switch"" - a recorded message promising a hefty reward if you can find the killer. OK. I'm in.As for the ease of playing the game... as someone who's often daunted by complex RPG interfaces with endless choices, decisions, and items to equip, I thought Shadowrun's interface is a breeze. It clearly shows you your weapon slots, inventory slots, and which body parts you can equip on armor or modifications. As for playing the game itself, you can simply click on your HUD to switch between weapons or end turns, but there are hotkeys for the more practiced player, too.You encounter many characters on your way to solve your friend's murder, and you get to pick and choose your own team of Shadowrunners to go on every mission with you. Each has their own specialty - summoning mechs, specializing in ""decking"" (hacking), melee combat, guns, magic, and so on, and I had a great time testing out all the different classes.All of the characters have their own specialties, but the game is forgiving, and you could probably get by just using guns on everyone. I realized one of my runners had a healing ability 3/4 of the way through the game, and had been getting by just fine without knowing that. So if you're worried about difficulty or complexity, don't be.Another positive for me is the game is heavily text based. There is a lot more discovery and reading than combat. You can also save anywhere except an NPC turn in combat, or in conversation. So I could get up to answer the door or grab some food without bothering to pause, or quit at a moment's notice if my friends asked me to play a multiplayer game.I know I'm writing a review no one will ever read, for a two year old game, but it gets an easy recommendation from me, especially if you're a busy person who can only enjoy games in bits and pieces before you're on the go again.

												Strongest point of Shadowrun Returns is its writing. In best tradition of older RPGs, game describes what you character sees in flowery language. Character introductions, location descriptions and dialogues are smart and charming. The setting of Shadowrun is a blend of cyberpunk and urban fantasy - don't think I knew something like this exists before. I wouldn't mind experiencing Shadowrun Returns in book or graphical novel form.As a game, however, it is not so magnificent. SR was made by relatively inexperienced developers on tight budget using Unity and it shows. Graphics are mixed bag - wonderful character portraits, bright and detailed, if somewhat cartoony 2D backgrounds, but awful character models and awkward animations. Sound direction feels cheap overall - music are fine, but forgettable and there is absolutely no voice acting. Combat mechanics ripped straight off X-COM: Enemy Unknown.The biggest flaw of SR is its linearity. I just didn't have the opportunity to explore the world of Shadowrun - game kept railroading me on one story after another, with brief breaks in same   small hub. All two side missions are one chance affairs - go on them right now or miss it forever. While writing itself is great, spending points to improve charisma and get new dialogue options felt like total waste - game is too short and there is almost no opportunity to use your mad speech skills - I think I used each etiquette only once or twice in whole game. Story starts as a noir-like murder mystery, but after halfway point abruptly turns into ""save the world"" scenario and ends with series of boring battles against bugs. Absolutely unnecessary twist, in my opinion.My final impression: SR is an enjoyable short RPG; not without flaws but if you are able to overlook them, you will have a great time playing it.			"

												First all, let me tell you about my background - 39, working professional, married with kids. Was looking for an RPG game that I can really sink my teeth into without getting bored, and coming from a gamer background myself, not many games can catch my attention.Then saw a recommended game review somewhere about this Shadowrun, so being the typical gamer that I am since I dont like to pay for something I haven't tried yet....so I *cough*cough* got  a copy of the game to try........and then I closed the game, went to the Steam website, and purchased a legitimate copy. Let me tell you why :-a) this is an RPG - story, story, story - this is what's it all aboutb) the interface and game - slick, modern XCOM style combat, with that turn based system thats good for my pace and strategy.c) the real world/cyber world - the transitions are nice, a good break from the routine.d) Story - did I mention story? I like how I have to slow down to read, even the freaking Splash screens got something to really readSo I parted with my cash to show support to this developer. Keep up the good work and I look forward to purchase Dragonfall and any more of DLC of this kind :)			"

												Review for DMS (Dead Man´s Switch) & DF (DragonFall) CampaignsWhen Shadowrun Returns DMS came out, i liked it, but wasn´t really happy.The writing, atmosphere and graphics were nice and fitting, you really could delve into the Shadowrun universe and have fun.What was not so nice, were the lack of good/real party members and the unability to customize them. Also the story itself was pretty straightforward, with few optional decisions possible.What was horrible was the lack of a proper saving system.With DF Harebrained Schemes finally delivered the save system. So the horrible part is gone. They also tried to deliver some optional questing and a bit more interesting&permanent team members. B for effort, but for a truly good rpg the customization/inventory management of your party is still lacking, also the characters of the fix team members could still use some makeover, at least personal quests.The story once again is fitting, and the whole game has a bit more variety, without changing much of the base gameplay.So, to make this short, if you like Shadowrun and haven´t bought this game yet - do it! ;)If you like rpgs/cyberpunk, you now can give it at least a try.

SHADOWRUN RETURNS - Cyberpunk adventure/rpg with a compelling story   || 8 || Score Comment   Graphics 7 The game has top down isometric type view, graphics are very well done: the lighting, effects and areas feel very fitting and atmospheric.  At points, however, it feels like it would be nice to have a little bit more variety to the areas, some of them feel quite samey. Character creation and portraits are ok but you can't go into the level of detail of some other RGPs.  Audio 7 Music and sound effects are good, there is however quite a bit of reading to do in this game, do not expect voice acting for all of the story / dialogue.  Gameplay 8 I really enjoyed playing this game, its a nice mixture of adventure / mystery and rpg with turn based strategic combat (think xcom). You control a small team of characters (you collect them as the story progresses) who follow you as you play through the story completing various missions and solving mysteries. There are some good puzzles to solve as the story develops and you can choose to upgrade various skills as your character advances in levels. A really nice feature is the ""hacking"" that the decker class can perform, this takes a form similar to combat in the game but its you and your constructs against the computer systems defences.    Story 8 Shadowrun Returns is set in cyberpunk-esque world where magic meets machine. You can play different stories in the form of campaigns, the official ones are complemented by community created ones via the steam workshop. The campaigns are extremely well done and have a very noir feel to them. There's a lot of background and detail to the world (and a lot of reading to be done) and the story had enough intrigue and action to keep me interested right to the end. The nature of the game (your characters acting out the story) basically means that play feels quite linear and that sometimes the decisions you make don't really have lasting effects but this didn't effect my enjoyment too much.    Replayability 5 As much of the main campaign is story based, once you have completed the game there isn't that much to draw you back in. Having said that there is an excellent DLC (dragonfall) and there are community created campaigns and an editor which should add quite a few hours of playability   Overall 8 Excellent game for anyone who loves this style of gameplay or the setting. The community content really adds a whole new aspect and lease of life to the game, just be prepared to do a lots of reading.  More reviews by Fancy FishAgree / Disagree?

												As an avid Shadowrun fan, I was psyched when I heard about the kickstarter for Shadowrun Returns. I immediately backed it and kept careful track of the progress. Based on some of the design decisions and the concept art, I was initially concerned. My worry proved to be unfounded though. When I first opened Dead Man's Switch I was immediately pleased with the depth of detail in story and graphics.It does a respectable job of emulating the pen and paper game feeling. There is room for improvement, and I certainly hope some of the issues are addressed in the future, but there is enough variety for you to at least customize a character to reflect you (combat) style. Lacking stealth is a particularly strong drawback. So is the way social skills like negotiation and con are replaced with etiquette, but a smart modder can work around that and present an experience which will tailor to your needs.Which brings me to my next point, the editor. Say what you will about the main story, give it a couple months and it won't matter. The game comes with the same editor the developers used to make the game. Based on the community, you can expect some amazing modules to come and I look forward to them in the future! As for the main game, I enjoyed it even though it was fairly linear. It had the feeling of playing shadowrun at a gaming convention, you needed to follow a set script, but there was a decent story to back it up.One of the biggest concerns myself, and the community had was the lack of a save anywhere feature. Fortunately HBS was quick to implement this after release. They are very attentive to their fans needs. Now if only they could do something to limit ammo!Overall though, I am happy with Shadowrun Returns. If you are an avid fan, get it. If you are a casual gamer, do your research first. This game is not made by a major studio, you cannot hold it to the same standards as you would something from EA Games. If you want voice acting, amazing graphics, and more options than you can imagine, this is not for you. If you are willing to give the little guy a chance, and want the feeling of playing Shadowrun with your friends, then you will probably be pleased with what you get. At the very least its the best Shadowrun game out there currently.UPDATE 6/29/14I was asked about the game's replayability, so here is an update to address that. I will (most likely) better update the review later, but for now here it is.Most of my hours were spent inside the editor, you can easily spend hundreds of hours making your own mods. If you want to tell your own stories, and share them with the community, this is the game for you. The editor is the same tool used by the devs to make the official modules. A regular player will get less mileage out of the official campaign. The base campaign, Dead Man's Switch is under 20 hours for a playthrough. I played through it 3 times with different style of characters, but the experience is more or less the same regardless of character type. The expansion, Dragonfall, was also under 20 hours of playtime. I have only played that campaign once. Its a much more satisfying experience than the base campaign, but still, limited replay-ability. There are a couple optional missions you can play, but they both are fairly linear overall.The place where you can get strong replay-ability is the fan made modules. Some of them are really incredible. The downside is that being fan made you need to be patient for them to finish. It is entirely likely that you will start one and then finish everything that is there and be stuck waiting for the next installment.			"

												Hype and expectation are funny things. They can invite even the most rational and level-headed into wish fulfulment FAR beyond the truth, and we all know how prevalent that is in video gaming. I honestly believe that this game's reputation absolutely suffers from precisely this, especially from the view of some players. So, Shadowrun Returns - the question is ""does it"", or rather ""does it REALLY warrant the return?"" Let's start with the expectation part I mentioned. When this game was proposed, those that were fans of the old tabletop RPG and the old SNES classic sat up and took notice, and for good reason. Nostalgia aside, both are truly excellent games in their own rights. The downside to this is that it tends to set the bar VERY high, expectation-wise.Fast forward to the game's release, and there were certainly mixed views; much of the criticism dealt with there being less on the action and more on the text and story. Also, length was cited too, or rather, lack of it. On the face of it, very valid criticisms, except that many of these either forgot or didn't understand WHAT the game was achieving - a new version of the classic games, adhering closely to the rules - in short, Shadowrun RETURNS. The clue's in the name. It does what it says on the tin.So, there's an abundance of text and story, and less of the action itself, and yes, it is a bit short. While they are valid concerns EVERY game buyer should consider before dropping their cash, context is also equally important. Apologies for this slightly overblown introduction, but I felt it valid to lay this down at the outset. Let's get on with the review.If you know what Shadowrun is (or was), then there's little point in going over this and you can skim to the last paragraph. If you don't, then as I've already said, there's the classic tabletop ""D&D style"" game - a pure, unadulterated old-school pencil and paper RPG. The hook here is that elves, orcs, goblins and all the staples of fantasy exist, but the one major difference is everything is a futuristic sci-fi bent. It probably sounds completely at odds with one another, but it works so very, very well, both in lore and in combat ... ESPECIALLY in combat. You can still hack 'n' slash if you want to, you can still use magic if you want to, but add to the mix firearms and a complete veneer of futuristic and modern tech, and you have Shadowrun.It rather goes without saying that anyone who has spent any time playing old-school tabletop RPG knows that story and text are perhaps the premier parts, and that is the case here, naturally. But the question to the critics remains ""ah, but it is any good?"" Thankfully, the answer is ""yes, it is"".I confess I'm a little jaded. I've been around gaming since the very start, and have never had a period when I've not been involved. I've seen a lot, played a lot, own a lot, and have even worked in the industry (albeit relatively briefly). For the most part, I care little for story in games - most times I'm merely concerned with the mechanics over everything else. I couldn't tell you the story of Halo, for example, as it never gripped me in any way. So, why on earth am I saying this game's story is good? Because it DID grip me right from the off. It works. You know the story's working on you when you can start to identify and remember the characters. So, being heavy on the story is an ASSET to this game, and in no way a hindrance. I shan't spoil it in any way, but it's a fairly standard story, but it does it pretty well, so in summary I don't see the critique of ""too much story, too little action"" in any way a bad thing unless it's REALLY not your thing.Now, onto length. Yes, it IS relatively short. However, you should at least consider the reasoning behind the game's existence - it would never have seen the light of day AT ALL were it not for crowd-funding. Sure, you can claim they made big promises and ran out of resources and/or time, but the conclusion here is that putting all those aside the end product is pretty damned good. As stated before, it very much does what it says on the tin. So, if you don't mind quantity being less if the quality's good or reasonable, then there is no issue here. What does render the length argument completely invalid is one thing - WORKSHOP support. There's TONS of user-generated content out there which not only mimics what tabletop RPGs are all about, but the inclusion of mod tools (which I haven't tried) ensure that it's pretty easy to dole out a good scenario, and it certainly shows. So, if you finish the game and want more, you won't be disappointed at all.The combat is best described as being very similar to XCOM. It's turn-based with the dual-turn set of movement/action phases per character, or a mixture of those: you move, you shoot/swing/etc, and your turn's over. Your playfield is peppered with objects that you can utilize as cover, with the shield icon offering how good that cover is. This all offers a lovely tactical play where you don't just consider dumping your character up against the enemy and swing away at them, but you have to consider balancing cover with line of sight, flanking, and a number of other little tricks to make the best use of the battle.Character skills are great. As you'd rightly expect from a combination fantasy/sci-fi, it lends you a VERY wide palette of things to mess around with. Fire-based magic attacks? Sure. Rifles, pistols, or SMGs? Yup, have at them. Fire-based attacks WITH your pistol? Yup, that too. It does the Shadowrun rules well, and the interface is clear and intuitive and you'll have no issues picking it up quickly.Visually, the game offers a very nice art-style that does the medium justice. Backgrounds are all pre-rendered and hand-drawn (or at least they LOOK hand-drawn) in a graphic novel style which suits perfectly. Nothing I can fault here at all. Musically, the soundstrack is really good. I'm not a big fan of music soundtracks - I'm not one who will listen to them outside of the game. To me, they're a background that serves to provide ingredient to the recipe. They should illustrate without hindering the game in any way. Not only does the style and mood of the music suit perfectly, but it's not repetitive, and remains interesting without hindering in ANY way. If you're someone who does listen to game music absent of the game, you might well find this one very appealing.So, final summary time. Is it worth purchasing? Yes. If you are expecting a good turn-based old-shool RPG, it's worth it. Steam Workshop really underlines this, value-wise. The only caveat I would make is that if you're either not sure whether this sort of game's for you, or the length of the official game really is an issue for you, I'd thoroughly recommend waiting for a sale - it's still worth picking up.Final note I'm doing with all my reviews now: I'm giving a ""what do I think the game's worth?"" instead of any score or other metric, as I think that's the most valuable metric anyone could have. I'd say this deserves a £9 (or your regional equivalent).			"

												Pros:-Some good writing-Turn based combat is great, slightly better than Fallout with cover system.-Beautiful hand drawn world-Game editor and User Generated Content. (from what I read, the editor is quite restricted.)Cons:-Clunky user interface, clearly meant for touchscreens-No voiceover.-Non interactive world. Everything that you can interact with is highlighted with the hand icon. Anything not highlighted is just a background. Makes the world feel empty. -Non practical inventory system: cannot trade items between party members. You can only manage your inventory during start of a mission and at the safehouse.-Too little choice of weapon and armor.-No lootable corpse. Perished enemy will simply disappear into the thin air.-Moving and clicking is a bit off, particularly because it's a tablet game in the first place.-Extremely linear campaign and no sidequests.On tablet this game easily score an 8 out of 10. The game was designed for tablets in mind, making the developers overlooked some of its flaws and ignored many of the aspect of a good RPG other than writing. In fact, Harebrained Schemes (HBS) is a tablet game developer, has only released mobile games.Bear in mind that Shadowrun Returns comes with an editor and a default campaign made by HBS. The campaign is restricting and painfully linear. You cannot go back to previously visited place and there's only a few sidequest that you can do for extra cash. Right now there is some user made campaign available on the workshop which was designed better than the campaign made by the devs.Shadowrun Returns is a disappointing RPG lacking of real depth with so many unfullfilled potentials. If you're really looking up for this title and has already run out of RPGs to play, just wait for a sale.Score: 6/10Edit: You can now save anywhere in this game. And they lower the price too.			"

												** My full reaction is here on my blog should you want it http://riksreaction.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/riks-reaction-to-shadowrun-returns-pc.html **I thought this was great, from start to finish. Excellent. It is difficult to know what else to say... I just thought this was great. I'll just ramble as follows.As an RPG it was the perfect amount of complexity, deep but easy to understand.The artwork is lovely, everything is well animated and it is just generally a really attractive game.It is VERY well written IMHO, the characters come to life through the text and written dialogue, it's great! I honestly felt like I was enjoying an interactive book, which is a feeling I tend to get when I am fully engaged. The locations, the people, the story.. all of it is vivid and believable, not so much due to the on screen action, but more through the filter of my imagination which the writing nutures throughout, things playing out in my mind's eye as I read the next interchange between characters, or digested the description of the place I'd just arrived at.The narrative is solid, and makes sense (within the world it is told) and pans out well, I thought the pacing was excellent.Some might dislike the linear nature of the game, I personally love it. Side missions are available, but they are in direct relevance to the main storyline at all times which keeps things moving, and therefore aren't always available for you to come back to tidy up and complete later, so bear that in mind. I am a fan of a well told story, and ""sandbox"" games are never as good as experience for me as being told a well crafted story. Shadowrun Returns nails this.I really enjoyed this game, took me 17.2 hours to complete but it felt like a lot less purely because I was enjoying every minute of it and was just waiting to turn the next page in this electronic short story and learn what was going to happen next. Like a good book, it was tough to put down.It has it's flaws here and there, like checkpoint saves (due to be changed in a patch or via the next DLC I understand), some sections keeping you in turn based combat mode when there aren't any enemies about and on some of the longer battles the combat music can get a little tiring, but those are small complaints. Excellent and I'm looking forward to see what they do next! Recommended.			"

												The SNES Shadowrun was the jewel of my cartridge collection. I've honestly lost count of how many times I've played through it. With that in mind I started up my journey into Shadowrun Returns with a healthy dose of nostalgia and optimism, and at the end of the journey I came away happy, if not entirely satisfied.Unlike the Shadowrun of yore, Returns plays like an odd crossing of point & click adventure and turn-based strategy. Your runner is investigating the death of an old friend, and in each scene spends most of their time navigating dense dialogues with the many NPCs on hand. You might also be tasked to click on an object or a door, but the vast majority of the non-combat gameplay is talking. It's good talking, though, with some very colorful characters and attentive writing. The parentheticals get a little too heady and poetic for my tastes, but they set the scenes well enough. Overall the game nails the Shadowrun setting, which goes a long way towards keeping me interested.Combat is the other side of the coin, and while it works better than the ancient art of ""stand in place and shoot forever"", it's not without its flaws. Your crew and the enemy forces each take turns expending the action points of their members on a grid map with cover objects, much like in the recent XCOM. AP is spent a little oddly, however. Each move within a certain range costs one AP, whether it be a single step or a dash to the edge of their range. With melee weapons this is fine because the melee attack is included with the move, but ranged weapons cost at least one AP just to fire, so getting into an ideal position and firing can be a costly proposition. Doubly so when the sight lines around the environments are not terribly consistent, and it costs a full AP just to reload. It's an imperfect system that works well enough, but could definitely use more polish.There are plenty of ways to kill people though, and enough skill points to earn through the game to make the most of them. You have melee, five different firearm types, drones, and two kinds of magic, and that's not even getting into the support skills. Unfortunately, there's not much reason to diversify, and the game even tells you as much. High ranks in skills are very powerful, and spreading your points around won't give you the ranks you need to pass skill checks or hit later enemies. Plus, you hire party members from a large roster of shadowrunners who can easily fill in the gaps for you.These gripes are really part of a larger trend with Returns. You can buy weapons, armor, and other upgrades, but they are unevenly spaced throughout the game. There's not much to interact with in the many levels, and no real branching paths to explore. You can be a decker and get into the Matrix side battles, but they are few and far between. Your hired runners have no personality and can't be interacted with other than ordered around in battle. Even the story, built on some genuinely good writing, is small in scope and lacks any sort of proper build-up. It all points to a game not fully realized, a lot of potential without a lot of substance. The whole time I was playing, Returns felt more like a demo for the game engine than a full product.That's not to say it wasn't fun. I thoroughly enjoyed the 8-10 hours it took to complete, and aside from a particularly annoying final mission, had no major complaints about it. The issue is more a lot of little shortcomings mounting to give Returns a very half-baked feel. It's definitely worth playing, and I'm very interested to follow it with Dragonfall, but I wouldn't fault anyone who checked out after a few hours. Shadowrun Returns is a good enough Shadowrun game, and now I want a better one.			"

												I love Shadowrun as an IP.  It was one of the first pen and paper games I ever played 20 years ago, and my friends and I still plat it regularly (though now we're on the 5th Edition). But this is a hard game to recommend.  The mechanics are fine, but it's very easy to run into unsolvable problems - if you roll a hacker, you're going to have very little to do in the main campaign and are going to rely on NPCs and hirelings.  And if you're not a hacker, every time you NEED a hacker you'll be provided one free of charge.There's more too it than that, of course, but that's pretty illustrative.  The game feels extremely limited in a lot of places, from missing mentor spirits to customization through what's available from the NPC stores.   Honestly you'd probably be better trcking down an old copy of Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magicka Obscura.			"

												I think I had never heard of Shadowrun before a friend of mine gifted this game to me. When I started playing it, I discovered a great world, filled with an unique style and characters.The setting is fantastic. A futuristic world where people can replace their limbs with mechanical implants a la Deus Ex, mixed with magic and fantastic creatures. The gameplay is quite fun, it reminds me of the turn based RPGs I used to play when I was younger, although in this game the combat is more tactical, with things like cover and area effects.The character customization is great; you can select your character's gender, its race (Human, Elf, Orc, Troll and Dwarf), and its abilities, some of them being street samurai, shaman, and decker. Even then, you can further customize your character by spending ""Karma points"" to unlock new abilities.The story is quite good, and there's plenty of dialogue options during the conversations, even more if you have the proper abilities. Another great point is the soundtrack, which really set the mood.So, to conclude, I highly recommend this game.			"

												I hesitated in picking up this game after reading a lot about how terrible the original campaign was and how the game was dull and boring. It also didn't help that I didn't really know anything about the Shadowrun universe. During the Summer Sale though, I was in the mood for something new, and picked it up. I just finished playing through the original campaign (Dead Man's Switch - DMS) and have to say, I'm glad I bought the game.Getting the basics out of the way, I admit that DMS is very linear. There is a lot of reading involved. And besides combat, there's not a lot of interaction with the world. Still, as someone who knew next to nothing about Shadowrun before I started, I think DMS does a very good job of introducing the player to the world and the mythos surrounding it. The reading will probably be boring to someone who is deeply familiar with the setting, but I found it very useful. Gameplay is likewise straightforward which allows a new player to dive in without fear of messing up. I played a Street Samurai / Decker and had no trouble. I did find myself wishing I could build a party and level them up, outfitting them and whatnot ala Baldur's Gate, but perhaps that will happen in an expansion.All in all, this game was well worth the $4 I paid. I also picked up the DLC, which I read is much better - I look forward to trying that next. "

												There are curently 3 Shadowrun games from Harebrained Schemes. Shadowrun Returns is the first one they have released and clearly the weakest of the three. That does not mean that Shadowrun Returns is a bad game, far from it. The following titles are simply much better and deeper experiences, making Shadowrun Returns kind of no longer relevant. For people with limited free time, if you want to play a Shadowrun Game, go for Dragonfall first, Hong Kong second and, if you still crave more, give Shadowrun Returns a shot. The Good:+ Great, immersive atmosphere+ Well designed visual styleThe Mediocre:~ Combat needs polish, some character builds are overpowered, other almost useless~ Relatively short~ The plot is not very interestingThe Bad:- Extremely linear, the player does not have much say in how the plot unfolds			"

												If you're expecting an RPG with open world and long hours of playing, this is not for you.This is a short (I finished it in about 12 hours of gameplay, not rushing or anything) and linear (at no point there is even an option of doing something different, picking different ways, or other stuff you would expect from an RPG) game.That being said, during those 12 hours I had a nice time. The story is interesting, the gameplay & interface is enjoyable, and for a simple game with no voice acting, the atmosphere is amazing.I would definitely recommend if you find this at a discount. Well worth if a few bucks for the 12 hour fun - just don't expect it to be a super production. "

												Tactical RPG putting you in the role of shadowrunner - a freelancer merk with private motivation to do some investigation properly. World of Shadowrun is rich, full of postmodern and fantasy, yet it is a very pragmatical and cynical one. Lovely thing, just like the big world behind the window, only with magic. Sadly, unlike D&D universe, it was poorely pictured in the videogames (there was 2 good games, but only on 16bit consoles - Genesis and SNES).Aside from my previous experience with the Shadowrun universe, game's a good one. Solid cyberpunk story (and fitted to Shadowrun agenda, as well). Fascinating music. Good battle system (if only too easy for my tastes, even on the hardest). Decent rpg skills system, not without a flaws, but - fair enough.So, generally - it's good. Not excellent, but good. Like 7/10 in my book.Although. I love Shadowrun, and I would give the game more - just for good revival - if only they would made Matrix better. That's a major disengage for me in the whole game. They just did another field for shootouts in the Matrix, not anything near hacking. I've played many interpretations of Shadowrun, and that game made almost everything fine - but ruined cyberspace. It's like making a remake of ""Singin' in the Rain"" movie without actually singing in the process.Think I'll go and play some blues now.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a decently capable game and most of all is a good start. It will be interesting to see where the game ends up, as the game comes bundled with an editor allowing for a lot of potential from the community making Shadowrun Returns a game that is likely going to grow a lot over time. The current module, The Dead Man’s Switch, is an okay experience which is sadly awfully limited in story decisions and suffers from many little oversights and rough flaws such as underwhelming AI and a lack of simple quality of life systems such as manual saving, but does contain excellent writing that incorporates much of the interesting universe without overwhelming newcomers.As such, the potential is definitly there and what it currently contains will be entertaining and fun to go through for the RPG fan, but it isn’t anything that will happily surprise you or amaze you in any way. If you are looking for a decent RPG with good writing and a solid amount of abilities and skills to choose from, Shadowrun Returns is an easy recommendation. Full review:

												Hoi chummers! Welcome to Shadowrun Returns. This game has a wealth of content to explore, including full campaigns in Seattle (Dead Man's Switch) and Berlin (Dragonfall). After you finish the professionally made campaigns, try out more free content on Steam Workshop. You can also write your own stories in the Editor, kind of like using Legos. There is a large and welcoming community of fellow players and content creators and we hope you enjoy the game!			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a turn-based cyberpunk themed strategy R.P.G. developed by Harebrained Schemes and published by Harebrained Holdings. Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation nearly 25 years ago. Now, creator Jordan Weisman returns to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical roleplaying game. The year is 2054 and magic has returned to the world awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend as technology merges with flesh and consciousness. As a shadowrunner, you're a mercenary living on the fringes of society, in the shadows of massive corporate arcologies, surviving day-by-day on skill and instinct alone. Shadowrun Returns harkens back to the classic old school roleplaying games from back in the day. The top-down isometic view, intense turn-based combat and non-voiced dialogue of a traditional R.P.G. are expertly blended in this fantastic indie title from Harebrained Holdings. The story is divided into campaigns which can range from solving murders to battling corporate espionage and a number of other different situations and once you've finished the games main storyline you can download new user created campaigns from the Steam Workshop or the Nexus which further extends the replayability of this great title.Besides the excellent story, the turn-based combat of course is one of the best features of this game. Progressing through the narrative will reward you with experience points and allow you to grow your character in any direction that you choose. Want to summon spirits as an elven shaman, be an expert hacker or go guns and blade ablazing as a Street Samurai? The choice is up to you. As the leader of the group, it's also up to you to choose the right balance of combat, tech and magical abilities in order to have a successful run. The gripping tactical combat system is quick and responsive and just a fun alternative to the combat of today's more popular roleplaying games.Graphically the game looks terrific in full high definition with its futuristic cyberpunk setting. The environments are also quite varied as you will travel from the slums of the Redmond Barrens to the extravagant offices of powerful corporations and beyond. The character portraits presented during conversations have a unique style that lends itself well to this title and I find the isometric backgrounds and set pieces delightful to view. One of my favorite things about these types of games are the small details in the world around you and this title is chock full of them and add to that some excellent sound effects and a terrific musical score and Shadowrun Returns delivers big time. If you're a R.P.G. fan looking for something a little different to add to your library or just enjoy old-school or retro games then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Shadowrun Returns! You will not be dissapointed with this title.			"

												A huge disappointment.  I was really looking forward to this game since it showed up on Kickstarter.  Fallout 1 & 2 are among my favorite games ever, and this was touted as a return to that style of RPG.  It...isn't.I find the combat enjoyable.  It's basically a simplified version of XCOM:  Enemy Unknown.  One problem with it is that once combat starts, it doesn't end until you move to another map, even if there are no enemies around.  So after a fight ends, you'll have to move your party through the map in turn-based mode until you get to an exit.The story is good by video game standards.  You receive a recorded message from an old friend who's been murdered and are tasked with tracking down his killer.  For the most part, dialogue is well-written.  There's no voice acting, which some may take issue with, but it allows for more robust dialogue.  Unfortunately, this game doesn't take advantage of that benefit.The game is extraordinarily linear.  There's exactly one path through the story.  A handful of situations where you may be able to get from point A to point B by a slightly different route exist (i.e., bluff your way past a guard vs. hacking through an unguarded door), but these are so few and so insignificant that they don't make any real difference overall.  Dialogue is pretty much the same no matter what:  Ask about story-related stuff, ask about general backround/setting information.  Very little opportunity to employ your character's personality.Sidequests are almost nonexistent, and the few that the game does have are simple ""go over there and get me that thing,"" or ""while you're on this run, see if you can find a thing I want"" sorts of things.The whole game is designed entirely around mobile devices and it suffers for it.  The UI is a bit clunky and unintuitive for PC, limited to what would work on a touch-based interface.  The save system is simply unacceptable.  The game has no manual save option.  Not even a save and quit function.  It's entirely based on reaching checkpoints.  This is supposed to be fixed with the DLC scheduled for January 2014, but until then, if you screw up a fight at the end of a mission?  You're replaying the whole mission.  Have to leave before you finish a mission?  You're replaying the whole mission.  As I understand it, this is because the game cannot save the current map state, which explains some of the linearity.  When you return to a location, you're actually loading a completely different map of the location with its own triggers, different versions of NPCs with dialogue appropriate to that point in the story, etc.  This means that the player can't affect any change in the game as every change or combination of changes to a location would require its own unique map, and I'm not even sure if the game is able to load different versions of the same map based on variables.I can't really speak to the user-generated content as I haven't used the editor or played any user-made campaigns yet, but from what I've heard from those who have, the editor is very, very limited in what it can do.  As a result, a lot of people who were planning on making content for the game have given up.Maybe the upcoming DLC will improve the editor, maybe (probably) it won't.  Either way, I wouldn't suggest paying more than about $5 for Shadowrun Returns.			"

												Shadowrun is an RPG set in a future version of Earth where Elves, Orcs and magic exist. It has a strong story, involving murder investigations, corporate espionage and supernatural rituals. There are many interesting NPCs and good dialogue choices, although sadly no voice acting. The stats/skills level up system has some nice depth, and some stats can influence dialogue options. Combat is like Xcom, turn based with a squad of 4, with action points to spend on moving, firing guns or using items/magic. Some squad members are hired temporarily before each quest, have no dialogue, and you can't customise their stats/gear, so unfortunately they lack personality. Levels are small and the whole game is quite linear, with not much scope for exploration. But the campaign lasts around 11 hours so value for money is good. The music is fantastic and really adds to the atmosphere. Although some things could be improved, its still very enjoyable and well worth checking out.Review update: DragonfallDragonfall takes the formula established in the original release, and improves on it in several ways. Its actually misleading to describe this as ""DLC"". These days, particularly in the RPG genre, that term conjures up thoughts of short quests and meaningless item packs. Dragonfall is more like the good old days of expansion packs, where you got a meaty chunk of gameplay to sink your teeth into.The story is excellent, one of the best I've played through in any game for quite some time. The action has shifted to Berlin, where you've joined a crew of shadowrunners on a contract to extract some data from a vault. Predictably, the mission goes wrong, dragging you into another deep conspiracy full of twists and turns, that also helps to explain more of the world's lore.Because your crew are fully fleshed out characters, instead of the original's mostly hired help, each character has much more depth to their personality. They have a past, they have feelings, and the story is given increased emotional weight through conversations with these characters.The gameplay mechanics, tactical turn based combat, and level up system all remain intact, and we now have the ability to save anywhere, rather than being limited to the original's checkpoint only system. Quest structure is less linear than before. You have some control over which order to play certain quests, and most quests have optional objectives that, if completed, provide greater (or alternate) rewards. You'll also have some tough moral choices to consider which affect quest outcomes, and many areas allow for the use of non combat skills, including talking your way past guards or hacking computers to gain information.Dragonfall took me 19 hours to complete, which is significantly longer than the original game, and represents excellent value for money at full price. I don't recall encountering any bugs at all.Overall Dragonfall is amazing, and I rate it as an absolute MUST BUY.			"

												My last reccomendation was unfair to the development team. I overlooked the fact that this game was pumped out by a minimal staff in a very short deadline, so I'm going to re-write my assessment.Boring, clunky, and linear. This game has great concepts behind it, but is not executed well. The storyline might be a fascinating read, but does not engage the player at all. The best scripted fight, the last fight of the game about 8 hours in, is almost as fun as the prologue of Neverwinter Nights. Almost.My biggest complaint is with the story, but the game has potential to give the community what they are thirsty for. I'm not overly impressed with the graphics, and I really wished I could have changed angles from the point of view on the field, but for the most part the combat and character navigation is easy enough to manage. The equipment is very simple, though not explained well (*cough cybernetics cough*), and you don't have to put much thought into micro-managing your character or your hire-by-mission squadmates. It's impossible to get attached to characters as they're just a portrait to represent the mathhammer you wield as the gamer.I did really like the etiquitte aspect to your character. The game gives you more conversation options if you have a higher Charisma stat, and with a higher Charisma you learn new jargon by which to speak with the appropriate factions (ie shadowrunners, security, corporate, or gang). Unfortunately, the dialogue is still linear and it only provides introductory ports for the equifinality of the storyline.Pros: cheap, potential for community contribution, non-demanding of hardware, neat concepts.Cons: easy, impersonal, clunky, and inconsequential.4/10			"

As of now it's just a cyber space with the same mechanics of the real world, just with different weapons and enemies.Little tips to new-comers: don't spend your karma points until you know what type of mission you're about to face, don't spend all of your money and make use of allies' items first of all.

Short version: 76%Harebrained Schemes made a nice but not too spectacular attempt at adapting the rules of the original Shadowrun game books in a video game format. The end product is a bit simple but still enjoyable, medium-length turn-based tactical combat RPG in a great cyberpunk setting.Long version:Whenever pen-and-paper RPG rules are adapted in video game format, the results are always unpredictable. In the case of Shadowrun Returns though, there was no risk involved: one of the original creators of the Shadowrun universe leads Harebrained Schemes, the studio behind this game.On the flipside, the developers pretty much assumed that those who will play this game are already familiar enough with the setting. While this lack of handholding can be refreshing, it may scare away a few people who won’t have the patience to delve into the depths of the game mechanics.And learning is an important part, since Shadowrun Returns is an almost purely tactical combat RPG. There are plenty of dialogues and datalogs to read, but they have very little influence on the events; the bulk of the game is spent on the turn-based combat levels.Said levels try to offer many different layouts, settings, and even enemy types, but they lack in variety when it comes to approach. Out of all the possible classes, deckers (hackers) have incredibly limited roles on a handful of runs, and magic or hand-to-hand feel underpowered compared to a simple-as-a-stick assault rifle wielding warrior. (Not to mention that one mission will force the player to use a specific weapon type, even if they have zero points in that skill.)Some of these unbalances can be corrected with a good party, but by limiting the player in choices, one still cannot help but feel as if this game is only good as a first attempt, nothing more—which would be correct, as the later entries will open up a much wider world…			"

												One of the first big Kickstarted franchise releases, Shadowrun Returns had a great deal to live up to. Not only did it carry the torch for the next generation of crowd-funded games, it was also the first title in several years for a much beloved franchise. A sequel of sorts to the very well-regarded SNES title, Shadowrun Returns revisits the grungy streets of Seattle 2054, an urban wasteland controlled by mega-corporations, into which magic has re-awakened, and a variety of meta-human races have re-emerged. You play as a Shadow Runner, a sort of special agent for hire who offers their skills out to anyone willing to pay the right price. In this case, you’re contacted by an old buddy who wants you to hunt down a murderer. His own in fact.The campaign that comes with Shadowrun is being touted as a sort of sample story to inspire modders to create their own stories, but honestly it’s of sufficient quality that it justifies a purchase on its own. Dropping enough hints and allusions to the greater Shadowrun fiction to get hardcore fans salivating, it tells a standalone tale full of double-crosses, femme fatales, duplicitous corporations and shady cults that immerses newcomers in the world without bombarding them with unnecessary exposition and world detail.One of the great joys of the setting is the clash between familiar fantasy and cyberpunk tropes. Traditional fantasy races and concepts like mages and elves exist alongside mega-corporations and streetwise hackers, struggling to survive in the lawless urban wasteland. Over-familiarity with basic conventions is a common problem in fantasy, so it’s intriguing to visit a universe where that predictability has been largely removed. Although, unsurprisingly, elves remain pompous, haughty ♥♥♥♥♥ even in Shadowrun. It’s a world that feels both vibrant and entropic, colourful and bleak, and it’s brought to life through a vibrant and consistent art style. Character art stays just on the right side of cartoonish, each portrait giving you a sense of the character while allowing your imagination, and the excellent dialogue, to fill in the rest. Hulking trolls and lithe, graceful elves scamper about on a lush selection of neon-lit cyberpunk cityscapes, while the rain pours down and shreds of newspaper and cigarette packets are scattered by the wind. The thumping background score completes the sense of immersion. It’s genuinely one of the most visually stylish games released in 2013.While the visuals do their part to set the scene, it’s the writing and storytelling that really sell the setting. Characters are understandably painted in rather broad strokes, but they still feel believable and likeable, from your hard-bitten buddy Coyote to the streetwise Jake Armitage (think a ginger Han Solo with a penchant for sleeping in morgue trays) and the politically astute troll bouncer Mr. Kluwe. Even negotiations with background NPC’s feel real. Thugs and gangsters speak in an unfamiliar street cant, peppering each sentence with baroque and occasionally impenetrable slang. Grab a rank or two in the charisma stat and you can select an ‘etiquette’, essentially giving your character a familiarity within one of the social strata that make up the Shadowrun world, from high-flying socialites to street-level hustlers. Your character’s possible dialogue responses are also really great, allowing for a range of deadpan cynicism and/or colourful insults.The focus on one small cabal of runners is a great idea, as each character gets their moment in the spotlight, and the sense of a dysfunctional family of scoundrels is well developed over the course of the game. There’s even a surprisingly deft and touching final scene. While the main plot itself loses a little character in the final third, and there’s relatively few chances to dramatically affect the flow of the story, on the whole it’s an enjoyable adventure with a couple of nice twists and some dastardly villains to take down. Hopefully developers Harebrained Schemes will serve up some more adventures with this bunch of miscreants and rogues.When you head out to crack some heads, Shadowrun Returns offers a deep and satisfying turn-based combat system. Everything revolves around ‘action points’, which govern exactly how many moves you can make in combat. Firing a single shot from your pistol might take up one point, while carefully zeroing in on an ork thug’s eyeball takes two – the former frees you up to move into cover, while the latter eats up your movement but increases the chance of a critical hit. Adding to the mix are various abilities from different skill trees. While this is essentially a classless game, meaning you can build your character however you like, for new players it’s advisable to stick to one of the pre-arranged packages, which range from spell-slinging mages to riggers, who take the Robot Wars approach to combat by using controllable drones. You can branch out of your chosen package at any time if you fancy dipping into weapon skills or even grabbing some cyber-warfare skills. Jack into the matrix as a ‘decker’ and you’ll find you can circumvent some of the detective work you might otherwise be forced to do.Each play-style has a few unique tricks for you to discover in the heat of battle. Mages can find lay-lines of magical power, that if stood on increase the efficiency of their spells. Shamans can instead spot hidden elemental spirits that can be summoned into a fight. In one of Shadowrun‘s best combat features, controlling a spirit becomes a dangerous game of risk and reward. You can invest your summon with up to four action points, making them extremely dangerous in a fight. Charging them up too much, however, increases the likelihood that they can break free, leaving you with one incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off fire elemental to deal with in addition to the other twelve ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Riggers can use their robot buddies to flank enemies through conveniently placed vents, allowing you to both scout ahead and get the drop on guards. My only qualm is that sound effects don’t quite carry the punch of the rest of the audio design. Some more weighty gunshots and spell effects would be welcome.Since Shadowrun is all about disparate operatives coming together for well-paid but dangerous missions, it makes sense that before each mission you can select your team. Contacts in your base of operations provide a list of agents covering each class, as well as some more unique multiclass characters. You pay a certain amount to each runner to get them in your squad, with some of the more devastating operatives only available to those with sufficient cash. It’s a nice touch that encourages careful selection,as each runner possesses their own load-out which may or may not mesh with your needs. However, the lack of customisation seems like a missed opportunity, as Shadowrun seems tailor-made for the same kind of attachment you had to your X-Com: Enemy Unknown commandos.Bugs seem largely non-existent, apart from the occasional grammatical mistake buried deep in the text. Despite these relatively minor imperfections, however, Harebrained Schemes have done a bang-up job with Shadowrun Returns. Interfaces are clean, slick and, despite inventory management being slightly awkward due to the need to keep cycling unused items back and forth to your stash, generally intuitive.Shadowrun Returns exceeded my every expectation. It is by far the best title in the franchise since the 16-bit era. Shadowrun fans and RPG enthusiasts who loved the late-'90s isometric games should definitely check it out.			"

												I love the Shadowrun universe, so I was pretty excited about the kickstart campaing and the eventual release of this game. As an old school gamer, my gaming history is based on games like Fallout(1&2), Shadowrun(original), XCOM(originals) and many other genre-defining legends, my expectations were pretty high I must confess.Once I finished the game (about 10h or so) I couldnt believe that it was over, it felt like something was missing.It was the realization that the experience I hoped for was never going to be delivered.The game is not a total waste but it's tremendously shallow, as linear as it can possibly be.Character creation doesnt feel deep enough: generic 3D models, character photos that do not represent your model, lack of customization, lack of classes information...During the course of the game you do not interact with the game-world but with overlays on it, you will never go up or down a stair, you interact with the overlay near the stair and then you go up or down.Leveling up feels boring, most of the time you don't feel like getting stronger. Also the possibility to wait for a stat check barrier (the game tells what values are needed) to spend your karma points feels really sad.All around It's an excessively minimalist game: graphical engine, art, interface, world, combat, skills, progression... everything.If it was a mobile game it would've been a fair accomplishment, but at this point in gaming history, a ""return"" to Shadowrun universe as a PC game shouldn't have looked like this.This game lacks depth for a Shadowrun universe PC game.Two good aspects of the game though:- story: Does a good job immersing you on the plot.- content creating community: The level editor and the content created by the community can keep you entertained if you happen to like the game. The community made a lot of other adventures for you to run if you wish.For me, that is not enough and, most importantly, not what I was looking for on this ""return"".For people with high expectations as mine I cannot recommend this game.

												Huge oversight on the design of this game, is that noncombat ""skill checks"" for interacting with the environment can only be done by your character.What this means is, say you have three hired mercenaries on your team.  One of them is the ""hacker"" role.  You go to a computer in a noncombat situation, and want to hack it.  You have no hack skill, but the hacker merc you hired has plenty of hacker skill level to break into the computer.  But the game doesn't let your use your hacker to open the computer - only YOUR character's hack skill is checked.  So, there is NO reason to hire a hacker, since they can't be used to hack in noncombat situations.  Utterly stupid.  If you don't take the hacker role for your character, you literally have NO ability to hack outside of combat situations, since your hacker mercearies can only hack in combat.  Thus, hacker mercs are pretty terrible. There's things like Strength checks too.  Like, your character is not strong enought to move a fridge, but the troll you hired has enough to move it.  But again, it's not combat, so your troll can't help you.  WTF.AND THERE'S SO MANY BUGS!  Scripted events fail to trigger, game freezes, can't progress in missions...Sloppy.NOTE:  The later sequels, Dragonfall and Hong Kong, have fixed the hacking oversight.			"

												This is a rpg game in a world where fantasy and technology mix perfectly.  If you enjoy androids, giant insects, cyberpunk, guns, and are a fan of ""Blade Runner"", you will enjoy the odd characters and turn based combat. If you enjoy reading narrative instead of hearing it, this is for you.			"

												This game has one official story, and it is pretty linear. You can complete the full campaign within hours, and there are no official post-game contents.The battle system is turn-based, grid-like strategy fight. You control up to 4 players, and fight againts enemies either by using guns, melee weapons, or spells. The battle itself isn't hard to understand, but it is very challenging if you are playing harder difficulties with an unprepared party.The main character is very customizable, it takes my first playthru a lot of times struggling on how to develop my character. However, after one playthru, I find the customization choice is pretty unnecessary, since you can always hire a full team of balanced shadowrunners to do all the work.The story or dialogue choices make very little difference to the plot, most of the time they just affect the next NPC sentence and that's all.The plot is interesting and fit in the game setting pretty well.Glitches still happens to me in this game, most of them forces me to restart the game and lose less than 20 minutes of playtime since the last checkpoint. But so far nothing game-breaking.I was a huge fan of the SEGA Genesis version. This game gives me some nostalgia because of the character and plot setting, but the gameplay itself is very disappointing. So I have a mixed feeling for this game.The game on itself is pretty decent, but it kinda ruins the impression I have for the franchise. In my opinion, this game is pretty good for players who are new to this franchise, but it is a disappointment for old fans.I wish this game have achievements.My Score: 6/10			"

												I played the classic on the SNES back in the day and only lasted 10 minutes before dying. No matter what I did, I died. I thought Shadowrun Returns might be as deadly as the original, but (thankfully) it wasn't.Shadowrun Returns looks amazing, and from the first moment it makes you wonder just what lies ahead in this strange cyberpunk world. The inviting world teasing you to explore and uncover the truths behind the deadman who wants you to find his killer, however... it never really got there.Don't get me wrong - the various maps look amazing, but there's little to them other than being a very impressive backdrop. There's no real reward for exploring, and the various NPCs that litter the sidewalks aren't much more than fancy decoration on an already good looking cake. Perhaps I was asking too much for this to be a deeply engrossing world, yet in a way it is an engrossing world thanks to the storytelling.What you are going to get in Shadowrun Returns is a great story, and for some it might even be too text heavy (especially if English isn't your native language). However, I enjoyed it, the story is basically a detective novel as you try to uncover the mystery of who killed your friend. The catch being the client is the deadman himself, which is great and is a nice nod to the old film noir movies of old.It's due to how well the story is written I can forgive it for being very linear with almost no plot trees or divergence due to your actions or selections that I noticed.In fact, that seems to be the theme of the game. It's a very well presented world, with a very well written story, but just seems to lack a little spice. There's very little loot, there's very little to explore, the skill tree looks rather impressive, but doesn't seem grab you at all. The same with character creation.I don't want to come across as overly negative with the game, as I really did enjoy what was offered, yet I feel like it could have offered so much more. Again, perhaps I'm demanding too much from what is already a very well presented game. On the plus side it has Steam Workshop intergration and there seems to be a host of community mods and projects underway, so a host of new content should just be around the corner. Likewise the developers have released DLC, which seemingly adds another layer to the game (perhaps that's what I'm looking for?). In short, a very solid game and a welcome return for Shadowrun, but it's not as brutal as the original and perhaps lacks that little something extra to make it a true great. Enjoy the detective story.			"

												While it could have been great, the game is simply flawed with the save system.I played Shadowrun in the late eighties, early nineties, and this game reminded me well known emotions during half an hour, after it was lost. Too few items, too few weapons, too little roleplaying.  "

												If you were to cross Bladerunner with The Dresden Files into a quality tactical strategy RPG hybrid, the result would no doubt be something very akin to Shadowrun Returns. Shadowrun Returns excels at story telling, the game is rich with lore, well written dialogues that feel more conversational than what most games accomplish, and a structured story full of plot twists and interesting characters. Perhaps my favorite point about the story is that it starts out small-scale, you are on a simple mission to look into the death of a friend, but it slowly ramps up into something larger as the story progresses. To top it off the game is set in a beautiful futuristic game world and has solid tactical gameplay to boot.More than anything this game to me was about an awesome sci-fi detective story. The mystery and intrigue suck you in, the stellar writing especially in regards to dialogue keeps you hooked. I'm not saying the game mimics what street talk may actually be like in the future, but it was great enough to get me immersed in the street life of futuristic Seattle. The characters within the game range from annoying (intentionally so), charming, grumpy, and likeable; chatting with the regulars throughout the story and going through the different chat options was something I enjoyed doing (shout out to Mr. Kluwe, you're the man, man!). The game's audio and visuals do justice to this story, bringing it to life with stunning hand drawn environments and appropriately mood setting music.The game's combat also leaves little to be desired. Although I felt the large scale management of the game to be a little inconsistent...for example the money you earn throughout the story can go into temporary lulls, and if you need to do a mission when you aren't expecting it you may find you don't have enough money to buy a full team of mercs. The game runs similar to most other tactical RPG games, especially similar to the XCOM series. You use the terrain to your advantage and in a turn based fashion you move your team about and order them to attack or use utility items/spells. On hard the game isn't terribly difficult and you shouldn't have to think deeply each turn on how to best arrange your team and how to best utilize there action points (how many actions they can take per turn). The combat is a bit sparse at the beginning of the game but as you progress further you start to battle the baddies more often and that's when the fun starts.Shadowrun Returns is a solid tactical RPG game, and with the addition of the Steam workshop can keep you playing well beyond the twelve hour campaign. The game's story is strong and the characters within are fun ones. It's nice to play a detective style game that isn't a point and click for a change. The game is quite gripping and just like any good detective novel it kept me at the edge of my seat until I got through to the end.			"

 Never trust people who you cant punch. Especially if they are already dead. Shadowrun Returns  is linear story-driven game with turn-based combat. You are a mercenary in a sci-fi world that also got few drops of magic and your goal is to find the murder of a friend of yours. Story and Writing The story plot is generic: You are called by your friend who was recently murdered and you have to find his murder. On the way you gonna meet other runners and people that will show you that there is more than meet the eye.Even with the generic plot, the writing is solid and often you see that there are several approaches in a conversation that is based on your stats and etiquette. But dont worry if you cant talk your way out, few bullets can do the same or maybe a few slashes or fireballs. Combat The combat in Shadowrun Returns is turn-based with Action Points and cover. If you played X-Com : Enemy Unknown , the combat will be old friend of yours if not then you will be in luck since combat is simple enough to learn but it can be hard to master.  First thing first : being melee you are allowed to walk and attack with 1 action point( more if the target is far away) while for range you cant run and gun. Instead  you will want to get in cover before you start spreading love/bullets/magic. If you arent fan of direct attacks you can instead use drones/spirit to do the dirty job. We should not forget and the AoE skills mainly because there is friendly fire so you have to be careful when you use them. Especially if there is low hit chance because if it misses, the AoE will hit somewhere near the targeted zone.Cover is mainly to reduce the chance to be hit but at times it may seem broken . Once I went behind a target that was in cover and my hit chance got reduced(in pointblank range) which was weird.Once you are familiar with meat-world combat you will have to encounted and the Matrix which can be accessed only by deckers . Combat in the matrix is the same but you use different skills and death in the Matrix means disconnect and damage to your real self. Equipment Thats one area which lacks content. While you have on your hands several kind of gear to use, you will find that there isnt much variety in it and you will just look for the higher numbers.First you have your outfit that provides armor and bonuses to different stats. Then you have your weapons melee/range/drones/ spells , Then you have slots for skills and last but not least you have consumables : medkit, revival kits,grenades , spirits.If you arent fan of using spells/magic then you will be glad to upgrade yourself with cyberware. Cyberware provides you with improved stats at the cost of your essence(the ability to use spells) which is a fair trade if you count on melee or range weapons.But still Equipment pool is lacking a lot. Character Customizatin Here we are with the best part of this game. I mean what is an RPG without a decent character customization , huh?While you can pick one of the 5 premade classes you are better off with making your own class and the customization deliver just that. There are 6 main stats : Body, Quickness(Agility), Strength , Intelligence , Willpower and Charisma. And each one of them got different branches that offer different skills(only Body doesnt have any those since its mainly to increase your HP). Quickness is important for your range gunners . It allows you to spend points on different gun types : Pistol,Shotgun, SMG and Rifle. It also let you increase your points in dodge which makes you harder to hit with physical attacks. It also allows you to specific actions in a conversation.Strength is important for your brawlers because it let you spend points on close combat : melee weapons or unarmed.In the same tree you will find and the throwable stats. And just like quickness, you can pick unique options during a dialogue.Intelligence is important for your techwizards: hackers or drone users. Hackers are useful when you are investigating because you will often find hackable objects that provides useful information. Also only Hackers(deckers) can enter the Matrix to provide you with extra information. Drone users on the other hand will be able to use higher level drones . On top of that Intelligence also contain the Biotech branch that increases the amount of HP you recover with medkits. And just like the other stats you are given unique dialogue options every now and then.Willpower is the main stats for mages. Increasing it will allow you to equip more and better spells. It also increases the chance to hit with them.Charisma is the main stats for spirit users and sweet talkers. Its most helpful if you try to talk your way out of a situation. It also allows you to have different etiquettes.Its worth noting that different races got different limit on some stats, And a friendly advice from me : Never try to be a Jack of all trades because there arent enough Karma points to let you do that. Instead focus on 2 stats and let other shadowrunners fill the weak spots(yes you can hire other runners on some missions). All in all is a solid game if you want to play a decent RPG nowadays. Often there will be different roads in solving a problem so its worth exploring and see the one way that fits you  "

												Note: this is for the base game without DLC/Dragonfall.I've never played a turn-based strategy combat RPG or whatever kind of game this is, before, so I didn't know what to expect. The gameplay mechanics felt so-so when I started. I played for like 30 minutes , gave up, then picked it up again a month or two later. Strategy isn't my forte so I was hesitant to crank the difficulty up for a challenge, it already felt frustrating to miss shots and then have to wait for things to happen during enemy turns. I got used to it after a couple hours, as I learned the game more and generally got smarter about what to do. I upgraded my opinion of the game play to ""yeah that seems alright then.""The class/karma point system is pretty interesting and I had fun toying with that. The decking/hacking bits were cool and I wish there were a lot more of those scenes/levels. Be wary if you go for a rigger build, there are a couple points in the game where glitches are possible to encounter, you'll have to unequip your drones to progress and it felt kinda sad considering that's the whole point of the build I wanted. The story is also very linear, I think there's only one optional mission you can do that diverges from the main plot.It's a 2d isometric game, so if you're not into that sort of retro style you may not like it. I thought it was gorgeous, and along with story-telling and the slang it was really easy to feel immersed and taken away by the plot. There's no voice acting, only text with pre-written options (of varying personalities) of your character's reply. After a couple hours of playing I didn't want to stop because I wanted to see what would happen next. The story and atmosphere are A+ for me and I plan on buying the new game solely based on that. There's a decently sized mod community as well. I haven't played any yet but I have a few user made campaigns to try out soon that seem worthwhile.			"

Shadowrun Returns is a isometric tactical RPG. In a dystopian future, where dormant elf, orc and troll genes reemerged in the population, where immortal dragons run mega-corporations that control the world, mercenaries run the shadows to do everyone else’s dirty work with the use of guns, magic and technologies. They call themselves Shadowrunners. This review takes into account the free Dragonfall DLC released later after the game.Pros: The first module, called Dead Man’s Switch, is a nice although straightforward introduction to players who aren’t familiar with the game and explores the Seattle setting. The second module, called Dragonfall, offers a lot more character development and additional flexibility and options to complete any given quest, all while exploring the anarchy-governed flux-state of Berlin. The game backgrounds are gorgeous hand-drawn stills, added with the techno-trance music gives the game an eerie atmosphere, each building and object seemingly having a story of its own to tell, while the music adjust to combat scenes before slowing down once you’re back from it. The game progression is straightforward, the skills are broken down into skill trees with a clear view of what you get from raising any attributes or skill. There is no set character class, although you have pre-generated archetypes you can start from. Cons: The story is somewhat linear, most of all in Dead Man’s Switch, where choice will change the dialog but not the outcome of the story. General graphics aren’t on par with the AAA industry, so anyone looking for graphical realism will be sorely disappointed. There is no voice acting, so get ready to read a lot if you want to have any hopes of feeling involved in the story. The two modules which happen at the same time, aren’t related to each other, so there is no progression from one to the other, and are both somewhat quick to play through.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youLet’s judge the game for what it is: a crowdfunded indie game (the success story that put Kickstarter on the map for many people) meant to be used as an engine for the modding community, community that has been very active at creating new stories, new equipment, new world object for other modders, and is using the engine in new and creative ways. As you play, you can feel the richness of the game’s tabletop RPG heritage, and you just wish you could learn more about that world. It is fun, it is well worth the money and time, and it’s definitively a game I recommend!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Oh. My. Goodness. What an amazing game that I've stashed for thus long. I were not a big fan of cyberpunk, but the atmosphere  of the game was well articulated, as I didn't feel uncomfortable. The story is immensive, well-written and intriguing. The combat (as well as navigation around the map) resembles highly XCOM, which is tactic-intensive. Some cons: it would be better if voice is added to the main campaign. The total silent during the conversations breaks immersion a lot. The skill tree looked very intimidating to me as a newcomer to the series. Finally instead of a ""comprehensive guide"", an integrated tutorial would be a huge help (albeit basic navigation/ combat was as simple as point and click, some profession-specific capabilities were not straightforward). Overall it is a great game, and I recommend it to anyone who like RPG with turn-based combat.			"

												Mediocrity is the word that best describes this game. Its art style is really charming, but only in screenshots.The combat is made of a fixed number of battles in the campaign, wich are not hard, not easy, but neither do they require strategic thinking. The tutorial is also really bad, only by the end of the game you'll get to understand what some type of characters do. The story is pretty simple, but the included campaign lasts more than it should. I often thought the game was gonna end after one battle, only to be surprised by villains who always run away and another few pointless quests.I should note that the game also lets you create your own campaigns, a feature I didn't use. It might be interest for someone.			"

												I got this free from a great friend!The original ShadowRun. I really enjoyed this remake of this game. Actually, to be technical this is a remake of a remake. The 1st game was on NES ..there was also a game on the Xbox, but it did not pan out and was not a rpg.Anyways, this is a great example of a rpg done correctly. If i can make a suggestion, this is not the remastered version and they are different...feel free to play this version before that one...but the remastered version might be better..i have yet to play it though.This game has a great storyline and has multiple paths to different endings. Any rpg that has multiple endings is great in my book.One other thing, probably one of the best uses of kickstarter was this game. They promised stuff and they pan it out.Anyways, recommended alot for great rpg mechanics and storyline.			"

												To write a review about this game (orginal dead man switch campaign) is really difficult for me. On the one hand the game is not bad and on the other hand I can't recommend it to someone who expects an RPG. Many aspects of this game are good and are a solid foundation for an RPG but the campaign is way to limited for an recommendation+ The Charactersystem: It allows lots of different builds. Unfortunately they are not balanced and some skills won't be needed too much. + The interface: It was created to also work on touchpads so it can feel a bit ""clunky"". However I did not have any problems navigating the menus.- The save system: The game only saves on the beginning of a map. This can be annoying but it is not the reason why I can't recommend the game to RPG gamers. - The story/campaign: This is the my main problem with the game. It is way too linear. Don't get me wrong the story is good in introducing the world too you but all the time when I played the game I thought: ""Surely after the next mission I will have more freedom to explore the world, have some more banter with companions or get better gear"" In my opinion the story ends to fast, dialogues with the few interesting NPCs is very limited, no decisions which could affect the story... well the important stuff besides a good character system.+ The graphics: I liked the graphics the only bad thing: The resolution-settings: define how far you can zoom into the game. Long story short: The base game itself is good but I can't recommend the game with the ""dead mans switch""-campaign. I hope I can recommend the game after the release of the next (dlc) campaign because as I said the game is not entirely bad it just needs a good official campaign.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a throwback to the days of old, which feels absolutely fresh in this modern era. This takes me back to the golden era of RPG's in the mid-to-late 1990's - which was back when RPG's were often isometric; turn-based; party-based; and used a mixture of both 2D + 3D environments + character models. If this sounds like something that would be up your alley - you likely have already have purchased SrR (Shadowrun Returns) or should buy this game ASAP. Shadowrun Returns is simply nothing short of fantastic.Shadowrun Returns (base-game) comes equipped with ""Dead Man's Switch"" for its base-game's single-player campaign. You play a runner (whose class, if you want to pick one; race, class, skills, etc can be determined by you) whose friend recently died. Actually, he was murdered. Your job is to find who is responsible, why, and decide what to do about the matter. It seems that our friend is linked to a bunch of strange murders that have being happening in this futuristic mix of both a cyberpunk setting (futuristic world where corporations, computers, hacking + whatnot are all par for the course) + fantasy elements (elves + dwarves are here; and magic can all take place in this game-world here). And that's just the start of things - so, that I don't spoil everything.One thing that absolutely sets SrR apart from many other modern-day games - there is just no voice-acting. It's not that this game needs voice-acting, either. This is one of the best written games I've seen in years, feeling like a throwback to the days of Planescape: Torment (late 90's). This game is not just a great game, but it also so happens to be a great book to read. You'll be doing plenty of reading here. The prose, dialogue & characters are absolutely excellent - littered with tons of description + is extremely verbose. If you've been missing games to be littered w/ tons of description when characters actually do things, since graphics do plenty of the talking these days - you're in for a treat here with SrR, since the writing here is excellent.While the graphical quality will certainly not top the technical aspect of the most recent hardware-pushing graphical show - the direction of the graphics are excellent. The artistic direction game is loaded with tons of style + substance - with its excellent 2D + 3D mixture of graphics. This feels like a modern-day revival of games from the Infinity Engine.Combat feels very similar to the classic Fallout 1 + 2. You have a limited number Action Points that you can use spend to do attacks or moves. The combat of this game is quite tactical + turn-based. It always feels great, sounds great, and is a lot of fun to take on. Some of the most interesting + fun battles take place when some of your party members are in the literal game-world, while other party members might be in the computer-world matrix - where you'll be balancing doing combat on two different fronts. Nothing short of awesome.Most of this game's campaign is a linear affair, where you also might have a few side-quests here and there on your way. This is not an open-world game, by any means. Not that it needs to be, either - as the game often stays very focused on its excellent story, game-world, settings, and characters. Here and there, you'll be given a few different ways to solve quests - which can be be done or result differently, all based on your stats, skills & whatnot.Shadowrun Returns is a fantastic throwback to the 1990's era of RPG's, if it was just made with modern graphics + high-resolution support. Gamers that have been wanting a high-quality turn-based RPG where you control an entire party entirely - look no further. If you've wanted superb prose, dialogue, and writing - look no further than SrR. If having this great ""Dead Man's Switch"" campaign (which took me around 16 hours or so to finish) wasn't enough - this game has the Editor come with it. SrR is on the Steam WorkShop and there are a good deal of mods + campaigns made by gamers out there. Being given such a great campaign + an editor here - is there more that old-school RPG gamers can really ask for here? Grade = A.			"

												Rating: 8.5/10What is it?Turn based RPG set in a cyberpunk setting. The Good+ Great story and dialogue options + Great character development, you can choose between a variety of different types to fit any playstyle. Brawler, weapon specialist, hacker, drone control, mage, shaman etc... Different stats determine how good you are in each ability.+ Fun combat. Its turn based so strategy is involved in how you develop your character but also your party members. Combat is also fast paced. + Lots of spells, weapons and armor to further customize your characters + Easy to learn game mechanics. At first I thought the game would be intimidating however a few minutes into the combat and I realized how simple it was+ Great graphics and art style. I really enjoy the cyberpunk setting mixed with all the crazy characters. + Character portraits look really nice+ Very slick UI and HUDThe Bad- Can be frustrating when you character misses on enemies even with a high hit percentage. - Even after you kill all enemies, rather than the game exiting battle mode you have to control each party member to the exit to progress- minor bugs.ConclusionIf you loved the original Fallout games or even Baldurs Gate, you need to play this game. I was surprised how good it was.  "

												I was pretty skeptical of this game, i watched a few videos about it and read a couple of articles about the game, the universe looked pretty interesting, but the gameplay didn't look appealing to me.However, since during the cristmas sale, the game got really cheap , i decided to give it a try, and oh boy. Though i still have mixed feelings about the gameplay, the writing in this game is amazing, i never thought i'd enjoy reading this much in a game before. There is a lot of text, which is actually a good thing. A lot of interesting characters and stories. Would i recommend the game? Sure, but be warned  there is a lot of text, that's pretty much most of the game, and if you don't enjoy reading you are not going to have a good time with this game, though the combat can be pretty fun and chalenging, the writing is pretty much what makes this game great.If I have one complain is how linear it is. Though the level design is pretty good, I'm somewhat disappointed by the lack of exploration. There is a little bit, but the levels are way too linear and it hurts the gameplay. But not by much, since again, the meat of the game is the writing. Also this game looks pretty good. I love the art style of the characters, especially the portraits for the different characters you'll meet, very creative and interesting looking people.			"

												I had some fun with this game but the number of bugs I've encountered spoiled all the fun. The game has a huge potential, but it seems it has been wasted.1) The engine looks nice but it's FLAT. I'm not asking for much, even ""Fallout 2"" nearly 15 years ago had stairs in it. Not to mention original X-Com/UFO series from mid 90's. Also there's absolutely no interaction with it accept for cover options and a few active objects.2) The autosave option is a pain... especially when you have to reload due to a bug.3) Numerous BUGS! ""escaping"" camera (occuring even in ""locked"" mode!), unselectable ""active objects"", weird interface lags.4) Original campaign storyline is linear. Don't expect many side quests or free content exploration becouse there is NO CONTENT, there's only a series of tactical missions.The only hope for this game is fanmade content, but I'm dropping it untill the engine gets fixed (that might be forever).

												Shadowrun returns is a turn-based RPG on which you focus on 1 character (your own). This is a bit disappointing since even though the games features a lot of flavors of combat with different branches:- Summoner- hacker- Guns (Pistol, SMG, Rifles)- melee (Throwing, Melee)- mage (Offensive, supportive). You can only pimp your own character. If you need to go in a mission, you can hire ""Runners"" to help you  do the mission. You can only fill them up with consumables and not be able to temporarily equip them.Despite all of that, Shadowrun returns is a solid game with it's gameplay and a decent 13 hour length game. Plus the fact that the modding tools of this game can allow you to make your own storyline, this is a great purchase overall. WAAAAAAYY better than Invisible Inc which has very short mission line, very weak modding tools (can't make your own story) in exchange of a almost perfect gameplay. "

												XCom meets Baldurs Gate squished into one.Lots of reading, but thats how these games are, but there is a lot of reading.About 1/2 way through I started to notice some of the text grammer and spelling started to show some foreign traits, but nothing that detracted from the game.The campaign was a touch short.  I'm a casual gamer and I finished my first run in about 18 hours, but I enjoyed it!  Yes I will probably be playing through again.  By the time I was getting to the end I was finially remembering how the talent points worked (yes I played the pen and paper ver some way back when), and what skills/abilities I wanted.All in all I would recomend the game.  Especially if you like XCOM or any of the D&D RPG style games.			"

												If you're a fan of the old Shadowrun games on Genesis or SNES, this might be for you. If you enjoyed the Shadowrun FPS/Counter-Strike clone from a few years back, you probably won't like this so much. I give this a mixed thumbs up- the combat and leveling system are fun, but the story/writing and conclusion are pretty balls.			"

												If you are looking for a classic CRPG experience in the style of Baldurs Gate or Icewind Dale, you've come to the wrong place. This is one of the most linear Rpg's of it's kind i've ever played. Like exploring an open world, picking up side missions, and finding gear? Shadow run has none of this. Instead your stuck in an incredibly tiny hub area (usually just a bar, which you can't leave, though sometimes you have access to the city), which you use to hop from one mission to next, as mentioned before only a couple of these which deviate from the main storyline.  There is no loot really, the only item progression you get is buying the slightly better piece of armor/weapon/decker interface from the hub store. The story was holding it's own, and was a fairly interesting murder mystery untill about halfway through when ***SPOILERS*** you suddenly have to fight a bunch of astral bugs from another dimension and save the world... somehow? It gets completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, in other words. The combat is fairly good, but most of the time you're actually not even fighting anything so I can't reccomend the game based on the combat alone. This is not like an old school Black Isle/Bioware game like the trailers and screenshots make it look to be, so if that's what your looking for don't let this game sucker you into buying it like it did me. 4/10			"

												I heard a lot of mixed reviews for this game, and I have to say I was quite pleasantly surprised. It's not a perfect game, but it's a very enjoyable take on the genre, with enough innovation to feel fresh.PROS:- the biggest pro is the writing; the story is excellent noir-ish cyberpunk fare, and the dialogue is very well written- combat (especially late game combat) can be thrilling- the environments are attractive- there are some small and pleasing genre innovations (for example, hiring a party on a mission-to-mission basis, inventory/stash management is well done, the stat/levelling system is very versatile and effective)- the hacking system can lead to some really great combat encounters with fighting happening simultaneously in the real world and the matrix, and consequences of each fight has limited spillover on to the otherCONS:- the game is quite short with very little outside the main story path; I did every side mission and finished in under 9 hours- the combat music is repetitive- not enough weapons,  some balance issues,  some stats/classes basically worthless- the environments felt dead; few people in the environment, even fewer that will talk to you, and zero incentive to explore (not really any scavenging)- some of the lategame setpiece fights are too long and repetitive- the game was too easy overall (played on normal)anyway, I hear Dragonfall is better, so I'll be getting that too, but if this is on sale or something and Dragonfall isn't, it's still worth your money.

Short Review: Keep in mind this relates to the Vanilla game as of Dec/6/2013The combat is great and fun,1 skill tree class is pointless,game is linear,not much consequence of choice quest endings are irrelevant.Character creation is limited,skill tree point allocation brutforces max stats based on race.Graphics and locations are varied and lovely to run through.Mods can be made for the game via the limited tools,but are restricted to custom campaigns.Levels have lack of map rotation which gets in the way very few times if at all.Save system is horrible you have to playthrough section by section in order for the game to save, no manual saving options.Audio effects are good. If you want to play a tactical rpg with a so-so story (seems akin to kings bounty) in terms of a passable but not memoriable story,and can deal with the items I mentioned I say get it when its on sale.If it was not for the apparent flaws in the game,short length,and bad save system, I'd say its worth full price but to me its only worth $10 at most.Either get on sale, or wait til all the dlc comes out and buy as a goty,gold,platinum,complete, w/e they will call it.Otherwise skip it. I give it a  3/5 I do not see myself playing through this game again other than once every few years or something,it just lacks replay value to me.Full Review:This game has probably one of the best tactical rpg A.I. in terms of difficulty I have seen in awhile.The combat system is pretty good and the % chance to hit works just fine. The locations you goto are very vibrant and colorful and fit the setting of the game quite well. The lack of the ability to rotate the map becomes a pain in the ♥♥♥ in a few instances but not anywhere near as much as one would think thanks to careful placement of obsticles. Skill tree wise, there are some aspects I do not like such as the fact a summon has to buy spirits to sommon.To aide with this though one can summon a spirit from a location on the map bt only some locations have them. I played my first playthrough on hard as a summoner with riffle skills and conjuring ability.The Decker class (a cyber hacker ) is completely pointless because most of the missions where it matters to have on you get one for free or get recommended one for cheap that is pretty strong.Its a waste of time to even bother with the decker skill tree and there not many places you can hack which takes away from having a multiple way of doing things.I find this a bad flaw since this game is linear and there is hardly a choice of consequence. All the other skill tree classes are useful. Overall though the skill tree point allocation system some have problems with,but it seems balanced for how the game is so I had no problem with it. Pistols,shotguns,rifles,drones,gernades,elemental spirit summons,med kits,cybernetic implants,etc are your purchase choices.Quests in the game seem mostly geared toward the main story,I found there to be hardly any side quests.There are more optional objectives that you can do while on a main quest than there are side quests. This a let down since the optional quests in the main quest seem like they are naturally apart of the main quest anyway.Character creation is standard though limited.What character you pick decides what your starting stats will be.Now here is where some people might not like.In the skill tree races have a max stat they can reach for skills.For example in many lure Elvan are largely focused toward magic,nature and spirits so they tend to have high max stat allocation ability in areas related to it than other people. This sort of system in my opinion takes away from being able to make your character your own,however seems to convey a standard lure for the different races.Human,Elvan,Dwarf,Troll are your races to choose from.The story for me was very passable.You will need to follow it because of having to pick different dialog tree's so you will need to know some of which was going on,but I found myself skimming through parts of the dialog exchange because it was not engaging enough to keep my interest. There are some interesting points to the main story but overall I feel the story hurts the game the most.I wont say its not an okay story, I just found it very uninteresting. Some of the ingame events that occurred were fun however short lived without much detail for some.Overall The game is playable because of various locations,graphics, and a good tactical  battle system.However being an rpg there character classes hardly have much difference to them and the skill system is lackluster.The lack of consequence of choice and branching story/quest elements touted to be in makes the game suffer for it.The combat system saves it making the game playable considerably but the story is forgettable and I found myself not being engrossed into it. Since steam lacks any other option other than a thumbs up or down I have to give it a down for its weak presentation of rpg gameplay and story.			"

												I enjoyed this and its sequal dragon fall for several reasons.1. portrays shadowruns setting fairly well a dispotic apocalyptic wasteland with trolls and mugic and stuff.2. feels very close in character creation and growth like you are playing tabletop shadowrun !3. memorable characters and a cameo from the old nintendo shadowrun game ! nice.4. a pretty decent amount of options for strategies and you hire your own supporting runners.------------the few cons i found are as follows -------1. first one has kinda poor cyber parts until very late in game.2. healing from mage or shaman is kinda clunky and seriously gibbed by a lot of late game debuffs that give you damage at the start of your turn as healing only heals ""the last wound"" which is also kinda wierd in the players favor if you have 1 point in healing you can heal say a 24 damage crit in one shot if it doesnt have any lingering damage or anything.3.  Riggers seem OP once you get some money under your belt riggers can be up to 3 individual characters (combat) and circumvent things with drones (vents).4. Adept felt on the whole kinda meh. i beat the game and the sequal as an adept first and the second one helps but you still have to activate your abilities wasting 1/3 or 1/2 of your turn just to do the same damage as other people when in the scource game (tabletop) adepts can be passive wrecking machines just as dangerous as any cybersam.5. a few targeting glitches very rare but not being able to shoot at certain enemies at certain times ""just cause"" is a little annoying.6. i would have liked to see more control over your crews loadout and even maybe talent growth especially in the second one as the characters are more integrated into the story as opposed to just coyote in the first one.----------------------------in closing all in all the stories are good for both this and its sequal, the gameplay is solid enough especially for a small dev. They both allow a lot of character options, and advancement strategies. It feels kinda like shadowrun tabletop (a good thing)			"

												I finished the game.This game was developed for tablets and it hinders the game massively, many reviews seem to leave this part out.+ The story is great and very well fleshed out+ The NPCs you will interact with are interesting, unique and fun to read+ The graphical presentation suits the game's style very well, although key items and interactable objects blend in with static scenery+ The pacing is good+- The ending was satisfactory but nothing great- Short game, for an RPG, definitely not worth full price- A watered down XCOM combat system, boring, dull and clunky. Percentages seem to be broken, movement is annoying, cover is scarce and in illogical places. You can't peak around walls or anything like that.- The UI is barebones at best, you wont spend much time in menus, and as far as I could tell, there's no way to customise your character's gear and inventory unless you purchase something first.- There is little to no explanation of key features of the game, the UI, or the combat. I had to trial and error pretty much everything in the game.- No permanent party members, this means no customisation other than your character, no relationships to develop, no party member backstories to uncover. - The game locks you in combat between encounters, making exploration and navigating and absolute chore. Killing any semblence of enjoyment in exploring the detailed environments.  "

												So, really XCom is the leader in this sort of game, but Shadowrun compensates by adding some decent story and RPG elements. I had a good time with it, and apparently the sequel buffs out some of the quirks. There's a few oddities. The inventory management and party system is non-standard, but you're a grown person - you'll figure it out. The art is great, and you want a closer look at it. I only wish the game didn't keep trying to force you to zoom out. A few other weird issues manifest, especially in the early game when you and the game are still getting to know each other. I get the impression of a solid foundation having been laid but then parts of the structure being abruptly canceled and quickly made to achieve a base level of functionality. You can specialize in a weapon but then there's only 3 weapons of that class you can ever buy sort of stuff. Probably a result of the tabletop system being implemented literally without followthrough in the game properA few other areas assume a familiarity with the tabletop system and aren't explained especially well in the game, but they weren't gamebreakers for a 13-hour long RPG. You might make a bad decision and sort of de-optimize your build, but it's not a huge hassle. The game isn't very unforgiving. I played through on hard mode and only failed once in an early mission. For example, cybernetic upgrades aren't really explained very well in the game, and I purchased some cool robo-legs, and then later discovered that I was kind of stuck with them and there would never be any significant upgrades. I get the impression that the tabletop actually has lots more depth that they just sort of ran out of time to implement, and that these shortcomings (Just add more items to the shopping cart) could be easily addressed in fan made levels or whatnot.

												Shadowrun Returns is an top-down isometric RPG game, set in the universe of the Shadowrun pen & paper role-playing game.You take direct control of your central character, followed by the companions you choose or forced to by the game. Combat mode is activated when you encounter aggressive NPCs. Combat options include using cover, summoning creatures to fight for you, healing and boosting your team, spells, melee weapons and gun play. You have direct control of your own team. Interaction with the world and team is highly limited when out of combat unfortunately. When you start a game, you pick your character's gender, race (human, elf, ork, dwarf or troll) and either pick a pre-designed class or build your own. The character creation and progression system is highly flexible, you are given points which you allocate to certain abilities, enhancing them or giving you more options. You earn more of these by progressing through the plot or doing side quests in game. Throughout the game, you can also learn new spells, buy new weapons or invest in implants (at the expense of your ability to cast spells).The default campaign that comes with the game is short, linear, and filled with plenty of good and interesting characters that aren't fully fleshed out. Good plot, but missed opportunity. User generated campaigns are hit and miss, but some surpassing the default campaign.Graphics look beautiful, and really delivers the cyberpunk look and feel. Music and sound effects are good, but with only a limited selection, you end up hearing the same few tracks and sounds often. TL:DR: good for scratching that old-school isometric RPG itch, some good strategic choices to make in the game. The default campaign is fine, but limited, might want to check out the user made stuff, or DLC.			"

												I have a lot of respect to guys who worked on the cool artworks of the game. As a RPG fan, I really wanted to like Shadowrun Returns, but the game kept disappointing me on so many levels and I constantly failed to find RPG features that make me love RPG games.The story is very weak. Just compare the plot with Fallout series, the story of Chosen One, or Planescape Torment, the story of nameless one who wakes up in a mortuary one day and tries to find his forgotten past. Imagine Baldur's Gate's story, Candlekeep attack, Gorion's death, and the hunt for Saverok. Not to mention Kotor. This story doesn't give you any excitement or mystery in the storyline, and I constantly felt like the whole thing was written in a few days after the artwork was designed, although I am sure it is not true.There is no freedom of open world environment. The game dictates where we should go, what we should do to complete a quest. There are no random encounters, locations or rare items. The game doesn't reward you when you succesfully accomplish a mission besides karma points.There are certain areas where you can buy your supplies, have information on your investigations and you can't miss them. There is no puzzle that players can possibly struggle with.We are very limited with NPC options as well. Instead of choosing among several NPCs who have different POVs on matters, we have to choose no-name mercenaries for each battle. Think about Might and Magic series, Baldur's Gate, KOTOR, or Fallout and imagine how NPC choices were changing the gameplay, and how each character had different point of views on your actions. If Shadowrun Returns hadn't described itself as an RPG game, I wouldn't write any of this, but I think this game does not even  deserve to be in the same category with all of the other RPG games. I would even go further and say that even GTA IV, or Diablo is more RPG than Shadowrun Returns because of all the reasons explained above. I think the game tried to accomplish a lot and failed miserably because of this, and I hope they won't make the same mistakes in the future titles.			"

												Unfortunate Shadow run is really not that good of a game.I've sunk a considerable amount of time into the title and tried to like it because of the editor but in the end I cannot recommend it. The main problem is that the battle system is incredibly shallow, it is not balanced and to be honest it feels like there wasn't any attempt to create it like a system. It just seems like they added stuff because they thought ""well this is Shadowrun we need to have that"". Decking for example is largely useless unless you are playing a deck heavy UGC, other than that just bring along a decker on your mission and you're good to go. The guns don't feel much different from one another and spells that arnt bugged just seem bland, with again there appearing to be no thought put into the design and place of each mechanic. I think the main problem with the approach they took was that they were trying to develop it for tablet as well as PC and unfortunately it makes the PC version suffer through a general lack of options and customizability that you find in most PC titles.

												It plays a lot like the new X-Com on a more personal scale, and a lot more choice when it comes to combat. Since it includes a lot of RPG elements and the Shadowrun setting, you can create a character any way you like, from a run-and-gunner to a mage slinging fireballs, to a mage slinging buffs, to a mage with a pet, or something in-between. Some things seem unpolished or foolish, however, like running a melee combatant or a physad; The few times I tried to melee an opponent, even with a physad NPC, I got chopped into hamburger. I'm also unsure why you'd want to stick with pistols when rifles and shotguns are available, no matter how good pistols get later in the game. Maxing out pistol skills seems silly. Similarly, some of the etiquette skills are nearly useless, while some are indispensable. I suppose that's true in life as well, but it's easy to feel annoyed that you've wasted your skill points.But the setting is fantastic, and feels like it was written by people who know the game and want to make it as authentic and immersive as possible.

												Shadowrun Returns is an old-school isometric cRPG in the vein of the classic Fallout games based on, as its title suggests, the Shadowrun franchise; one of the pioneers in the fictional literature best known for combining cyberpunk, magic, urban fantasy and crime elements into this unique lore. Initially started as a pen-and-paper boardgame, it was long “forgotten” by today’s generation or occasionally overshadowed by games such as the widely popular and highly-acclaimed Deus Ex – at least that is how I see it.The gameplay in Shadowrun Returns is similar to many classic cRPGs. You manage a team of up to four Shadowrunners where you can choose from the story’s main characters to use or hire random, more specialised, Shadowrunners which suit your mission’s requirements. Just like in any RPG, you can pick a race and class for your character at the start, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The combat mechanics are turn-based and generally well balanced, resembling the one used in the recently rebooted XCOM franchise by Firaxis Games, thus if you are familiar with it then that is good news because it is solid. In addition, by completing missions or triggering certain events in the story, karma points are earned to be further spent on enhancing your main character’s attributes which include the typical Strength, Intelligence and Charisma, to name a few, seen in most classic RPGs. For instance, investing lots of points into Intelligence allows your character to be highly competent with Decking or Drone Control specialities, or investing a lot into Charisma can unlock specific dialogue conversations to bypass certain key situations in the game (other attributes are used sometimes for exclusive dialogues too). In fact, the game does a good job in making sure the player cannot master all the available attributes, because as the game explains in its tips during loading screens: a jack of all trades is a master of none. As a whole, perhaps one of the key aspects of its gameplay aside from its good turn-based combat is how you can approach the narration by choosing your responses based on what personality you want your character to be like when talking to NPCs. While not all responses follow a choice-and-consequence pattern, some do actually have an impact on how things develope; and Shadowrun Returns provides a wide range of opportunities. Ultimately, this also increases the replayability of the game a great deal. One last addition is The Matrix which is like a cyberworld used by Deckers to hack into systems. It is an interesting concept but feels a bit underdeveloped as it can feel a bit of a chore most of times.The art direction in Shadowrun Returns is at the very least appealing. The backgrounds, which do vary, are nicely drawn and the colour pallets used fit with Shadowrun’s universe and its cyberpunk roots, making it easily one of the best looking traditional isometric games out there.  The neon light effects used are also something to praise it for since they bring the game’s world to life, despite the lack of NPCs roaming the streets. Unfortunately, the character models, including their animations, are about the only things which look visually mediocre in this rather attractive game, almost making it look like it was ported from a mobile game. Moreover, Shadowrun Returns also boasts a brilliant soundtrack with a couple of memorable tracks, such as the one from the main menu (“Return of the Sixth World”) and “Puppet Masters”, which fit with the cyberpunk vibes of the game. Sure, while this soundtrack does sound slightly different to the one from the original Shadowrun game on SNES, it still sounds cool.Without a shadow (no pun intended) of a doubt, Shadowrun Returns’ strongest aspect is its narration with its great character development. Whilst it takes a bit of time at the beginning to get to like (or despise) individuals you meet, eventually you will be surprised by how many who become your companions or allies will quickly turn out as memorable characters by the end with who you can at least sympathise. Starting off as a simple detective story in the style of Jack The Ripper which progressively deepens and deviates from just a simple detective case to solve later on, the “Dead Man’s Switch” story in Shadowrun Returns is mostly solid, even though it sorrowfully turns into a Fahrenheit (Indigo Prophecy) type of story in the last quarter of the journey. While it might not completely ruin the endgame experience, that latter part personally left me with a sour taste in my mouth. Despite featuring no voice acting, this does not ruin the experience either since it allows you to use your own imagination on how characters are supposed to sound like in the story. As a result, it might require a bit more effort and dedication to read some of its pompous written dialogues, and this will certainly not be everyone’s cup of tea.Shadowrun Returns has some glarying imperfections though. Being an extremely linear (pretty much most of it is on rails) and story-driven game, it lacks any sense of exploration due to its contained maps and minimal interactions with their environments. This is something which might frankly turn off quite a number of RPG fans, old-school or contemporary. Clicking on certain hotspots, found only intermittently around places, usually pop up a text-box describing what the character is observing, but these are indeed very few throughout the game’s journey. For a text-heavy game, this aspect of interaction seems like a lost opportunity for further enriching the experience. On top of that, once a mission is completed or the area is cleared, in most cases there is no way to revisit an area afterwards. For a completionist, it is crucial to check everything prior to proceeding to the next area. The lack of a deep character customisation is another aspect that will not please every RPG fan out there since it is very basic and only allows you to choose from premade character models. Additionally, there is also no inventory customisation/management for your companions either which can cause some annoyances when planning your tactics prior or during combat.  One further frustration with the game’s design is its tendency to occasionally lock the player into combat even when everyone in the area is eliminated. This results in wasted time trying to move your team to the next objective location on the map as it is agonisingly slow due to its turn-based mechanics. And lastly, as much as the writing is top-notch, the game can sometimes drown you with its longwinded expositions from time to time which can be underwhelming especially for those looking to jump into action more often.In conclusion, Shadowrun Returns is an adequate and faithful entry to the franchise, albeit a limited game, that should please any cRPG, cyberpunk/fantasy fans and even book readers out there to some degree. While it can honestly feel shallow in places, its stellar writing, good narration, memorable cast of characters, distinctive art direction and competent XCOM-like gameplay should keep most people invested in its relatively short 10+ hours campaign, even if its story loses some of its early charm near the end. This, however, remains a borderline recommendation as many things could have been done to further improve the game as a RPG since it can feel a bit basic. To get most out of it is to always remind yourself that it is a very story-driven experience foremost, so any notions of open-world or high-budget production values in the manner of The Elder Scrolls should be dismissed, otherwise you will be disappointed by your own misconceptions. The best way to describe Shadowrun Returns is like reading a long, but relatively good book (that will not really blow you away) accompanied by solid gameplay elements to justify it as a game -- because honestly, it is not too far from being no more than a visual novel.

												High fantasy, cuberpunk and a film noir style that makes this a great game.It is a turn based role-playing game from a popular tabletop game ""shadowrun"".The game come with one campaign ""Dead Man's Switch"" that got 10 to 12 hours gameplay.But when youre are done playing that one you simple can make or download a other story on the steamworkshop.The only problem i have seen there is that you need ""Shadowrun: Dragonfall"" for some of the downloaded story's.But thats a simple matter of looking for other story's.Combat is rough, sometimes a near dead experions.You need to find cover and try to use youre team togehter to kill the enemy.Sometimes you even need to plan your staps or use a decker ""hacker"" to kill the secerty or turrets.After a battle you feel like you have done someting but if combat ends youre life dont come back so you need to still watch out so you dont die.There is so mutch to tell about this game but all i have to said.Dont wait mutch longer and give it a try.I give this game 8/10 "

												The first time had a chance to play Shadowrun on the console Sega MegaDrive 2, liked it. And just recently stumbled upon Shadowrun Returns to the incentive, of course immediately bought. The game is very like, tightens the story, but there is one drawback - to me it seemed short. In general, I do not regret the purchase, recommend to the passage.			"

												I was a big fan of the genesis version of this game and old fallout series. This game seems to combine both, but it doesn't.The game is very linear, with no options to go back or visit previous places.. All the chat options are meaningless, leaving to the same course. Even the special ones, that you can acquire with 'etiquette' are useless most of the time, useful only a few times to get a bit more money as rewards. Besides, it seems all the etiquettes are used not more than once during the entire game.The gameplay is annoying, with a lot of delay to execute actions. They made a lot of options for classes but you end up not feeling like exploring it. It's like they made a cool framework for a game but forgot to invest in the game itself. Did I already said it's very linear?On the other side, the story is worth paying attention, it could lead to a great 90's investigation movie. I finished the game and don't feel to ever play it again. If you expect even a bit of what I thought it would be, don't buy this game. I'm sorry :(			"

TL;DR at BottomIf you enjoyed this review,consider giving it a thumbs up!8/10Recommended PurchaseBetween the CracksShadowrun Returns is a cRPG that was successfully kickstarted and has made its way to steam. The game is set in a cyberpunk world where risk takers, known as shadowrunners, undertake dangerous jobs for whoever pays the most. The game has no multiplayer but instead focuses on its strong singleplayer story and even has steam workshop support so that people can create their own stories and share them with others. Shadowrun Returns is a reboot of an old franchise on SNES going by the same name. This reboot truly sets a new standard for cRPG's with its phenomenal storytelling and graphics that really immerse you in the world of cyberpunk Seattle. The lesson is this - the game is rigged. The cards are stacked. The dice are loaded. It's the same as it always was.-HarlequinShadowruns combat is turn based and, as is usual in the genre, in order to perform any action you require AP. You start the game with 2 points of AP and about halfway through the main story you upgrade to 3 AP. The combat in Shadowrun is pretty usual and there really isn't much special about it. You play as one of 6 classes but really they only affect how you start off early on in the game. Something pretty cool about Shadowrun is that you can build your character however you want regardless of class and your build will still be viable. There are a handful of main skills you can upgrade, such as charisma and strength, and then under those you have at least four or five sub stats such as melee weapons or rifles. The problem here is, at least in the main story, that there are so many stats to upgrade that you can only get about halfway through the skill tree before the game is over. I did almost every side objective there was and I still only got about 3/4 of the way through some of the trees. The game is incredibly linear too so that there is very little you can do in the way of exploration or side objectives. Sometimes you can pass stat checks so that you can avoid combat or haggle price when selling an item but overall the stats really don't feel like they matter in most cases. In some cases, like upgrading rifles or submachine guns you can unlock new abilities to use in combat on those weapons but overall the upgrades from the skill trees are pretty boring. Some of the classes feel really unique and different but others are just typical RPG classes. The rigger, for example, is a class completely focused on controlling your own robots that can do things like sneak through ducts and ambush enemies. Other classes are just basic mages or soldiers and I feel that, while the unique classes are certainly cool, they're overshadowed by the more basic ones. The most interesting part of the game was when you get to hire mercenaries to go on runs with you. You put together a team of runners who come with you on missions and, for the most part you get to pick who you want to come with you, but in some cases you are forced to take main characters. Generally the gameplay is average for a game like this, but I feel they managed to pull it off in a way that, while getting stale after a while, still is respectable for the genre.""Allow me to share a truth with you, Shadowrunner. The truly powerful do nothing themselves unless they absolutely have to.""-Hans BrackhausNow lets talk story. Shadowrun is quite short for a game in the same genre as Fallout 2 and Wasteland but I feel the story is compelling enough to make up for the poor length. You play as one of the aforementioned shadowrunners and you're in your apartment when you get a recording from your friend, Sam Watts. He tells you that if you are hearing this then he's dead.However, he has set up 100,000 nuyen (The games currency) wired on a dead-mans switch to be transferred to you if you can find his killer. You accept the job, be it for loyalty, money, or a mixture of the two and set out to look for the man that murdered one of the few you called friend. You journey through this gorgeous cyberpunk Seattle and as you do the game starts pulling you in and immersing you into this dog-eat-dog world. The environments are so incredibly detailed that you can't help but to want to know more about them. The game, however, doesn't really give you much backstory on the world and tries to keep you focused on the main storyline. The first half of the story you're looking for the cyberpunk equivalent of Jack the Ripper and for the latter half you have to stop an invasion by a horde of monstrous spirit bugs that cannot die. Every character you meet will make you care about keeping them alive and doing right by them or, at the very least, get you to want to learn more about them. Even though it's incredibly linear the story itself is very unique and fits in perfectly with the settings and characters in Shadowrun.TL;DRShadowrun Returns shows that combat isn't everything and an intriguing story and artwork to match can be just as importantIf you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming "

Shadowrun ReturnsExperienceWhen I was a little boy, I remember a tabletop roleplaying game my friend had. It had so interesting looking manual, I couldnt stop browsing it. It had pictures, formulas, almost nude cyborg chicks, mages, lot of guns and swords. It had orcs, elfs, humans, dwarfs, gnomes, giants and minotaurs. My little mind was blown away. I was so excited, I couldnt stop browsing. Time passed and memories faded. I was a teenager and girls were much more entertaining, than a tabletop roleplaying game. Roleplaying games were nerdy thing to do - girls were the cool thing, and you get to kiss them. You can kiss a rpg manual sure, it just taste like a paper.Not so long ago, I saw Shadowrun Returns in Steam Store. Something clicked. I had this indescribable feeling in my stomach. It felt so strange and familiar at the same time, I didnt know what to do actually. My mind went to some kind of automated state, and my mouse pointer hovered over the BUY - button. 30 minutes later, I was playing the game.UniverseShadowrun Returns is set in an alternate future in which magic returned to the world in 2012. Its cyberpunk themed. High fantasy meets science-fiction. Shadowrunners are the elite criminals for hire. They do your dirty work, for a wealthy payment, ofcourse. Cyberspace, omnipresent computer networks, genetic engineering and cyberware are reality.Gameplay Shadowrun Returns is using isometric view, and you get use cover like in XCOM. Gameplay is fluent and fun. You have many races to choose from, and lot of interesting classes. My first playthrough Im using a rigger. You are basicly an engineer with 2 droids to use and control. Im using shotguns and most of my points are in intelligence, drone control and drone combat. Partysize is four, and you have tons of choices. You hire your party members to every missions. Im usually using me ( as a rigger) , a mage, ranged specialist, and a shaman. Enemies vary alot, and story line is amazing. Its so fun, and entertaining. You can create your own campaigns and upload them to Steam. There are many good custom campaigns to download. This game is gonna entertain you a long time. Length of the original campaign is 15-20 hours, and gameplay is linear.I recommend Shadowrun Returns to all isometric rpg freaks.			"

												SR is a good way to kill about 10 hours or less; though I expected it to be longer.  Because of this, you might want to get it on sale.  The story-driven gameplay has a limited, if not non-existant, replay value... and you can't really stretch it out.  Well, you could make it longer by getting up from your keyboard between turns and spending that time with your family, but no one wants that.  Especially your family.The skill trees don't seem very important to success.  I put every karma point I ever got in dodge and/or shotgun... only.  And, still I blindly walked through the game without any actually difficult combat - which you'd find odd if you compared my random clicking to any real strategy.  I even destroyed the turrets that you're supposed to have to hack, because my dodge was too high for them to hit me (and then the game forces you to hack them to proceed anyway).  Most items are also pretty pointless... you can just buy one really good weapon, a couple of medkits (or just put a healer on your team), and forget the rest.The option of buying all that cyberware is confusing, because there doesn't seem to be a way to repeatedly take missions for money.  I can imagine some people making the game more difficult by blowing all their money on gear and then not being able to hire a proper team.  I only recall seeing one 'bonafide' side-mission, and the way I resolved it seemed to aggrevate the mission-giver at the Seamstress Union to the point where he quit talking to me - which I take it to mean that he wasn't intrinsic to the play mechanics and probably wouldn't have given me more missions even if he'd stayed.  It really seems like the player is stuck to the rails of the story and that there's no real economy in the game.Another thing about the gear:  Some items like the leg options only seemed to be slottable on one side of my body, though there was no apparent indicator that they were either an upgrade (I already hade a cyber leg on that side of the body) or are somehow restricted to one side.  I'm thinking this is a bug, but the game's not long enough, nor are the gear upgrades important enough, for it to matter.Other than not properly supporting my native 2560x1080 resolution (1920x1080 was the max, and that gets stretched when in fullscreen mode), the game works really well under Linux.

												This game was a suprise for me. I did not now about Shadowrun universe before, and i was kind of dumbstruck about the setting. Think DnD with cyberpunk. This alone made me buy this game, and this beauty did not disappoint me. Combat is like the X-COM Enemy Within. Not detailed as much but still, enjoyable. The campaign is interesting (though not as much as dragonfall) and you can download more campaigns through steam workshop. There are many campaigns there and some of them are very, very good. Have I mentioned the setting is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome?This is an awesome game and it deserves it's pricetag.			"

												I really enjoyed the elements brought into the game from the RPG books.  They have done a great job merging the different types of combat, and interaction with the world even though the game sets you to run a specific story I found myself not minding the limited scope.  Normally I go for action-rpg combat, but this game manages to still have good flow with the turn based combat.  Overall I'd say it's a very well put together game especially for the price.			"

												I was looking for something to tie me over until the release of a game I'm waiting for and so I decided to give Shadowrun a try.It is amazing! As I am someone who plays for story and characters, I was absolutely smitten by the writing. It's not so much the plot, but the little things that make this title superb. Dialogue, descriptions, and the mechanics of their delivery. Some people may not enjoy this much text, but I delight in it. At this point I am 8.5 hours into the game, and I cannot get enough. In addition to the writing, combat is also enjoyable. I'm not a power-player so my builds may not be efficient, but I appreciate the game allowing me to develop my character the way I see fit in terms of role-playing, and still have fun fighting. Once I am done with the campaign, I will be sure to check out the authoring tools. At this stage I might just be inspired to try creating a story of my own.			"

												So let's start this review by criticizing the story-module they offer with the game, since its the only story provided with the game and while yes you can acquire others from the Workshop, you'd expect something more solid, At this time I have about 10 hours I believe put into this game and with that I was able to start a first game, went maybe a quarter to a third of the way thru, than decide to restart with a different character and finish it... all in 10 hours, its very short overall, and the logevity of the game depended solely on the players themselves building new stories, which is not a good idea, since players didn't program the game or get paid for it, their work will most likely not be up to par... typically, but in this case, I am not really sure of the quality of the module provided with the game.Look at the Deadman's Switch story, effectively it has alot in common with Robert E. Charette Secrets of Power Shadowrun Novel series, you have a Sam Watts, instead of Sam Verner, heck you see one of Verner's buddies in there too, also with one of your runners named Coyote, somehow a connection to Sam Verner, however indirectly this time. Ultimately like that Novel series you are a man (or woman) on a hunt, in the Secrets of Power it was Sam Verner on the hunt for his sister, in here it was your Shadowrunner on the hunt for Sam Watts murderer, and in the end just like with the novel you end up dealing with some creepy spirits and it became the main issue to deal with at the end of the story. Frankly I am shocked nobody else saw how they merely copied various elements from the Secrets of Power novel series and recreated a cheaper story based on such elements but of far more mediocre result and with a far too cliché ending for the genre. So story wise the single module provided is a enormous let down.Now for the Gameplay, well its not too bad, but felt fairly limited, you have effectively a single Shadowrunner you can buid and equip, those you can hire are pre-made entirely and you can't even modify their gear, shouldn't you be able to buy weapons and stuff and loan it to them or something? It would make sense... rather you are stuck with whatever they want. Also they don't level up along with you, but as the game advance the entire list of potential runners is updated at a few spots in the storyline, also you only have two runners that have any connection to the storyline mostly, those two are involved in it and one of them is only available for a couple of missions, the other is only available after the first is not available anymore, which mean you never truly feel involved with your crew all too much and they are very much expandable assets. Also a problem is the bits of the story in the Matrix, unless you make your char a Decker, or at least update one to be a Decker on the side of anything else you want it, well you are going to have issues, the few spots where you have to deal with the Matrix would have to rely on pre-made chars that you don't have any choices over the build for, which can be a serious issue. They shouldn't have made the Matrix runs a necessity if you only have one custom char and that char might not be a Decker.Another issue is the game sometimes bugs and those bugs can be dire, at one point I wasn't able to do anything anymore during a fight, I couldn't attack or anything, so I had to close the game and load my auto-save, only happened once, yet its still annoying.

												A captivating turn based game, the like of which I've not played since Fallout 1 & 2. The story's amazing (heck, I just played through the game in one sitting, was worth it!), just wish there was voice acting for it as well. Little snag I had was that it sometimes would keep you in combat for too long, meaning it would be a hassle to move your troops from point A to point B once everything in the vicinity is killed off. Other than that, no complaints about the game. Time to play the other installations!			"

												I've heard ""this game is like XCOM."" Scratch that, because it's nothing like XCOM. Sure there are some minor similarities in battle mechanics but that's where the similarities end. This game is good in it's own right. You've got a pretty interesting plot about finding your old friend's killer to make a couple of bucks. From there the story goes down a rabbit hole to uncover the culprit and turns into quite the adventure. This game isn't necessarily about saving the world or some greater good. You're pretty low on cash and a lot of times I compromised my morals to make a couple bucks. Mercenaries don't come cheap in this run down futuristic, magic tech world and we've all gotta eat. That being said although this game is short, for an RPG you'll end up taking a lot of jobs and get to meet a few brothers in arms. There are many characters you'll encounter but aside from the handful you actually get to know a bit most are for fighting purposes.There are numerous skills to customize your character with. When you complete missions or do good deals it rewards you with karma points pretty frequently to upgrade whatever you like. I suggest finding a particular specialty and sticking with it. When I started my I decided I'd be a decker with focus on melee skills. Decker was a good choice as there are a couple of situations later in the game that require that particular skill set. But I soon found that most enemies carry guns and you know what they say about bringing a knife to a gun fight. Charisma was an important skill as you can get more money by charming the pants off of people using your words. This also had a couple of layers to it as you learn new etiquette surprisingly it's the choices I don't expect that pop up in dialogue. Like most strategy RPGs having a diverse range of companions helps in all missions but you'll end up hiring the same people who complement your style. Battles require a bit of strategy as AI isn't stupid. If you cluster all your forces in one spot an enemy will likely bomb your group. That being said you'll have more of the ""kill all foes"" variety of missions. How you do it is up to you. This game is good but I would have liked to see more locations or other town like places you could meet runners in between missions. There are conversations referencing other places in the Matrix but sadly you never get to experience them. There were also a couple of bugs that froze my game during missions. They were random and seemed to fix it self after a restart but saving often helps. Hopefully all these issues are resolved in the Dragonfall sequel but in itself it's an alright game and you should try it if you're into tactical, futuristic RPGs.			"

												Why does this keep happening to me? And by this I'm referring to the fact I can't seem to play a game where I can say, in clear-cut manner ""this is good or this is bad"", but always have to keep a balancing scale in my head and actively weighing positives and negatives against each other. Well, in one more attempt to remain consistent such is the case with Shadowrun Returns so let's get down to it, chummer.First thing first – it's GREAT to see Shadowrun make a proper return to the world of video games following its less than stellar last entry. That does come with a caveat or two because Returns was funded thanks to a Kickstarter project and this fact seeps through almost every aspect of the game, but we'll get around to that in due time. If there is one major Achilles heel worth noting it's the fact the entire game feels like a very light venture into the world of Shadowrun, but also one that makes only a token effort in explaining inner workings and setting itself to the uninitiated. If you don't know much about Shadowrun you'll get a brief 101; only for parts pertinent to what you're dealing with and delivered to you at a snail's pace primarily through loading screen text. This goes beyond matters of fluff and extends to systems themselves  - it's a borderline RPG-lite experience compared to what many have come to expect these days, eschewing things like looting fallen bodies and any great interaction with the world that surrounds you aside from few mechanics-related interactable points. This goes hand-in-hand with very light-weight tutorials which you'll have to actively seek instead of them being naturally introduced to ease you into the game. This may or may not be a relevant sticking point depending on your level of familiarity no only with Shadowrun but also with RPGs in general, though.To keep everything in perspective it is important to note this game was not made on a multi-million dollar budget and that should exempt it from some of the problems, even if things such as sometimes unresponsive functions and somewhat uninspired takes on certain elements like implementation of the Matrix remain annoying throughout the game. Speaking of which, as much as I love to see everything ranging from Adepts to Deckers presented not all Archetypes were created equal as far as unique selling points go and neither were Etiquettes aka your social ""specializations"" which unlock specific options in dialog. Game really could have used more of these options in general, but I guess it functions acceptably well with this overall linear structure of the game taking you from location to location as story demands and not letting you re-visit older ones, local quasi-hub notwithstanding.That was enough nagging about the game, where's the good stuff? Returns is not a bad game and you may have noticed I gave it a thumb up recommending it despite my incessant complaining in paragraphs above. Why? Because it's a still a competent RPG with great flavor and decent character building options. It smartly offsets the fact you only customize the main character by letting you choose who to take with you on missions from a roster of contracts, quality ranging depending on how deep your pockets are. Even though it kinda takes a while to kick in, game's story certainly delivers on everything from standard Shadowrunner fare to more... out there revelations and twists you will probably not see coming, but which still have absolute basis in existing lore.  Relatively short by RPG standards, but succinctly to the point and with no filler to waste your time. Characters? They definitely take a backseat to events unfolding although I have no doubt you'll find favorites among them.Last advice, chummer – never EVER cut a deal with a dragon if you value your sorry existence.

												Shadowrun Returns (SRR) is a story-driven linear RPG with turn-based tactical combat. You play a Shadowrunner (something like a private detective or a hired special agent) who's thrown into the investigation of an ex-colleague's murder only to find himself wrapped in a much greater plot...Review DetailsFor those not familiar: ""Shadowrun is a science fantasy theme set in a near-future fictional universe in which cybernetics,magic and fantasy creatures co-exist. It combines genres of cyberpunk, urban fantasy and crime, with occasional elements of conspiracy fiction, horror and detective fiction."" --Wikipedia. I would add the ""Noir"" keyword in that passage, as well.SRR is best played with a mouse and is entirely built into a third person isometric engine, just like the original Fallout games. The visuals (scenery, character portraits etc) are very well made and capture the atmosphere of the world, resonating in its depth and mystery. The music and SFX are just OK, and note that the game has no voice-over at all. The mechanics of the game are solid but they could use some more balancing and polishing. What annoyed me most is that the game tends to ""lock"" you in turn-based combat mode, even when all enemies are downed, until you reach a specific map location. Also, the stat-system (the so-called ""Karma"" points) is kinda inflated, not all skill-trees are well structured, and many of the items or skills you acquire become obsolete quite fast as you get better ones. The game is not very difficult: It took me 15 hours to complete on Normal difficulty and I only failed and had to reload a couple of times. You can quick-save/load anytime with F5/F9.The plot itself is interesting and keeps you motivated to see what's next. Each time you think you're close to the ending, something more pops up, throwing you into a bigger plot! Role-playing is quite varied and there's usually multiple ways to progress in the story which, however, is fully linear. However, I played the game only once, so I am not sure if the consequences are really that different if you pick other dialogue options... Most of the characters are memorable and well developed but I think that the lack of voice-over kinda limits their profoundness. Finally, I like how the game borrows elements from classic books/games, e.g. Gibson's Neuromancer or the Fallout universe, and how it renders stereotype characters, e.g. the ""corrupt cop"", the ""badass waitress"", the ""taciturn bouncer"" etc. Well written!VerdictIn overall, SRR is a decent game, mostly recommend if you're into that theme (cyberpunk) and/or that game genre (story-rich RPG with tactical combat). There's not something really special about it, but it was surely worth my time! If I were to rate it, I'd put it around 70-80%. They say that the second game, Dragonfall, is much better than SRR, so I got high hopes for that one!			"

												Shadowrun is the iconic cyberpunk RPG franchise from the 80's. RPG fans might also remember GURPS which had a cyberpunk module, and also the Neuromancer novel was a hit at that time. But it was Shadowrun that was succesfully converted into videogames, with two different games on the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo that a lot of RPG fans seem to remember. This game is a homage to these two games, rebooting the electronic franchise in a memorable way.This game style is pretty old school. You wander around places talking to people, searching for clues, learning information and finding items, just like an adventure game. Occasionally you will have to fight, tactical RPG style. You have action points to spend and got to position the characters wisely. Nothing new here, but it just works. All the reading provide immersion and the fights feel quick enough not to bore you.You have a single character, which actually helps role playing. The kind of character you build will influence how you will play the game. There are some decisions that depend on what class you are playing, so it feels great to make a difference when your skills are needed. You control other characters in fights too, you can recruit people and some people stick with you for a bit while the story is being told.This new franchise is compatible with GNU/Linux systems, and it plays very well on my Intel HD3000 onboard graphics. Graphics are simple, but well done. It feels like a classic game, but so much easier to get into in comparison with the older siblings.I recommend this to anyone who is interested in cyberpunk and enjoys some immersion and story telling. RPG fans are going to have fun building a character, the system is interesting and fresh. I recommend reading about character building before playing, unless you enjoy learning the hard way that going full hybrid won't work well.			"

												A fun short game (beat it in 10 hours) but an overall disappointment.  The level up/stats system is laughable -- I played a troll who has high maximum stats thinking I'd have the pleasure of making a strong brute of a hero.  Alas, the campaign is so short you only gain enough experience (or karma in this case) to get slightly passed halfway.  Huge letdown.Also, when hiring mercenaries, you'd think they would be able to hack computers/open locks for you -- they cannot.  It all relies on your character's skill set.Being able to hire said mercenaries also allows you to get a taste for the different classes/races/weapons/tools and removes any sort of replayability.  The storyline is very linear.The in/out of combat system is finicky as well, and I had to reload more than a few times to fix.Not worth $16.  Thank you Humble Bundle.			"

												Cyberpunk, Fantasy, Dystopia, Quality writing, and turn-based isometric gameplay. In other words... it's a cross between Deus Ex and the old Fallout games (1/2). Neat!I heard that this was a game series that existed many years ago, but I had never heard of it before playing this. No matter, since I didn't need any extra backstory to understand what was going on here. And what I saw was quite good. :DTook about 10-12 hours to beat the main storyline, but you can also create your own campaigns. Many have done so, and you can find them on the workshop to add a little more to this game. There's also a DLC that i've yet to play, and i'll put a review of that separately when I do. Anyway, I love Deus Ex and Fallout - two of my favorite franchises of all time. So naturally I have much to like about this game. Good storytelling, good gameplay, and a wide variety of choice and replayability options. Plus mods and more content on the way.Have fun! I did. :3Edit: Played Dragonfall. It's even better than the main game is. If you get Shadowrun Returns and like it, then get Dragonfall too. It is worth it. ^_^			"

												A cyberpunk-themed old-school turn-based RPG? Color me excited!Shadowrun has great graphical asthetics and feel, it plays well and the written dialogue and story is fantastic. The turn-based combat may be the weakest portion of the game, it's rather basic but it isn't bad and does what it needs to do.If you're into this sort of genre then you will be sucked into this world.*Update*The Dragonfall DLC Campaign is HIGHLY recommended! Far better than Dead Man's Switch in terms of story and (imo) characters. Be sure to pick up both!			"

												Man, I really REALLY wanted to like this game...A big part of that is because I think the world of Shadowrun is an awesome setting for a game, I mean I've never played the tabletop game but I've heard loads about it (primarily from watching Counter Monkey) and I think the idea of mixing a Gibson-esque Cyberpunk setting with elements of more traditional western fantasy (Orks, Elves, Dragons, what have you) is a really cool concept. I'm one of those people who could never really get into games/movies/books about western medievil fantasy settings, they just always seemed kinda boring by design, seen one seen 'em all y'know? Skyrim is one of the only games with that sort of Tolkien-esque world that was able to hold my attention, and that was only because the Nordic stuff was able to overshadow it and make for a more interesting world (Snowy peaks > green fields, just sayin'). But Cyberpunk? I ♥♥♥♥ing LOVE cyberpunk!I love the idea of speculating about  a darker future, how technology has changed us for better or for worse, the ethics and practicalities of cybernetics and artificial intelligence, it's just got so much more meat to it. And when you take all that AND THEN add magic and elves and ♥♥♥♥? You've got the potential for some really interesting ideas and stories, and I'd absolutely love to see a game do this setting justice... but this is just not it.First, I'd like to disclaim this by clarifying that I am not entirely versed in the Shadowrun lore, I don't know how true to the books this game is, so I won't judge it one way or another in that respect. I will however say that had I not known anything at all about Shadowrun prior to playing this game I don't think I'd have gotten much from it. Things like the Sixth World and the Great Awakening are referenced but nobody ever explicitly explains what they are or how the dynamics of this world work. Why did magic come back? Where did it go? Where did all the elves, orks, and trolls come from? Who are S.T.A.R.S? What's a Doc-Wagon? None of these things are addressed, and while I understand that this is a game made for and by longtime Shadowrun fans, and as such there's going to be references that only long-time fans will necessarily understand, I get that, but It's not a good sign when I feel like I need to crack a players guide for the tabletop game just to understand what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, and that's how I felt while playing much of this game. Also, the writing in this game, or atleast the base campaign, is very... eh.I Mean it wasn't bad, it all makes sense, there were no glaring plot-holes or laughably bad exposition, but that's just the thing, it's very... okay. It's not what I'd call bad, but save a few stand out-moments it wasn't all that exceptional either. The idea of building a story around your dead friend hiring you to solve his murder from beyond the grave is an interesting idea but I've seen it done before, and far better. Also, while I definitely think that a noir-style crime drama would be the perfect framework to explore the world of Shadowrun, I just don't feel like the story presented lived up to the setting's potential. But again, this only refers to the Dead Man's Switch base campaign, I understand that many fan-made campaigns acted as a far better realizations of the Shadowrun setting, but I don't really think it's fair to include user-made content in a review like this.I think one of the major things that kills this game for me is the fact that it tries to be a throwback to old-school CRPGs, but it's completely linear, and doesn't give you the kind of freedom one would come to expect from a CRPG. There are very few optional missions or objectives to speak of, and while there are multiple ways to complete many of the objectives, much of the time it feels less like a choice, and more like a calculation (I recall one situation where a dialog choice asked me if I wanted to pay this guy 100 creds for what he knows or 50 creds. No speech check, no skills or disciplines involved, flat question of ""would you like to pay more money or less for the same information?""). The Dialogue trees in general just feel pretty cut and dry to me, very ""nice response/jerk response/witty response,"" much of the time, and it just comes off as boring to me. I do however think that going text only instead of recording some half-♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting was definitely the right thing to do, in my mind CRPGs have always been about replicating the experience of reading a good book in the context of an interactive environment, and when a game like this adds unnecessary voice acting it sometimes kills the experience, at least for me, and since quite a bit of the actual written dialogue is pretty damn good despite the plot in which it takes place, I am glad they went this route.The turn-based combat is actually one aspect of this game that I thought was pretty good, I mean it's pretty much XCOM light but that's okay, it functions very well and doesn't feel out of place in the setting or genera. I do feel like melee weapons were made somewhat under-powered, which is disappointing to me as I decided to play a Street Samurai specializing in melee and shotguns. Also, this game seems to have some kind of percentage skewing problem in which you seemed to miss ""70% chance"" shots 80% of the time, but that might have just been my rotten luck. Other then that the combat seems to work just fine for what it is.Another aspect of this game that I found a very mixed bag is the aesthetic, the backgrounds for one thing look fantastic, they're all hand-drawn in the classic CRPG style, and they do the seemingly impossible task of making the aesthetic of a grimy, neon soaked, cyberpunk world look beautiful (all-be-it with a little too much blue-saturation for my tastes). The in-game models on the other hand... not so much. I understand, this game was kick-started, they were on a budget, and as someone who doesn't have a very beefy PC I am rather grateful that they didn't emphasize graphical fidelity and turn the game into a performance hog, but that said, I do think they could have put a little more polish into making the in-game models match the backgrounds a little better, as it stands they just kinda clash and it creates a very odd contrast, it just doesn't look very good.I have other criticisms I'd like to level at this game, the character customization was a little lacking for my tastes (especially the outfit choices), some of the character portraits look better then others, and cyberware is drastically underplayed (which is one of my favorite aspects of the cyberpunk setting, so that's especially disappointing to me), but at this point I'm nearing the level of nit-picking so I think it's about time to wrap this up. I feel like a total jerk right now, because this is a kickstarted game I'm talking about here, it's a miracle this game was even made at all, and as a budding Shadowrun fan myself I am glad that it exists and is introducing the setting to other people. However at the end of the day the mark of a good game is whether or not I feel truly engaged in it, feel self-driven in playing and enjoying it, and look forward to playing it some more as soon as I power it down, and Shdaowrun Returns just didn't do it for me.I have been informed that Dragonfall fixed many of the problems I had with Returns however, so I do intend to give that a go when I can, and I really hope that turns out to be true because Shadowrun deserves a game to truly do it justice, and this just ain't it.

												That's the stuff, chummer.Game has its flaws, it's short, it's linear. Funny thing is, it's not even using the full potential of what content Devs created (for instance etiquettes).I think Harebrained Schemes (wtf name right?) were too much confident into their mod editor and community.Since then, 10s of mods have been released, I didn't play any so far, so cannot discuss quality. Fact is, you can appreciate quality of a mod by a simple glance when it comes to gameplay/system/ui/textures modifications, but it's very hard to tell when mods are oriented into story-telling with a simple synopsis.BUT, despite all its downfalls, let it be clear: writing is top notch!Harebrained Schemes also showed that they are a very capable studio with DragonFall Director's cut (imo best game of 2014) and that they deserve support.Soundratck is neat, and couple of tracks are full gems (Memory, Double Cross, That's the stuff, Dark Alley...)Oui, oui, mon ami!

Read other reviews because I don't even want to think about all the things I really dislike about this game. I was looking for something akin to ""Arcanum"" but got some empty world game with buggy controls and pointless quests. Hacking is pointless. Everything seems pointless in this game because of how incredibly linear it is. I'd try to do my own thing, but that's often how I'd end up with quest items (like donuts) before I even knew the quest existed.			"

												A solid if streamlined RPG. THe biggest plus point for me was the story. It's well written and had enough depth to keep me keen to discover more.  Combat is straight forward enough and after a few fights you should have the basics mastered even if you have never used this type of turned based fighting before. You willl most often engage in combat as part of a group. Unlike tradidtionl RPG's where you meet characters and they tag along for as long as you need them Shadowrun returns takes a different approach. Most of the characters you encounter will not stick around for more than a quest ot two. They all have thier own agenda's and will not follow meekly in line behind you and your cause. To build up a ""party"" you hire companions from a list. This was a slight drawback for me, party characters did not feel like characters. They have zero dialouge and interaction with your character so feel more like pieces of gear rahter than actual people. All in all thou its a really enjoyable experience. a good 7/10 for my money.

			Does this kickstarter funded revival of a classic 16-bit RPG franchise meet expectations? Reviewed by Trent Please like and subscribe for more reviews, gameplay, and discussions!		

 Kickstarter has proven itself to be an exciting tool for gamers disenchanted with the the games being pushed out be major publishers. Last year Kickstarter exploded with projects promising to revive classic gaming franchises and bring new releases that embrace classic gaming conventions. Shadowrun Returns is one of the first major kickstarter releases to come to market and it's success or failure to impress will inevitably shape gamers trust of the kickstarter. Based on a pen and paper RPG, two completely different Shadowrun titles were released for the Super Nintendo and the Sega Genesis. The shadowrun universe is a unique combination of high fantasy races like elves and dwarfs and a cyberpunk world. Shadowrun Returns offers an original campaign, turn based tactical combat and a robust editor that allows players to create their own campaign.Your created character has struggled after a shadowrun gone bad and is contacted by one of your old crew members from that run named Sam Watts. The catch is that Sam has been murdered and his message is pre recorded, in it, he offers you 100,00 nuyen if you are able to bring the person who killed him to justice. As it turns out, Sam has been slain by a notorious serial killer, the Emerald City Ripper. The quest to identify the ripper takes you through drug dens, shadowrunner bars, the National Transportation Safety Board, a mental hospital, a cult's worship center and into mega corp territory. The narrative is very noir inspired with its femme fatals, seedy locations and nihilistic denizens. The script is peppered with slang that is simultaneously ridiculous and enriching. This is especially important since Shadowrun Returns features no voice acting. The regulars of the Seamstress Union, your quest hub for much of the game, are usually up for a little chat and even the merchants are on the loquacious side, sharing their personal stories before hocking their wares. Oddly enough, most of the shadowrunners that accompany your character on missions are mute. There are a handful of optional tasks and even fewer optional missions to pad your coffers. It's ultimately a refreshing experience since your character and the supporting cast are fueled solely by their own personal gains and vendettas instead of high-minded, self aggrandizing world saving exploits.Tackling your missions involves navigating isometric maps, extracting information from the locals and of course engaging in turn based tactical combat. Exploring the sections of Seattle that host your missions isn't often rewarding. On occasion you will run across a grenade or a med kit for taking the trouble to look around before chatting with the next NPC that points your party in direction of the critical path. Fortunately, Shadowrun Returns often makes finding the way to your next objective engaging by asking you to so some puzzle solving, detective work and smooth talking. When the need to fight arises, combat starts immediately without any transition screens and props that litter the environment becomes all important cover. The turn based combat will have you analyzing the positioning of your units, managing action points and deciding which skills and spells to use. There are also elements in the environment to take advantage of, Riggers can send their drones through vents and Deckers can enter the Matrix to hack turrets, security cameras and swipe information to fence for funds. Turns in Shadowrun Returns are not governed by stats; there is simply a player phase and an enemy phase which makes streamlines planning. A large emphasis is on ranged combat since firearms are generally more powerful though melee attacks provide secondary effects like taking away a target's action points in addition to health. A wide range of buffs and debuffs can also swing the conditions on the battlefield in your favor.Where much of the difficulty in Shadowrun comes in is through the use of overwhelming numbers. Often enemy encounters are lopsided and several missions have you face down endless waves of enemies until a given task is complete. Careful planning and making use of the environment makes these missions more than manageable. In fact, on the whole, Shadowrun is a bit on the easy side if you build an offense based class. Instead of gaining levels, completing actions earns your character karma. Karma can be spent on stat increases that progressively become more expensive as they increase. In addition there are base stats that must be leveled to level a subset of stats that are associated with that particular stat. All of the other shadowrunners that your character hires are not customizable in any way. While this fits into the lore of Shadowrun, it can make the game more difficult if you choose to play as a specialized support character.The futuristic Seattle rendered in Shadowrun Returns is quintessential cyberpunk with hand painted interiors and cityscapes. The hand-painted aesthetic is very attractive and distinct and most of your surroundings are packed with details.  Most everything not associated with the Mega corporations are dingy and filthy and bathes in neon light. Unfortunately, some of the miliue can feel lifeless since there are few animated assets present. A few particle effects would have gone a long way toward making the streets of Seattle much less static. Characters are very minimalistic and their animations are modest. Detailed character portraits make up for this and do a commendable job communicating some personality. The music is handled by the composers of the original soundtracks for the Genesis and SNES games and as one would expect it has a large electronic influence. It's a catchy soundtrack that pays homage to it predecessor while properly aiding the tone of Returns.  Shadowrun Returns is one of several games that has to shoulder the heavy burden of gamers expectations from Kickstarter funded games and it has held up it's part of those expectations admirably. Harebrained Schemes has delivered several balancing patches and has offered excellent support for Shadowrun Returns and it's quality is quite exceptional. It's cyberpunk noir narrative is highly enjoyable with it's cast of characters motivated by very personal circumstances rather than the need for glory and heroism. Combat is simple but flexible, offering an appreciable degree of options for taking down foes. It's also a bit easy, linear and has a modest presentation but all of this is easily forgiven since it's price is a third of a tiple A game. Shadowrun Returns is an excellent example of what made classic RPGs special while reminding us how far the genre has come. Now, let's hope that Wasteland 2 and Broken Age also impress.			"

												Lacks any real depth or replay value like I was (realistically) hoping for. If you want a good Shadowrun game with replay value, play the Sega Genesis version, on an emulator of course. The game feels so ""look but don't touch"" with how linear it is and the lack of any real exploration that it should have been. Feels like a browser-based flash game and overall a REAL disappointment for people like myself that know how fascinating and fun the world of Shadowrun could and should be.			"

												Fun but short. Fun but a little simplistic. Fun but a bit too limited. The key word here is ""fun"". There's a lot of criticisms you can hurl at this game, after all. 12 hours to complete the game from start to finish with quite a lot of reloading and a few pauzes included isn't all that much for an RPG. The world is location-based and the story is extremely linear with no choice of where to go. Interaction with the world is very low and even loot is unheard of. In short: people expecting a Baldur's Gate experience were extremely disapointed with this game and I can see why.BUT, despite all the short comings, the core gameplay is very solid. Combat feels right, the skill system feels almost perfect, the characters are fun, the story entertaining and the backdrops are beautifully drawn and crisp. What is in the game, is done really well - the game's main weakness is you constantly wishing it was more ... more interactive, more side quests, more freedom, etc.			"

												Took 17 hours to complete.I loved it!There is a LOT of reading. All dialogue, and this game has a lot of story content, is text based.Good for playing 5 min or 5 hours at a time.The combat is Xcom like, graphics and animations are less of a focus though.The world seems well developed, classes seem balanced enough. It's all turn based, which is great for me. There is nothing that happens that you need to respond to in any fixed amount of time. This means you can get up and get a drink in the middle of combat with no trouble, or during a dialogue sequence. You can save at almost any point as well. This helps when you don't know how long you are going to be able to play for.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a first installment of the Shadowrun Returns trilogy (followed by Dragonfall and concluded by Hong Kong). A kickstarter success, the project led by Jordan Weisman, the creator of the Shadowrun tabletop role-playing game met its funding goal of $400,000 within 28 hours. The game ultimately had gathered $1,895,772. The first installment in the series comes with one story campaign called “the dead man switch” - which takes about 12 hours to complete. The story itself consists of two distinctive parts: first 4 to 5 hours you're tracking down a serial killer, and the rest 7-8 hours you are fighting crazy doomsday cult. The story concludes with you stopping the invasion... of giant spiritual bugs representing ancient evil. Sigh.The combat is weak too- it is extremely slow, repetitive and plain stupid. The only saving grace is that no predetermined class approach guaranties a lot of freedom in character building (same goes for roleplaying as well). Honestly, the story and combat are pretty weak, but that's not the point. The point- SR R is a prologue, first act, exposition if you will, to one of the best game trilogies in recent years. It misses on story and combat, but it menages to create a feel, to add some context and to set a stage to the amazing second act (Dragonfall), and good third act (Hong Kong) So in conclusion- if you have some time to spare- start at the beginning, and play Shadowrun Returns first, before attempting Dragonfall or Hong Kong. If you don't- go for the Dragonfall and Hong Kong, you cant afford to miss them. They are THAT good. P. S. If you re playing Shadowrun Returns first, then lower your expectations and remember 2 simple things: firstly- its an introduction of the setting, and secondly- it gets better with second and third games in the series.P.P.S. While tracking down serial killer, you come across a suspicious and creepy man at the crime scene. He' s mumbling something about how he loves to strangle kittens and that his mother never loved him. ""Leave him"" says the game, we still have 10-12 hours to investigate these strange murders.10 out of 10, would investigate strange murders again.			"

												Even though I absolutely loved Shadowrun Returns, I can't just unconditionally recommend it. This is because you will only be able to properly enjoy this game if you like reading, since this game has a lot of text and no voice acting. But after a short period of getting used to it, it will feel like someone had combined a good book with a fun video game. However, just like a book, this game is very linear. Personally, I didn't really mind that, because I prefer a good, linear story over a crappy one with 30 different endings. It all comes down to personal preference, but if you're like me and don't need constant action to be entertained, this game might be a gem you have yet to discover.			"

												Ah Shadowrun.Being developed by some of the leading heads of the franchise you sure get that feeling when playing the game.Sure some things could have been better - the combat system/abilities/weapons could have been a bit more complex and imo far more of the stuff should have been taken over from the pen&paper system but graphics, sounds, dialogues and story all make up for that and just feel right when the playing the game - plus they provided a nice modding platform to statisfy different needs. :]The Dragonfall expansion is even better.(still yearning for a multiplayer mode here :p )			"

												I reccommend this game, but only with one big asterisk next to it. This game is good... in potential.Dead Man's Switch is fun, but feels kinda short, and that's really all you get at the onset. The real good of this game is the fact that it's a way to both tell your own stories, run campaigns with numbers attached for others, or enjoy those campaigns that people toss up on the workshop or otherwise.The best part, to me, is the full ability customization. Rather than limiting you to the severity of most of the actual tabletops, this game does its own thing, more like the old console games back in the day, rather than duct taping itself to the tabletop rules like most tabletop video game adaptations. You wanna play an 'wared up ork street sammy and pick up a couple spells just for that special occasion? Go nuts. You wanna play a luddite mage and sneak in a few points to make yourself stupidly good with a sniper rifle? Have fun.Honestly, my only major complaint is that the availability of character customization options is incredibly limited. One face per race/gender combo, and your only real options are a selection of like 10 hairstyles and colors shared across all races, genders, and classes. And the troll looks like a spiky idiot at that. Top it off with the fact that armor only comes in one piece deals, and you're gonna be seeing a lot of a very blah character for a good long time.But if you can get around looking like the same jackass with a bad picture for the whole game, then you pick this ♥♥♥♥ up and play the hell out of it.(Note: I havent played Dragonfall yet, so this review doesnt include that. Maybe Dragonfall dispenses pure endorphins, idunno, it costs 15 bucks on its own on top of the game, it had better.)			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a fun return to the venerable Shadowrun universe.  It has a healthy retro flair to it, both using a classic Shadowrun time period and an interface that would not be out of place in RPGs from the turn of the millenia.The included base campaign ""Dead Man’s Switch"" makes for a good entry point for those new to Shadowrun.  The treatment of the Shadowrun setting is excellent and is one of the high-points of the game.  Classic Shadowrun character archetypes are represented, a few familiar faces from previous Shadowrun stories make appearances, and the cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world is generally a joy to explore.  The writing is fittingly hardboiled, if sometimes a bit campy, for the neo-noir plot.  The soundtrack compliments the setting well and there are some very clever musical references to the classic Shadowrun game on the Super Nintendo.Regrettably, ""Dead Man’s Switch"" is a rather linear experience.  The writing style is engaging, yet the plot feels somewhat stock.  Most unfortunate, however, is the lack of balance for all character types; certain builds are less useful than others.  Hackers in particular seem to be short changed, as they rarely have opportunities to use their specialities.  Lastly, the game is a bit on the easier side, great for folks either new to the genre or people who are interested only in following the story, but it does include a scaleable difficulty for those who would rather their time in the shadows to be lived on a razor’s edge.Beyond the included campaign ""Dead Man’s Switch,"" Shadowrun Returns hosts a series of mod tools to allow for player created adventures and content.  As of this writing, there are already some very fun player created missions and campaigns available on the Steam Workshop.Overall, I really enjoyed Shadowrun Returns.  Though it has some shortcomings, I found them to be far outweighed by the games strengths.  It’s a game I can easily recommend, especially for fans of RPGs like Fallout, Neverwinter Nights, or the old Infinity Engine games.

												Ressurrection of 20 years old RPG. Simplistic visuals but very pretty, good gameplay, very deep and profound story. With no voice acting whatsoever still offers deep story, lots of crazy characters and tons hours of good gameplay. If you are RPG fan grab the game you won't regret it. Conclusion 8 out of 10			"

												I love tactical combat games, specially if they are turn-based, so this one (the first I played in the Shadowrun series _ I also got Dragonfall and Boston Lockdown on my library) seemed to be right up my alley. Unfortunately, it's subpar in terms of combat and graphics, and the lack of voice acting and controller support (this is always an unforgivable flaw) doesn't help either. So I was leaning on a non-recommendation for this one, but the character and party customization and, above all, the story redeem it. It's not very long (finished it in 21 hours), but this suits the story, which is not an epic, but more of a noir in a cyberpunk setting. Feels like an intro for a larger story, so I suggest buying it on sale. Hope the next installments are better (reviews for Dragonfall are largely favorable), because there's potential for great games, specially if the devs look up to the combat in the XCOM series, while keeping the focus on narrative instead of resource management.

												If you ever played Pen & Paper Shadowrun, or better yet, the Super Nintendo and/or Sega Genesis Shadowrun games, this game is perfect for you. It's essentially a sequel of sorts to both games, and a revival of Shadowrun in video game RPG form. It feels like you have a GM running a PnP Shadowrun campaign for you from start to finish. Even if you don't know Shadowrun, but like The Matrix, Blade Runner, Johnny Mnemonic or Cyberpunk/Sci-Fi, and older Computer RPGs like Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights or the like, then you'll probably love this game. I know I do! As a Kickstarter backer who paid 3 times what Steam asks for it, I'm more than happy with my purchase! Simply superb! Can't wait for the Berlin DLC, and more User-Generated Content.

Shadowrun Returns: Dead Man's SwitchDrek or not?Shadowrun Returns has been out for awhile. I'm late to the party but figured I would leave a quick review for anyone that shows up after I did. In keeping with the spirit of today's digital world I will make this brief.GameplayShadowrun Returns is a top down, isometric view computer role playing game (CRPG). Story and dialogue are delivered through text (NFPWDLTR). Combat is tactical and turn based, incorporating gunplay, melee, and magic into a system that plays a bit like Xcom, or Wasteland 2. Combat is handled on a grid with an action point (AP) system. You move your character and any other runners (think mercenaries or other temporary party members) into and out of cover, shooting, swiping, using spells and or abilities to defeat your foes. There is more to it than this but for the sake of brevity I will leave the rest up to you to figure out. One key point to reiterate is that this is turn based. Each unit on the field, both friend and foe take a turn. They move/shoot/swing/cast/use an ability then on to the next unit. If you are going to enjoy this game you must be comfortable with this type of gameplay. This is NOT real time with pause (RTWP) like Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale.  This is NOT real time top down like Diablo or Sacred. I like all three types of gameplay but your mileage may vary. If you do not like turn based combat then do not buy the game, you won't enjoy it. If you you aren't the biggest fan of turn based but really enjoy RPG's and are interested in the Shadowrun setting then put the game on the easiest difficulty setting, plow through the encounters, and have fun building your character and playing through the fun, albeit linear story. StoryThis is a short (for an RPG) game. The central storyline involves you, a runner, a dead buddy, a murder mystery intertwined with a larger murder mystery intertwined with a larger mystery mystery. That's about as spoilery as I am going to get. The story is passable but it won't knock your socks off or anything. Progression through the story is quite linear, this can be good or bad depending on your mood. If you just want to play a short and straightforward RPG adventure then you will have a good time. If you are looking for something with a branching storyline featuring heavy choice and consequence (C&C) this won't do it for you.Dialogue and story play in tandem with your choice of character quite well however and the game throws ample skill and stat checks at you in dialogue throughout the game. This will provide you with possibilities for higher paying rewards, avoidance of combat (in some situations), chances to receive additional intel, and alternative solutions to some quests.Character Building SystemThe best part of the game in my opinion. I am biased on this as I really enjoy the Shadowrun universe. The blend of high tech and fantasy with cybernetics, hacking the matrix, and wielding magic, all co-existing in the same world is a strong draw for me.The skill based character system is very well done and you can make some really unique builds if you so desire. Once you get a feel for how the stats and abilities work my number one suggestion is to create a fully custom character. The templates provided throw points into stats where you won't need them. Create an idea for your character and try and specialize in two key areas while maintaining a sense of durability that shares a direct relationship with the difficulty you choose you tackle. The only negative in this regard, and it is significant, is the way the hired Shadowrunners have been built. It's almost like the developers either don't understand their own mechanics (unlikely) or just wanted to build a bunch of gimps for you adventure with. If I were to alter this module in any way the first thing I would do is rebuild the stat and ability allocations for all the hired mercs. ConclusionNot drek ...Introductory I think is the best descriptor here. The Dead Man's Switch (the primary story module for Shadowrun Returns) serves as an introduction. An introduction to the gameplay systems, the dialogue system, the storytelling style, and the editor for the game. It feels like an introduction for both the players and the developers and while it leaves plenty of room for improvement I still had a great time.I played from start to finish over the course of one long weekend. Steam says I clocked 15.9 hours.  I played a Human Decker/SMG/Toughguy. My ending stats were something like: (Body -7-, Quickness -7-, Ranged -7-, SMG -3-, Dodge-6-, Intelligence -7-, Decking -7-, Charisma -2-) My main character was always the most deadly in a fight and I could hack the matrix like an awesome nerd. I can definitely see myself playing this again just to run through the story with another build. I already have several character ideas.Recommended for:CRPG enthusiasts that enjoy isometric games with turn based combat and can look past the linear story. Think of it as the introductory module for a larger role playing experience in the Shadowrun universe as imagined by Harebrained Schemes.Not recommended for:Gamers not interested in having all of the story and dialogue in a game deliverd via text. Gamers looking for heavy C&C in the storyline and or branching storylines based on player agency. Gamers who do not enjoy RPG's. Provisional mega bonuses:The game comes with an editor. Make your own Shadowruns!The game runs great on older machines. As of this review I don't even have a video card in my rig and the game ran fine using only my Intel integrated graphics chipset.			"

												the good: excellent graphics and sets the shadowrun world ambiance well enough. Am biased tho, as I had played the rpg a handful of times, and enjoyed the setting. plus the rpg system was good. wish the game used those rules a bit more.the bad: gameplay wise: skills are boring, and redundant. eg. pistol, submachinegun and arguably shotgun are all inferior weapons to the assault rifle....so no reason to put points in anything but assault rifle. even the special abilities you unlock for the various skill paths are all so ineffective or simply, meh. Magic builds end up doing simply reskinned things that gun builds do. i.e. magic is nothing unique (apart from one or two utility spells). Same goes for drone rigging or even decking into the matrix. its all exactly the same as if you just created a gun build.the devs need to redo the skills trees and don't make shooting the same as spells the same as decking the same a rigging. its all too much the exact same experience.the deadman's switch story: its a decent story. i enjoyed it, the dialogue (even though it did not matter what you selected) and the npcs.conclusion: recommend to buy when on sale			"

												I played Shadowrun in the early 90's.  I played the pen and paper RPG religously.  I read the books, and to this day, the 2XS/House of the Sun series by Nigel Findley are two of my all time favorite books, period.  The SNES game was intrepid, a game that I still go to every now and then because it was so much fun even when you could speedrun the thing in less than 20 minutes.So I'll base my review of this game on why I bought it:  I bought it because it is Shadowrun.  In my opinion Shadowrun has only successfully been represented once in a video game, and that is the SNES iteration.  Why?  Because it has everything a good table of friends had when they pried open their books and began tallying up the details of their runs.  Your character, a (basically) faceless dude who is slumming after a hard-knocks life of violence and heartbreak, suddenly becomes the target of a major corporate plan that by the grace of whatever god might exist, he lives when he isn't supposed to live.  The 16 bit game has everything you'd expect, barring the limitations of a directional-pad and 8 buttons:  A ""matrix"" to hack, complete with I.C.E. to fight, optional data logs, and upgrades to the way you interface with computers scattered throughout the world.  Magic to weild, nifty guns to play with, ""random"" enemy encounters and a handful of bosses.  Environments ranging from the urban sprawl to sewers to looming corporate towers.  The 16-bit SNES Shadowrun satiated the pen and paper fan's thirst for real world recognition of a game that too often was overlooked in the shadows of Cyberpunk and D&D.  As a kid, I didn't know anyone who played Shadowrun who ever dabbled in other dice rolling games.  That's what set it apart, at least for me and my friends.  We didn't have to squeeze into the typical stereotype of pen and paper gaming.  We could walk into the hobby shops and have virtually anything at our disposal, and nobody could ""talk shop"" with us because all the conventions considered ""normal"" in other games just didn't apply to Shadowrun.  Games could last for weeks, and to me, Shadowrun was Risk while D&D looked like Candyland.  There was no comparison.  The lore, the possibilities in character development, there is not one single thing I can look back without remembering fondly, except for the fact that FASA handled this gem so poorly that it eventually killed it.  I am going to give this game a 9.5 out of 10.  I have not enjoyed it.  None of the charm I associate with Shadowrun exists in this game.  I am rating it high simply because another Shadowrun product was created and released, keeping the brand alive and fresh.  I'm rating it high because it has done so well, assumingly amongst people who are used to playing games that follow the same vein.  I'm rating it high because I love Shadowrun, but no, I don't like this game.  I'm sorry.Maybe it isn't for me, but I hope that the critical acclaim it's recieved will lead to more Shadowrun products, and yes, I will buy them all, and hope that one of them suits my individual tastes.  I don't have time anymore, nor do I have the same friends who would dedicated 8 hours of their evenings to sitting around a table arguing about that homeless guy we didn't heal who turned out to be a decker that could have helped us stall a squad of drones while we got shot up trying to escape an Orc brothel.  This game here, will sit on my massive backlog and maybe at some point I'll give it a shot, if not only to see Jake's face one more time.  Buy this game, support the love and heart that went into making it.  If you aren't me, you'll probably love it enough to play more than a couple hours. "

 TL:DR Shadowrun Returns is the name of a classic-style RPG, but it's really just a venue for telling stories in its long-dormant fantasy universe. What you're really getting when you buy it is a short but well-written tale of murder and conspiracy called The Dead Man's Switch, access to community-created content  and just enough of an isometric roleplaying game and turn-based tactical combat to get by. Pros: Great settingWell-told story Cons: Few real choicesDisposable mercs			"

												Lovely art assets, decent writing effort. Story was unfortunately rather railroady and linear. Gameplay is a little sluggish but fairly diverse - unfortunately there's not a lot of reason to diversify beyond making sure to bring a decker on most runs, if you aren't one yourself. most magic, combat drones, summoned spirits, melee combat, all sorts of cool stuff, are about as effective as a gang of goons with guns. which is i guess a balancing effort to try to prevent some class/party composition from being singularly the best. the campaign may have a little replayability with different main character setups. the writers and level designers put in a decent amount of effort to make some of the charisma skills useful in a couple of instances, and there were a few times i cursed having chosen not to be a decker myself for the number of doors, safes, and datavaults that remained closed to me. and of course the possibility of simple bribes comes up on occasion, too. nothing had me more frustrated than going in on a stealth mission too broke to even bribe a humble janitor for info.the campaign is obviously written as a sort of intro to the setting and tutorial of functions, and blatantly hand-holds you a couple of times.matrix combat and hacking is unfortunately stale and boring compared to the irl combat in this game. this is partially a weakness in the shadowrun setting itself, i guess. i cant imagine how boring it must be for a roleplaying group sat around the table to wait for their party's hacker to do a mini-computer-dungeon on his own to enable the adventure to continue. thankfully the campaign levels are typically set up so that your other characters have goons to fight while the decker hacks.the mystery had me genuinely mystified and interested at first, but it kind of got solved in the middle leaving the end of the game to be a cleanup effort. there is a campaign editor/level maker function included which is cool, but not much has been made with it yet, and the interface is daunting to me myself.so yeah consider giving this thing a shot if you like shadowrun stuff.

												Shadowrun returns is the first step in a series that just keeps on getting better and it is already pretty good.The unique setting paves the way for a plot that isnt chewed out and interesting to follow. It all feels very cyberpunky and having played the actual pen and paper I am fully satisfied with the translation of systems to a videogame. The characters in game are all unique but dont get explored a whole lot. Unlike later parts you dont really have a crew of people to run with that you get to know better throughout time, just some reccuring allies.Gameplaywise you spend the largest part of the game with turn based combat akin to the XCOM series. Another thing they have in common is a hyperunrealistic amount of 90% hit chance misses. If I hadnt done it all on normal difficulty that would have probably led to quite a few frustrated reloads. You have a very decently large amount of fighting styles to choose from, unlike in later parts you cant put a low priority on fighting and talk your way through things though.The soundtrack is the best in the series so far, though probably not worth buying a 10 dollar DLC for. Give it a listen on its own on youtube or something though, it is pretty cool.The graphics are far from top notch but you never zoom in closer than birds eye view so they still get the job done.All in all if you like the pen and paper or like cyberpunk with fantasy or simply a turn based combat game with decent story I would reccomend it even at full price. Dont expect to get more than 16 hours at the most out of it without modding though.			"

												My first experience with Shadowrun was the old genesis title. After that some friends got into shadowrun and G.U.R.P.S... along with alot of other table top games. Played a bit, had some fun... was fun while it lasted.Then I kept seeing news about 'new games in the shadowrun universe!' popping up, but never saw anything concrete. Then this game came along and I scoffed.Turn based rpg's... so oldschool. Nevermind the fact that we all loved those games... I assumed it wouldn't be any fun. It has the same general style of oldschool games (If you never played oldschool tactical RPGs... think somewhat like XCom).The different weapon styles allow for some interesting fighting, although honestly the later games are much better at this. Magic isn't overpowered or underpowered... and can be quite interesting in some situations. I had alot of fun playing a decker (hacking isn't half bad, but is much better in the followup games), and the story is interesting as well. Lets you feel just how hopeless life is in this universe.Buy it if you want a good read, and love noir films or style of story.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a solid RPG that was a lot more fun than I thought it would be. I don't know much about the setting but I think the game did a good enough job explaining things. The writing isn't anything to really write home about but it was good enough to keep me interested and the game has its fair share of likable characters. The combat is also surprisingly fun. I usually dislike WRPG combat but SR's combat was the right kind of difficulty on Normal and it never really threw bullcr*p at you. The game isn't without its problems though, Deckers are absolutely useless aside from certain plot-dictated battles so you should never play as one or have one in your team unless the game tells you otherwise. I was rolling a Physical Adept and I definitely recommend them, they're great. From what 've read, the game didn't allow you to save in battles which I could definitely see being very frustrating but they fixed it so it’s no longer an issue.Overall SR is well worth the price and I'm really looking forward to playing Dragonfall because I hear it’s even better than the vanilla campaign.

												Shadowrun Returns is a decent game.  Even though there's a graphical interface and pretty pictures, it's an old-school, turn-based, text driven game.  There's a lot of reading to do, but that's not a negative.  Instead, the writing is very nicely done and your brain fills in the details we normally get with fancier graphics and super-duper cutscenes and voice acting.  It's really nice. There are several areas where the game falls down a bit:- Pacing:  about halfway through the story you start wondering if this is the last scene or not.  The story implies an ending, but doesn't get to it for a while.- Dialog choices:  adding more Charisma is supposed to open more dialog choices.  But, as far as I can see, there were only four or five places where those additional dialog choices existed.  Plus, I believe that there was only one type of extra dialog choice that was used more than once in the game.- Inability to progress:  because the story goes from one area to the next with no ability to go back or do other things, you can get to a point where you're stuck.  Maybe you need more money to hire a team or buy stuff.  If you don't have it, you're SOL -- there's no way to go off to earn it and come back.- Mission ambiguity:  when you're given a mission, you're told to buy a team to help you.  Yet, you don't know enough about the mission to know if it's purley physical or will involve decking.  So, you really don't know who to put on the team.  This is made a bit worse by the design choice of not assembling a permanent team that you develop and train.  With a permanant team, you could produce multi-talented people to cover all the gaps.- No sharing:  you can't move items from one character to another.  This is especially troublesome with things like med kits and resuscitation kits.  I ran into many cases where the character carrying those resuscitation  kits died and I could neither transfer one out to another character before-hand or walk over to the corpse and take one out of his pack afterwards.- Development tree:  some of the character developement tree doesn't seem to be of much use.  For instance, I played a Decker.  Theoretically, I should have focused on the Intelligence/Decking aspects of the tree.  Yet, Decking only happens in a few spots in the game.  Since the character you're playing is the single point of failure for the whole game (i.e., if he dies, the game is over -- whereas if a team mate dies, you can resuscitate him or carry on without), you're better off focusing on pure physicality and survivability and hiring the specialists as needed  (assuming you knew when they'd be needed).Of course, I've got to temper that by saying that all of that stuff is based on the sole developer-provided scenario.  There's another one in the Dragonfall DLC available here and there are oodles available for free in the Workshop.  So, with the proper writing, those issues could go away.  So, the game, especially considering it's a framework for other stories, is decent.			"

For a text review, a modified script is provided below.Shadowrun Returns is a turn based isometric strategy game based in the cyberpunk world of Shadowrun. Accompanied by dialogue and progression mechanics similar to those found in RPGs, this indie title is a very unique start to a series that seems like it can only get better with more support.Shadowrun features a linear campaign with a highly engaging story that starts out simple and maybe just gets a little ridiculous by the end. But in a world of decking into the matrix, metahuman troll shamans summoning spirits made out of corpses, and drugs basically being entirely replaced by virtual experience chips that are eerily similar to video games? Maybe it's hard to judge when something actually becomes strange. There's plenty of dialogue to read, choices to make, and paths to explore that all come with rewards of additional money, karma, or maybe even just the opposite. The campaign lacks freedom of movement though due to its linear nature, but that's not really a con with this game. It works perfectly fine the way it is, it's just a shame the game is only about 10 hours long. Never fear if you want more content however, the game is fully equipped with modding support and plenty user-made missions and campaigns exist to lengthen your playtime. Some of them even allow you to import your character from the main campaign and continue to make him the epitome of badassedry.Shadowrun's gameplay is similar to other games such as Avernum and XCOM, but seems to borrow far more from XCOM in terms of the fact that you can still miss a lot with a 99% chance to hit your target. Honestly though, it's a lot of fun. The strategy elements will appeal to any fans of the turn based genre and the RPG elements of how the story progresses and how you equip and upgrade your character bring it an appeal to a whole 'nother market entirely. You see the game gives you Karma instead of levels or experience, and they are essentially skill points that you earn by completing objectives, and more of by sacrificing monetary rewards to do the 'right' thing. These skill points plus purchasing gear are entirely how you shape the efficiency of your character. My only complaint with how the gameplay actually works is  the movement. When you're out of turn based movement it is very obvious that the characters are still running around in turn mode since there is a constant pause like it's processing the start of a new turn every couple of seconds of running. And when you are moving, you are incapable of quick saving your game til at least one full second after you finish moving. This makes life for save-a-holics like myself a little inconvenient, but it makes it even more evident that they didn't bother making an actual real-time freeroam mode and just reskinned the turn-based movement. It's a shame, but it's no reason to be turned away from the game.A reason to to turned a way from Shadowrun would be that it suffers from a lot of bugs. In fact, if you have a bug and google it to get help, not only will you find plenty of persons with the same bug in the same place, but you'll find others who have a completely different bug in the same place as well! The steam version is notably the buggiest version of the game. It features extra bugs in any potential area and even features a game-breaking save-wiping bug that makes it so that if you want this game, I'd recommend NEVER buying it on steam. The GoG version being the least buggy that I've found and lacks any game-breaking bugs that I've found in 23 hours of playing it. If you're going to get this game, get it on GoG.The graphics of this game are understandably bad for today. The game was released almost four years ago and was a difficult project that even had to be kickstarted to get off the ground, and thankfully they put most of their effort into gameplay and story rather than making it a beauty to look at. The nitty gritty feeling of the graphics however really helps to immerse you into the scary world that is Shadowrun. So long as you can ignore occasional glitches such as shooting an SMG and seeing the bullets come from the opposite corner of the map and flying off to who knows where instead of coming out of the gun like they're supposed to, the graphics really shouldn't be a con.The soundtrack is something I'd like to describe as cyberpunk to the extreme. It definitely fits the setting and the sound effects are fine, but no standing ovation. The game however does lack any voice acting whatsoever which is good to note, because if you do not want to do a LOT of reading, then this game is not for you.Overall, Shadowrun Returns is a charming indie title so unique in every way I really don't think you should miss it. It gets an 8/10 from me. It was reaching for 9/10, but all the problems with bugs and certain flaws stomped it down a bit, making it just barely retain an 8/10. Is it worth the full price of $15? Only yes if you plan on downloading and playing a bunch of user-created storylines. The base game is too short to justify $15 however, being barely longer than the bare-bones campaigns findable in many AAA first person shooters these days. I definitely recommend buying this if you like strategy or experiencing new and unique settings, but buy it on sale unless you definitely plan on playing every single mod you can. Just do NOT buy it on steam unless you're ok with potentially dealing with having your save games wiped or a plethora of other steam-exclusive bugs that have been reported.			"

												A basic introspective to the Cyberpunk universe.  Gameplay is similar to X-Com.  Adopts many elements from William Gibson's ""Neuromancer"".  This novel was what established the cyberpunk genre in the first place.  Armitage is a name adopted straight from the book.  Enjoyable game if you enjoy reading alot.

												The game is solid, easy to learn, turn-based tactical combat. Art (you can see), music is very well composed and abient, and the motif captures Shadowrun nicely for anyone who grew up on Cyberpunk in the 80's and 90's.The writing though makes me want to grab your lapels and shout ""BUY THIS GAME"". I don't read with much enthusiasm, but EVERY BIT OF DIALOGUE was well written and the characters really come alive. I found myself going through every bit of dialogue with everyone I could find JUST TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEM. In the end, I cared for every NPC I didn't find antagonistic and have purchased the next two games without playing them yet, just from the trust Harebrained Schemes gave me with this title.			"

												The good: The setting is great, the story/characters are interesting, and there is a lot of flexibility in playstyle (being a mage feels different from being a decker, which feels different from just shooting up everything with an assault rifle). It's also a reasonably pretty game. The graphics are a little cartoony, but with enough detail to let you enjoy the dystopian cyberpunk future theme. The bad: It's extremely simple/easy, painfully linear, there's no voice acting, and while conversations give you the impression that your choices matter, the game appears largely devoid of meaningful consequences. I'd call it a ""video graphic novel,"" except the writing isn't even all that good, and (despite some more positive reviews) there's not even that much writing to begin with. It's also short. Really short.Bottom line: This is a simple game that would feel rewarding if it were a free mobile game instead of pretending to be a full-fledged PC RPG. If you can get it on sale for a couple of bucks, it might be worth it as a gateway to the superior Shadowrun games that follow, but as is, this is not a $15 game.The ""crime/detective"" themes try to make it feel like an old point and click adventure game, except your options are so limited that it feels like a ""mystery"" designed for a 5 year old to solve. Despite the emphasis on ""tactical combat,"" fights tend towards the easy. Resource management is a joke because you should always have plenty of money to buy equipment and a full high-level team, so there's no additional ""should I get better armor or a new gun"" type of trade-off. The result is boredom. The game spends too much time in the turn-based combat mode (even between discrete combat encounters), so simply walking from one fight to the next has to be done individual party member at a time.

												Although the game engine and the dynamics leave a lot to be desired the atmosphere and storytelling makes this an instant classic. I couldn't stop building new characters, trying new classes, new ways to beat the game. The level editor and the huge amount of UGC guarantees that you can't get tired of the game or if you ever do you can make your own story. It's a must have for everyone who is familiar with the Shadowrun universe and everyone who likes well thought, atmospheric turn-based RPGs.			"

												I really enjoyed playing the game, although it felt like there's a lot of systems that you can simply skip - for example, I found no use in putting points into Decking or getting most Cyberware, given the rare opportunities to actually use them, it's better to just use a hired gun. The complete lack of voice acting or animated cinematics even during critical portions of the story, such as, uh, the ending, lend to a bit of a low-budget feel. I also wish the game had gamepad support, or at least an option for larger text so I could have played it on my TV like the original back in the day; this is a complaint I could level at the majority of games on Steam, mind you. The game is really quite linear and though my time tracker shows over 25 hours played, much of that was spent on pause or idle, and the game feels kinda short overall. However, what's there is really good. I had lots of fun, and would recommend it to anyone who likes this sort of game, especially at a sale price. I'm looking forward to playing Dragonfall, as I've heard it's an improvement, though I don't expect voice acting there either.			"

												Shadowrun is an awesome universe to explore and play inside of. This game is somewhat simplistic in execution and depth, but that does not mean it is not worth playing. I've found it to be a great diversion to jump into on my laptop. Playing this game makes me want an even more comprehensive and immersive RPG along the lines of recent Fallout games set in the world of Shadowrun.			"

												After 11 hours I finished the game and it was a good ride. There are good things about the game and then there are things that could be (way) better. Let's start with the good things first:It certainly feels like a Shadowrun game. I've played the pen & paper RPG in the 90s and during the first minutes, the game gets the atmosphere right. It feels like the Seattle of 2050 that I had in my head (or at least very close to it). The artwork is well made and the soundtrack works nicely to support the setting.You can choose how to play your character. While the decking part is a bit underwhelming, the choice between weapons or magic is there and quite well balanced. There's a good amount of freedom how to build your character and while it doesn't have a big influence on the outcome of the game, it still gives the game some depth.Depth... that's the real problem with the game. The story is well written and while it does have a quite large number of twists, in the end it works well. The game is too linear though. There is exactly one optional 'Mr Johnson' run and that's simply not enough in a Shadowrun game. The game feels too much 'on rails' and while you can grab a few optional items for additional creds, there's almost no content you can miss out on. That in turn means there's almost no replay value except if you want to check out magic instead of weapons (or vice versa).I still recommend the game, because it does give you a good amount of content and especially if you like Cyberpunk. 15 € is too much for it though, so grab it in a sale (they are frequent enough). I'm looking forward to play Dragonfall and see if they added a bit more flesh ;)			"

												This game is good stuff. Why? Well, it isn't for everyone obviously, but the game is filled with enough variety and content (as well as has great people always making more stuff for it.) that it feels very very good. Also, depending on your class also means you get to choose how you want to approach things. Are you there to just kick down doors and give everyone a healthy bullet diet? You can! Want to have a lot of bots, enemy turrets, and other such things do that for you? You can!Also, delving deeper into things can lead you to decisions that you might have initially considered. Devil is in the details and all that. Overall, I would recommend this game, and its extra DLC stuff, cause it is done that well. Have fun, and happy running.			"

												Please buy this game.Games like this are not released often enough, which is why I backed this on kickstarter a year ago.At the same time, it feels new-- glossier and more intuitive than I expected. Accessible, even.The writing is wry and pleasantly true-to-form for the canon/world of Shadowrun. NPCs are well-characterized without too much exposition, much like in a good tabletop game.Combat feels right, and very familiar to tabletop runners/fans of the SNES game. Multiple approaches to almost every situatoin, delightfully turn-based yet explosive/well-scripted enough to appeal to a newer set.Lastly, I want more games like this to come out. Need, even. Let's spend money on clever, exciting things(especially kickstarted things that were delivered on time and on budget). Vote with your dollars to tell indies and megapublishers both that this is the kind of game you'll buy.Please.			"

												Very nice game. I didn't expect it to be that good. Pluses:+ Visual style! + Interesting story. You investigate the murder of your friend. Of course, everything is not what it looks like.+ Character skills. There are lots of them. You have to be careful with what you choose as you can't revert it.+ Combat. I like turn-based combat system. Here it is a lot of fun. You have to think your strategy through very thoroughly.+ Great music!+ Memorable characters!There are a few minuses as well:- game is pretty linear which is bad for RPG. There are a few places where you can use your charisma skill and pass through without fighting, but that isn't enough. - No point in replaying the game.- It isn't really a minus for me, but the characters aren't voiced. So you have to read everything: dialogues, thoughts of your character. Some prefer to listen to all of that, so it is sort of a minus.All in all, I don't regret playing it. 8 out of 10!			"

												As a point and click isometric / RPG tactics game veteran, I must say this game is fairly lame.TL;DR... It's Fallout / Fallout II light for the casuals... it's linear, it's mind numbingly boring and just not fun.For those of you that want a more in depth look as to why this is a polished turd, read on...It takes a whole lot of reading and engrossing yourself in this universe to really enjoy it. The entire game is played with a single button... yes, the left mouse button... so talk about a snooze fest. I found myself  controlling the camera movement with the W, A, S ,D, keys just to  break the monotony of only using the mouse to play.The game proceeds like this: You go through a metric ♥♥♥♥ tonne of dialog, learn some things, more plot holes are formed and you proceed clicking around walking (ever so slowly) around some linear rundown areas of a city. You talk to some more NPC's and choose some more inconsequential dialog options... Then you proceed to get in to a ""tactical"" fight... there's usually only one of these per chapter.I was interested in the game because it looked like a fun tactical RPG game and had stat / profession / skill selections like the original Fallout games but that's about where the similarities die... The dialog to combat ratio is just abysmal. Fallout found that perfect balance of never giving you too much unnecessary dialog / information... It was always just the right amount and then it was off to go shoot some people, even still, Fallout has much richer dialog, you almost crave more of it sometimes. Shadow Run is just the polar opposite... 90% of every chapter is all dialog with a single battle / boss encounter that lasts about 5 minutes, tops.The cyberpunk thing doesn't really do it for me either, a lot of the classes are rather convoluted and redundant... Highly unnecessary and only viable for small portions of the game to perhapes skip a few needless fights that end about as quickly as they start. The best all around class is the Street Samurai... so like you're a street thug with honor... kay... talk about a contradiction. :/I was never in to the Shadow Run lore so that might be why I'm not enjoying this as much, it all seems very familiar and boring. It's just another rip off of the Fantasy / Sci-Fi genre with a Cyberpunk coat of paint over the top... So you have your Trolls, Orcs, Humans, Dwarfs and Elves but they're all dressed in late 90's, pleather ridden esque garbs talking about jacking in to matrix's and carrying uzi's. *puke*If you find it on sale, go for it I guess... but be warned, it's incredibly drab over all... not very stimulating. As a word of advice, don't try to specalize in more than a couple traits because being a jack of all trades / well rounded toon is going to get you killed in the late game.			"

												""Shadowrun Returns"" does for the rich Shadowrun universe what ""Baldur's Gate"" did for the Forgotten Realms. Playing through this game was like playing through some of the classic SR adventures, with mysteries to solve, clues to follow, and all manner of unusual individuals to interact with. And firefights, of course. The noir atmosphere is great, and it's quite obvious from gameplay that the creators of the game were fans of the tabletop RPG: there are numerous references to characters and organizations from the gamebooks, some more relevant to the story than others. The music is great, the character creation was satisfyingly customizable: I was able to make a reasonable facsimile of my female Dwarf Decker from the tabletop game with the options present. And the fact that I've been able to play as a Decker and get through the first adventure on Normal difficulty is a testament to the fact that you can play any character type you like and do well. If you're a fan of the original tabletop RPG, I highly recommend ""Shadowrun Returns.""			"

												In an Era where RPG's are filled with shallow mechanics, retardation in character urgency and plots that are as simple as offering  Oprah a piece of your sammich emerges Shadowrun Returns Dragonfall. For those who have been living under a rock I would like to ask 1)How much is the rent over there and 2)How have you not heard of shadowrun returns Dragonfall. Dragonfall is the expansion of the cyberpunk rpg that came out last year. I enjoyed the OC so much that it is probably my third favorite game of all time. The Dragonfall expansion has an ambition to expand on the wonderful world of shadowrun returns. I could write a long review but each time I look at vine videos I am reminded that society's current attention span is...hey a puppy. Basically I will write down some cliff notesWhat Does Shadowrun Returns Dragonfall Improve on?-Level Design-Choices and consenquences-Combat difficulty-Character Interaction-Character Development-Skillchecks-More Mage Class Urgency-More EquipmentWhat Does Harebrained schemes need to work on?-Response time of their game. My menu screen takes a while to respond to a click.-Adept class still needs improvement as it feels a bit lackluster.-Work on those Boss Fights.Final Verdict is Shadowrun Returns Dragonfall 9/10 would ban....sorry about that. 9/10 would play again which I will be doing today with a decker.

												First off, I want to say that I'm glad someone is trying to revive Shadowrun and it's rich world setting. Unfrotunatly, this did not quite hit the mark.The game was too on the rails for me to enjoy. Shadowrun is an amazing world and you're not allowed to explore it. The stash system makes no sense and is a poor design choice. As far back as SNES, games have allowed you to automatically equip a new item you've purchased and sell your old one or keep it to be stored. Why do my new weapons go automatically to my stash? I purchased it because it was better than what I had currently. There's no excuse for this design to still exist in modern games.The only viable option for your character is Street Samurai as this game decided to keep the poor choices of old isometric games where the game is over if your character dies, even if there are ways to ressurect people. I chose Decker as my class and it was neutered from the awesome experience it should have been. I was squishy in combat and thus had to restart levels multiple times as the AI would target only me and end the fight quickly. I was not presented with an option to enter the matrix to hack things and it was relegated to an automatic dialogue option. I asked other and it doesn't get any better later in the game.I so badly wanted this game to be what Shadowrun deserves but I guess I have to keep waiting.			"

												Until recently, I was somewhat reluctant to recommend this game. I enjoyed Dead Man's Switch, but, like many people, found it to be more of an interactive novel (with tactical interludes) than a role playing game. Playing around with the editor has been a blast, but I know that this isn't for everyone, and neither is playing through User Generated Content (though there's some excellent stuff out there). After the launch of Dragonfall, however, I can post the positive review with confidence. Aside from implementing the much needed save-anywhere system, Dragonfall is a much more engaging campaign on so many levels. It's what Dead Man's Switch should have been, but wasn't. While the main hub is relatively small, you really do feel like the leader of a team of Shadowrunners, and are able to take on a variety of jobs, and complete them in the order that you wish. The jobs themselves, more importantly, feel a great deal more open, with tough choices and multiple objectives, including optional points of interest. The literally two side quests you got in DMS felt like afterthoughts (""oh crap, we forgot to put side quests in and the game launches in a week!""). Here, everything feels lovingly attended to. This is, perhaps, a major advantage of text based story telling. If you're inclined to pick up the relatively robust editor that comes along with the base game, you'll not that your storytelling capacity is only limited by your writing ability and your imagination (the scripting and map building aren't that hard to learn). If you've got the desire and the ability to write, you can craft beautiful and interesting adventures, whether side quest or main, to your heart's content. And that's what HBS has done this time around.In fact, the one thing that hasn't changed is the excellent writing. This isn't high end literature, but it's engaging and interesting all around. It draws you into the world and, in some cases, really captivates you. The charachters, especially your crew members, the fixer, and the occupants of your little slice of berlin, are memorable and interesting to a person. It's unfortunate that this had to be released as DLC. The base campaign had the writing down, but it didn't have the wow factor or the, well, interactivity. If only it had...The setting and the charachters of Dead Man's Switch could have really shone with a similar treatment.Still, better late than never.			"

												Shadowrun.A cyberpunk world heavily inspired by William Gibson's ""Nuromancer.""In fact, so heavily inspired much of the early lore and ""techno-speak"" with in the table-top RPG was taken straight from his 1984 novel and pasted.When I was 14 years old, I mingled with a small herd of nerds who held Shadowrun as some sort of Holy Grail amongst table-top games. I played it once, and hated all 30 minutes of it. Needless to say, my friendship with them didn't last much longer there after, but my interest was stoked a little.In my late teens and very early twenties, I read a trilogy of Shadowrun novels. My intrest went from mere intrest to a desire to gather more Shadowrun knowledge.I later acquired a battered and torn copy of 2nd edition.Again, my first game- this time Gm'd by me, did not bode well and was a complete failure, lasting just about as long.I have now however, acquired 4th edition- hopefully that will work better.But onto this game it's self.When my brother In-Law (soon to be) told me of a Shadowrun game on Steam, I was very excited and very jelous he had it too!Having been bought it by my wife during the summer sale, this has been one of the best buys I've gotten for any game.What has led to to write this though, isn't the core game it's self, but the ingenous user made content.The core game made, gives a good story an awesome over view of the Shadowrun world with a cool RPG element.The user content I has sampled thus far though, brings this game to a whole new kind of awesome.Users have spent their (probaly what little of it they have) spare free time to craft gems of gaming story with layers of Shadowrun lore, politics, intrigue and magic threaded within it. These aren't just ""I made this for a laugh (guff)!!!"" These are stories. Character driven and user defined.So why get this game?Get this game to find others who want to share a dark magical future with you.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is some of the best isometric, turn-based combat I've seen in a while, and I love the genre.  I love cyberpunk in general, and Shadowrun in particular, so I'm admitting bias up front.  Still, the world and combat are a blast.  I really have to recommend it all over again due to the Dragonfall expansion, as that has some of the greatest in-game character development and plot that I've seen in the last decade.  Fascinating NPCs not only in your team, but in a neighborhood that you adopt.  Great options to solve problems regardless of whether you sling lead, summon spirits to do your bidding, or pilot a few remote-control death contraptions.  The team's interesting and useful, the cover system and environments make the combat fun, the plot keeps you progressing to see what's next, and your choices matter in ways that are really refreshing to see.  Two cybernetically-enhanced Orc thumbs up!			"

												This reminds me of a time when good writing was still a priority in roleplaying games.  FASA's Shadowrun pen & paper games were among my all-time favourites back in the 1990s and this game captures the atmosphere and well-fleshed out characters of ""The Sixth World"" perfectly.The adventure is short but the toolset and mod community should provide more than enough justification for the asking price (especially during a Steam sale).If you're a fan of tactics-style RPGs or the cyber-punk genre, you really can't go wrong with this indie-gem.

												TL;DR, This is a good game with great writing, easy-to-understand mechanics that will still offer a challenge to those who want it, and while the main story that comes with the game is short, it has some decent replayability value with the character customization and is helped by the fact that there're plenty of community-made campaigns to try out. Oh yeah, this thing will also run well on most potatoes. If you like Baulder's Gate, the first two Fallouts, or like RPG or strategy games at all, try it out.I knew nothing about Shadowrun before playing this game other than it was a cyberpunk universe of some sort, and this game got me interested in the universe pretty quickly. It pulls classic fantasy stuff, like magicy fireballs, standard fantasy races, and even dragons and puts them into a cyberpunk setting in the near-future. While that sounds like a bit of a cluster♥♥♥♥, it actually works really well.The game leaves you with a pretty open opportunity to make any sort of character that'll fit into the setting that you want. The only thing that is established is that you are/were a Shadowrunner (which are off-the-grid mercenaries, basically.) and you had like one guy you usd to run with that's at all relevent to the rest of the story. It makes me think of Fallout: New Vegas, and that's a good thing to be reminded of.When the first fight happens there's a page where you can read through all the rules of combat, and while that may seems overwhelming at first, you can honestly just read about Action Points, where everything is in the UI, and cover. Cover is important. From there, anyone who has decent cognitive function and has played a videogame before can figure it out as they go, because the game isn't going to punish you early for not quite knowing what you're doing yet.The greatest thing about the game is the story and writing. It's a well put together mystery that starts out seeming pretty simple, but get deeper and deeper as you go further into the rabbit hole. As for the writing, I continually noticed how good it was throughout the whole thing. Each loading screen, while they can take a long time at certain parts, has a well-written set of paragraphs to set the mood of the place you're about to go to. Each character is believable, many are likeable (my personal favorite is Mr. Kluwe), and all are well-written.The game is linear as opposed to open-world, but it works. It's structured like a tabletop RPG campaign, because that's what Shadowrun is/was. While I figured that out a ways in, it didn't feel restrictive like some linear stories are. That could just be a personal thing, but hey, this is about my experience with the game.One of the biggest problems with the game is that the main campaign is short, especially for a cRPG, which are usually quite long and expansive games. Shadowrun: Returns is meant to be, at least as far as I can tell, to be an engine from which to run your own campaigns, like how DMs in tabletops like D&D do, because, again,  that's what Shadowrun is/was. However, I have personnally yet to find a campaign from the workshop that I really like. After playing through Dead Man's Switch (the main campaign that comes with the game) all the community produced campaigns feels sub-par or mediocre. I suppose that should be expected when comparing something made by a professional development team to something made by one guy and is for free. Still, it does impact the staying power of the game.I got this on sale for 5 bucks a while back. As of this writing, it's like 80% off, at 3 dollars or something. It is definately worth that price. Overall, this is one of the most satisfying video game purchases I've made in a while. If you want an arbitrary number out of number rating, I'll give it a solid 8/10.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a tactical RPG based on the pen-and-paper game of the same name. It offers a unique universe and an intriguing combat system, and I found myself pleasantly surprised while playing it.Character CreationCharacter creation is rather tricky if you are new to the Shadowrun mechanics. You are permitted to select your gender, followed by your race (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Orc, Troll), and an archetype if you wish - the archetype presets your skills for you and is recommended for beginner players.I played as an Elf, creating a custom archetype specialising in ranged weapons and Body (the stat that gives me more HP). Rather than gaining experience throughout the game, you get Karma (effectively stat points) to start and as you progress. You spend the Karma to advance in the skills of your choosing.Creating your avatar is fairly simple, with minimal options for appearance. Given that I spent most of the game fully zoomed out, this was rather irrelevant. You do not get to design any party members for this game. Instead, there are story-related party members assigned to you for certain missions, and you can hire others to fill the holes for each mission.CombatCombat is definitely a challenge. Everything is based on hidden “dice rolls” (or Random Number Generators), and directly affected by your stats. You get Action Points for each of your characters, which you can spend on movement, attacking, or using skills and items. Movement is critical, as you position your characters using the environment for cover and giving yourself the most advantageous location for attacking the enemy. Of course, the enemies move too, making each round require a new plan.Attacks are made with a weapon of your choice. Pistols, rifles, submachine guns, melee weapons, shotguns, and a magic missile attack are all made available to you for purchase, and you select/upgrade your weaponry to suit your character’s needs. You cannot, however, modify the weaponry of your companions.Spells are interesting, to be sure. Like weapons, they are purchased and equipped. Spells, as in most games, have a cooldown period. However, in Shadowrun they can be cast even while in cooldown - at the cost of your health. In a pinch, this can be a beneficial choice to make. At the wrong time, it could spell your demise. (See what I did there??)StoryThe story in this game is decent. The backdrop is set throughout the game, in a futuristic world where magic has made a resurgence into power. Called the Awakening, this resurgence has led to the appearance of metahumans (in varying forms - Elf, Dwarf, Orc, Troll), who are the target of prejudice as humanity remain the majority. Technology still plays a powerful role in this universe, with people being able to get cybernetic enhancements, bring drones into combat, or even hack into computers (which is referred to as Decking - and the internet, of course, is now the Matrix). Your character is a Shadowrunner, someone who completes dangerous (and often illegal) jobs under the table. Your old friend has been murdered, and he has left you a secured bank account with a significant sum of money. The catch? You must find his killer.Why I hated itIn the interest of avoiding spoilers, I will not reveal too much, but the ending was absolutely ridiculous. The last four missions were, actually. Also, there are a few moments where the writing quality just crumbles, forcing me to do a double take and breaking my immersion. Finally, while many of the metahuman NPCs mention the anti-metahuman discrimination they face, it seemed irrelevant that I was a metahuman myself - they completely ignored the fact that I was an Elf. Minor detail, yes, but still a nuisance.Final RecommendationThe game was fun, overall - despite the last few missions. Think XCOM: Enemy Unknown as an RPG. That’ll give you a decent sense of how this game plays out.			"

												In 2005 an arena combat shadowrun game emerged, it was a tremendous mistake. It singlehandedly destroyed the beautiful and weird property that wizkids had cultivated for tabletop gaming, for an entire digital audience. I salvaged a disc from a bargain bin a few years after it's release, and died a bit inside realizing titles meant nothing. It'd be like going to your favorite restaurant on your birthday, and getting food poisoning.Flash forward to Harebrained's inspired idea to do this franchise right, and goodness did they.The controls are so streamlined you could replace candy crush/angry birds for your toilet gaming habits.The Lore is solid. This game was written by someone who not just played the tabletop, but obsessed over the subject matter so long, that they could re-create the vivid world of megacorporations and magic, and they expanded on it so well, that even their truly inspired players could use their tools to tell their own cyberpunk stories.This game is an accomplishment, not just a successful game- not just a beautiful deluge into the gritty future of fantasy, but the redemption of an entire franchise.

												Turn-based cyberpunk fun.Fantastic writing, great art (the player and NPC portraits are full of character and style), and flexible character development (mix magic and hacking, summoning and swordplay, or any other interesting combination of skills that seems cool to you). Do yourself a favor and play it on Hard or Very Hard to get the most enjoyment out of the strategic combat system. The main drawback is the linearity of the base campaign (Dead Man's Switch), but the story is enteraining enough that it's a minor complaint, imo.Environments are interactive in various ways depending on your skills -- for example, leylines and sources of elemental spirits can be tapped by casters, and various terrain can be used as cover during combat to raise defenses. The DLC campaign, Dragonfall, greatly builds on every enjoyable aspect of the base game as well as broadening the scope of the world. More sidequests, more interesting characters, more player choices, and more gritty Shadowrun atmosphere and story (along with several different endings).There is also an extensive library of player-designed campaigns, made via the built-in content creator tools, after you finish the two official ones. Or you can try your hand making scenarios of your own. Totally worth the price, though I'd highly recommend getting Dragonfall too, since the base game feels rather short and linear on it's own.

There are some negatives, the interface feels outdated and i've found quite some typos along the way. This last bit is a shame because the game relies heavily on the story, which is something i really like in games. Good, but short.			"

												This review may be biased purely because I have played the pen and paper version many years ago as a youngster, and playing this seemed to vividly bring to life all those adventures I ran and played all those years ago. These guys (developers) did an amazing job capturing the spirit of Shadowrun, and I can't give it any more praise than this review. The moding community is also brill with enough one off adventures and campaigns to keep anyone playing this for even longer than the main adventure, thumbs up!			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a modern take on an old genre we haven't seen much of recently. You might be familiar with the world of Shadowrun. I wasn't before playing this. It's one of the coolest and most well realised fictions I've seen in a while. The writing here is impeccable and will likely make you wish there were more games set in this universe. There's no voice acting, so get ready to read, but I found the world so engaging it wasn't an issue.The combat has taken some ideas from old-school games and some from modern ones like XCOM. It works very well and has deep character trees and customisation options. With the exception of a massive difficulty ramp on the last mission, the combat is quite intriguing.The real strength of this game will likely be in whatever the modding community decides to do with it. The whole thing is just a module launcher similar to Neverwinter Nights. You could tell endless stories within this frame.			"

												Shadowrun is a game that has long been waiting for an RPG like this.While you buy this as a whole game, you get so much more.You get the interesting campaign which is around 12 hours long and will keep you engaged. Beyond that, you get the tools to create your own campaign and play other people's. Many games have this, so why does this game having it warrant anything?Well, as with any RPG based on a pen-and-paper game, there's a plethora of campaigns just waiting to be inserted into this game and a lot are already there. Not only do you get an excellent game in and of itself, you get all of the currently-released and upcoming campaigns that will inevitably come.			"

												This game captures the spirit of Shadowrun perfectly. The starting campaign, 'Dead Man's Switch', is a -little- cliche, but it's well-written, well-executed cliche that has good characters and a few fun little twists. There's a vast amount of user-generated combat, and an editor included to make your own. Excellent game; I wish I'd backed the kickstarter.			"

												Enjoyable, but much better turn based games out there. Strong points are the story and the idea/universe, as well as the music and setting. As for Cons, the game is fairly shallow and linear as can be, it almost plays it self for you while you kind of click along without much thought. I kept playing for the story itself. Potential for a very strong game with these ideas are buried here with a future release. 6.5/10			"

												Based off the Pen and Paper RPG Shadowrun, this is without a doubt the closest to the pen and paper game you can get without getting papercuts, mountain dew and dice.On to the setting!the super short version: the Love child of Cyberpunk and High Fantasy.the short version: Magic returns after lying dormant for thousands of years turning people into the races from fantasy games/stories and reshaping the politcal and topographical map through war and disasters both natural and otherwise.Corporations are bigger and stronger (go figure) and they and anybody else with the scratch hire shadowrunners to cause and solve problems for them.Guessing you can figure out your role in the game.It's got a good campaign and once that's finished there are plenty more that other people have made and you can make your own.The Expansion's campaign is also very good.

												If you've heard rage about this game, don't worry; most of that is from people who severely underestimated the cost of video games development.  A $2 million Kickstarter campaign (which worked out to about $1.2 mil after Amazon and Kickstarter's cuts, which then also had to cover the physical rewards for the backers as well as the game) doesn't mean AAA quality - it means a shoestring budget.  Keep that in mind, and this is a fantastic game and a worthy addition to the Shadowrun universe.Set in the dystopian, cyberpunk future of 2050, in a world where magic and the races of fantasy have returned.  Unlike the last two good Shadowrun games (the FPS should only be considered a Shadowrun game in the context of how NOT to make a Shadowrun game) back on the SNES and Genesis, Returns hews more closely to the turn-based nature and feel of the original pen-and-paper game.  It doesn't exactly port over the ruleset - merely uses a whole new one inspired by the rulesets used by the PnP game's 2nd and 3rd editions.  It's a classless system, meaning you can spend your Karma (what the game calls XP) on whatever aspect of your character you want.  Think your AK-97-totting ork needs some skill with a blade for when the enemy gets up-close and personal?  No problem - just drop the Karma into the relevant stat when you have the chance.  What if you feel your chi-wielding Physical Adept needs a bit of extra ranged oomph but you don't want to spend the money on guns?  Sink some Karma into spellcasting and you can add some fireballs and lightning bolts to the mix.The game does provide a set of Archetypes to pick from during character creation, each one fitting one of six roles in the SR universe - the Street Samurai, who follows a code of honour but mostly focuses on combat and augmenting himself with a lot of cyberware; the Mage, who lashes out with powerful spells; the Decker, who uses his cyberdeck to hack into the Matrix (the internet's successor... no, no relation to the films; Shadowrun was using the term way back in the late '80s); the Shaman, who manipulates the energies of the natural world to aid his companions as well as calling up spirits to fight alongside them; the Rigger, who remote-controls a series of combat drones and the Physical Adept, who focuses his magic inward and make strikes with his fists or a blade more devastating.The Archetypes spend most of your starting Karma for you and (in the included campaign, Dead Man's Switch) set your starting gear.  If you want to spend all that starting Karma yourself, be prepared to start the game with a few guns (I think a pistol, an SMG and an assault rifle) and no spells/drones/cyberdeck/etc.  In addition to the archetypes, you also have five races, or metatypes as the game calls them, to choose from.  In the 2050s, humanity is now metahumanity and consists of humans, elves, dwarves, orks and trolls.Most of them are pretty much what you'd expect - elves are agile and smart, dwarves and tough and stubborn, orks can snap you in two like a dry twig, etc.  Trolls, though, can basically be seen as orks on steroids (an analogy that doesn't quite work as well when there could literally be orks taking steroids) - they're even bigger, even stronger and have bony growths on their skin that act like armour.  Each metatype's drawback is limits on how high certain stats can go - most can raise them to about 10 or 11, but trolls, for example, can't raise their Charisma above six.The combat has something of an XCOM feel to it, save that you can't rotate the camera.  HBS took some of the elements from XCOM Enemy Unknown that worked - the assumption that your team brought more than enough ammo for the job (infinite ammo, but needing to reload) and the high-low-cover system (though flanking doesn't give a bonus to critical hits, just makes them easier to hit).I'll get the negatives out of the way now - at the time I'm writing this, there is no manual save feature.  It only auto-saves on loading screens and there will be times when those are spaced far enough apart to be a pain.  Good news on this front - they're working on a manual save system that should be done at the same time as the first expansion, Dragonfall, but will be applied to the base game and campaign without you having to buy that.  That won't be til about January, though.  Secondly, the included campaign is rather short - tops out at about 12 hours or thereabouts and is rather linear.  Don't go into it expecting the freedom most other RPGs have; Dead Man's Switch is a very story-driven campaign and the events in it only cover a few days.  This next one I don't see as a problem, but there were a lot of people raging about it on the Steam forums after launch - the game has zero voice acting.  They couldn't afford it.  Yes, sadly; this means that you will have to read.  But for the added freedom this gave them in NPC dialogue, I have no problem with that.  There is also very little to actually interact with in the environments (or at least in Dead Man's Switch, this may not be the case in Dragonfall or some user-generated content) so they can feel rather empty at times.The graphics have an interesting, stylised look to them.  It was a big jarring for me at first (I'd binged a bit on the various 4th edition books during the Kickstarter campaign where most of the art's a bit more realistic) but eventually I came to enjoy it.  The character models aren't exactly high-grade, but the camera never really gets close enough for it to be annoying.  You'll be getting a better feel for a character's look from their portrait.  The overall character designs fit the SR universe, though; Detective McKluskly is a good example of this - they've taken an almost stereotypical design of a corrupt detective and turned him into an ork and it works.  Even with the lower-quality of the character models, they still found ways to add little details to them.  Jump over to Google and do a quick image search with ""Shadowrun Returns McKlusky"" and find an image of his character model.  You might notice a tattoo on one forearm.  It's never mentioned anywhere in the game, but that's a tattoo from the UCAS Marines - he's ex-military.This game does come with a full editor that is, relatively, user-friendly.  I say 'relatively' because any editor that involves more than placing terrain and hostile NPCs is going to be complex, no matter how you slice it.  But the coding side of this one is a lot simpler than any other I've seen - using If/Else statements and the like.  It takes some getting used to, but there are tutorials for it on the HBS youtube channel and there's bound to be plenty of fan-made tutorials out there by now.  Most of this game's life will come from the campaigns published on the Workshop, but like any game driven by fan-made content (ARMA, Elder Scrolls, even ol' Neverwinter Nights) it will be at least a year before that side of the game comes into its own.I'd say more about Dead Man's Switch itself, but most of the negatives I feel players could be warned about (or at least worth mentioning here) come with some serious spoilers.  These aren't massive ones, really just mention on why one NPC isn't as tough as the PnP game's books suggested.  What I will say is that it has some phenomenal writing that pulls you into the setting.  There are perhaps some things mentioned that may not mean anything to someone new to the setting, but HBS has a Shadowrun Primer on their website for free download that should help in that respect.  Regardless, they made great use of Shadowrun's iconic slang and the various setting elements (although that does mean anyone familiar with the setting may know what's coming once you start having to deal with the Universal Brotherhood).

												I vaguely remembered the pen and paper version of Shadowrun from my high school years. The game system has been around for some time and has a rich background. I downloaded Shadowrun Returns and enjoyed it thoroughly, bringing back memories of the pen and paper days. While the game itself has a limited use of skill sets, I found the combat enjoyable and the background story fun and different from the norm. Was also good enough that I purchsed the Dragonfall content. That pack utilized a broader range of skills overall, but seemed more focused on the decker class. The two games shine in dialog and content moreso than expansiveness. Both are thoroughly engrossing and have multi-play capabilities in terms of combat difficult settings and different character classes. For the price, it would be hard to beat the quality.			"

												I bought this game having played Dragonfall (stand-alone) and was very disappointed. I expected going 'backward' from Dragonfall would miss out on some UI improvements and such but I was shocked at how short, basic and uninteresting Shadowrun Returns storyline was. The story was poor to say the least; I won't spoil it but I genuinely thought I was in the prologue or something until the 'final boss'... I completed this game in 11 hours, despite seeking all little side quests (it feels like there were none) and talking to everyone possible (much less than Dragonfall). I do not recommend buying this game today but STRONGLY recommend Shadowrun: Dragonfall, which despite being a ""small standalone story"" is infinitely better, more interesting and took me over twice as long to complete. At only £2.20 in a sale it's arguably alright but still, knowing what I do now I'd have skipped the game completely.			"

Easy to learn and build your character even with absolutely no familiarity with teh pen and paper version f teh RPG, smooth play, and workshop support that allows for user generated content similar to Neverwinter Nights. Shadowrun is a fun game with a beautiful art style, lovely music, and a rather solid gaming experience.If you're looking to revisit the past, or to while away a few hours exploring a techno-magical fantasy setting, this game's a solid pick.

												I've loved Shadowrun for a long time. It was my first tabletop rpg, and it helped foster a love of the happy that is going strong today. For those who don't know, Shadowrun is a setting that takes place in a dystopian cyberpunk future. Corporations are more powerful than governments, and most people are either wretchedly poor or corperate wage slaves with no freedom. But there is a twist. As this dystopia began to develop, magic returned to the world, bringing with it Elves, Dwarves, Orks, Trolls... and Dragons. Think Bladerunner meets Dragon Age. You play as shadowrunners, mercenary criminals who live off the grid and do jobs that are too dirty or difficult for the corporations. You are a theif, assasin, or bodygraud on any given day, operating in the shadows and outside the law. I've always thought that this would make a great setting for a video game, but Shadowrun hasn't had too many adaptations: and the ones we did get weren't great. But Harebrained Schemes thought they could deliver, and took to Kickstarter. And deliver they did. I kickstarted Shadowrun Returns, and the end product was worth the investment. It was a good turn base strategy rpg, along the lines of, say, Fallout, though the setting conjures up comparasions to Arcanum: of steamworks and magick obscura (also recomended). The combat was fun, the graphics looked excellent, and importantly to someone like me, the developers clearly understood Shadowrun, a sense that could not be gained from the poorly received X-box shooter of some years ago. But it was good game, if there were several issues that kept it from being great. A save system that didn't work well, and a story that was a little too linear and static for Shadowrun's traditional style. These issues were tempered by a promise of mission packs and expansions, and a robust editor for the community to create missions of their own. Now they've released the first of those mission packs, Dragonfall, and playing it convinced me to write this reveiw. Because where the original game faltered, Dragonfall soars. A rational save system is finally in, and there is more variety to the weapons, cyberware, and other combat options to make things a little more interesting. And, most importantly, the new campaign is exactly what shadowun should be. It's got interesting characters to talk to, both in your team and in the hub where you go in between missions. It's supports player agency, from the runs you choose to go on to the way you solve those runs. Runs themselves are interesting and often dynamic. Each one has signifigant choices, and I had to think hard about seveal of them. While I could have seen more room to roleplay, for the most part I never felt that my character wasnt' represented in the dialouge choices. And while I like the story of the main game, the story in Dragonfall is much better. It made me care about the characters and the situation far more than the orignal. But most of all, it feels like Shadowun. The runs played exactly like runs I might have written myself for the tabletop game, far more so than the first game. And the balence between story based missions and those just for case works much better than the previous as well. All in all, playing Dragonfall felt just like playing a real Shadowrun game. That is what I wanted when I kickstarted, and I will buy whatever DLC they release as long as they maintain that feeling. So, I heartily recomend Shadowrun Returns, but strongly recomend you buy Dragonfall too- in fact, you should probably start with it over the original games campaign, espeically if you are familier with the setting, but thats a personal choice. But is it right for those who don't know Shadowrun? I still think so. The setting is interesting enough to draw people in, and no previous knoweldge is needed for the actual gameplay, which is entertaining even without feeding into that Shadowrun feedback loop I have. That said, the Berlin Free State setting of the game might be a little bit bewildering, as the game doesn't explain all that much (That said, most shadowrun players probably don't know much about Berlin either - Me included- but at least with the background its easier to get up to speed). For those who don't know anything about Shadowrun, and are willing to put up with the weaker (but still good) story, starting with the first game's story might still be better as it is probly friendler to those who are going in blind. tldr: Shadowrun Returns is a good game, but Dragonfall is even better, doubly so for anyone who knows the setting or has played the tabletop game. If you were on the fence before, Dragonfall makes it a good bet.			"

												--UPDATED REVIEW--No doubt about it, Shadowrun Returns is a Shadowrun roleplaying game engine (built on Unity), not a game. The first campaign released was Dead Man's Swtich. The second campaign is Dragonfall. They are fully standalone campaigns and are really where you find the game of Shadowrun Returns. Dragonfall is not ""DLC"". It is, in fact, a more robust, more ambitious and (at least as I played it) twice-as-long campaign compared to its predecessor.This is really important to recognize, especially if you haven't played through Dead Man's Switch, or maybe you didn't like it. It's like playing a roleplaying campaign under two different GMs with two different encounter design styles and stories to tell. You definitely don't have to play Dead Man's Switch at all to enjoy Dragonfall.Since I played Dead Man's Switch, many things have been improved / patched. For instance, scripting in the game's dialog has allowed you to often call on your teammates' skills to help interject in a hacking (decking!) or knowledge based problem. It's not perfect, but it's much, much better. The save system is also now fully featured, which was my biggest complaint about Shadowrun Returns (save when you want, OMG!).I don't really like how little influence you have over your party's inventory, but I kinda like the narrative implication that they are in charge of themselves, and you're fully in charge of what characters get to come with you on your runs.The art style, the characters, the rules, the format, etc. they're all the same as you'd remember from Dead Man's Switch. Where Dragonfall shines uniquely is in providing an environment that is far more free than the campaign of its predecessor. I believe most computer roleplaying game fans will greatly prefer Dragonfall. There is a town hub where you are free to shop and pick up side quests, unlike the compact hideout in Dead Man's Switch. Many combat situations have multiple approaches compared to what Dead Man's Switch offered. The characters are more interesting, have more personality, are more plentiful (and more useful), and are better written than those in the prior campaign (reminds me a lot of Mass Effect 2). The story also goes from the small criminal raids of a simple shadowrunning team to the gigantic world-changing epic story that RPGs are famous for.That said, Dead Man's Switch is still a friendlier, smaller, and more digestible introduction to the Shadowrun world, so I really do recommend playing that campaign first if you're just diving in for the first time.I'd also like to add that in Dead Man's Switch I played a shotgun-toting, robot-driving hacker, which is basically my ideal cyberpunk character idea. I had a great time! I was originally a little underwhelmed with Dragonfall when I started as a melee fighter because it lacked the gimmicks of my prior loadout (but I'll be darned if I only play one archetype in an RPG). In fact, the lackluster start is what kept me from really even playing the game for 4 months. But in the end, I was really impressed with my troll, and he was just as important to my party as my prior character.So yes! If you like RPGs and good writing, play Dragonfall. DO IT!--ORIGINAL REVIEW--This is only the second Kickstarter game I've played. I'm pretty impressed with it, and it really is the kind of game that most publishers would never fund, so I'm excited to have had the opportunity to play it.  I've so far only finished the Dead Man's Switch campaign, so the following points are regarding that campaign only.Here's some bullet points:* The visuals are adequate but not compelling. The high-res handpainted isometric art is impressive for the skill required to execute it. It's retro without being pixillated or limited in palette. VFX are adequate.* Really cool music, though not enough of it. Never became obnoxious but I was blown away in the first couple hours, but heard basically the same music for the rest of the game. Adequate sound, but no voice acting, which would've pushed the reception of the game's narrative over the edge!* The story was really cool with some great twists, though it is linear. It's a lot like a great pen-and-paper campaign. You normally wouldn't replay something like that, so a surface-level appearance of choice and nonlinearity is enough, and as a result I found myself happy with the game. However, if you're looking for the story to change dramatically as a result of your choices, you will be disappointed. There are a few dialog options that will change based on your choices, but they are for flavor only. That's OK with me.* The gameplay is fun. I love turn-based RPG tactics, I just do. I love the positioning and the AOE attacks and managing action points. I like buffs and line-of-sight and overwatch. The game is fully featured in terms of the amount of relevant (and effecitve) skills and choices you have available. You are not locked into a class. Where the gameplay falls short is the dice rolling (like most direct tabletop RPG-to-videogame translations). I hate it when I have an 83% chance to hit a guy and miss twice in a row. Further, I hate when an enemy has a 21% chance to hit me, and it lands. I want my performance to be more predictable and tactical and less dependent on luck. Usually things play out like you'd expect, and so it's okay, but every time the odds are in your favor and you fail, you feel cheated. I hate that.I would be very comfortable recommending Shadowrun Returns except one thing: The abysmal save system. This game will only autosave when you go from one area to another. There is no other way to save than autosaving. Further, as the story and quests are linear, you can't just abuse the auto-save system by going back and forth between locations. The result is that whenever the designer decides that you'll be in one area for a really long time, it means you can't save that whole time. This is remarkably, and frequently, inconvenient. That said, as the game is turn based, most of the time you take are decisions you mull over. Your progress is the result of choices, not usually execution. So losing progress isn't so bad when you die, as you'll quickly be able to repeat your choices that you've already thought through. Still though, in this day and age in gaming, it's a pretty egregious oversight.That said, I would still recommend Shadowrun Returns if only for the wonderful and rare cyberpunk videogame setting, choice driven character systems, and tactical RPG combat.

												So after completing Shadowrun Returns: Dragonfall, I can say with no small amount of enthusiasm that it was one of the best stories I've played through. Despite it's relatively short length (somewhere around 14-20 hours), the writing is superb and almost every character is fleshed out very well - even NPC's that aren't critical to the story. Coupled with the new save system, I can confidently say that it's a much better Shadowrun. The story may not be as deep, but the interactions with your team and neighborhood more than make up for it. Picked it up for $5 on the Steam Sale and it's easilly one of the best five dollars I've ever spent.			"

												I played through the entire game in about a week, put about 20 hours into it. I've been playing games for quite a while and I have gotten to that point where few games make me want to came back again and again and be excited to come home from work so I can play it. While Shadowrun Returns didn't quite capture the feeling that I used to get it came pretty close and was a nice reminder of how gaming is supposed to feel. The main story was fun, I am looking forward to popping in a workshop campaign in a few weeks. Mechanics feel good, however with the single button comand style (only left clicks) I found that I made few miss clicks when I should not have but there is an option to change that. I look forward to playing an other class later on and with that in mind I would say that this game does have very good replay value. Take it from a biased gamer who you know nothing about, but for my two cents worth it was worth my 15 bucks.			"

												For me this game succeeds on a couple of levels.  It is a great looking, well written game with a really nice soundtrack.  But more importantly to me, it is a really pure expression of the original RPG.  I say this as someone who played a lot of the pen and paper version of Shadowrun back in the day.  This game is amazing at re-creating that vibe.  (That may not be a plus for you, but it really works for me.)			"

												Great source material, execution has some flaws but overall a fun game.  A bit oversimplified IMO but that also makes it a friendly, unintimidating introduction to the genre.  The combat mechanics are a bit simplistic, especially for ranged weapons--I can't figure out why none of the newer squad based tactical RPGs like this have copied the excellent Jagged Alliance 2 'spend action points to improve aim' model, which is very flexible and intuitive.  If you haven't played that game, go buy it now, it's one of the all-time best in the genre and has aged extremely well.  The magic and drone aspects of Shadowrun combat are well implemented, so props to the developers for integrating everything so well.The story held my interest, though (spoilers)a deus ex machina sweeps in to help you with the final mission, which I found disruptive.  The writing itself is god-awful at times.  It could have used another couple proofreads (it's/its, comma usage) and stylistically it reads like decent internet fan fiction with some crap parts.  If you're going to do a text-heavy game like this, you'd better make damn sure you have the writing chops to do it.  Hire some damn writers, Bioware and Black Isle didn't seem to have this problem way back in the 1990s.Still, a fun ride overall, and the developers did a great job of capturing the universe.  I recommend playing it on 'Very Hard' which puts you on even footing with the enemy but plays more like you would expect 'Normal' or 'Hard' to.  Choose 'Hard' if you're new to this sort of game.

												Captures the feel of the Shadowrun Universe, but lacks in content.   The limited amount of cyberware, and the ability not to be able to save where you want is somewhat limiting.  Many mods are out for this game that allows you to extend the gameplay somewhat.   Mods have come out with the Cannon Companion, and several other shadowrun books, but the abilitiy to import them into the game is somewhat limited, and many mods are for mod designers and not casual players.Overall i would give this game a 3 out of 5; its worth 14 bucks but dont expect too much.

Easy to learn and build your character even with absolutely no familiarity with teh pen and paper version f teh RPG, smooth play, and workshop support that allows for user generated content similar to Neverwinter Nights. Shadowrun is a fun game with a beautiful art style, lovely music, and a rather solid gaming experience.If you're looking to revisit the past, or to while away a few hours exploring a techno-magical fantasy setting, this game's a solid pick.

												I've loved Shadowrun for a long time. It was my first tabletop rpg, and it helped foster a love of the happy that is going strong today. For those who don't know, Shadowrun is a setting that takes place in a dystopian cyberpunk future. Corporations are more powerful than governments, and most people are either wretchedly poor or corperate wage slaves with no freedom. But there is a twist. As this dystopia began to develop, magic returned to the world, bringing with it Elves, Dwarves, Orks, Trolls... and Dragons. Think Bladerunner meets Dragon Age. You play as shadowrunners, mercenary criminals who live off the grid and do jobs that are too dirty or difficult for the corporations. You are a theif, assasin, or bodygraud on any given day, operating in the shadows and outside the law. I've always thought that this would make a great setting for a video game, but Shadowrun hasn't had too many adaptations: and the ones we did get weren't great. But Harebrained Schemes thought they could deliver, and took to Kickstarter. And deliver they did. I kickstarted Shadowrun Returns, and the end product was worth the investment. It was a good turn base strategy rpg, along the lines of, say, Fallout, though the setting conjures up comparasions to Arcanum: of steamworks and magick obscura (also recomended). The combat was fun, the graphics looked excellent, and importantly to someone like me, the developers clearly understood Shadowrun, a sense that could not be gained from the poorly received X-box shooter of some years ago. But it was good game, if there were several issues that kept it from being great. A save system that didn't work well, and a story that was a little too linear and static for Shadowrun's traditional style. These issues were tempered by a promise of mission packs and expansions, and a robust editor for the community to create missions of their own. Now they've released the first of those mission packs, Dragonfall, and playing it convinced me to write this reveiw. Because where the original game faltered, Dragonfall soars. A rational save system is finally in, and there is more variety to the weapons, cyberware, and other combat options to make things a little more interesting. And, most importantly, the new campaign is exactly what shadowun should be. It's got interesting characters to talk to, both in your team and in the hub where you go in between missions. It's supports player agency, from the runs you choose to go on to the way you solve those runs. Runs themselves are interesting and often dynamic. Each one has signifigant choices, and I had to think hard about seveal of them. While I could have seen more room to roleplay, for the most part I never felt that my character wasnt' represented in the dialouge choices. And while I like the story of the main game, the story in Dragonfall is much better. It made me care about the characters and the situation far more than the orignal. But most of all, it feels like Shadowun. The runs played exactly like runs I might have written myself for the tabletop game, far more so than the first game. And the balence between story based missions and those just for case works much better than the previous as well. All in all, playing Dragonfall felt just like playing a real Shadowrun game. That is what I wanted when I kickstarted, and I will buy whatever DLC they release as long as they maintain that feeling. So, I heartily recomend Shadowrun Returns, but strongly recomend you buy Dragonfall too- in fact, you should probably start with it over the original games campaign, espeically if you are familier with the setting, but thats a personal choice. But is it right for those who don't know Shadowrun? I still think so. The setting is interesting enough to draw people in, and no previous knoweldge is needed for the actual gameplay, which is entertaining even without feeding into that Shadowrun feedback loop I have. That said, the Berlin Free State setting of the game might be a little bit bewildering, as the game doesn't explain all that much (That said, most shadowrun players probably don't know much about Berlin either - Me included- but at least with the background its easier to get up to speed).

												*This is a review for Dragonfall, the DLC to Shadowrun and not the original campaign*An absoulute gripping look into the cyberpunk universe and one of the most mesmorizing narratives I've seen this year. Everything Shadowrun's original campaign does, Dragonfall does it three times better. This is a case where you should buy the game, just for the dlc. Your party members (which you don't have in the original shadowrun campaign, thanks) all have a plethora of fascinating backstories and dialogue choices. The game takes place in Berlin which uses a completely unique politcal structure for government combined with beautiful enviroments that just make the game feel real, even though it's such a stylized version of a mystical future. The decsions you make later in the game are excruciatingly hard. Dragonfall doesn't treat you like an omnipotent god that makes all the right choices. This is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ world with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ choices to make and if you mess up too bad, everyone suffers for it. There was one choice in particular I had to stop playing for about 20 minutes to decide what I should even do. The gameplay is exactly the same as the original campaign or Xcom unknown so no real changes there. This is a game you need to play if your into old RPGs, well constructed plotlines and characters, and if your a fan of sci fi or cyberpunk, no exceptions if you meet any of these guide lines -Enjoy			"

												I am very happy with Shadowrun Returns. I think the game lives up to the hype. I am a passionate fan of the Super Nintendo Shadowrun game (which I've been playing for over twenty years!) and playing Shadowrun Returns feels like a homecoming. It is very reminiscent of the SNES game, but very contemporary and modern, of course.The combat and puzzles are of medium challenge (just right for me when I played on the game's easy level of difficulty) and the storytelling is good. The visual design and music are extremely well done. There is a well-balanced blend of exploring and fighting. I finished the game in about twenty-four hours of playing time, with only a couple of mission ""do overs."" A quicker and more skilled player might take about twenty hours to finish. I’d like the game to be longer, but that is hardly a legitimate complaint, merely a fond wish and a desire for more of a good thing. I noticed no flaws in the game other than a rash of minor typos about halfway through, mostly in dialogue windows. The only real problem I had was some serious lag in combat scenarios featuring about eight or more characters on screen, but my system, while of good quality, is not a gaming rig, and I'm running only the minimum 2GB of RAM the game recommends. The turn-based system employed in Shadowrun Returns made the lag easily tolerable.In my first play-through I found that playing my character with thoughtfulness and manners gained me lots of karma. The option to be a hardcore, coldblooded merc is always there, but I can't say how taking that tack affects the gameplay. My key to success in combat was always being smart with in-combat strategy. No matter what mistakes I made with equipping or tactics, or how my luck went when the fighting began, I was always able to overcome by making good strategic decisions.Thanks to everyone involved in making the game. Great job!			"

Highly recommend if you're into the old BG, Planescape:Torment, Fallout style of turn based games. Seriously fun.

												This is good ol' classic Shadowrun, I have a bias, I love the Shadowrun backstory and myth. This game is primarily about two things: First you get a pretty decent campaign and the ability to create all the major Shadowrun character types, it's very story focused and is interlaced with combat sections. It's far more lightweight than most games. The other thing you get is a hell of a powerful editor and the strong likelyhood of an ever expanding pile of 'shadowruns' to go on as people make them. This isn't a game about extreme tactics and strategy, it's fairly deep but the combat isn't the main focus, it's all about the stories. If you liked the SNES version, this is very much like that, if you don't, you might stay away, at least see where folks take this game.			"

												In 2005 an arena combat shadowrun game emerged, it was a tremendous mistake. It singlehandedly destroyed the beautiful and weird property that wizkids had cultivated for tabletop gaming, for an entire digital audience. I salvaged a disc from a bargain bin a few years after it's release, and died a bit inside realizing titles meant nothing. It'd be like going to your favorite restaurant on your birthday, and getting food poisoning.Flash forward to Harebrained's inspired idea to do this franchise right, and goodness did they.The controls are so streamlined you could replace candy crush/angry birds for your toilet gaming habits.The Lore is solid. This game was written by someone who not just played the tabletop, but obsessed over the subject matter so long, that they could re-create the vivid world of megacorporations and magic, and they expanded on it so well, that even their truly inspired players could use their tools to tell their own cyberpunk stories.This game is an accomplishment, not just a successful game- not just a beautiful deluge into the gritty future of fantasy, but the redemption of an entire franchise.

												I was a complete neophyte to the Shadowrun series when I first played Shadowrun Returns. I was looking for a strategy oriented RPG with a scenario that would keep me interested in playing the game, the futuristic setting was a bonus.The character's customization offers many ""carreer"" possibilities, whether you want to be a Street Samurai, blading and gunning through the streets of Neo-Seattle, a hacker or ""Decker"" and turn the situation to your advantage by jumping in the matrix and hacking your way through the top, or someone in touch with his inner self and the old spirits of nature, such as a shaman. Or maybe you would rather unleash your fury on the local gangs and punch whoever is stepping in your way. You could also combine any of the different skill trees to make your own and unique gameplay, but remember that a jack of all trades is a master of none...However, this is not why I am recommending this game. Because even if the gameplay and the overall aesthetic of the game are worth the price, the scenario and roleplaying aspect of Shadowrun Returns is, in my humgle opinion, what makes it an amazing game. It all starts off simple, and then escalates to a breathtaking scenario carried by well-written dialogues and a very peculiar ambiance (at least for a newcomer like me).In conclusion, if you're looking for a neofantasy roleplaying oriented strategy RPG, this is your game.

												Shadowrun Returns is a light tactical RPG focusing on story and pretty graphics. The game is fairly short (~10h), but just the right length to not overstay its welcome.The gameplay elements are fairly simple as far as Tactical RPGs go, and those looking for challenging and meaningful systems should look elsewhere. It is still entertaining though, and perfect for those looking for a more casual experience.The real meat of the game is the story, the setup and the writing. The plot is of a noir detective style with conspirations and social commentaries mixed in, well written, served by beautifully hand painted 2D graphics.The only complaint would be that such an interesting universe: a blend between Blade Runner and D&D, deserved a more traditional, long lasting, content rich RPG. As it is the game is highly enjoyable as a little tread, but it's missing momentum, exploration and more involving combat. Well worth on a Steam sale though.			"

I think the story's main funciton is to teach you the game and give you information about the amazing and dark world of Shadowrun Universe. And it is a lineer one, but still there are enjoyable and strange characters. And the naration part of the story feels like you are playing a tabletop rpg.

												TL;DR, This is a good game with great writing, easy-to-understand mechanics that will still offer a challenge to those who want it, and while the main story that comes with the game is short, it has some decent replayability value with the character customization and is helped by the fact that there're plenty of community-made campaigns to try out. Oh yeah, this thing will also run well on most potatoes. If you like Baulder's Gate, the first two Fallouts, or like RPG or strategy games at all, try it out.I knew nothing about Shadowrun before playing this game other than it was a cyberpunk universe of some sort, and this game got me interested in the universe pretty quickly. It pulls classic fantasy stuff, like magicy fireballs, standard fantasy races, and even dragons and puts them into a cyberpunk setting in the near-future. While that sounds like a bit of a cluster♥♥♥♥, it actually works really well.The game leaves you with a pretty open opportunity to make any sort of character that'll fit into the setting that you want. The only thing that is established is that you are/were a Shadowrunner (which are off-the-grid mercenaries, basically.) and you had like one guy you usd to run with that's at all relevent to the rest of the story. It makes me think of Fallout: New Vegas, and that's a good thing to be reminded of.When the first fight happens there's a page where you can read through all the rules of combat, and while that may seems overwhelming at first, you can honestly just read about Action Points, where everything is in the UI, and cover. Cover is important. From there, anyone who has decent cognitive function and has played a videogame before can figure it out as they go, because the game isn't going to punish you early for not quite knowing what you're doing yet.The greatest thing about the game is the story and writing. It's a well put together mystery that starts out seeming pretty simple, but get deeper and deeper as you go further into the rabbit hole. As for the writing, I continually noticed how good it was throughout the whole thing. Each loading screen, while they can take a long time at certain parts, has a well-written set of paragraphs to set the mood of the place you're about to go to. Each character is believable, many are likeable (my personal favorite is Mr. Kluwe), and all are well-written.The game is linear as opposed to open-world, but it works. It's structured like a tabletop RPG campaign, because that's what Shadowrun is/was. While I figured that out a ways in, it didn't feel restrictive like some linear stories are. That could just be a personal thing, but hey, this is about my experience with the game.One of the biggest problems with the game is that the main campaign is short, especially for a cRPG, which are usually quite long and expansive games. Shadowrun: Returns is meant to be, at least as far as I can tell, to be an engine from which to run your own campaigns, like how DMs in tabletops like D&D do, because, again,  that's what Shadowrun is/was. However, I have personnally yet to find a campaign from the workshop that I really like. After playing through Dead Man's Switch (the main campaign that comes with the game) all the community produced campaigns feels sub-par or mediocre. I suppose that should be expected when comparing something made by a professional development team to something made by one guy and is for free. Still, it does impact the staying power of the game.I got this on sale for 5 bucks a while back. As of this writing, it's like 80% off, at 3 dollars or something. It is definately worth that price. Overall, this is one of the most satisfying video game purchases I've made in a while. If you want an arbitrary number out of number rating, I'll give it a solid 8/10.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a modern take on an old genre we haven't seen much of recently. You might be familiar with the world of Shadowrun. I wasn't before playing this. It's one of the coolest and most well realised fictions I've seen in a while. The writing here is impeccable and will likely make you wish there were more games set in this universe. There's no voice acting, so get ready to read, but I found the world so engaging it wasn't an issue.The combat has taken some ideas from old-school games and some from modern ones like XCOM. It works very well and has deep character trees and customisation options. With the exception of a massive difficulty ramp on the last mission, the combat is quite intriguing.The real strength of this game will likely be in whatever the modding community decides to do with it. The whole thing is just a module launcher similar to Neverwinter Nights. You could tell endless stories within this frame.			"

												Just to be clear, this is not the second coming of Baldur's Gate.  I'd love to go off on a rant regarding the relative merits of both games, but I suppose only that one fact needed to be addressed.  Avoiding spoilers, I can at least say that all missed opportunities in Shadowrun Returns made me better appreciate what the old classic of tabletop-to-computer gaming did right.With that said, I still recommend Shadowrun Returns as a well crafted experience as long as expectations are kept realistic. Made by a relatively small team with (relatively) limited resources, the potential that shines through this game makes me excited for upcoming projects, despite some sloppy execution and limited story.  The fact that they provided all the editor tools and the campaign level design files is also really neat, and there is a strong user community around custom content creation.			"

XCOM: Enemy Unknown style combat meets a great RPG filled with a cast from metahumanity's worst to its finest, with enough snark to make a room filled with hard-boiled, collar-propped detectives shiver. To be fair, areas or 'levels' themselves are linear, but each offers different ways to get past trouble; clubbing your way through, persuading a bystander to pitch in or hacking your way into networks can all help out. The game's worth a good look at the very least.			"

												In a sentence: a tactical noir murder mystery set in the Shadowrun universe. I loved playing the tabletop game in the 90s but it took me a long time to buy this since the last LAST Shadowrun game was so horrible (okay, it wasn't bad as FPS go but that completely defeated the purpose of setting it in the Shadowrun Universe). I'm not all the way finished with the main quest yet but have been immensely enjoying this game, both for the way the plot falls out (if a little predictably) and for the nostalgia of character building and the fun of the universe. I'm not really sold on the tactical combat -- it's never been my thing -- and even on easy mode I've had more than a few wipes. I also get a little frustrated when hiring runners because I'd like more control over the party and party skills (though it's possible that might come later? I hope?). Still, the game was definitely worth the money during the Steam sale and just the five hours I've played so far made me go ahead and buy the expansion too.			"

It isn't very challenging and seems to get a bit repetitive.  Overall, I really did enjoy the game and it is well worth the money.  I bought the expansion as well.  It is better.

												One of the best, most immersive games I played this year. Do your self a favour and get the Dragonfall ""DLC"" (it's more like a whole new Shadowrun game) too. It takes the concept to a whole new level. Absolutely loving it! Don't buy this if you hate reading though :p			"

												So, the Shadowrun world is entirely new to me.  I never played the SNES Shadowrun game, and I definitely didn't know until recently that Shadowrun started out as a Dungeon and Dragons style table top game in the late 80's/early 90's.  Only a few minutes into the game, I could tell that this is a well developed universe, one that could be better appreciated by those who have been involved in the Shadowrun lore for years.  Not to say I'm not impressed.  Like I said, I'm completely new to this world.  But that's what makes this game immediately addicting.  It has it's own world and immediately pulls you right into it.  Yes, you can feel like a foreigner at first, but not for long.  The game starts when you receive a message from an old friend, Sam Watts, who pre-informs you of his death through a video message which is sent to you upon his death.  Your mission is to investigate who killed him and find out who this ""Ripper"" character is.  As you investigate Sam Watts murder, you get pulled more and more into the underground world of Shadowrun, discovering more of the secrets of Sam Watts, as well as the other characters you meet.For me, I enjoy a good RPG.  Typically, I have trouble getting into turn based RPGs anymore.  Despite that this game is turn based, there is a strategy element that gives it more depth.  You're not just attacking, healing, and casting magic.  You have to anticipate the movements of your enemies and use your surroundings to your advantage.  There is also a bit of a puzzle element, too, as you must search your surroundings and use items to get past certain areas.Shadowrun is a nice blend of fantasy with cyberpunk.  I wish I could have emersed myself in this universe before, but I feel fortunate that I can experience it for the first time.  So even if you are not already familiar with Shadowrun, I suggest downloading this game.  It will definitely keep you hooked for hours.			"

												Have you been looking at it? Has it got your attention? Are you wondering whether or not this is worth twenty dollars? DO IT. XCOM: Enemy Unknown style combat meets a great RPG filled with a cast from metahumanity's worst to its finest, with enough snark to make a room filled with hard-boiled, collar-propped detectives shiver. To be fair, areas or 'levels' themselves are linear, but each offers different ways to get past trouble; clubbing your way through, persuading a bystander to pitch in or hacking your way into networks can all help out. The game's worth a good look at the very least.			"

												Well, I have to say I'm glad to be able to change my thumbs-down review of Shadowrun Returns to thumbs up. The fix for save files has been working fine for me with some flaws, but you will decide for yourself if this suits you fine or you might get DRM-free version that appearantly doesn't have these problems... I've used several different solutions and my own experiments to come up with the fix that works.So, this is my story with Shadowrun. I saw a few promotional posters here and there. Nothing more. Then one day, a good buddy of mine gifts me Shadowrun Returns and Shadowun Dragonfall. I didn't touch any of these in a long time because my reviewing and gaming queue was really choke full. But one fateful night I decide to check out the playing order of Shadowrun games and I install this one. After creating my character, I've found myself in my smelly apartment wiith a dead friend asking for help. And I immediately fall in love. TOTALLY.Shadowrun universe is one of the best I've encountered in a long time. This clash of tech and fantasy was something I even dreamt of writing about myself (until I've realized it's been done before and better). When I've figured out there are BOOKS out there about Shadowrun world... I nearly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my pants and figured out I'll die happy. You will be entering the strange cyberpunk retrofuturistic world filled with noir style crime mysteries, corporate thrillers and technology ruling the flesh. The storyline and game itself is fairly linear, but it made me care more about roleplaying - there's never a dull moment and nobody asks you to milk the cow (read: nonsensical sidequests) when you're in the middle of exciting main mission. That way you truly feel like you're doing something important. Battle system is similar to that one seen in XCom games (turn based combat), and RPG system is decent and effective, making you care how you distribute your Karma points.The only true problem I had with Shadowrun Returns on Steam is the fact that at certain point I've started having major problems with save files - to cut the story short, game stops recognizing your saves. By doing this, you will be able to play the game, but Steam time tracking will not work. If you're into tracking your time (as much as I am), you can always run a Steam edition of the game beside second one. I am playing on Windows 7 64bit. I am not responsible for any accidents or nuclear meltdowns caused by copying and pasting. BACK EVERYTHING UP.If you all of a sudden get greyed out CONTINUE button and you are not able to load your game, try this.1. Go to C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Harebrained Schemes\Shadowrun Returns\Saves and copy all the files. These are your save files. COPY THEM. 2. Go to your Steam folder. There, find the following folders \userdata\YOURPERSONALNR\234650 . Inside 234650 folder you will see two folders, one named Local, the other named remote. Back those up, just in case. You're bound to find some save files in these folders, but sometimes it's not the case. Now, paste AppData/Local... save files to both of these folders. If system asks you to overwrite, overwrite.3. Now, most people say you need to restart Steam and start it in admin mode. This may help you once, just as it helped me, but then you'll encounter greyed out buttons again. The way I made my saves work is that I ran my game directly by clicking Shadowrun.exe from \Steam\steamapps\common\Shadowrun Returns.Pros: your save games work.Cons: no Steam overlay, no time tracking.I would usually not lose this much time to figure things out, but Shadowrun is SO GOOD and when I heard Dragonfall and Hong Kong are even better... oh, happy times!!!

												I've just finished the second one of these game 'Dragonfall' and intend to start the third straight away later tonight! These games offer so much to the player who likes a 'story'. If your an impatient conversation/cutscene clicker then simply DONT buy these games, you will get so little from them! But if you like to get your teeth into a decent storyline, turn based combat and a polished product then these games may well serve you well. The Shadowrun universe is compelling and interesting. It's not your run of the mill fantasy/sci fi fair, it's rich deep and complex and the PDF that comes with this first game goes quite a way into giving you some of the details. Again this is for people who like to delve and read lore, those who care about backstories and where their characters will be adventuring. The graphic style of the game I think is perfect! The detailed world is welcoming, it draws you in and the art team have done so well in bringing the Shadowrun World to lfe. It's hand drawn feel adding to its charm. Character progression is good, although a little linear feeling, in that like most games nowadays you need to build your characters in certain ways to really get the most out of them. That said theres plenty of different ways to build your character and enouigh difference in the classes to keep you interested. I played the first game as a Decker and had plenty to do as I progressed through the game and I played the second as a Rigger and again found the gameplay excellent. The second game is better than the first and theres no requirement to play the first, they are standalone stories but if you were to skip this first game you would be skipping some of the best narrative there is out there today. Harebrained schemes obviously care about their writing because it's very profesional, head and shoulders above most similar games out there. The game isn't perfect. It's short (which can be forgiven as a first foray into a new universe - the second is MUCH longer and even better written, if thats poossible.) and it has anoying ommisions of functionality that we come to expect as game players.  You cant for example swap out inventory items between team mates, often leading to frustration because wanted items are passed to your 'stash' rather than simply handing them to another team member who has room for them! An odd choice of how to do things that sadly made it into the second game too!Aside from some other small niggles I find it hard to say bad things abaout this game, and its sequel Dragonfall because I had so much fun playing them.Do yourself a favour, buy them! TL:DR - This game is not for you.  "

												This was the Shadowrun I wanted when I couldn't get *into* it back on the SNES. The story is deep but easy to get into, and while the engine feels sluggish, four hours in my first sitting is an excellent indicator of how engrossing this world is. I've heard it described as the 'weakest' of the rebooted series, but that is only a testament its success.What's fun:- Intelligent, thoughtful and entertaining writing- Fantastic character design and visual astectic- Thematic, moody music that is unintrusive- Dresden- Combat is fluid and engaging- Smooth difficulty curve with a storyline around which you are the focusWhat's not fun:- The interface is very bsaic; getting the job done and requiring more of a learning curve than the gameplay- Cover based combat is introduced without any guide- Shopping can be confusing as you can't see what's in your inventory at the same time (a feature in RPGs since the early 90s)The 'not fun' aspects are very minor quibbles as I easily found the patience to learn the system. It's nice to see a game that doesn't insult its playerbase, as games often do. Having to remember and/or double check your inventory before purchases is hardly a chore.Any fan of cyberpunk and fantasy needs to give this one a try, and it can be had quite affordably via various bundles online.What are you waiting for?

												I just finished this game. Considering it was a kickstarter project for a game made in a old PnP setting that been pretty much dead as far as I know, they done a decent job. The setting itself is interesting. Steampunk with elves and trolls. The gameplay is turnbased and the perspective is isometric. What I think was the good parts is as said the setting, the world itself feels very interesting. Turn based and isometric is also a nice touch to see but more games been doing that of late. Someone changing it up from all the third person action oriented RPGs of late. The graphics are not top notch tripple A high budget but it got its own charm anyway. The bad sides to me is how short it is and the lack of exploration. The game is pretty linear. But from my understanding it is pretty much like the old Neverwinter Nights campaign, a tool to show what the toolset can do and what kind of things any player can create.If I would grade it I would give it somewhere between 6,5 to a 7 out of 10. Which is above average! With todays corrupt gaming journalism and inflated grade systems, this might look like a bad grade but it is really above average. Which is a good thing.			"

												So, after many breaks, I finally finished this game.I suppose up front I should say I don't have nearly enough time for games as I used to.  So being able to actually finish an RPG in around 10 hours was a very enjoyable experience.  Not every RPG needs to be epic, you know?  I don't remember what I paid for this, I think I got it in a Humble Bundle, but $15 seems about right for this.Now I'm not familiar with Shadowrun at all.  But this game did a good job of easing me in.  The world building was relatively minimal, and didn't hold things up too horribly.  In fact, I think the world building was appropriately spread out and well integrated into the game.  No audio logs you listen to while doing other things in this game.  Or worse, audio logs you listen to unable to do anything else.  I'm looking at you Mass Effect.I perhaps could have used a bit more of a combat tutorial.  I didn't realize until halfway through the game that I could overwatch, or that I could command my guys in any order I wanted.  But perhaps I should have Read The ♥♥♥♥ing Manual instead.  On second glance, there doesn't appear to BE a manual...Combat did start to get a bit repetitive towards the end.  Equipment wasn't too glamorous either.  But I think my biggest complaint is that I never got attached to any of the hirelings you can get.  Well, except for Coyote.  But for the most part, your team will just consist of a rotating cast of randos, with maybe a story required NPC.  It really hurt my engagement in the somewhat stale combat.  I had my guy, who I cared about, and then 3 bags of meat.That being said, at the end of the day I really enjoyed this game.  It took me a few months to stop being distracted by other games and actually finish this one.  The reptitive combat may have contributed to that.  But the story was interesting enough to keep me coming back.  And the story really does wind and twist through some interesting nooks and crannies.  Probably the strongest aspect of this game, aside from the generally creative setting.Probably not the strongest recommendation, but it's still a recommendation all the same.			"

												A decent game. The plot meanders, but it's a pretty quick, fun little jaunt. The turn based combat is good, but the balance is iffie. It's not a Divinity: OS by any means, but it's well worth the 10 hours of your time to play it, provided you get it on a price that is comensurate. The worst part of the game is the inclusion of known degenerate Chris Kluwe as a non-playable character. I personally don't like the idea of child molesters being able to buy kickstarter characters in games, but what can you do?			"

												I do recommend this game. Warning though...This is an old school roleplaying game, set in a classic pen and paper RPG background, and it is focused on two features : nice writing/storytelling and nice turn by turn tactical combats. That's it.The two of them are great, especially the writing. You could say the art direction is somewhat strange but interesting, as every piece of level art is actually painted by hand. The mix of 2D and 3D works good enough.But good tactical combats, funny art and great writing doesn't exactly cut it. The hidden strengh of Shadowrun Returns lies in its Editor. The first campaign is actually a (very nice and long) showroom for the level editor. Very good content has already been made by the community and it is far from over. This is a cyberpunk-ish roleplaying game that keeps on giving.If you're not into User Generated Content and Steam workshop, you might want to wait until it gets cheaper. If you're into roleplaying games, if you know the shadowrun universe, or if you crave to create your own stories, just buy the damn game already!			"

												This is a Cyberpunk style Turn-based RPG game as it is labeled, but beyond that, it is actually a 'detective' game with fantastic writing and in-depth futuristic settings.You follow the wish of your deceased buddy to investigate a simple murder but somehow stumble upon a tremendous conspiracy threatening all mankind behind this.The gameplay is basically linear, and often you won't find too many stuff to interact with, So I wouldn't recommend this game to Sandbox RPG lovers. But believe me, if you play this game, you would feel like you are actually reading an amazing novel with complicated plots and descriptive details.9/10 would name my Character after my daughter again.

												I'm impressed with Shadowrun Returns. While the core adventure may seem brief to some (roughly 12 hours of continuous play), the ambience is reminiscent of the old pen-and-paper Shadowrun I played so long ago and adored. Furthemore, there seems to be a respectable, growing listing of user-built content and adventures, free to download here under Steam Workshop.  Most surprising to me is that SR runs smoothly at 1366x768 resolution on my old 2009 Dell Inspiron 1545 laptop running Ubuntu 12.04, with only a mere integrated Intel GMA 4500MHD; Intel Core 2 Duo (2.0 GHz x 2), 2 Gb RAM DDR2 800Mhz.

Walking around can be a bit tedious, and the healing especially is obnoxious, which can lead to a bit of frustration. They should have gone for a system more like the old Fallout style, with more granular action points. The story is also way too linear for my liking.

												So I've had a few people ask me what I think of the game so I thought I would right a review. I have not finished the game at the time of writing this. So far I am enjoying it. While I know about the Shadowrun franshise others my not. This game plays alot like X-com but with a Deux Ex feel to the world.  It is a Cyberpunk D&D setting. Graphics are good, I haven't had any problems with bugs, the story so far is good. I haven't figured it out yet but I am starting to put things together. Replayablity should be good with having 5-6 class's and races to pick from. At the $5-$7.50 range Its worth picking up if your working with a small bugdet.UPDATEI finnished the story took 24 hours, I play slow I would say its about 8-12 hours for normal speed. Overall It was worth the $5 though the real Gem has turned out to be the DLC, the story and world is alot more fleshed out, new EQ more side quests I would say pick it (the DLC) when its in the $7.50-$10 range.

												Shadowrun Returns is a beautiful re-launch of the Shadowrun universe on PC. It's predecessor on console while good, was a little rough around the edges, and I feel that Returns has really stepped up to the plate to make the playability more seamless to the gamer.The plot for this game is masterfully crafted leaving little or no detail not mentioned through the dialogues with characters or the descriptions. The gameplay feels very much like a session of tabletop as you wind your way through dialogue options and will then quickly become a turn based strategy when there are bullets to be fired.I whole-heartedly recommend this game to any fan out there of Sci-Fi, tabletop, Strategy/RPG games, or simply Shadowrun in general.

												Shadowrun Returns brings the Sixth World triumphantly back to the video game medium. While the setting has always enjoyed a cultish, global fanbase, this game offers strangers to it a chance not only to get a solid feel for its essence, but also to enjoy an all-around good game. The fruits of the Shadowrun Returns kickstarter have been sweet indeed, and new updates keep making them even sweeter. From veteran runners of the pen & paper or console shadows, to anyone looking to enjoy a nice indie game brought into being by the hopes, donations, and hard work of many -- I highly recommend this fun and celebrated game.

												Best game of this kind since Fallout series .Interesting story line (a bit to much to read at the beggining but than action takes over) and brilliant soundtrack.Graphics is well detailed with touch of cartoo-nish style but not to much ;very pleasent to an eye .The mixure of magic and science fiction combines brilliantly alongside with colorfull characters ,weapons ,and spells.What I like the most in Shadowrun Returns is the ability to jump into ""Matrix"" where you can fight programs and systems to get control over important data .There is also very interesting feature worth to mention :ability that helps you send found items straight to your stash no matter where you are .A lot of diferent skills ,weapons ,armor ,and...of course Cyberweare!!!Go and get this game ,it's awesome ;you gonna love it :)Dan.

												Turn based tactical rpg by a somewhat inexperienced studio, i still enjoyed this one. Closest thing to  Shadowrun pen and paper so far with room to grow. Regarding the initial campaign many people consider it a mixed bag. Story was mostly well done, tone of the setting was excellent, character developement was good, though some skills such as decking not utilized to their full potential in this initial campaign. A bit short. Overall i enjoyed it for what it is. A decent first effort at bringing back e shadowrun rpg. An editor is included and community content is available at varying stages of finish. An expansion is on the near horizon that fixes the save system( from current checkpoint system to new anywhere save)  and ought to expand the gameplay and campaign linearity. Curious to see what gets built on this foundation.edit 6/16/14;  having played through the dragonfall expansion i felt the need to add that it is an improvement over the base game in most every way. such as party members able to use their own skills to make skill checks now, and improved cohesive story, and somewhat more open campaign. i highly recommend  checking out dragonfall as well, or at least the reviews of it. something to consider when purchasing this.

												Catfood everyone?A great game that captures the great things about Shadowrun, the ambiance, the lingo, the deep backstory, the crazy world.  It also does you a favour and hides most of the complex RPG game mechanics.  Both the original adventure and the DLC Dragonfall are challenging.  Really challenging, frequently turning your whole party into catfood after one minor tactical mistake.Highly recomended for pen and paper RPG types looking for a good fix and for vetran shadowrunners of all ages.

												I want more games like this, and definitely more in the Shadowrun universe.Shadowrun. Do you know Shadowrun? ... I'm not a nerdified loremaster, and certainly not qualified to make absolute statements, but from what I know Shadowrun is one of the largest RPG-Fiction-Universes ever created. It started out as  a Pen & Paper roll playing game with a nice, not overly-complicated mechanic and, which is the important thing, a really really cool setting. The whole Shadowrun universe is awesomely extensive, there exist around 50 or such novels about it aswell. To put it short: it's kind of a combination of William Gibson's Cyberpunk (Neuromancer, Biochips, Cyberspace, Mona Lisa Overdrive ...) and J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy fiction (The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings). So, it's some moderate Sci-Fi (no laser guns or energy shields) intermingled with magic fantasy (Elves, Dwarves, Orcs... and pretty much every other creature you can think of). Now, about the game... It's a turn based tactical combat game. The gameplay system is easy to grasp and usually doesn't eat as much time as other games with a similar gameplay concept sometimes do (the new X-Com for example). Graphics aren't breath-taking but entirely sufficient since most of the game really happens in the text based storytelling and interaction. Which get's me to the interesting part, the game's main story is really quite awesome, it's really been a while since I've seen a story as awesome as this one. The writing is entirely perfect, extremely immersive and complex, everything fits your characters race and gender, which in many other games is sadly neglected, and I've found like two typos in the whole game.The game's atmosphere is rather dark, slums, gang-criminality, ruthless megacorporations and political apathy give a perfect backdrop for the story.The game features an editor for custom campaign creation (there's a steam Workshop for it), which adds theoretically infinite replayability to it. Options for importing characters from campaign to campaign enable players to create characters with all-maxed out stats, if they so desire. Options for equipment progression are quite limited -> 'at-the-moment' <-. A pretty extensive add-on for the game (Shadowrun-Returns: Dragonfall) has been announced and is due to be released in early 2014. There is also an MMO Shadowrun game (Shadowrun-Online) in the tube, which I would recommend to check out aswell.(PS: If anyone is interested in reading any of the above mentioned novels by William Gibson and/or J.R.R. Tolkien I explicitly recommend getting original english language prints, as the translations I've read for books of both authors really missed out on a lot of things.)			"

												If you're a fan of the tabletop you should find at least a bit of pleasure out of this, if in nothing but the character creation. The included scenario is fun, but doesn't demand much replay, and while there is plenty of player generated content the basic premise can get old pretty fast. (Visit fixer, get qeust, kill baddies, return to fixer, repeat) Combined with the pretty hefty load times when going from zone to zone it can make the game drag. I'm still a fan of the franchise though, so fanboy as I am I'd still reccomend it.			"

												Excellent tactical RPG with a strong focus on story. Tons of skills, abilities, and weapon types to choose from allow for a good level of replayability, especially if you get the Dragonfall DLC (also recommended!) but there are some fun user-generated campaigns in the workshop too, though most still need some rounding out. Mix and match from weapon-focused skills like swords, thrown weapons like shurikens or grenades, pistols, rifles, and SMGs as well as magical abilities from fire and lighting to summoned spirits or chi attacks, or go with a more technological approach and use drone allies or hack computer, turret, and camera systems or even enter the digital Matrix to fight AI programs with your own.

												DRAGONFALL analysis:Pros:- Great story- Immersive setting- Interesting characters- Nice, strategic, turn-based combatCons:- The game does not explain anything to you. For example, there are these ley lines things on the ground, that somehow improve magical abilities. However, the game does not explain this to you, and nor does it say HOW your magic is improved. This is just an example, because you have to pretty much figure everything out by yourself here.- The NPCs don't cover every role/class possible (like in games such as Dragon Age). This is actually not a big deal, but I started the game as a Shaman (summoner/support mage), only to find that the game already provides you with one, but not with a damage-oriented mage. You can hire some mercenaries to fill those roles by paying cash, but I don't think this solves the problem.- The items/spells systems are not clear and have some pretty big flaws, and as I stated before, nothing is explained to you.Two examples: 1) You can by spells/armor for yourself, but not for your companions, but no one tells you that. At the same time, you can buy consumables for them. 2) If you equip an ally with a consumable before a mission, the item will be lost after the quest, even if you didn't used it.Even if its flaws, I must reccommend this game for anyone who's fond of turn-based strategy games (it plays a bit similar to XCOM) or who likes a game with great story. Just be sure to read a guide or something before playing.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a science fantasy turn based tactical role-playing game developed and self-published by Harebrained Schemes. It takes place in the Shadowrun campaign setting from the science fantasy tabletop role-playing game. This is the first in the line of games that Harebrained Schemes done for Shadowrun. If you liked the Pencil and Paper RPGs  (Shadowrun, Cyberpunk 2020, Gurps Cyberpunk), cyberpunk themed games and playing turn-based single player campaign games, you might love this game.It has a game editor for making new missions that the community been using to improve it with and to extend the life of the game. Go through the Workshop and subscribe to the large selection of community made campaigns. It comes with the HBS campaign called The Dead Man's Switch.You play a character that can hire others to his team and do a mission.  You control the actions of each member of the team. While gameplay is mostly linear, some small amount of exploration is possible while completing objectives. The player can enter into dialogue with various characters, with different statistics and skills giving new dialogue options.See wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_Returns for more info and spoillers.for more info:

												An authentic-feeling Shadowrun experience, clearly crafted with love and care, with satisfying plot and gameplay mechanics. About the only problem is that it's rather short, but if you can see your way around that, then it's well worth full price.Dragonfall is similar, in a sense, but it's a much heavier game and seems a lot more demanding of a player than the core campaign; the core campaign is simple, straightforward and nothing tricky. Dragonfall puts you in slightly more ""authentic"" RPG scenarios that might require a little more thought or effort to succeed in.			"

												The first section of this review is regarding the Dragonfall DLC campaign, as of originally writing this review, I had not touched the original Dead Man's Swtich campaign, so keep that in mind when reading. Theres a second section that covers Dead Man's Switch.DragonfallTo start, it's a good game. A really good one. It feels like a CRPG from over a decade ago, and I say that in the best way possible. It honestly feels like it could have been made by Troika, and I say that in both a good and bad way.What do I mean by ""both a good an a bad way""? Well, the game has some good writing, genuinely interesting characters, and a sold cobat system. The game is also buggy, but not so much that it's game breaking.When speaking of a the combat system, we're looking at a very XCOM esque sort of feel complete with grid-based movement and overwatch for helping to keep areas locked down. You'll likely often find yourself moving your characters from cover to cover while pushing forward and taking down enemies. The combat system works on a cooldown system for abilities, in which once an ability is used, it cannot be reused for X number of turns. All in all, the game actually offers satisfying tactical RPG experience complete with guns, magic, and swords. In terms of the bugs well, here's a few examples. At one point in the game I had a set of side objecties. Those objectives disappeared from my mission log, which from my expericne, shouldn't happen, but fortunately that did not prevent me from completing those side objectives and getting the payout from them. At another point in the game, a character I was talking to repeated dialogue from earlier on in the game when I spoke to her. It seemed clear that that piece of dialogue should not have been spoken, as it completely went against the more recent gdialogue I had just had with her (as in, literally seconds before). Also, not really a bug, but movement can be finickey if you want to move a charater to a tile behind another character, since the game will generally select the other character rather than move the one you wanted to move.Writing is... pretty subjective obviously, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. I really liked all of the characters, I found converstations interesting, I liked learning about the past of my companions, and I liked watching them grow as I continued to run with them. The chararacter aren't exactly super dynamic, as there'll never be huge changes  in their personality, but still, as you converse with them, you can tell they're growing, which is actually more than I can say for quite a few other titles in the genre. The game also offers a number of superficial choices, in that you can't actually alter the course of the story, but it will still give you feedback about the effects of your decisions in terms of the world around you, so while it doesn't change the storyline, it still feels like it has an impact. Aside from that, doing things one way over another may provide more karma (experience) or money.In any case, I bought the game on sale, so betwen the original title plus the Dragonfall DLC, I ended up spending around 15 USD, and it was most certainly worth that and more. That said, $30 might be a little steep if you're only interested in Dragonfall, as it's not actually all that long (longer than the original campaign from what I'm told, and just better all around), but then again, it might not be, because it really is good. I'll add to this review after running Dead Man's Switch I suppose, but bottom line is: Dragonfall is a fantastic campaign that's well worth paying for and playing.Dead Man's SwitchI might as well start by saying that yeah, it's pretty much worse than Dragonfall in every way possible, but still decent. The writing is Dead Man's Switch is far less compelling to be frank. The characters aren't as interesting, they never really appear to gorw, and you don't really interact with them, or even the world very much. It's a very much guided experience that sort of just shuffles you from level to level as the story unfolds. I feel that my most major problem with the storyline is that I find it pretty much impossible to make a connection to any of the characters since you don't really get to interact with them much. Honestly, I'd say that if you're going to get Shadowrun Returns, get it for Dragonfall and think of Dead Man's Switch as an extra campaign despite the fact that Dragonfall is DLC which you'll have to pay for. Dead Man's Switch is nothing to really write home about, so if you get the game, you should really get the DLC. If you're more interested in the user-generated content or the combat system, the base game still has that going for it of course.			"

												This is a game where I wish there was a third option between ""recommend"" and ""not recommend"". But I guess I am engaged with the game enough to keep playing it, so I am going the ""recommend"" route.To begin with, this game is my introduction to the Shadowrun IP. I never played the tabletop RPG, nor any of the other related video games. And really, this particular blend of genres doesn't really do it for me. If you don't know, in the world of Shadowrun, magic and fantasy-type races typical in most fantasy (orcs, trolls, elves, dwarves) genres have ""re-awakened"" in a futuristic, cyberpunk setting. So basically, you've got elves casting spells alongside cyborgs hacking their way through cyberspace. For me, this is just a mashup that I don't find that intriguing, though I can see how some might think it's really cool. So then, what pulled me in to trying out this RPG with turn-based combat? I guess it was the beautiful visuals of the isometric maps. The game world is very pleasingly portrayed in great detail.Unfortunately, you can't interact with much in the game world except for certain areas (hotspots denoted by various icons) where you need to search for plot-specific items that you need to advance the story, or when you need to talk to someone, or open a door. And here I'll point out one of the minor technical gripes I have with this game. Sometimes when I try to click on one of these interaction icons (to open a door, for example) the game doesn't respond to the click. It seems like it happens when my character is moving from one point to another. If my character is in motion, then clicking on a ""open door icon"" isn't going to work most of the time until the character stops moving. Minor nuisance, I guess.The other thing I don't like about the game is the inventory system, which I find confusing.There is only so much stuff that you can carry and so you have a stash for anything you don't currently have equipped. However, when going on a mission, you usually have one or more other characters going with you and they each have their own inventories. However, sometimes in the game, it seems like these other characters have their own stashes, but it's not clear to me how to access their stashes. Furthermore, when you go to hire these other characters in your party, you have to commit to the team you've just hired and then embark on the mission. You can't hire your team and then go buy equipment for them. You have to by all the weapons, health packs, spells, fetishes, etc. BEFORE you hire your team but then, how are you going to know which gun, for example, will be most effective with which team member when you haven't hired your team yet to look at their stats. Even when I have tried to buy ahead of time for team roles I am going to hire, when I get to the ""loadout"" screen before embarking on a mission, I try to equip these things on various characters, and then either don't show up (presumably because the character isn't skilled enough to use the item) or they are incompatible with some other item that the character already has. But there is not enough information provided to the player to know what spells, items, etc are or are not compatible with which characters.Here's an example, I bought some grenades and when I tried to equip them on my shaman, I got this message that said that the item I was trying to quip was not compatible with the level 5 summon elemental spell the shaman already had equipped? Uh, why exactly? I have no idea.Not to harp on the inventory problem too much, but here is another example. My character is a decker (a hacker class) and I have leveled up to where I can use better decks(like a portable hacking keyboard or laptop) that hold more ESPs (Expert Systems Programs) and other programs to help me hack in cyberspace. But I have never been able to figure out how to get those programs that I buy from my stash INTO my deck. So I usually end up hacking in cyberspace without any of these useful aids.So other than the beautiful graphics, I have to say that the writing is pretty good in this game. The character dialog makes the characters have their own personalities, and their motivations are usually clear. The load times between ""areas"" of the game can feel long at times, but there is usually some good flavor text that gives you some setting and atmosphere for the area you are entering. The story is pretty engaging and starts out as a story about bringing your friend's murderer to justice, but through some twists and turns ends up in the familiar, ""save-the-world-from-some-evil-from-beyond"" territory.The turn-based combat is also pretty good and implements a cover system. You have plenty of options when it comes to fighting: melee (fists, bats, swords), ranged (pistols, machine guns, grenades), AoE attacks (some spells and grenades), and buffs and debuffs (in the form of spells or various drug-like substances). Shamans can summon elementals to fight for them, but at a risk. These summoned pets might decide to rebel against their masters and then you have one more enemy on the map to fight.So even though I have some gripes about this game, I guess overall I would recommend it for those who like isometric RPGs with turn-based combat. I am not sure if fans of Shadowrun will think this game does the IP justice or not, but to me it seems like they would like this game.UPDATED: So here's my final word after finishing ""Dead Man's Switch"". I bought the game for 5 bucks and it gave me 18 hours of basically good gameplay and a good story. But I have no desire to play it again which is a shame because usually with a good RPG, like Skyrim for example, I would want to play it through again trying out a different character which would allow me to experience the story again with a different play style. Also, I have no desire to try out the Dragonfall DLC nor any other player made content that is out there. I guess the game world didn't captivate me enough to make me want to live out other stories within it.			"

												An excellent old-school RPG.  If Fallout had an adventure in a world formed by a collision of Deus Ex and Baldur's Gate, this would be the result.  The base campaign has some flaws, but the Dragonfall expansion is excellent.  You spend as much time talking as you do in combat, so it's a good job the writing is among the best to be found in the genre.			"

												I was a huge fan of Shadowrun for the Sega Genesis, and when I saw this go up on Kickstarter, I was quick to drop money on something I'd always wanted to see more of, and I wasn't disappointed.It's not the kind of game with high action gameplay, but the story runs deep, the threads and arcs are nicely woven, and it's everything I expect from a great game based in the Shadowrun Universe.Remember, watch your back, shoot straight, conserve ammo, and never, ever, cut a deal with a dragon.

												Quick review for Dead Man's Switch+ Deep writing with lots of humor+ Fun combat mechanics+ Nice soundtrack- LinearThe game is a light action-RPG, with combat style similar to Fallout. RPG elements are there to provide some depth, but I found the focus of the game to be more in telling the story. The story is told mainly in text, which I personally liked as it gives room for imagination. The game is linear but as the story is really gripping that did not bother me. Took me about 12h to finish, which was enough to tell the story and not drag for too long artificially.Really enjoyed it! "

												A light strategy action rpg that doesn't hit as hard as it can. It combines fantasy magic, trolls, with technology, guns, hacking, for a cool atmosphere you wish you could spend more time in. The combat is good, uses a cover system and plenty of weapons to attack with from a nice choice of classes to master with a few perks to each.Your character build affects how you can approach situations depending on your strength, decking, and mostly charisma. Choice is limited, though.The story keeps it going but isn't as fantastical as you think it could be. You also don't get all the explainations you want. All the characters are very good for their short cameos in game.Overall, the pieces for something really big are here, it just doesn't flex all it's muscles. Most importantly, I had fun. I was underwhelmed because of my expectations for story but nothing that made me enjoy the game any less.

												Take an old-school, well written, high fantasy, tactical turn-based RPG such as the Black Isle games, completely flip the ""high fantasy"" part on its head and replace with a Cyber-Punk theme that breathes a well-needed blast of fresh air into the genre and you get Shadowrun Returns. The base game and the game mechanics are well realised and will provide many hours of engrossing fun. But the Dragonfall ""dlc"" is nothing short of a masterpiece of story based gaming. 89% for the base game. 97% for Dragonfall. Throw in the fact that the community are getting behind it with some decent free mods and this game becomes an ESSENTIAL purchase for any self-respecting RPG fan.			"

												I love RPGs. But it is very rare for me to finish one. When I think about it, it is mostly because I rarely get really drawn to the story. I usually get bored halfway and leave. Shadowrun Returns is an exception. You start by building your character and the process on its own is so much fun. There are 5 archetypes to choose from and if I am correct, depending on which archetype you are playing, the story ends slightly differently. Once you start the game, you are almost immediately thrown into a battle which will give you a taste of what will come ahead. You have optional and mandatory challenges to finish. I suggest finishing them all. As a turn-based RPG, you are required to think and plan strategically in order to successfully lead your team in battles (a good team composition is important!) and unveil the story.  If you're looking for a fun game with a good story arc, this one is for you. I recommend getting it.			"

												An authentic-feeling Shadowrun experience, clearly crafted with love and care, with satisfying plot and gameplay mechanics. About the only problem is that it's rather short, but if you can see your way around that, then it's well worth full price.Dragonfall is similar, in a sense, but it's a much heavier game and seems a lot more demanding of a player than the core campaign; the core campaign is simple, straightforward and nothing tricky. Dragonfall puts you in slightly more ""authentic"" RPG scenarios that might require a little more thought or effort to succeed in.			"

												See my full review with screenshots and more at http://misstoxia.com/review-shadowrun-returns/If you’re unfamiliar with the Shadowrun universe, it’s set in future earth and incorporates both cyberpunk and fantasy elements. Before now, Shadowrun has been a very popular tabletop game, an action RPG on the Sega Genesis and even a team-based multiplayer FPS.Thanks to Kickstarter, Shadowrun has returned as a traditional isometric-style RPG that plays very similar to the old Fallout games, with combat that feels like it’s out of the XCOM games.Character creation involves choosing your class and race, in the Shadowrun universe you can be a Human, Elf, Troll, Orc or Dwarf, each of which have their own unique restrictions and perks associated with them, for example, Trolls and Orcs tend to make terrible Deckers or Riggers because of the high intelligence required, however they start with more HP and are better at strength-based abilities.Your class choice has a huge impact on how you will be playing the game in combat situations. The classes include;- Street Samurai, master of weapons, both melee and ranged.- Mage, master of magic and magical support.- Decker, master of the matrix (cyberspace).- Shaman, master of the spirits, summoning and magical support.- Rigger, master of mechanical drones and engineering.- Physical Adept, master of unarmed and chi magic.Regardless of which class you choose at the start of the game, you can always later specialize in a different field of skills, your class mostly just affects your starting stats and gear.Gameplay outside of combat is in real time, you control your character by clicking where you want to move or what you want to interact with, if you have companions they will automatically follow you.During combat, the game becomes turn based. Each character in the fight has a certain number of action points they can use during their turn. For example if you have 3 AP you could choose to run to cover, fire a burst of bullets with your SMG and then cast a heal spell on one of your friends.Rather than having a leveling and experience points system, Shadowrun Returns simply rewards players with karma points for completing tasks which they can spend on leveling up their skills.Although Shadowrun Returns is an RPG, it doesn’t quite incorporate all of the elements of freedom that most RPGs have. For example, you cannot go back to areas you have already been or choose what order to do certain tasks in. The main campaign follows quite closely to the story with very few side missions.While on an actual mission you are given a fair amount of freedom in regards to how you accomplish your tasks… will you open the door by jacking into the matrix, battling security programs and finding the door controls, will you fight your way in meatspace to the door switch, leaving a trail of destruction in your wake… or will you simply get your break down the door because you’re a giant troll with ridiculous strength?The game has a lovely soundtrack with a real cyberpunk feel to it. There is no voice acting though, so if you aren’t a big fan of reading dialogue you may find that off-putting.I found the story to be absolutely amazing! It was probably the best story I’ve experienced in an RPG thus far. My only issue is that it ended after 10 hours of gameplay and I felt like I had not fully developed my character yet and that there was still a lot of things I wanted to try. But I suppose 10 hours of gameplay isn’t bad considering the game comes with a built in module/map editor and there are loads of modules on the Steam Workshop.If you’re looking for a more freedom-based experience with this game, I recommend getting the module ‘Shadowrun Unlimited’ from the Workshop.Overall, I really liked this game, it has just about everything I look for in an RPG. It lacks a bit of freedom in the main campaign, but makes up for it with modding tools and DLCs.			"

												I have heard of Shadowrun, and I have played the roleplay game only a couple of times. My friends prefer Vampire or DnD. I played the game with no expectations other than it looked pretty, and I got it on sale. The game had very pretty backgrounds, but the sory was very linear. There were hardly any side missions, and you had to do them as soon as you got them. There was no exploring of the world, which would have been nice. I would have liked to get to know some of the people who were in my party besides Coyote.I liked the character customization part. The fighting style was tactics, which I usually do not like, but Shadowrun Returns did it well. Overall the game was fun, and Dragonfall is supposed to be much better, or at least that is what i have heard. "

It's also worth mentioning that the Dragonfall DLC is also worth picking up. The DLC itself improves in story telling for that campaign over the original one and adds a whole bunch of new goodies. There's also a pretty active mod community, with one group even going so far as to completely remake the old Shadownrun SNES game.

Adds a lot to the storyUse of drone combat is interestingGreat story, and you can see they put effort into the dialog choicesGood character development, you can see how different and unique each character isLots of text -- feels like a story that's interactive, good immersion for the playerSmooth, sensible combat model -- turn based (which I prefer), but never feels slow or clunkyFor some reason, the system won't save the rest of my review.

												All i can say is just wow! very solid turnbased rpg. Don't listen to all those people who keep bashing the game because this wasnt in the table top or that wasnt supposed to be able to... in the table top etc. Their right about one thing IT ISNT THE TABLE TOP VERSION! Instead this is a very enjoyable love letter to the series from a company thats put  a lot of time to making this feel like it could be in the shadow run universe. The character customization alone can  make or break the game for you, seeing how the focus was on gameplay and ability cuztomization rather then visual. But i gotta say i had so much fun with the mage and building my crew and the awesome story that id recommend it to anyonbe looking for a goood rpg, not and i repeat NOT to some one whos looking to see a visual version of the table top. p.s. the visual style of this game is mid blowing!

The ""Dead Man's Switch"" story does a pretty good job capturing the setting, with some nice twists and turns in the plot. And unlike the pen and paper Shadowrun, it doesn't take five days to create a character.			"

												Doesn't work on Linux. I can play about 15 minutes into the game and then it randomly crashes and sends me back to my desktop. Looks fun and I hope they get it fixed soon. Should of never left beta.Edit: Opted in for the beta and they fixed the problem. Thanks devs for getting it fixed.			"

												I didn't realise how much I'd love this game, but it sucked me in good!I loved the old school turnbased action of the game, and the writing and story was just ace. I liked it so much I even downloaded some of the user developed mods for the game, which weren't as good as the original game, but still scratched the itch further.I really hope the devs put out more ""official"" addons.

												Shadowrun returns feels like reading a (good) book.The interaction on top of that gets you involved. Good albeit linear story. I did find the final antagonist a little bit underwhelming though but for a low budget game I can understand the few flaws. Once done I didn't feel like replaying through the story again.Can't wait to play Dragonfall, I hear it's more open than the original. If the gameplay improve on this one it should be good too.			"

												I think this game have gotten some bad reviews.I played the game to the end, and that's unusual for me.I usually stops when I find an exploit, or get bored.The game has a good story, some lovely npc, an at least one good nemesis, even though She gets pretty bleak in the end.What I don't like is, to be lied to, when I bought the game the promised to release, nxt chapter in Nov. And they did not.But on the plus side, they have very good editor. And loads of gamer made stuff is out there. Started to play some, but cant really find, the time to play any. Since I liked the original story. And curious as I am I want to see what's around the bend. "

												Seriously, if you like cyberpunk themed videogames (or cyperpunk in general), this one is for you. The original campaign is ok, but it's not stellar, i felt it needed improvements on a lot of areas (from level design to gameplay). The dragonfall expansion improved a lot of stuff, the characters are more interesting, and also the Berlin is really cool. This is for fans of mature rpgs with lots of choices (most of them aren't that easy), really cool lore and story and engaging gameplay. You can choose the race you want, the features you want, and build the character you like the most. You are given a lot of freedom.The workshop adds a lot to this game, you can find dozens of interesting campaigns, that will keep you hooked for many hours. "

												There are no words for how much I could recommend Shadowrun Returns. It brings back the excellent feel of old isometric view strategy RPGs like Fallout and Wasteland in a modern day, with the Sixth World taking you in and shaping you into a runner. Dead Man's Switch, the base campaign that comes with Shadowrun Returns is a good entrypoint into the Shadowrun world if you have never experienced it before. Unfortunately it lacks in a bit of my favorite aspect, Decking, but it makes up for it in an exciting, well paced story. The expansion, Dragonfall, takes what SR started in Dead Man's Switch and runs with it even further than it went before. Instead of being in the ever used area of Seattle (one that was used in both 16-bit consoles as well as DMS), it takes you to Germany to face off against an Elder Dragon. The best feature of SR is the Steam Workshop. The community has taken Shadowrun Returns and made their own campaigns, their own weapons, skills, anything you can possibly imagine being in the Sixth World. Just, go check it out.			"

												As a Seattle localite I found Shadowrun Returns to be something more than just a game. The atmosphere and art direction is something I know to be familiar; The dark undertones and ice-cold attitude of characters is a dead-on representation of the city I know, whether it be civilians, corporations, police or criminals... The story is immersive, the visual and auditory artwork is spectular and the RPG elements leave little to be desired. Overall Shadowrun Returns is a nearly perfect single player Cyberpunk RPG. In addition to the campaign the Shadowrun Editor provides more gamplay opportunities.			"

												I waited on the berlin expansion to review this game, and I definitely recommend it now.The original campaign, Dead Man's Switch, had a handful of problems at launch that had kept people from being as upbeat about it as they could, but many of those have also been fixed as of the expansion (Weapon balance, save system, bugs). Dead man's switch is a pretty cool campaign, and has a lot of nostalgic throwbacks to the SNES game. It's very Shadowrun Seattle (Megacorps, historic figures, gang control), and a bit short and linear, but still cool. I would give it a 8/10 or so.The Berlin expansion is the most hooked I've been by an RPG in a really long time. The writing is fantastic, the characters are cool, and the world is really fun. The combat isn't quite as polished as say, XCOM, but it's passable and doesn't detract in any way. The flux state (prior to the invasion and second Berlin wall going up) is well depicted, and you become very invested in the stories of everyone living in your block of the anarchists haven.There's much more freedom to approach things differently in the Berlin expansion, and you can take on side missions from the Berlin hub in the order you want, or even skip one or two if you want. It's also a bit longer than Dead man's switch, and features some new weapons. I would give Dragonfall a 9/10, easily.			"

												Turn-based strategy games are having somewhat of a revival the past few years and Shadowrun is a MUST-HAVE for anyone who enjoys turn-based strategic combat. The original comes with one campaign, but to buy the game for the campaign is to miss it's true value: it comes with an editor that allows you to create your own campaigns and it's fairly simple to use. It ships with highly detailed documentation so even if you don't know how to use it out of the box, it only takes 5 minutes of reading the wiki until you're making your own game. When you buy this you're not just buying the box, but a community of game designers with dozens of excellent campaigns and stories to experience. Shadowrun is about immersing yourself in the dark world of a cyberpunk future. It relies heavily on storytelling and it does an excellent job. Expect a wonderful original story, a tool to craft your own, and an opportunity to be part of a community of brilliant writers who make even more campaigns for you to enjoy. With Shadowrun, what you're getting is a community.			"

												If you're a fan of RPGs, Cyberpunk & Noir mixed together with some XCOM: Enemy Unknown tactical combat, then you can pretty much get it all in one package by buying this game. I've personally never played the first Shadowrun, but Returns has me intrigued with its awesome soundtrack of synth-electronic tunes and a few interesting characters. Like in true old-school fashion there's no voice acting, which when it comes down to it, is an afterthought anyway. Good voice acting & Bad voice acting can certainly affect the playability of the story, but If voice acting is a most then you'll find none of it here. This is a game for peeps who are looking for an old-fashioned RPG and I'd say it succeeds at that. Despite its flaws, such as the absence of a save feature in exchange for an auto-save function and rather short length; It's damn good!			"

												You don't see these kind of games that often now a days. The old school classic feel you get with the isometric tactical RPG's from back in the days. Shadowrun Returns brings this back in full force. Great looking artistic graphics, very well written story and game play that is enjoyable. For me this is one of the best games i played all year. And if your new to the Shadowrun series(like me) then this is a good way to start, as each character has a rich story and you get to know pretty much everything about the world in the first hour or so. I can highly recommend you this title if you have the slightest interest in this genre.			"

												Edit: Updated for the newest patch.Shadowrun returns tries *really hard* to be a great game. It's got a great history in tabletop roleplay, and the super nintendo shadowrun might be the most overlooked RPG of all time. The framework is definitely laid to make this one of the best retro gaming experiences of the last few years. Sadly, a lack of attention to detail often holds it back. Simple things, like healing kits in the store before the last fight, have been flat out overlooked or left out. It may be intentional, however there are enough times that it happens that it really feels like the game was slightly rushed. Another great example of this is the decking system. Decking itself is fun, if a bit tedious at times. However, there are 3 missions in the entire game that actually allow you to deck. And the times there are decking quests? One requires you to take an npc along as a sidekick (not bad, all things considered). The next decking mission? The npc *has to* do it, you don't even help. I realize there may be plot reasons, but where it ends up is that there's an entire skill tree that they literally only let you use twice. My first run was a decker, and I got through 3/4ths of the game before I got to actually use the skills I built for. Frustrating doesn't describe it. Another issue is how healing magic only heals the last attack to hit you. Mobs love throwing a big hit, then pinging you for 1 damage. This wouldn't even be an issue, except for the fact that you have limited medkits, and can't force your helpers to pick em up on the fly. Either you get them, or they go to your stash. This isn't an issue in combat mode, but you can't toggle combat mode manually, so if you're out of a fight? Hope you're the medic, because you're the one getting the health packs. Movement can be equally tricky, especially when it starts getting crowded. Misclicks, clicks in wrong places, moving instead of attacking (the worst of the bunch, as it's pretty easy to die if you're not behind cover) are commonplace if you're not careful. Add the ability to manually enter combat mode at any time (so npcs can pick stuff up), or inventory management on the fly, mixed with a bit of an easier way to move to a specific location in a crowd? A lot of my problems would immediately go away.Shadowrun combat is fun and engaging. There's a deep variety of skills and abilities that all influence the battle field in different ways. Mage-based spellcasting feels powerful, especially if you beef yourself up to be able to take a hit (you'll have to) and stand on a ley line. Rigging is a *blast*, if a bit frustrating as they only allow one of each drone type per tier. This means, if you want 2 attack drones? One's gonna suck a bit. Summoning, similarly, is a ton of fun and feels really powerful. They put quite a few free summoning points in the game, it's one of the few ways you can use the environment against your enemy. As for Adepts? They are a bit under-utilized, IMO. Right now they're heavily melee focused, and take a lot of finesse to get full use out of, because you're so skill-thin. Body for HP, Quickness because Dodge, Strength for melee attacks and the attack focus skill, Will for Chi Casting. Late bloomer doesn't describe them, even the supposedly super-awesome npc you pick up near the end isn't all that impressive. And, without spoilers, he's one of the strongest characters in the entire Shadowrun canon.The campaign's difficulty is incredibly well balanced. I was thrilled when even my biggest indestructible troll still had to take cover from time to time, because becoming fully immortal is impossible when your enemies have fully automatic machine guns. Some of the UGC (actually, most of it I've played to this point) doesn't have the same light touch, though, making swapping from the official campaign a pretty steep learning curve. The only real issue with the main campaign is length. It's incredibly short, especially for this style of game. Lots of people lament the fact that it's a fairly linear experience, but I personally enjoyed that. Not every game needs to be a sandbox, and Shadowrun Returns has a very distinct story to tell. Some may feel shoehorned, but I just enjoyed going along for the ride. The writing in the main campaign is *fantastic* and easily the strongest thing about it. They paid a lot of attention to detail, and really worked a lot of the flavor of the shadowrun world into their story. I *love* the big bad, as well. They definitely swung for the fences with the nemesis in dead man's switch. This is a great touch, since I know a lot of us pnp shadowrun players have fond memories of them. As well, major and well known players in the shadowrun universe make cameos, and some may even join your team. There's a great early nod to the snes shadowrun game that really set a great tone. This game pays obvious respect to what came before it. The fact that Jordan Weisman was responsible for this is very apparent in the plot and tone. Also, for those wanting a sandbox style adventure? Dragonfall is very much along those lines.The graphics, as well, are spot on. The game feels fun, and cartoony, and really captures the essence of the shadowrun universe. Hyperkinetic neon and chrome, with a touch of Tolkien fantasy, blend together oddly well. None of it feels out of place. My only qualms about the background art boil down to there not being enough of them, which becomes a problem with UGC as it all starts to look exactly the same. The sprites are also well designed, if a bit generic at times (I'm looking at you, every troll in the game), and the game wouldn't hurt for the option of using different faces/body types. The sound? Meh. The soundtrack is fun at first, but quickly gets repetitive. I tend to turn off the music and put on some industrial while I play, or other music suitable for shadowrun. After the first playthrough, or even the first few hours? You probably will too. UGC... It's the elephant in the room. UGC is a great idea in theory, and supposedly a high selling point for the game. The ability to create your own worlds, and play the worlds other people create, is *fantastic* on paper. And sometimes, it even works in execution. This is seeming to be the exception to the rule. UGC suffers from the same thing it does in most other games that feature it. It's uneven, balance is often lacking, the plots are frequently very weak, and... Well... It was made by the community, with all of the lack of polish that entails. There are a few *strong* exceptions to this rule, but it seems overall like the ones with the great plot lack any semblance of combat balance. As well, and as mentioned, the art assets get rather repetitive. A lot of the UGC just looks cut-and-paste, which is probably because they are. On the upside, sourcebooks from the original pen and paper game being fully converted into the game, and heavily fine tuned. Some of the creators have done a lot of work adding even more customization options, which is *amazing*. The major downfall to UGC is already becoming apparent post-Dragonfall, however. A few of the people responsible for large conversion kits or well known adventures have walked away, because the expansion completely broke their work. It's the same problem the UGC community of the first Neverwinter Nights faced, with every new expansion comes 10-20 hours of work to put your mods back together again.Overall, this game is fantastic. It's got some quirks, but Dragonfall cleaned up a lot of bugs or issues that were once holding it back. This is solid retro gaming. 8/10			"

												I'll get straight to the point:The Good: It's official campaign Dead Man's Switch is pretty good so to speak. The story it has justifies the linearity of the game's design as it's pretty much like reading an interactive book (like some of the older RPGs of the 90s). The game is practically friendly to almost any PC considering that it relies on the cyberpunk aesthetics to make the game look pretty. In terms of combat, it's basically a simplified version of Xcom: Enemy Unknown and if you like that game, you are going to be fairly familiar with how the game works. And even if you are done with the main campaign, there's still more to offer from the community itself through UGCs which can be downloaded through Steam directly or through the Shadowrun Nexus (especially if you own the DRM-free version on GOG) And by the time of this review (which is the same time as when the DLC Dragonfall first came out) you can actually save without relying on the autosave feature. The Bad: Due to the fact that the replayability of this game past Dead Man's Switch (and Dragonfall) is dependent on the UGC of the community, you will probably have to take your time to look for custom campaigns that are actually complete, let alone any good. Most of the complete ones are usually the shortest or the simplest of campaigns. In addition, the Dead Man's Switch campaign doesn't seem to give much options to have a players who want to play a Face or a Decker as they are either very few instances to begin with or doesn't truly payoff. I don't like the fact that I have to actually rely on hiring more runners for a particular mission and they feel restrictive in which you cannot give them suitable gear or even have them hold on to an medkit if your inventory is full. Also, there are certain dialog choices that are greyed out if you don't meet the required stats to qualify. I'd rather have them hidden to keep me surprised. On top of that, I know that the idea behind this game is to make the player the main protagonist, but the problem with that is that this is Shadowrun, and the reason you have a variety of runner archetypes in a team is because you can take advantage of what they are capable of inside and outside of combat. Instead, that variety is only restricted to combat and combat alone save of you being able to appoint a hired/companion decker to hack into the Matrix for you in case you are incapable of such a task.Overall: Shadowrun Returns has it's flaws but I like what Harebrained as treated it so far. It's not an amazing game and it's hardly going to be the ""best RPG EVAR!!!11!"" but if you appreciate a good cyberpunk story with a touch of magic with a potential for more to come whether by the devs themselves through DLC or by the Shadowrun community, then I'd say this is a very safe purchase.

This game was made so modders could create campaigns and stuff.The main story isnt it all, check for more at the Workshop.Did i already say Turn based strategy with a strong RPG layer? ah yes sorry :DIt may not be the most visually appealing game but since i dont care about that. What i need from a game is fun gameplay and replay value and this kind of game offers me just that. For much lower price than those bigger company games.P.S.: i dont work for Harebrained lol.			"

												As a gamer constantly looking for as immersive as possible and varying different experiences, it felt as if I found a gold mine just for myself after 1 hour within Shadowrun Returns. The game runs as half tactic combat, half story. Both are very well made and entertaining, but where the game truly excells is the story. At first I was put off by the lack of voice in the game. Why are the pretty and detailed avatars with excessive and rich language representing the dialogue, entirely silent? I dig around options looking for volume slider, but there was none. Some minutes of gaming later I realized the person who wrote the story, descriptions, and dialogue lines is a pure genious. Reading your way into the world of Shadowrun is like reading a truly well written novel. I really really hope the person behind these texts continues the work in the next Shadowrun game. Thus, the game world is immersive, colourful, rich. There is zero point in spoiling the story, but it should suffice to say that it is very good and that ♥♥♥♥ goes down in unexpected extremely well written ways. The world of the game is not so big, but the way it is presented and through the richness of details you get a sense that it is huge, living, and real, and that there are so many more interesting ""♥♥♥♥ going down"" kind of things going on besides your own story. Sahdowrun's RPG elements are not very deep but fun and engaging enough to encourage even several playthroughs. I would suggest Shadowrun Returns to anyone interested in a truly good story or immersive world, or those who like tactical combat. The game is truly bad ♥♥♥.			"

												I managed to pick this up on a steam sale a while back. My friend suggested I just pirate it because the game wouldn't be worth 15 euro. How wrong he was! I've just come off finishing this entire game in one sitting, and the reason for that is because the game is that good.The game comes with one campaign which is called 'dead man's switch'. This is the campaign the developpers made and is a very good showcase of what you can do in Shadowrun returns. The story sucks you in and the entire realistic atmosphere gives off a gritty blade runner feeling. You actually feel the grime that exists in the world and the parallels to our world are scarily frequent.The gameplay itself is a blast, you play the game using a self constructed avatar which you assign a 'class'. Which can be broken down into a fighter, monk, mage, summoner, hacker and trapper. The game then divides the points into the needed categories and from there you are free to specialise your character how you see fit. This gives you an insane amount of customisation as far as your character is concerned. Besides yourself you can hire help to go along on the runs (missions), you can preview their stats and items before picking them and during the mission you are free to control them as you see fit.The game also contains a lot of dialogue which helps to flesh out the living and breathing world. You sometimes get choices which you feel will have some impact later on along the line, sadly you generally don't see any effect from your choices besides alternate ways of attack something or something being worth more or being more expensive.I suggest anyone to atleast give shadowrun a try, the game is really fun, able to pull you into it's world and the challenge it provides is just right in my opinion. Despite in the last mission the two 'superior' characters being weaker then my own dwarf. ""Reality can be found in the shadows""			"

												The world of Shadowrun Returns is based on the tabletop RPG Shadowrun. As such, the lore is well established and will certainly please many cyberpunk fans. When you purchase Shadowrun Returns, don't expect to be satisfied with ""Dead Man's Switch"", the campaign that comes pre-installed with it. No, you are buying this game in order to run user generated campaigns set in the world of Shadowrun. In my opinion, ""Dead Man's Switch"" is merely a way for the developers to show the capabilities of the game engine and how much you can do with the campaign editor. With that said, ""Dead Man's Switch"" is around 6 hours long and features a rather linear but interesting story. In this campaign, a fellow shadowrunner that you knew hires you to avenge him for a hundred thousand nuyen, through the use of a dead man's switch. You travel to Seattle in order to find the killer and get paid, but as luck would have it, it involves plenty of jumping through hoops. Once you complete the campaign, you'll find yourself wanting more and that can be easily solved through a quick browse in the Steam workshop.			"

												Some folks have noted that the core module ""Dead Man's Switch"" is short and the gameplay is limited. Those are both fair points, but when thought of as a weekend romp through a cyberpunk landscape, Shadowrun Returns is perfect. You're not bogged down learning in-depth combat systems or slogging through tutorials. The game gets off to a snappy start and doesn't stop. The writing is easily the best part in setting the tone even if the graphics won't blow you away. I wouldn't say the story is short so much as not cluttered with filler. Every step is meaningful and that's downright refreshing in an RPG nowdays despite shaving hours off of the game.			"

												4/10I saw this and thought 'Cyberpunk Arcanum', but it's not even close. The engine feels dated, the story is linear, the plot is juvenile, the art is okay, but would have been considered dated in the Fallout: Tactics days. Yeah, it's a beta, and yeah, it's got DLC, but this feels more like a mockup than a beta release. I've bought far better for far less.			"

I played it after playing Dragonfall... [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]...so the reviews will look the same!Finished in about 13 hours, so I will talk very consciously about it. I didn't know it was an indie kickstarted project developed for smartphones and tablets in mind and this explains a lot of cons.First, I would like to talk about the gameplay. Having experience with a lot of RPGs and turn-based games I have been disappointed: percentages to hit seem to be flawed, covering system is ridiculous, inventory is caotic, some combo are overpowered (you'll instakill with rifles and relative stats at 8+), experience points are given not by killing enemies, your party doesn't upgrade, AI always attacks first (resolved in S:HK) and it' also dumb (you can wait for them at corners and instakill with overwatch), you are not given so many possibilities of attacking, you can't use your items outside of combat, you are not given the option of using your teamates abilities in the quests, you have a limited choice of weapons and upgrades, etc.Then, the story: the first hours were nice (I felt like in sci-fi crime scene) but when things started to became interesting... game ended. This is not the only con: 1) Dialogues are scripted, the choices you'll make DO NOT alter the game 2) Skills are useless for dialogues: even when you are given the choice to use them, they just provide a couple of more rows of text to read or just a 20% more money 3) *someone die, so we have to find the culprit* bla bla *turns out all the city is in danger* bla bla  *gear up and go final attack*.Graphics: from the screenshots it seems to be very powerful... it's not. Just colourful.The matrix puzzles are few and could be passed easily. Same as the envinroment puzzles: you just have to search a little around. There isn't enough attention to the gameplay.I enjoyed it? Yes and no. Yes because I like these type of games, no because X-Com, Civilizations, Fallout still stand on a higher level. I would call it a nice time waster. If you are looking for a solid game, you should look elsewhere. Dragonfall is better, but I hope they'll get even better in the next chapters.Best played with Keyboard & MouseRecommended Buy Price < 10$Score 6,5/10 "

												I was proud to back this game on Kickstarter, and the final result is no disappointment. The tactical combat is very satisfying, and the writing and atmosphere are great. The end of the main story is just where the experience begins, though, because the community has already started creating some incredible content. This is to Shadowrun what Neverwinter Nights was to D&D, with new community modules cropping up everywhere to make the game much bigger than any single company could make. It'll just keep getting better as time goes on.This is a worthy Shadowrun game, recommended for everyone who loves party-based RPGs with turn-based tactical combat.			"

												This game is AMAZING! When I saw it, I saw it as another game like the classic Fallout 1 and 2, and yes I know this is a rebirth of the classic Shadowrun rpg series which was amazing! But this game brings it back in HD and visual graphics of our time and it is just fun. Fun is how I can describe this, it brings rpgs back, with indepth skill trees, where you cant unlock everything, so you have to choose what you need. No levels, as you get karma points to unlock your skill and stats, Its just lots of fun. The visuals are definately amazing and the whole steampunk motif is just amazing! Why arent there more games set in an ORIGINAL steampunk universe, that isnt a final fantasy game. If you guys want a Xmas present for yourself, get yourself Shadowrun Returns, it is just worth it. :) 5/5P.S. Did I also mention that all the fan made created content is free so as long as people are making their own stories set in the Shadowrun universe, we keep getting stories to play. :D			"

												I was never one for isometric RPG's however I did a bit of research on this game and what attracted me the most was its setting. The gritty, dark, futuristic fantasy setting is portrayed quite well in the game in terms of its art style, environmental design and the text based descriptions of your encounters. By itself the default campaign can seem quite restricted. As though its trying to give you the illusion that your decisions impacts everything differently when its more than likely going to play out the same way. However I was still compelled to go on because I found the story somewhat interesting and simply enjoyed getting engrossed in the world Shadowrun Returns puts you in.  The combat itself is simple but it doesn't seem like it would get repetitive fast for me. What makes this game worth it for me though would be the wide array of user made content I see int he Steam workshop. Some of them seem well made and I intend to put more hours into them once I'm through the main campaign.			"

												Let me start out by saying that this is the first Shadowrun game that I have ever actually played. Yes I have tried the 1993 Shadowrun for the Super Nintendo but I could never get into it due to it's... Interesting controls (read point and click with a controller). But the game concept and the universe intrigued me, Over the years I forgot the name of it several times but would bring it up every few years and try to find the name of it and feel that they should remake it for the pc where it ultimately belonged. Well a few months ago was one such time that It popped into my head, I did a quick search for it and what did I find but a new Shadowrun being made for its proper platform (psst its the PC). I instantly fell in love with the style and everything I say was just the best thing I have ever seen.Flash forward to now where I have been given the ability to write this review and I am just stoked to be able to finally play a Shadowrun game without being hindered by a D-pad. Well I wasn't home when I got the Beta code but I had a 2 hour drive till I got home and then I had to download it and set it up. This just ate at me up inside but I managed to do it and when I first started it up I felt a chill as the dark and music (composed by Marshall Parker and Sam Powell from the 1993 SNES Shadowrun) started to play and the menu appeared.When you start a new game your greeted with a fairly standard character creation menu. You can select your gender, race and choose between several preconfigured or a custom skill sets for your character as well as select from one of several portraits and player models. The models look nice but are lacking the level of detail that you see with other games though this low detail level just feels right in the world, fitting in with the 2D environments. Each race has specific traits that are more prominent then others, these usually have higher starting values and higher max values. After choosing a character model and skill set you get to pick traits and spend your skill points on your starting stats. As soon as you are done creating your character you start in a modest apartment. After looking around the apartment for a while you get a call from an old friend and are sent into a flashback where you learn more about yourself and your friend but more importantly you get to experience the combat system for the first time.Shadowrun Returns is broken up into missions and uses an auto save feature that saves at the beginning of a mission. It uses a tactical combat system where you have your squad and each member has action points. Each action your characters take use action points and once they're gone then that character can't do anything till the next turn.This is customary for tactical games like this and even new people to this style of play should get used to it rather quickly. The combat system uses cover and line of site as a tactic and shows you how good the cover is and to what side you have cover on. This system isn't perfect as it doesn't always show that you're in cover and at times it's hard to tell if your line of site is broken simply due to the layout of the room and the camera angle.Shadowrun Returns comes with a full scenario editor that allows users to create whole new missions and stories and share them with the community. The editor has been out for many of the kickstarter backers for a while now so there is going to be plenty of user made content available. Someone is currently working on recreating the old SNES Shadowrun into Shadowrun Returns using the editor available here http://www.obsidianportal.com/campaigns/snes-shadowrun/mapsOverall I feel that the 2D backgrounds and the 3D character models mesh very well together and unlike in some games they feel right together. The story is excellent and you don't feel like it's being force fed down your gullet so you can play the game for the story or the game play or both. The main story is quite linier and it tends to feel like there's some handholding going on but you can choose to help someone or leave them to their own devices and save your own skin. I am not a master of table top RPG's but this feels like how I would imagine a table top RPG should be on a PC.Check out my video review on YouTube @

												I have been role playing 4th edition for a few years now and i have to say when i backed this and SR online i had really high hopes especially because of the people who were making it. i got to say SRO still needs alot of work but it is getting there.now SRR is a game to behold, the first one holds up well and as a game is good but lacked something i could not put my finger on. the customization is good even if it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ up the skills making it possible to be just about anything you want to be.i understand that games have limits and as a player you want to be anything possible and since the SNES does allow you to be just about anything as well i will let that slide.Turn base combat works well with the amount of players you will be playing with and who you are up against and even if it might give you the impression that its slow paced the way it carries itself will feel very fluid and fast you will be scratching at the keys hoping that lost shotgun shell wont finish off one of your runners.Now let me get to Dragonfall, this game has it all and i am still so thrilled to be playing it, the runs feel like a typical milk run but it will always turn south and bad things become worse everytime. the plot devices for characters is rich and want you to keep looking for more even if they are side characters. this truely feels like a shadowrun game and it should be enjoyed to the fullest as a gamer and as a role player.the feel and atmosphere of SR is there and if you are a role player yourself deffently give it a go you wont be disapointed, but if you feel SRR isnt as its holding up to be then you must get dragonfall trust me!!!

												So, finally completed this and although I liked the story, and it has the potential to contain a lot more depth than the newly released Chronicles (multiplayer support) I was a bit dissappointed that the story is quite linear, unless I am missing something here.I played through as a custom class Human, using Shotgun, Assault Rifle (both upto 6) with the maximum amount of charisma unlocked (to enable dialogue options) and some minor spirit control - for use on summon points.A lot of the extra etiquette options are null and void, each only being used once as far as I can see, and there are not many side missions, only encountered a single side mission, and one that was suggested as optional inbetween a major mission arc. (involving coyote)Combat is nice, tactical settings and options all very good - cover, scenery, summon points and ley lines adding to strategy level.The way you build your team can totally alter the playstyle you adopt, but overall you can ham fist your way through the majority of the missions with good combat skills. (with a solid main character at least)This was a real shame because although some levels were a challenge it was mainly because of a poor choice in a combat round (don't summon 3 spirits then have them go rogue woops) not because I struggled to overcome the enemies.This carried on right up until the end, again the only difficulty coming from the choice of enemy used to progress difficulty (spirits).Totally worth the time invested but I was expecting a lot more conversational choices (2 of the etiquette lines are not even used) and a LOT more side material in line with the none combat skills I only encountered 3 places in the game where I couldn't personally unlock, influence or action something because it was based on - decking, strength, or intelligence.Even race choice and stereotype seems to have little impact.I get that this is a showcase for the engine, and the ability to mod in more content is nice, but overall the vanilla campaign had a lot more potential than a basic manhunt combat run. imo "

												I'd strongly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a nicely paced suspense/ turn-based video game. This being my first Shadowrun game that I've completed I'm definitely going to continue with the others that said this game does have some minor things that I didn't like, but it's nothing game breaking or obsurd.Pros: 1.) Great story telling and characters2.) Combat is fun and has a steady pace3.) The artwork is well done and I found myself looking at all the little things the artists included.4.) The music was great, though I would have liked a little more diversity in some places. Did give the feeling of a grim and dirty world.Cons:1.) It wasn't game breaking or even hindering all too much even on hard difficulty, but sometimes places where you thought would have full or even half cover wouldn't have any at all. 2.) I liked the characters, but I would have like to have seen more from other characters especially back at the Union which is essentially your HUB throughout the game. 3.) I don't think I really missed a lot of content through my playthrough, but I kind of would have liked to see more side jobs.4.) I played through as a decker, which is basically like their word for hacker and I enjoyed it, but there really wasn't all that much to hack and gain access to hopefully in the more recent Shadowruns this is expanded upon.

												For a  turn based, and thus slow paced, game this is a pretty solid buy (especially on sale). The original mission is kind of short but the Dragonfall DLC is longer and more enjoyable. Also, the DLCs which I am just starting to get into are prety solid.

The original campaign (Dead Man's Switch) is great, the second (Dragonfall) is fantastic, and the tons and tons of UGC campaigns available are full of gems that easily rival the official publications.

												Shadowrun Returns is a fun and relatively simple cyberpunk rpg. The underlying systems have some weaknesses and punish character builds that don't specialize. However, the sense of adventure is great throughout and the game is the perfect length so as to not allow the combat mechanics to overstay their welcome. The editor is too complex for myself and possibly most people who were expecting something on the level of the original Neverwinter Nights, and this means that there won't be many well-made user generated campaigns which is a shame. The Dragonfall DLC campaign is even better than the base game.			"

And, of course, the Dragonfall mission is even better.All perfect for Shadowrun stuff fans and casual gamers, but perhaps not a big deal for hardcore gamers. I must say, I loved it at first sight!

												Overview:Pros:-	2D environments and portraits-	Interesting characters-	great writing-	refreshing setting-	diverse skill systemCons:-	3D effects-	linear story-	story goes a little off the rail in the final act-	endgame fights (enemies appear out of nowhere, required party members)RPGs are my favorite genre. Nevertheless I didn’t enjoy recent RPGs like I used to. Yes, they might have great graphics, good gameplay mechanics or a well-crafted skill system, but the one aspect I find them lacking is the storytelling. Shadowrun Returns is an exception.Before I start getting into the details, I have to say I watched several gameplay and review videos before I picked it up. To be honest – I wasn’t impressed. Even though the hand-crafted 2D environments are gorgeous and vivid, the character models as well as the visual effects are far from impressive. Nevertheless, I gave it a shot and I wasn’t disappointed.The Shadowrun universe combines Cyberpunk aspects with the return of magic and metahumans in a futuristic world. The player slips into the role of a shadowrunner, an operative who will steal, infiltrate, hack and kidnap for the right price. The protagonist has to deal with powerful corporations, corruption, mythical creatures and fellow shadowrunners to survive.When it comes to creating a character that is your own, Shadowrun excels. You can choose between five races you might find in a fantasy RPG (human, elf, dwarf, ork, troll), which feel quite fresh in this unfamiliar setting. Your character can choose from six pre-made classes:-	Street Samurai: become a gun-wielding or close-range killing machine-	Mage: Fireballs, buffs and Debuffs. The familiar choice.-	Decker: jack into the Matrix to fight security systems with your programs-	Rigger: use small drones to support your team or deal damage-	Shaman: use totems or summon spirits to defeat your enemies-	Adept: use magic to enhance your own abilities, making yourself a weaponFurthermore you can also start from scratch and spend Karma points and create your own experience. Technoshaman? Combat Decker? Everything is possible, as long as you don’t spread the Karma points too thin. Skill checks are quite common in dialogue options and spending some points in Charisma or Intelligence can be worthwhile.The inventory system is quite rudimentary. Characters wear an outfit and can carry up to three weapons. Everyone can carry up to six consumables and Magic users as well as Deckers have a spellbook with up to six slots. To further improve skills or stats, cyberware can be implanted. However this results in increased cooldowns for spells.The gameplay revolves around a team of up to 4 shadowrunners. During the majority of the game you can hire a team and choose them depending on your group dynamics. Or your cash on hand, since shadowrunners don’t work for free. The combat system is round-based and reminds of Fallout 1 & 2. Action points have to be spend wisely to move, attack or use consumables like medkits and grenades.You have to read! Where many games try to tell their stories with cutscenes and voice acting, Shadowrun Returns presents the story with superb writing. Whenever you travel to a new location or meet a character the situation is beautifully described before you have to worry about combat or dialogue choices. Combined with vibrant character portraits, the characters you encounter feel alive.The different races and classes offer replayability. My first playthrough (normal, Human Decker) took 9+ hours. Due to the familiarity with enemy placement and linear storyline, my second run (very hard, Dwarf Mage) took a little over five hours. I can see myself coming back to try out different classes, however for now I’m enjoying the Dragonfall DLC (very hard, Troll Adept).I would highly recommend this game to players who enjoy round-based RPGs, which concentrate on storytelling.

												Huge original shadowrun fan here and this game does not do the original justice. They have all the shadowrun goodness but failed on the execution. Leveling system sucks, Combat sucks. Quest/story sucks, My main problem is that it is not even OPEN world; you are forced to follow the story and you cant even explore at all every thing you do and everywhere you go is controlled by the story; its more like reading a book than playing an RPG you dont get to make any choices. I really wanted this game to be more like the original :(			"

												PROPER REVIEW PENDINGWhile I am enjoying this game so far, I cannot recommend this game to anyone except die-hard Shadowrun fans. The gameplay is quite shallow and almost completely linear, the interface is clunky and designed for tablets. There is no exploration, poor documentation, and equipment selection is limited. Dialog choices are meaningless for the most part, and you cannot save the game except for advancing checkpoints, which also means no going back if you missed anything. Fallen enemies disappear and cannot be looted, and class/skill balance is poorly implemented. For a 2 million dollar budget from kickstarter alone this is a disappointment.What Shadowrun Returns really is, is a game engine and development toolkit, whose true merit has yet to be seen, with a short adventure included. This could be a good thing, but only time will tell. I see the potential for great things with this game but in my opinion that is not a selling point at this time for anyone but modders.However, as a Shadowrun fan, I am thrilled to be back exploring the neon lit slums of 2055 Seattle. The level artwork is the highlight, with the music adding to the atmosphere. The 3d character models are quite crude but fit in with the world when you are actually playing, just don't expect to get interesting looking armour for your character. There is no voice acting, but for a video game the writing is a pleasant surprise though that isn't saying much.All said and done, I don't regret preordering Shadowrun Returns, but if you are curious about the setting I recommend picking up one of the books until this game goes on sale.

												After wanting to play Shadowrun for the longest time, tonight I finally finished it. The game was not that long with its 12 hours of game time, and to be honest, it was quite a disillusion. After finishing Baldur's Gate 1 for the first time two weeks ago, I was looking forward to another isometric RPG. Being a big Deus Ex fan, the cyberpunk theme of Shadowrun Returns was very alluring. Being unfamiliar with the Shadowrun franchise, the mix of cyberpunk and fantasy felt weird at first. But even in the end, I can't say that I like it better. I'll try to summarize my experience with this game in a pro/con list.PRO  The 2D backgrounds are from time to time quite beautiful  The user interface was quite ok, and looked sleek  The first half of the story was interesting  Interesting combination of combat going on in the matrix and in real life at the same time.  The game worked quite well on Linux (except for the remarks below)  The game was easy to play with keyboard and mouse, but also with the Steam Controller on my TVCON  The game did not handle ""exotic"" resolutions well. 3200x1800 on my linux laptop and 3440x1440 on my desktop were not manually selectable. Log files mentioned that the game detected the native resolution but a slightly different resolution was chosen. The drop down menu never showed the native resolutions in game. Full HD on my TV was easy.  When contacting the developer's support for the issue above, no support was given. I got an email confirming that they received my email, and that's the last thing that happened.  The loading screens took quite long for a ""2D"" game. I would expect it to be faster than games like Skyrim?  Classes seem very diverse, but they don't feel diverse.   Leveling is quite boring. Not a lot changes exect for some % to hit etcetera.  Fights are repetitive because there are not a lot of different tactics (necessary). The AI is not very bright.  During combat sequences the game goes turn-based, even when all enemies are killed you still keep walking turn based until you find new enemies in the same environment. Moving your whole team person by person is very tedious.  When going on missions you pay mercs to come with you. They are not very strong or optimal in their configuration, so they felt like dead weight compared to my maxed out SMG fighter.  Hacking/Matrix sequences are very repetitive. Both for the looks of the environment and the variation in enemies and variation in weapons. I just spammed my default attack and nothing else was needed.   The game is very linear. There are not a lot of side quests and you can't explore the world on your own. There is no open world to visit.  Because of the linear gameplay and uninteresting classes, replayability suffers a lot.  The story of the game started out great. It felt like a personal story compared to the ""save the world"" kind of stories from Skyrim and company. But from the middle of the game it felt like the writers had to keep making the story more elaborate to keep the gamers interested. They created some complex and unnecessary twists that ultimately made me just click faster through the conversation options because I became uninterested.  Those conversations were often very onesided. The choices you make in conversations almost never matter. Most answers are just different forms of the same answer, making conversations very uninteresting. There is no real impact on the game.  The writing of the game is obviously inspired by the Sprawl trilogy, and tiringly so. Every sentence tries to be drearier than the last one. I like film noir and cyberpunk, but this was way too cliché at times.  The world of Shadowrun combines cyberpunk and sci-fi with fantasy. Obviously a lot of people like this, but I'm not really fond of it. It gets worse when they try to mix even more classic (cliché?) game themes in the mix: violent crazy people in an asylum, undead ghouls, monsters and even spirits!! It just lacked some pirates and vampires...  The (hand drawn?) backgrounds were nice from time to time, but they are very empty. There is not a lot of animation or interactivity. The world feels dead.  The music is nice. I mean, the 3 or 4 tracks that are constantly repeated are nice the first time. They sound perfectly in line with the cyberpunk theme, but after having it on repeat for 12 hours, I just disabled the music altogether.   The game is quite short. I finished it in about 12 hours (thoroughly reading everything), and it seems like I'm slow compared to others. Some did it in 8 hours. Sadly, I was happy that it was over.I was looking forward to play the complete Shadowrun series, but after being let down by the first installment, I just can't bring myself to buy the sequels. Even if they are better... Too bad really! I hope that the other famous tactical 2D Kickstarter games like Wasteland 2 and Pillars of Eternity can make up for this game.			"

												Okay. Have you played Shadowrun the tabletop RPG? Me neither. The closest i've ever gotten to playing Shadowrun before this game was the counterstrike ripoff on the Xbox 360 (not that it was bad or anything. They just went a very ""safe"" route with it).I had no idea what the setting was. What everything was called. Why in a cyberpunk futuristik setting where would be elves, Dwarfs and trolls. Did i learn anything about that in game? Nope! I did however find it online and i did get a bit intrested in the setting.""So we get that you like the setting of the game. Is it any good? Is it worth my 14 bucks? (Or something like that.))"" Yes, Absolutly. The game is pretty cheap and it has workshop support AKA you'll be old before you run out of content. The community makes content for this all the time and if you would so choose you could make your own pretty easily. They give you all the tools.The main story that comes with the game is a nice touch and it's a pretty decent story too! It's not bad at all but it isnt great. It's good not great. Just a bit of a fair warning on that front.The only thing i wish was in there was some sort of multiplayer. But that would be long and frikking annoying with all the slow ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s going ""HMMMMMMM, i wonder if i should heal that guy over there that just took a katana to the face or if i should throw a ineffectual ball of magic at the baddie that use said katana.

												I can now give this game a thumbs up with the Dragonfall content. This is what the game should have been from the outset and it's a major all around improvement. Make no mistake, this is still CRPG-lite, but for price it's worthwhile. I can only hope Harebrained keeps pumping out DLC of this caliber - and continues to improve the game - as well as assets to give the game longevity from the community making mods out there.  "

												Definitely nostalgic of the original Shadowrun on SNES.  An epic 'SQUEE' could probably be heard down the block when Jake Armitage crawled off of the slab in his cameo.  In any case, the turn based combat leaves a little bit to be desired from the original but all in all is actually fairly well thought out.  Positioning for cover, positioning behind enemies gives a melee boost, shotgun spread, etc.I've always been a HUGE fan of cyberpunk games that follow the whole, 'end of days' type feel.  World populated by multimillion dollar corporations that make the decisions now, street gangs that control most of the slums, implanted datajacks to interface with computers.  This one definitely hit me in my nostalgia bone, but with an updated twist.Bravo... bravo!			"

												Shadowrun: Returns and its Expansion/DLC Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a turn-based tactical RPG game created by a studio called Harebrained Schemes out of Seattle, WA. The base game Shadowrun: Returns was released on Steam on July 25th, 2013, and the DLC Shadowrun: Dragonfall was released on February 27th, 2014.For those not familiar with the Shadowrun universe, it is based on a cyber-punk futuristic planet Earth. It is the 2050’s. The world is run by enormous, greedy corporations who will stop at nothing to acquire power. The twist is that a few decades earlier (around our current modern-day) magic returned to our world. With it came elves, dwarves, trolls, ogres, and other magical creatures.Shadowrunners are for-hire mercenaries who will do just about any job as long as there is money to be made. Whether it is stealing secrets from a corporate rival, working as security to protect those secrets, or taking out individuals that stand in their way of power, they are hired by big corporations to do their “dirty work”. They work in the seedy underbelly of this corporate society and live and survive in the shadows.I discovered Shadowrun when I was browsing around Steam looking for something new to play. Dragonfall was pretty highly recommended, and after reading up a bit on it I thought it sounded like something I would enjoy. I started it up and decided to start from the beginning and play through the original campaign. I was immediately sucked in to the story. I just had to keep playing, if for no reason other than to find out how the story turned out!The story for each of the campaigns is probably the best feature of the game. I don’t think I’ve been this captivated by a video game’s story since Final Fantasy VII! Even though there are no video cut scenes and no voice overs, the story is told VERY well.The story is progressed by speaking with various NPCs in the game world. When you speak to them you are given a number of choices as to how you want to respond in the conversation. There are a few places in the game where the dialogue options you choose will change the sequence of events to complete the mission. There isn’t a LOT of these places, but they are there. Also some dialogue options may not be available to you because of certain conditions. For example, if your Strength stat is high you may be able to bully that gang leader into giving you the key you need to progress. But, if you lack strength and are more intelligent, you may have to use brains over brawn to get what you need. There is also a feature called “Etiquette”. The game describes etiquette as “knowing how to behave in various social situations”. In-game this means you will get certain dialogue options based on what etiquette you choose when you create your character. In the example above, if my character has the “Gang” etiquette I may have a dialogue option when talking to the gang leader that will open up different options for completing the mission.Character progression is pretty straight-forward. When you create your character there are a few class archetypes that you can choose from. This gives you a basic set of skills to start from. As you progress you will acquire more skill points that you can spend on any skill you want. If you want to spend your skill points to be a shotgun-wielding mage you can, or if you want to specialize in being an uber “Decker” (Shadowrun’s version of a computer hacker) you can do that too. While skill points come pretty easy, it’s still a good idea to specialize in one or two areas. The campaign isn’t long enough for you to get enough skill points to max out everything.The skills were all pretty well explained right in game. All of your teammates and other Shadowrunners that you can hire all have their own set of skills and abilities. So if you are a shotgun-wielding mage you can hire a teammate that has the hacking skills you need for a mission. I kind of like this system. It lets you build your character however you like and then you can complement your skills with those of the shadowrunners you run with.From the very beginning I felt like the game environment and the atmosphere were very well done. I felt like I was running around in the movie Blade Runner! Everything was futuristic, yet familiar. The characters I interacted with and their portraits definitely captured the cyberpunk feel. Each character you encounter has their own personality and they are very unique. I thought the music was great too, even if there wasn’t a lot of variety. I thought it fit well with the theme of the game.The tactical combat style is what attracted me to the game in the first place. I found the combat to be a lot of fun, and in some places it was VERY challenging. For most missions you have your player character and three other Shadowrunners to make up your team.When you are walking around the map everything is in real time. But, as soon as combat starts, it switches to turn-based tactical mode. Every member of your team has a set number of “Action Points” (AP) that you can spend each turn. Firing your weapon or using a special ability may cost an AP point. Moving to a different location with better cover may cost another. Casting that healing spell or reloading your rifle will cost another. This is where the tactical part comes in. You have to decide what you want each member of your team to do each round. Do you want to focus fire and finish off one enemy at a time, or do you spread out and burn them all down at once? You also have to be careful that you don’t leave yourself pinned down somewhere without enough AP to use that medkit to keep you alive in the fight. Once you spend all your AP for that turn, the computer will play the turn of your enemies. Once they are done it is your turn to spend your AP again. Add in that each weapon type has a different range and friendly-fire can be hazardous to your teammates, it makes combat VERY interesting.The Good, The Bad, and the UglyAs a whole I very much enjoyed Shadworun: Returns and Shadowrun: Dragonfall. The story lines for BOTH campaigns are among the best I’ve ever seen in a video game. The first campaign is a BIT slow to start but it’s only so at the beginning. Combat is a lot of fun and can be pretty challenging at times. There were a few missions I had to play through a couple of different times with different strategies before I was victorious.I really enjoyed the skill system as well. It was easy to understand and easy to use. I didn’t feel like I needed to go online and read hundreds of forum posts to learn what the best build for my character would be. I could just pick a couple of skills I wanted to learn that were fun for me and go with it and be successful.The only bad worth mentioning is the length of the campaigns. My total play time on Steam is 48 hours, and that was running all the way through both campaigns. I’m sure I’m a lot slower that a lot of other people. However, considering the inexpensive price of the game and the fact that there is a lot of player generated content on the Steam Workshop, there is a lot of replayability here. Hopefully they will also be releasing more DLC in the future.About the only “ugly” I can say about the game is a couple of buggy missions I encountered. In one mission there was an event that didn’t trigger properly and I was unable to continue because a door would not unlock. I had to replay that mission one or two times before it finally triggered properly and I could advance.Also, some earlier reviews criticized Shadowrun: Returns’ save system. At release you could only save at certain checkpoints. This is no longer the case. I’m not sure if it was with the release of Dragonfall or if it was before that, but they changed the game so you can now save anywhere.See my original review at http://www.mistervertigo.net "

												Simply a-freaking-mazing.Shadowrun Returns is my first venture into this universe, and after a ten hour campaign, I'm completely obsessed. If you are also new, but a little wary about dropping the money for this title, allow me to explain a little about the game...SR is an isometric-style Rpg, set in a future-fantasy universe, where elves and dwarves wield shotguns and cast spells. Starting up the default campaign, Dead Man Switch, you create a character. Race, class and appearance are all up to you. Then, the developer, Harebrained Schemes drops you into a well-written and thoughtfully crafted story, presented in a text-based format - no voice acting here, and I think it's better for it, but that's personal preference. Dialog options are different depending on how you build your character and elicit different responses from NPCs, with charisma allowing you to sweet-talk, and etiquettes let you rub elbows with the many groups that populate Seattle.You play a Shadowrunner, a type of mercenary, doing the dirty-work of multi-billion dollar corporations and aristocrats for cash. Gameplay is very reminiscent of the recent Xcom: Enemy Unknown. If you didn't like that, chances are you won't like this. Every turn, each combatant is given a certain number of moves, from moving to shooting and using items. It's very tactical and you could wind up dead if you don't think before you click. Several jobs you undertake have you bringing other Runners on to watch your back and take a cut of the pay, so you're almost never alone.I found no hick-ups in the gameplay during my play-through. The specials and items are balanced well, meaning death is often the fault of the player's ill preparation. The game is fair, which is about all a gamer could ask for. Also available are game editors, allowing anyone to write their own stories and scenarios for others to enjoy. I haven't been able to try any out because there currently seems to be a bug that causes the ugc to be downloaded to the wrong files, making them difficult to locate.Shadowrun Returns is a gem that I'm glad was funded. It's not for everyone, but if it sounds like it's up your alley, I urge you to pick it up. "

												Shadowrun Returns is a game for those who enjoy old-school RPG's. Dragonfall DLC is a must have.The games strengths are in good writing, rich world history and all in all beautiful artwork.The world is beautifully detailed whether you're in the streets of Redmond Barrens, a luxurious corporate headquarter or busy market hub in Germany. I might not be the biggest fan of the ""cartoony"" style the designers went ahead with but all in all it works. The portrait artwork is also beautifully done.Dialogue and text is descriptive and good all through the games, lack of voice is the proper way to do an rpg when you have good writers.While there are many things in the game that could have been done better, far better even, I cannot think of any major  flaws or issues in design. Base game delivers an okay story and gameplay although it's lacking in many ways I still managed to get some 12 hours of gameplay from it and did not feel bad about getting the game but I did feel like it could have been done better and certainly it could have been bigger.Dragonfall DLC is a whole different story however. In fact, I would say that Dragonfall is -the- reason to buy Shadowrun Returns. Dragonfall provides you with a more classic Shadowrun feel, the storyline is excellent, the permanent companions have personalities and plenty of dialogue in and out of missions and even the local npc's are always worth talking to. Dragonfall features more of the actual Shadowrun gigs, the game is full of choices to make, plot twists to uncover and provides far richer experience for all types of characters as all types of skills have more uses.The Dragonfall DLC provided me with additional 18-20 hours of gameplay, far more than the base game does.Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall dlc's only major problem is that it leaves me wanting for more. So much more.. I want a bigger game with more content!Harebrained Schemes has a great basis set up, hopefully they will continue in the path of Dragonfall as it is obviously doing so many things right.			"

												I never played Shadowrun when it was on the NES or whatever else it was on. I joined the world with Shadowrun Returns and I have to say its a good place to start. It opens up a lot of doors, and even some windows, to a whole new world of science and magic. The controls feel clunky sometimes, but its by no means game breaking. Its turn table based combat, good guys go first more often then not, and then the bad guys. You get to make your own character from various races and classes. You don't have to stick to class you pick at creation though. You can be a mage with some intense decking skills, or a rigger who knows some summoning. They don't force you to stick to a class. Just be careful, as the game often hints 'A Jack of all trades is a master of none.'You play as a Shadowrunner, a gun for hire in the streets. You've fallen on some hard times and seem to be thinking more about your future then your past, till you get a call from a old contact. A guy you used to run with, Sam. He's been killed recently and set up a 'dead mans switch' in his brain to send you a message when he finally kicks the bucket. Well, someone kicked his bucket for him and you need to travel to Seattle and find out who did it. There are some serious twists and turns as you dig deeper into this world, trying to uncover who did it.Dragonfall is leap and bounds ahead of Dead mans Switch. The graphics feel tighter, but there is no real change. Some of the sounds and combat has been tweaked a bit and the save anywhere anytime button is a lifesaver. The supporting characters feel a lot more real, and can be interacted with anytime. They have backgrounds and lives, and aren't afarid to give you a piece of their minds if they think your doing something wrong.In the newest 'dlc' you get a whole new campgain, set up for a new character but thanks to some dedicated players you can import your character over to this save file to run the DLC. Your out on a run with long time friend Monica and her crew in Berlin. Its a simple job, a smash and grab type. However things aren't always as they seem... Monica ends up dead and you and the crew end up fleeing for your lives. With Monica dead there is a seat to be filled in the community where she lived, and her crew wants revenge.

												Shadow Run Returns is an isometric tactical turn based rpg. While the story that comes with the game is quite short the developers of this game have developed a very in depth editor which allows the community to expand on content much like the old Never Winter Nights games.The combat is an enjoyable experience and the artwork and assests are amazing. The game contains no voice acting but I believe titles like this benefit from the lack of audio dialogue as these games are quite text heavy and a lot would be lost if it had to be minimised for audio's sake.If you enjoy isometric turn based rpg's then this is a must buy and definitely visit the Steam Workshop once you complete the main game and if you have any talent at designing games then you will thoroughly enjoy the provided editor.

												At the time of this writing, Hairbrained Studios have only released ""Dead Man's Switch"" and ""Dragonfall"", with the latter a significantly stronger module than the former. Both are heavily combat-based, and while careful positioning and action choices can tilt battles in your favor, the RNG can make sure that even if you do everything right, your team can still be wiped in a couple rounds due to keyboard-smashing bad luck (in this respect, the combat is very similar to X-COM: Enemy Unknown). But if you're getting an RPG like this, you're hopefully getting it knowing that luck is part of the game.It's all very good fun, particularly on harder difficulties. Agonizing over how to build your character, whom to take on a mission, and how to position them each round should please old-school turn-based RPG purists. The story arcs and character depth are not really fantastic, but the game is built on going out and completing runs (usually by shooting/stabbing/blowing things up, with only occassional decking responsibilities).Definite recommend, particularly if you've played the pencil-and-paper version.

												Shadowrun: Returns and its Expansion/DLC Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a turn-based tactical RPG game created by a studio called Harebrained Schemes out of Seattle, WA. The base game Shadowrun: Returns was released on Steam on July 25th, 2013, and the DLC Shadowrun: Dragonfall was released on February 27th, 2014.For those not familiar with the Shadowrun universe, it is based on a cyber-punk futuristic planet Earth. It is the 2050’s. The world is run by enormous, greedy corporations who will stop at nothing to acquire power. The twist is that a few decades earlier (around our current modern-day) magic returned to our world. With it came elves, dwarves, trolls, ogres, and other magical creatures.Shadowrunners are for-hire mercenaries who will do just about any job as long as there is money to be made. Whether it is stealing secrets from a corporate rival, working as security to protect those secrets, or taking out individuals that stand in their way of power, they are hired by big corporations to do their “dirty work”. They work in the seedy underbelly of this corporate society and live and survive in the shadows.I discovered Shadowrun when I was browsing around Steam looking for something new to play. Dragonfall was pretty highly recommended, and after reading up a bit on it I thought it sounded like something I would enjoy. I started it up and decided to start from the beginning and play through the original campaign. I was immediately sucked in to the story. I just had to keep playing, if for no reason other than to find out how the story turned out!The story for each of the campaigns is probably the best feature of the game. I don’t think I’ve been this captivated by a video game’s story since Final Fantasy VII! Even though there are no video cut scenes and no voice overs, the story is told VERY well.The story is progressed by speaking with various NPCs in the game world. When you speak to them you are given a number of choices as to how you want to respond in the conversation. There are a few places in the game where the dialogue options you choose will change the sequence of events to complete the mission. There isn’t a LOT of these places, but they are there. Also some dialogue options may not be available to you because of certain conditions. For example, if your Strength stat is high you may be able to bully that gang leader into giving you the key you need to progress. But, if you lack strength and are more intelligent, you may have to use brains over brawn to get what you need. There is also a feature called “Etiquette”. The game describes etiquette as “knowing how to behave in various social situations”. In-game this means you will get certain dialogue options based on what etiquette you choose when you create your character. In the example above, if my character has the “Gang” etiquette I may have a dialogue option when talking to the gang leader that will open up different options for completing the mission.Character progression is pretty straight-forward. When you create your character there are a few class archetypes that you can choose from. This gives you a basic set of skills to start from. As you progress you will acquire more skill points that you can spend on any skill you want. If you want to spend your skill points to be a shotgun-wielding mage you can, or if you want to specialize in being an uber “Decker” (Shadowrun’s version of a computer hacker) you can do that too. While skill points come pretty easy, it’s still a good idea to specialize in one or two areas. The campaign isn’t long enough for you to get enough skill points to max out everything.The skills were all pretty well explained right in game. All of your teammates and other Shadowrunners that you can hire all have their own set of skills and abilities.

												Bloody awesome RPG and a bloody awesome RPG. I don't regret spending a single cent on it. Basically it's a bit like a cross between Blade Runner and Lord of the Rings. You play a Shadowrunner, a bounty hunter who does difficult and risky jobs in a near-future world where magic has returned to the Earth, cyber-augmentation is very real, and meta-humans like elves and orks walk among us. Truly cool in every aspect, no?			"

												I have over 100 extremely entertaining hours in a game I spent a total of 20 bucks on, and I am not even finished playing this game.Interesting mix of fantasy and cyberpunk.Dead Man Switch and Dragonfall offer great official campaigns with interesting stories and characters, if lacking in challange.The real gem is the overwhelming amount of user generated content, which was the real draw for this on kickstarter.

												This is an OK game at a low price point. There's nothing particularly good about it aside from the art, music, and source material. It doesn't offer a deep RPG experience. Actually, it doesn't offer a shallow RPG experience. It doesn't offer very deep strategy, though it utilizes a simplified version of what you see in the new X-com (which is itself, a very dumbed down version of the Heroclix table-top game system). Hacking, or ""decking"" rather is just a fairly tedious reskin of the vanilla combat. There are almost no choices to make so the whole thing plays out like a point and click adventure sans puzzles. When the game came out a lot of the defenders shouted about the great user generated content that would come out. I've yet to see it. The engine itself is too limited to really facilitate much better. I know it seems like I'm ragging on it pretty hard but despite all this I can't say that I disliked my time with it... just don't prepare yourself for much. With the right mindset it's a pretty fun one-off adventure.			"

												Decent game with a rather compelling theme. It's refreshing to see fatansy elements thrown into a cyberpunk setting and the soundtrack in this game really adds to the futuristic theme.The only real problem I have with this game is the lack in depth in combat. The models and animation in the game are also rather lacking. It's serviceable, but nothing really great.In the end, Shadowrun Returns still looks very pretty, with a good color pallet and a likeable art style. Easily gave me hours of enjoyment.			"

												It's not cp2020 but it's still excellent. Not as shallow as XCOM and not as twitch-happy as Dishonored and whatnot.Style wise, think Fallout 1 combat, Baldurs Gate 2 quests and dialogues, and yes the world feels a little bit like Deus Ex, but at the same time it's nothing like it at all.Best thing I've played for a while. It's not trying to be pretty or sell to console gamers. It's isometric, turn based, point-buy item-buy and whatnot, without having to fight with 20 year old Windows installers.Hoping for more DLC stories!			"

												Awesome game. Like Fallout 2 except set in a different world, one of techno-mages, futuristic hackers, and cities in the embrace of dark-souled corporations. The script is well-crafted, and the story unfolds in a somewhat liner but enjoyable way. The combat is a genuinely fun, turn based system akin to a D&D system, but with rules based on the Shadowlands tabletop game. It is worth the $15 dollars charged for it. I generally don't like indie games, but a few have stood out to me, Bastion is one of them, Brothers Tale of Two Sons, and Shadowrun has definately entered this elite group for me.			"

												Picked this up on offer this Bank Holiday weekend and have really enjoyed it. I have yet to explore the additional content (which looks really good) so this refers only to the main campaign 'Dead Man's Switch'. I enjoyed the Shadowrun universe, the characters were almost consistently interesting, the dialogue options fun and there was enough variety on offer to warrant two or three play-throughs (well, almost three, more on that later). In fact, this game has inspired me to learn more about Shadowrun - a marketing success, for sure!Character creation allows for a lot of customisation, either from one of the standard templates or free-form (the latter allows some creative combinations once you've got the hang of the gameplay mechancis). While there is a lot of replayability in character classes (you'll have a different experience as an Adept than as a Decker, for instance) it struck me that my playthrough as a decker (who can hack into the 'Matrix' and fight additional combat scenarios within computer programmes) allowed greater access to content and secrets. A shame as I did feel the game was sort of pushing me to play as a decker, and while this is an interesting and challenging character class, it limits your access to combat and magic specialisations.My main criticisms are that even a year after release I kept encountering bugs - including a major game-breaking bug that meant I could not finish a level. In short, it simply would not end combat or allow me to initiate dialogue at one point, even when the combat was over and dialogue bubbles were above people's heads. This was a pain and recurred again even after a level restart. Other criticisms were niggling and broke the immersion rather than the game - playing as a troll, for instance, didn't change dialogue options to a playthrough as a human or as an elf - which was a shame (bar one person calling me a racist name) and I'd loved to have used the in-game mechanic of building your own gang to go on more than just main plot missions. A couple of side missions could have helped me diversify my character build, get some better equipment and feel more prepared to take on the end of game boss on the hardest difficulty.The game itself is focused on a single short story (took me about 8 hours the first time, 5-6 after that) which felt more like an introduction to the universe than a standalone game, which is an odd design decision, but it did mean I finished the game eager for more - rather than with a 'more traditional rpg' like Baldur's Gate where I tend to get fed up well before the finale. While this focus meant a satisfying resolution to the compelling storyline, it also meant there were no side missions, no additional content and limited opportunities for exploration. While additional content looks to rectify this, most involve creating new characters, so those I created for Dead Man's Switch won't be coming with me.tl;dr - Great, immersive, colourful and engaging game that I'd rate 3.5-4/5. This score would be higher if the game was longer, featured greater variety outside combat, had opportunities for exploration and a few more side missions and didn't have game breaking bugs this long after release!

												ahhhhhh, sitting back with a glass of 15 year glenlivet and a pipe in your man chair. It's hard to find a more refreshing and manlier past time....oh wait, what is this? Cyberpunk infused with a refreshing take on fantasy? In an Isometric rpg using hand crafted maps with a unique art style? I have a game to play, enough of this manly lounging about!tl;dr;  Overall 7/10. Worth the cash if your gaming plate is empty and, you want a fun rpg with decent story telling and stunning, unique, art direction and  visuals to sit back and relax with.-hardcore rpgs fans will find the Dev's campaigns lacking rpg-ness in areas-those who want the best parts of the campign will have to pay $30 for the toolset and dragonfall -it missed its calling -> it needs networking/co-op support so it can be used as a pnp campaign tool for shadowrunners. In my opinion, with these expansions added on this tool would be hands down the best way to run a pnp shadowrun campaign with friends.Shadowrun plays as a mix between old school isometric rpgs such as baldurs gate and uses a combat system similar to the new Xcom by Firaxis. Unfortunatey though the first campagin is...lacking. While a fun play through and introduction to the universe, it is necessary to buy the dragonfall campaign to truly see what this framework is capable of. However, hardcore Isometric rpg fans will find this game lacking. Side quests are few and far between, you have no control over how your npc companions (depending upon the campaign by harebrained) level up, and a general lack of freedom in what should be a more open world experience. However, the game is primarily designed for being a tool that players use to build their own campaigns. Sadly though, this shouldn't have to be a substitute for harebrain's lack of campaign building talent. The game also needs co-op, just hear me out. This is turn based game, based upon a pen a paper rpg, with focus on building a single character for a player with full stats/""classes"", with tools to build your own campaigns and maps. While entertaining to experience in single player, and as cool as the build your own rpg framework is, it missed its calling. This is a tool that could be expanded to actually run a pen and paper campaigns! There are things like roll20.net but lets be honest, the visual tools and dice support are lacking for odd ball rpgs like Shadowrun (huge lack of cyberpunk visuals like tiles/characters/creatures and a lot of custom equation building required to get it running properly). Adding networking/co-op would allow a savvy dm to build their own maps/campaigns and run a pnp rpg with visual support and a set rule framework for combat! (seriously, the art direction is gorgeous and no need to worry about that ""one player"" cheating their stats or rule loop holes).Overall, for the price ($30 if you buy all the dev built campaigns) it's worth the money. The 2 campaign  stories are fun, the lenghts of the stories are good, the changes in Dragonfall are proof that harebrained is listening to the community to improve upon their stories, tool upgrades, and improving rpg elements in their own work. There are a few bugs/optimizations that need to be sorted out but, I also need to upgrade my pc (really badly) so I'd like to hear how those with beefier rigs hold up. (I'm pretty sure the issues I ran into were due to the HD graphics straining my rig at high resolutions).			"

												This game, this game is one of the few titles I can name that truly inspires my mind to delve depths unimaginable the setting is superb, the lore rich and thick and let's not forget the beautiful controls and gameplay all in all I would say this title is one of my absolute favorites, but let's talk about why.First off the setting is one of the, if not the most beautifully crafted settings to grace the games industry the world feels alive and full of character and emotion as though it is dripping pure atmosphere and spawning true intrigue this is because it is built off of an amazing title already being part of the deep and wonderful world of Shadowrun making it one of the best modern iterations of a classic game series I have ever had the pleasure to step into.Now let's saunter on over to the lore of the game, which is built upon the original Pen and Paper title and the superb yet confusing NES and Genesis title, not to spoil anything too major but the entire world has been changed massively by an event called the awakening and yea, you know what just go read up on everything else.The gameplay is another area I want to cover as the game plays like an Turn Based Roleplaying Game, now the game comes with one preinstalled mission which is actually quite huge but there are a lot of player made missions on sites like NexusMods and even on the workshop itself add on the beautiful levelling system which stops you becoming extremely over powered early and you have fantastic gameplay.But I don't think the game is one hundred percent perfect, the preinstalled story called Dead Mans Switch, unfortunately feels undercooked and doesn't pull off the gritty superb story I expected in short your friend is killed and he hires you post death to find and kill the drek that killed him, I'm not gonna spoil anything but I thought the end villain was weak and uninteresting when they could've done something great with an established character from the beginning.I also shouldn't forget the DLC Dragonfall which in and of itself adds much more to the world and is it's own excellent piece of content adding new characters and more awesome story development.to test my new scoring system I give this 4 stars or a That's Grand LadLook forward to more reviews that hopefully don't sound too pretentious or crap "

												After much debate, well, not really, but I did wait a decent amount of time to play this title:  Shadow Run – Returns (http://store.steampowered.com/app/234650/), I gave it shot.  It’s about 15 hours’ worth of content and there doesn’t appear to be much in the way of quality DLC atm.   From a cost perspective, a dollar per hour of game play with a great story is money well spent.  It has a Fall Out 1 feel as it is turn-based, there are walls of text to read, and you can be a troll hacker that is more charismatic than an ancient vampire, with a data jack in his head.  In short, if you want a game that doesn’t demand too much of your PC or your time, and gives you a decent story to fall in love with, this game is for you.			"

Everything I was ambivalent about with DMS was rectified and improved.If you were on the fence after playing DMS then rest assured, Dragonfall is awesome and blows DMS out of the water. This is more than just game mechanics and tweaks. The story telling is better, conversation options are vastly improved, missions are more varied, NPCs are more than just mission givers and your squad mates have personality and history to uncover as you get closer to them.In short I love this game and can't wait for future releases.

So far, it's been well-worth the money.If you want the feel of an actual roleplaying experience, with lots of text to substitute a lot of what dialogue and information you would probably be getting through a DM or other players in a more conventional tabletop setup? This game has it.The main plot alone does seem to be pretty long and extensive, and that's not even cutting into the Dragonfall campaign expansion.Navigation is third-person point and click, combat is turn-based and a lot of the gameplay in general is pretty straight-forward.

												I'm done with ""Dead Man's Switch"" and a few missions into ""Dragonfall.""tl,dr: Don't buy the game unless you buy Dragonfall with it.The combat is a bit simple, though turning up the difficulty helps immensely to provide a more engaging, complicated experience. It certainly doesn't feel like the fluidity one finds in a real tabletop game session, but then, to expect that from a computer game is usually folly.The heart, and meat, of the game is, rather, in its dialogue and world. For clarity, don't expect voice acting and animated cutscenes. It's more in the mein of the aging RPGs like Baldur's Gate, but even less frilly. Characters are rendered convincingly, and with their own authorial voices. The writing never worse than ""pretty good.""But where Dead Man's Switch (the base campaign) never gets far above pretty good, and maintains a dreary linearity at all times, Dragonfall excels. Dragonfall's characters and story are much more believably written, the world more flavorful, and the story less full of deus ex machina windfalls.Where Dead Man's Switch feels like a saturday morning cartoon, Dragonfall is more like a well-written, high-budget film. I might watch both, but you can be sure I'd much rather watch the latter.			"

												Hoy Chummers.Shadowrun Returns takes you through a solid introduction to the cyberpunk world of shadowrun where classic fantasy, (sword and sorcery) meets cyber enhanced super soldiers.  When I first saw that this game was going to be done I was afraid another company was going to screw it up the way Microsoft did when they failed making another game trying to use the Shadowrun name.    Thankfully this is not the case.  The first story deadman switch is a good solid introduction to the world of being a gun for hire.  While the story is largly liniar the additional content added by players adds vast replayability to the original quest and provides a huge amount of additional content. Dragonfall adds several more hours and more options for play as well.  Another thing that has been nice is that many of the bugs that are/were in this have been fixed.  So many products are released to die where this game has been continually updated to ensure problems when found are solved.  For RPG fans or those who remember playing one of the many table top cyberpunk games,  this is a great game worth every penny.			"

												Great RPG.  The default campaign is well-written and keeps the spirit of the setting well.  Full character customization including magic, adept, decking, rigging, etc.  The campaign editor interfaces with the Steam Workshop, making it easy to find reviews on custom-created campaigns.The system itself is inspired by the Shadowrun rules; spend karma to increase attributes, linked skills, and subskills.  It even gives bonuses for the chosen etiquette.  The skills themselves are similar to Shadowrun skills, but there are certainly differences; in particular, the lack of stealth or perception.Despite any shortcomings, it's a fun game with an immersive atmosphere.  Expect about 25 hours of original gameplay in the default campaign, more with custom campaigns and replayability. "

												A pretty good game and a blast from the past in terms of style. Its got an interesting world and characters. The main campaign feels very much like the one from Neverwinter Nights - a holdover until the community builds content via the editor. The AI is a little weak; the game relies on overwhelming you with bad guys which is a bit annoying but overall combat is really interesting. It's sort of a cross between Advance Wars on the Gameboy and the freeware game Battle of Wesnoth. Improvements for the future could be a party system that allows you to customise a team of 4. That would be a great addition.			"

												Excellent! Loved it!There is no free roaming - this game is on rails.  It's more like an interactive William Gibson novel than Fallout Tactics.But it's the writing that really stands out,  that and the the RPG setting.  After playing this, I think if i ever did pen and paper again I'd like to try Shadowrun.  It reminds me a lot of Traveller (all-time favorite pen and paper RPG) in some respects.The music is good and fits the game well.The art is unique - be sure to zoom in occasionally to check out the details.In some of the levels, you will have a character jacked into the matrix and running alone,  while the rest of the team defends the access point (and the helpless cybernaut).  The game does a good job of creating a genuine feeling of urgency in these situations.Save points:  the game saves for you.  if you screw up a level you have to play it over again.  Did not care for this.I did not find it possible while on a mission to drop out of combat (when no enemies were visible) to move easier -  either i just never figured out how,  or it's not possible.  It should be automatic.  Did not care for this.I found the early game fights weak & easy.  Later scenarios were more difficult.Many reviews I have read lamented that the game is too short.  If you were expecting an open world roamer,  it is -  but if you are expecting a good novel,  it's not.   And ultimately, i think that's what this game is - a good novel.Speaking of good novel,  i found after playing  - being curious about some of the characters -  that i had met a very famous (in the milleu) dragon,  and an immortal - both subtly and (believe it or not) *realistically* portrayed.  another example of good writing.More side quests and missions would have been nice -  but it would have detracted from coherence.If you like cyberpunk novels, or gritty film noir,    you'll probably like this game.   I picked it up on sale for ~7.00$  and it's Definitely worth that.			"

												I think of this game as a great tactical combat and RPG engine for which the community will be able to create some interesting campagins.  The campaign that ships with the game is very good in its own right: it has an interesting story and dialog, believable and memorable characters, and a great balance between combat, conversation, and puzzle segments.The main campaign ran me about 15 hours, and that alone made the purchase worthwhile.  There's some level of replayability, trying different races/classes/builds, but the main draw will be what the community produces in time.			"

												I actually never played any Shadowrun games before this, but it reminded me of many other games I loved and played all the time when growing up. After playing through Deadman's Switch I have to say this game is absolutely fantastic!Where do I begin? The art and the detail in each area and character is very nice, the rules are sleek and easy to learn (though at first I was a bit intimidated coming into a ruleset I had no prior experience with).  The combat system flows great, it really keeps your interest. The writing is amazing, it feels like I am reading a good novel at times. On top of it all the music is sleek and fitting to the cyberpunk setting.I do have a few complaints, I did find some bugs, while not game breaking, they were an annoyance for a bit. And while the character development is solid for most of the characters that are a part of the story, I really wish I could interact more with the runners I hire, a one sentence description of the character does not do them justice.Because of this game I am looking into playing the Pen and Paper Shadowrun as well. Overall I would highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoyed games such as Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights (if you love user made campaigns).			"

If you played the pen and paper rpg you will recognize that the rulesystem is quite different to it. Its more dumbed down. But this is not bad. Actually its a question of gamedesign. And works quite good. This game lacks so many things. No voice acting no thrilling graphic style (all graphics are handdrawn). But this game has one thing i have missed in so many games the last couple of months. The just another mission effect. I couldn't stop playing.The story is great. The writting is compelling (and there is a lot of text since there is no voice acting what so ever). It inherits the spirit of the first 2 Shadowrun rulesets. Version 1 and 2 maybe 3 with all its coolness and glory. If you ever liked the old Shadowrun, buy this masterpiece.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is an excellent, engrossing, and enjoyable tactical RPG. It does come highly recommended; sort of.When the game originally released, it came with the default campaign known as ""Dead Man's Switch"". It's enjoyable, with some memorable characters, but there were complaints about it being too linear with too much focus on straight gunplay. Now obviously, that is still available. There's also tons of mods for custom campaigns. There was a DLC for this game, called ""Dragonfall"", which was superior to the base game in almost every way. Now in order to get that, you need to purchase ""Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut"". Buying this title here will not grant you access to Dragonfall anymore, sadly. I personally recommend both titles, but at this point it would be best to wait for this title to go on sale, and pick up the seperate Dragonfall game ASAP.			"

												I was looking for different games and spotted this one on sale. I'm a huge fan of the Fallout series, especially 2. When I saw this, it instantly reminded me of the playstyle. And that's exactly how it is. The colors are amazing and vibrant, the music is wonderful and the playstyle is very, very enjoyable. That is, if you like turn-base games. It gets challenging in later missions but that's what makes it satisfying when you complete them. I only wished it had a stronger storyline, not that it's bad or anything. Maybe because I didn't play the original Shadowrun(?) I just hoped for more side missions or more areas to explore like Fallout. Overall, I give this game a 9/10. Being able to create your character and have your skills raised by karma is amazing. A lot of nostalgia and worth it!			"

												Cyberlike, tatical strategy, turn-based rpg. A lot of great things about this game however, there are a lot of flaws as well. The graphics are nice. The artwork is fantastic. The story is interesting. Shadowruns is a great series!Not to mention, the game editor produced some amazing community content.I especially love that it's compatible with my tablet pc. You don't need a keyboard to play. As a result, I spent my long subway rides progressing with the story which was a great way to pass time. However... this game is extremely linear. There are dialogue choices, but most of the time.. They don't matter. Most, if not all, dialogues end the same.Most importantly, the gameplay is extremely linear. There's not much exploration and the paths are clearly laid out for you. Adding to that, there are very very little side quests to actually do. There are just optional objectives that give you extra karma or help a little with the main quest. A little bit about the combat: Because it's turn-based, it takes a while for each battle. There's no way to speed up the process so battles often take longer than you'd expect. Adding on top of that, You can only save out of combat - Be prepared to finish or don't start it at all. Tldr;+ Interesting story+ Can be fun, depending on your own preferences+ Great time-passer+ Amazing artwork+ Great community content- Linear gameplay & plot- Linear dialogue - Slow combatDespite it all, Shadowrun Returns is a great place to introduce yourself and start the video game series.

												There are two camps that come to my mind. Those that enjoy being 'told' a story and those that enjoy 'telling' the story. If you are one who resides mostly in the camp of the former, then I tell you this:""Wait""There is absolutly no urgency in your purchase of this game, not yet anyway. The Shadowrun community needs to bolster its numbers with creative individuals, and get into crafting trinkets and stories. This game is an excellent tool to tell stories, and with the back-drop of cyber-punk in a world of magic, dragons, and elves one has many resources to craft tales of epic adventures.Now to those of the second camp, get your butts in here! We need more content, and the only way to ensure this is for you to help us in creating it. In due time, this will grow to be something absolutly amazing.

												So, finally completed this and although I liked the story, and it has the potential to contain a lot more depth than the newly released Chronicles (multiplayer support) I was a bit dissappointed that the story is quite linear, unless I am missing something here.I played through as a custom class Human, using Shotgun, Assault Rifle (both upto 6) with the maximum amount of charisma unlocked (to enable dialogue options) and some minor spirit control - for use on summon points.A lot of the extra etiquette options are null and void, each only being used once as far as I can see, and there are not many side missions, only encountered a single side mission, and one that was suggested as optional inbetween a major mission arc. (involving coyote)Combat is nice, tactical settings and options all very good - cover, scenery, summon points and ley lines adding to strategy level.The way you build your team can totally alter the playstyle you adopt, but overall you can ham fist your way through the majority of the missions with good combat skills. (with a solid main character at least)This was a real shame because although some levels were a challenge it was mainly because of a poor choice in a combat round (don't summon 3 spirits then have them go rogue woops) not because I struggled to overcome the enemies.This carried on right up until the end, again the only difficulty coming from the choice of enemy used to progress difficulty (spirits).Totally worth the time invested but I was expecting a lot more conversational choices (2 of the etiquette lines are not even used) and a LOT more side material in line with the none combat skills I only encountered 3 places in the game where I couldn't personally unlock, influence or action something because it was based on - decking, strength, or intelligence.Even race choice and stereotype seems to have little impact.I get that this is a showcase for the engine, and the ability to mod in more content is nice, but overall the vanilla campaign had a lot more potential than a basic manhunt combat run. imo "

												TL;DR - Great story/setting, great character customisation, levels/gameplay is fairly linear which restricts the RPG elements of the game, overall a really fun game, worth the money, just have to take it as it is. Before I give my thoughts on this game, I'd like to make it clear that this is the first Shadowrun game I have played, although I am aware of the franchise and it's history. (Tabletop, PC/Console games etc.)Story/Setting: The game overall is pretty solid and good fun. It has a decent story with twists and turns and an amusing ending. You encounter likeable characters and the world is a great representation of Cyberpunk, with it's own take on things with the addition of magic.  Character Customisation:You get to make your own runner at the start of the game and there is a lot to work with from melee characters, armed characters, Deckers (hackers), Riggers (drones), Mages (spells, traps, heal), Shamans (Similar to mages, can also raise spirits, creatures and demons). However where this game shines is you really have the power to go all out with one type of class or mix any of them and make a unique build of your own. (I think I got all the classes correct there. Or near enough!) I'd say this game has great potential for replay value as you could try out all the different classes avaliable, however it wouldn't be something you'd jump straight back into after compleing in my opion, as the story and levels are fairly linear.Mechanics/Gameplay:Everything works as it should in this game and I encountered no issues at all. However I would say the game is a little lacking in RPG elements in my opinion. Let's call it CRPG-Lite! (That was terrible)A couple of areas that came to mind; In conversations you do have the ability to convice, bribe and use etiquettes to persuade and win people over to your side which you would expect with an RPG, but, what I feel was lacking was that you can't really ♥♥♥♥ someone off in dialogue or make them hate you and never talk to you again like you can in some RPGs, ultimately conversations (It would appear) all have the same conclusion, you just have little things you can do here and there if you spec'd in charisma, you bribe them or have the correct etiquette.I think this is because the levels and story are fairly linear for an RPG that it can't really give you that freedom. There are oppourtunities that you can miss out on if you give the wrong responses, but in an RPG I want it to be truly diverse in the sense that I can ♥♥♥♥ up an oppurtunity and then I have to go out of my way find another way to achieve my goal/quest. This game ultimately always seems to come to the same conclusion regardless. The other major area that felt a little lacking was the combat, it has the average top down, turn based combat mechanics but I wish it was more like Wasteland 2's. You can get behind cover, but some you can't shoot around, your character literally can't step out with one foot and shoot around a doorway or down a corridor. Just a bit more control over combat and the ability to make better stratergies would have made the combat near-perfect!Other little issues I had were things like not being able to examine the environments other than what the devs wanted you to see. Lack of dialogue/text box like in most RPGs, that displays examine text, Character thoughts and NPC dialogue etc.Overall:Overall this is a really fun game, I played it through in a few days and was pretty glued to it. At first I was a little disappointed with the lack of RPG elements I'm used to, but I quickly accepted that Shadowrun is it's own thing and does it a little differently. I'm really impressed with Harebrained Schemes and that they've successfully brought back Shadowrun. Now I have Dragonfall and Hong Kong to play, and from what I hear they've been improved a lot from this game!			"

												Huge original shadowrun fan here and this game does not do the original justice. They have all the shadowrun goodness but failed on the execution. Leveling system sucks, Combat sucks. Quest/story sucks, My main problem is that it is not even OPEN world; you are forced to follow the story and you cant even explore at all every thing you do and everywhere you go is controlled by the story; its more like reading a book than playing an RPG you dont get to make any choices. I really wanted this game to be more like the original :(			"

												After wanting to play Shadowrun for the longest time, tonight I finally finished it. The game was not that long with its 12 hours of game time, and to be honest, it was quite a disillusion. After finishing Baldur's Gate 1 for the first time two weeks ago, I was looking forward to another isometric RPG. Being a big Deus Ex fan, the cyberpunk theme of Shadowrun Returns was very alluring. Being unfamiliar with the Shadowrun franchise, the mix of cyberpunk and fantasy felt weird at first. But even in the end, I can't say that I like it better. I'll try to summarize my experience with this game in a pro/con list.PRO  The 2D backgrounds are from time to time quite beautiful  The user interface was quite ok, and looked sleek  The first half of the story was interesting  Interesting combination of combat going on in the matrix and in real life at the same time.  The game worked quite well on Linux (except for the remarks below)  The game was easy to play with keyboard and mouse, but also with the Steam Controller on my TVCON  The game did not handle ""exotic"" resolutions well. 3200x1800 on my linux laptop and 3440x1440 on my desktop were not manually selectable. Log files mentioned that the game detected the native resolution but a slightly different resolution was chosen. The drop down menu never showed the native resolutions in game. Full HD on my TV was easy.  When contacting the developer's support for the issue above, no support was given. I got an email confirming that they received my email, and that's the last thing that happened.  The loading screens took quite long for a ""2D"" game. I would expect it to be faster than games like Skyrim?  Classes seem very diverse, but they don't feel diverse.   Leveling is quite boring. Not a lot changes exect for some % to hit etcetera.  Fights are repetitive because there are not a lot of different tactics (necessary). The AI is not very bright.  During combat sequences the game goes turn-based, even when all enemies are killed you still keep walking turn based until you find new enemies in the same environment. Moving your whole team person by person is very tedious.  When going on missions you pay mercs to come with you. They are not very strong or optimal in their configuration, so they felt like dead weight compared to my maxed out SMG fighter.  Hacking/Matrix sequences are very repetitive. Both for the looks of the environment and the variation in enemies and variation in weapons. I just spammed my default attack and nothing else was needed.   The game is very linear. There are not a lot of side quests and you can't explore the world on your own. There is no open world to visit.  Because of the linear gameplay and uninteresting classes, replayability suffers a lot.  The story of the game started out great. It felt like a personal story compared to the ""save the world"" kind of stories from Skyrim and company. But from the middle of the game it felt like the writers had to keep making the story more elaborate to keep the gamers interested. They created some complex and unnecessary twists that ultimately made me just click faster through the conversation options because I became uninterested.  Those conversations were often very onesided. The choices you make in conversations almost never matter. Most answers are just different forms of the same answer, making conversations very uninteresting. There is no real impact on the game.  The writing of the game is obviously inspired by the Sprawl trilogy, and tiringly so. Every sentence tries to be drearier than the last one. I like film noir and cyberpunk, but this was way too cliché at times.  The world of Shadowrun combines cyberpunk and sci-fi with fantasy. Obviously a lot of people like this, but I'm not really fond of it. It gets worse when they try to mix even more classic (cliché?) game themes in the mix: violent crazy people in an asylum, undead ghouls, monsters and even spirits!! It just lacked some pirates and vampires...  The (hand drawn?) backgrounds were nice from time to time, but they are very empty. There is not a lot of animation or interactivity. The world feels dead.  The music is nice. I mean, the 3 or 4 tracks that are constantly repeated are nice the first time. They sound perfectly in line with the cyberpunk theme, but after having it on repeat for 12 hours, I just disabled the music altogether.   The game is quite short. I finished it in about 12 hours (thoroughly reading everything), and it seems like I'm slow compared to others. Some did it in 8 hours. Sadly, I was happy that it was over.I was looking forward to play the complete Shadowrun series, but after being let down by the first installment, I just can't bring myself to buy the sequels. Even if they are better... Too bad really! I hope that the other famous tactical 2D Kickstarter games like Wasteland 2 and Pillars of Eternity can make up for this game.			"

												Shadowrun. I picked up the Pen and Paper RPG when I was younger. Sadly it took years before finding a group to play it. Luckly around my University years I found a decent group of people and we are gaming since than. I am an hardcore fan so probably my Review could be a bit biased. Frist of all I strongly suggest to read a bit before gaming. Just the ""Primer"" which is a small guide\introduction to the World of Shadowrun available from the site Shadowrun Universe (official site for all things related to Shadowrun). Once you have the Primer you can have a good idea of what to expect from the Setting. I know that at a frist glance it looks strange maybe even too much but trust me it is awesome. The more you will dig the better it will get, specially if you start to read the various RPG manuals and novels. If you liked the setting buy this game. The basic Campaign included in Shadowrun Returns is a classic. If you never rped or played Shadowrun (I am mostly referring to SNES and GENESIS Games) this is a wonderfull start. The narration is set in 2050s which is a very cool period for Shadowrun (keep in mind that in the current RP Setting the time is around 2075) and it is based on some of the hottest plots of that period. The game is a basic Turn Based Combat with RP elements in the form of dialogues where the various options depends on which skill you have. Back when it was just published the Game lacked few things like save anywhere option. Luckly this was fixed up in the 1st DLC Dragonfall. Dragonfall is even better than the basic game. The Devs listened to us Players and fixed few things and I dare to say even took inspiration from some of UGC - User generated Content (More of this later). Dragonfall can look a bit boring at the start with the logic of ""Do a Run, get back and run again"" (Run is a work, a mission in Shadowrun) but the Narration, the Plot goes always up till its end. In Dragonfall I was not impressed by the first Runs but nearby the end I could not stop to see how this Story was going to end. The only negative side of both Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall is that you can not manage your NPCs. You can select who can help you in a Run but you do not have any kind of control on their Skills and how they improve. Probably this will be fixed in future DLCs. If the basic game and the DLC are not enough there are UGCs. Shadowrun Community is very active and Devs select from time to time some UCG to play just to show up how much it is good. There are a lot of good Artist out there who are working on big UCG like remakes of SNES and Genesis Shadowrun Games. I strongly suggest to take a loot at ""Shadowrun Unlimited"". I hope all of this makes sense. In any case, if you start to play and dig into the Shadows of Shadowrun remember: ""Shoot straight, conserve your ammo and never make a deal with a Dragon"".			"

												Ive been fan of the Shadowrun ever since i first played on the Genesis and Snes and was glad to see a new iteration of it come out. The game still follows all of it rules and has a great look and story that fits the Shadowrun world great.While I still do recommend the game to fans of the Shadowrun world, it does have some really bad bugs / glitches still and wouldnt recommend it unless you love the shadowrun series.Fans of the first two fallout games might find some interest in this title as well since the combat sytem is set up very similar,although a  buggy (almost feels incomplete) version of it.Just an example of a few combat bugs to give people an idea of what thier getting into.A bug for shamans where when you summon a spirit which will cause the combat system to break and not be able to use or select any of characters during youre turn and basicly forcing you to forfeit the rest of your turn which will most likely cause a death of one of your runners.Another bug is where and enemy attacking you will shoot you through walls while you not only cannot shoot because of line sight issue and wont be able to even see the enemy untill you run around the wall.A bug where when you try to heal your drone out of combat it will say immune not heal your drone and use a repair kit.So I would say a good game for the price if your a fan of the series but if not I would probaly skip over this one.

												Really a big fan of turn-based RPGs since Fallout and Fallout 2 as well as a fan of the pencil and paper, table-top RPG game. The description and reviews are fairly accurate. The thing that really hooked me was when the game was approaching a foreseeable ending and then took a left turn at Crazy Street. Totally surprised me in a good way and extended the gameplay by a couple of hours. Looking forward to replaying as a different spec character to see if there are any other twists that I missed. After that, it's some serious contemplation on whether to buy the DLC or venture off into the user created material that seems to be free of charge. All in all, a fun, solid game with unexplored aspects awaiting.			"

												I had never played the SNES version of this game.  But I was absolutley hooked on the Sega Genesis version.  This new rendition of a classic is, to say the least, Fraggin' awesome!!  The good people at Harebrained Schemes really deliver a terrific balance of new technique and classicly proven rpg elements.  Whether your here for some good old fashioned turned based RPG combat, or to lose yourself in a great story I'd recommend this game.Game-play, controls, mechanics all come pretty standard with this game.  Its a ""tutorial-while-you-play"" learning curve.  The dev's manage to balance it decently.  If youre new to RPG's, and turn-based combat, you might have a slight up hill battle learning the in's and out's of the game.  But if your a fly by fan, or hardcore RPG junkie, you'll find it easy and intuitive. Again, I highly recommend it! "

												Funded this game back when the kickstarter campaign was around. Spent $10, and would gladly spend $20+ on it. Granted, I am a long-time shadowrun fan, but it's a great game for rpg fans.While the graphics may not be the greatest, and the original story was pretty good at best (the Dragonfall DLC definitely makes up for it, it's another game in itself), what really makes up for it is all the user generated content that is coming out. A reboot of the snes title was the first project I saw pop up, and have been following since.Shadowrun Unlimited, is more of a non-linear style of game. I'm only a couple of hours into it, but there is so much more to it than the original game (more cyberware, more programs to be used in cyberspace, etc.), and it has much more replayability (random missions) than the original game.That's just a couple of mods that I've been keeping an eye on, and there's plenty more where those came from.If you like turn-based strategy, with both mystical (magic, dwarves, elves, etc.) and futuristic elements, it's most definitely worth picking up.

												Back in my SNES days, Shadowrun was by far my favourite game.  These days, that's the only game that really sticks in my mind when I think back to playing that console.  Over the years I have tracked where the game was going.  Horrified that Microsoft bought the rights, but thought maybe they'll do something good with it.  Nope.  2007, I saw it was just another first-person shooter, not tied to the Shadowrun universe, I sadly concluded there was no chance of ever seeing another Shadowrun game like the one on SNES.  Guess I'll have to install a SNES emulator and play the original (never got around to it).Then I was cruising around Google Play last week, when Shadowrun Returns showed up on my recommended list.  OHHHH.... darn.  No tablet.  Yet.  But tis on Steam, and it works on Linux.  REJOICE!  I tried it for a few hours and so far it's looking great.  I played both the Dead Man's Switch campaign provided by Harebrained Schemes, and a story someone is putting together to replicate the SNES version.Thanks Microsoft for giving the game's rights back to Jordan Weisman!  Thanks Jordan and HBS for bringing back the world of Shadowrun to our screens!  Thanks  Kickstarter for the campaign to fund HBS' development.  Thanks all who provided funding!  Had I known the campaign existed last year, I would've contributed for sure.			"

That's how addicted you become to the storyline, and playability of this game.It very similar to fallout ( the first one ), all isometric views, and despite some critics, i liked the graphics a lot. The ambients are wonderful, the conversations are well-thought, and you do feel you're in some crazy society, all the way through. The gameplay is extremely simple, but you've got a miriad of choices along the way. Most of ( if not all ) of the puzzles have several different ways to be solved, depending on how you build your character, or your gaming style.You can hack stuff, use your charms and talk your way, shoot it, sneak it, however you want.From a troll bouncer that's as polite and philosophical as ever, to a psychotic ugly elf, you're gonna get surprised by this game.

												I really enjoy the fact that Shadowrun is back.  I played Shadowrun on the SNES and the Sega, and always hoped that we would get another chance at this game. Most of the UGC is really cool, combat is fun I think that the turn based style works quite well for the game. The DLC so far has been fun but at times it feels like the DLC is geared more towards a decker.  While this is not a down side; it does lead to some hard choices, still no matter what I am having a blast with it.  I'd say if you haven't played the orginal games, or the Tabletop RPG you should give this game a chance. If you have played the orginal games or the RPG, get it! I'm hoping that we get more DLC for this game and I look forward to what UGC comes out for it. Minor beefs are some of the essence costs and we don't see much in the ways of Betaware or Delta grade cyberware, of course this could change as time passes.			"

												Don't let others bad reviews dissuade you from picking up this title. True, the main campaign is shallow and linear, but it exists as an example of the cool stuff you can do with this game. I spent a lot of the eighties obsessed with cyberpunk and a lot of the nineties playing Shadowrun, and I love this game. The real benefits to this title will be apparent once the community starts churning out campaigns. 8/10			"

												Amazing. Incredible. Mind-blowing. If you liked Fallout 1&2 and you liked the old-school Shadowrun of the Genesis, then this is a no-brainer. The expansion (Dragonfall) is also a full-length game that took me just as long as the original to complete. Many of the imperfections of the original were handled in the Dragonfall expansion. This goes in my top-ten list of best games of my generation.			"

												Truely brilliant; a fantastic blend of gameplay and story set in a fantastically realised world that breaks so many rules of fantasy/sci-fi but then spits in your face and continues to pull it off flawlessly. Every moment in this unfortunately short game builds the world of Shadowrun into one of the most believable and ridiculous mash ups of fantasy and cyberpunk ever. It is unique and engrossing from beginning to end.Pros:Seriously brilliant story, seriously brilliant world. There's not another like it.Great tactical gameplay and RPG character progression that is simple to understand and lets you build whatever character you choose; be it an elf who snipes their distant enemies and throws fireballs at their closer targets, or a troll who hacks computers and controls robot drones with his mind.Cons:Short. Like this list.Highly recomended.			"

												If you like story, turn based combat or having a plethora of community made adventures to play after you beat the excellent campaign, then buy this game. Its damn near perfect in my opinion, but i said ""near"", theres really only two major grips I have with Shadowrun Returns, Firstly, the progression in terms of equipment is little more than a linear stat progression, Secondly, the cybernetices are,in my opinion, boring and un-intresting, nothing more than adding bonus stats, theres no cybernetics that add abilities(outside of the datajack) or new attacks, they could have done more with cybernetics(like chainsaw arms or a cloaking implant. But neither of these grips interfered in my enjoyment of the game, I still heartly recommend Shadowrun Returns, wheter or not you like shadow run, Buy Shadowrun returns.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a tactical strategy rpg which functions similar to the X-Com or UFO series games, set in the Shadowrun universe. Pros: *Nice Artstyle*Simple yet effective combat and skill system, allows you to more or less build your ""class"" by picking which stats and skills you want to learn.*Lands the Shadowrun Universe pretty wellCons:*Very short playthrough (core game, not the Shadowrun: Dragonfall expansion)*This game is very easy on ""normal"". I recommend to anyone that has played the genre before to play on the hardest difficulties.*Could use more weapons/armor/configuration. I kept feeling like there should be another drop or weapon coming soon... and it never does.Overall: 7/10Fun game, looks nice, but it's very short and could use more content and story. I am about 5-6 hours in (2 did not get recorded by Steam), and I would say according to the chapter list on most websites I'm about 75% through the game. I am looking forward to trying the expansion however, and I will update my review when I get the chance. Many reviews for the expansion title seem to point out that it's a bit more complete and a touch longer than the core campaign.I would purchase this game again, since I bought it on sale... but I don't think I would pay full price for it. This is a good pickup if you catch it on sale, and if so I would grab the expansion to go with it, otherwise the game may feel a bit incomplete.			"

												A great game, lovingly recreated to resemble the old super nintendo game I used to love.  The turn based gameplay works really well and the karma system for levelling up gives limited scope so decisions must be made carefully, rather than having a fully levelled up character before too long.  Dead Mans Switch felt linear and the responses felt as though they didn't really change the game outcome much, however the expansion, Dragonfall, addresses many issues including the ability to save anywhere.  Dragonfall is a much more honed Shadowrun campaign in my opinion and deserves an applause for the production team who clearly thought hard about the game story and characters.  A triumph.			"

												Overall, I would give this game a 9/10. Everything is fantastic, and I cannot wait to play Dragonfall someday and also play player-created campaigns. I am also inspired to pick up the paper and pen version of Shadowrun, as well as Shadowrun Online. It's just that Dead Man's Switch became quite disappointing. Just take it out, or give the players more freedom, and everything here would be stellar.*****Now for ***SPOILERS*** Kind of.*****I have not played Dragonfall, so this review is of the main campaign, Dead Man's Switch. I really enjoy pretty much every aspect of this game--the environment, combat, characters, atmosphere, etc.--except for the main story. Despite getting very interested in the storyline after the first few lines were presented to me, almost all of my excitement was lost when the Ripper was revealed. I was having fun treating DMS as a murder mystery; I was carefully examining everything and trying to figure out who the Ripper could be--I even had some evidence to support who I thought could be the Ripper--but the game pretty much points a huge sign at the real suspect from the moment they are introduced, and this is overwhelmingly disappointing. The other side of the story after the reveal doesn't even make much sense.			"

												My playthough was about 15 hours total. I went with a Troll who specialized in unarmed combat, and I really enjoyed the powerful hits that would sometimes one-shot enemies. Running into combat like a berserker was quite satisfying too, but  most of the time I would end up taking a lot of damage.  It was a little annoying not being able to get all the little secrets that require decking skills, but I managed just fine without the extra stuff.Pro:  Lots of community contentLots of class/race options and tons of ways to build a character, and lots of spells/skillsWell-executed turn-based combat with a cover system akin to X-COMGreat story that pulls you into the world of Shadowrun (very text-heavy, enjoyable for those who like to read)Con:The RNG seems off sometimes (e.g. a 90% chance to hit might fail three times in a row)The story is very linear, and there isn't a new-game+ option "

												Shadowrun returns was a kickstarter project that gained traction rather fast, although like most kickstarters this was due to nostalgia. This game stands on its own extremely well.Shadowrun returns is a cyberpunk fantasy tactical rpg, which in retrospective sounds absurd but its an idea that works really well and is amplified by the impressive dungeons and dragons art style.Typical for an RPG you level up with points gained from battles but what you put your points into in this case either help you or hinder you.Upgrades are apart of the experience and have a tradeoff mechanic, sacrificing one thing to gain something else, but comes into play later in the game.During my time with the game the battles were more interesting than the story and in an rpg story should be just as important as the rest of the game.The game stands on its own legs and is a good experience for someone who enjoys strategic rpg games and/or cyberpunk settingsRating: 8.5/10			"

												A tale of two halves.The first half is a basic-yet-intriguing cyberpunk XCOM-lite game. The second is a tedious, monotonous, dragged-out affair that completely spoils everything and made me very glad it was only $2.50 when I picked it up.PROS-Crisp art style that lends itself fairly well to the setting-Some interesting characters (kind of)-The music is decent the first time around-Neat outfits-It's less than ten hours....CONS-Environments/levels are 99% static and lifeless-The dialogue/script is wildly inconsistent in terms of style, going from grandiose to vernacular at will. It's like two or three different guys were writing without consulting the design document. Then at the end they were just like ""♥♥♥♥ it, too hard to redo all this work""-After a couple hours, the music grates-Combat is far too simple to be enjoyable for long-Lack of cool loot/drops-Exceedingly linear-Most characters are neat at first but then it becomes obvious there's no depth-The narrative takes a wild shift in the second half, and it's not for the betterment of the game-The second half is only more difficult because gobs of enemies are thrown at you, rather than anything clever or original-Puzzles can all be solved by holding down Alt to see what few things are interactive-Terrible ending that made me uninstall immediately after closing the game-Along with the tonal shifts, most of the scant humor isn't funny, and the cyberpunk/Shadowrun terms were used in a tryharding manner rather than making sense or adding atmosphere-Lots of typos and generally-lazy writing-Decking is uselessly dullOverall it's a game that starts out strong and finishes way after boredom sets in. The combat is stale with little-to-no tactical depth, and level design is so narrow-sighted and basic that I can't help but think these guys are out of their league. And this is from someone who views cyberpunk as the best genre in all of media.			"

												The Dragonfall expansion single-handedly did justice to Shadowrun Returns. The Dragonfall campaign build brings a much more involving and intricate storyline, choices, side-missions and memorable NPC companions, resulting in longer gameplay and satisfaction compared to the 12-hour long original. There were certain tweaks to the mechanics of the core game, it seems. For example, there will no longer be extra action points garnered from cybernetics, but this is compensated for via game balancing. There are new portraits to choose from (though still quite limited visual customization) but no changes to the skill trees. Games can be saved at almost every point of the game now, not just at savepoints, so that's another step forward. There are new music scores with this campaign, and they all set the mood satisfactorily for the throughout the gameplay. I still find the beats from the original campaign more to my liking, but that's personal opinion. Some issues inherent in the original was still present in this one. Missing sprites, limitations to allocating picked-up items to teammates outside of combat and the occassional AP bug can still be encountered. However, I would not personally hold this against the expansion as this one is does seem like the developer's turn of churning out an AAA campaign using the same builder tools made available to the community. I grew up playing and loving role-playing games that were akin to reading sci-fi fantasy book sets. After Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Arcanum and Neverwinter Nights, I am relieved to be able to add Shadowrun Returns into my collection of RPG games worth the ages. To enjoy this one, you'll have to read, children, and dig into your storeroom for that old thing called an 'active imagination'. If Shadowrun Returns left you feeling wanting, then Dragonfall will bring you past dessert.			"

												If you're a Shadowrun fan, or at least have some experience with the old SNES and/or Genesis games (the 2006 Xbox one doesn't count), this is worth picking up. Shadowrun Returns plays like XCOM with more RPG elements and without the punishing difficulty that is a hallmark of that series. The story is full of references and inside jokes that will render fans of the series nostalgic, but even if you're new to the series, important concepts and characters are explained at least adequately enough for the story to make sense. My one complaint is that the story, which is fairly short, is extremely linear and offers virtually no sidequesting. However, this game is meant to be just one ""campaign"" in the Shadowrun setting, and the real replay value lies in the editor, which allows players to create their own adventures and share them with the world. Despite its linearity and lack of meaningful choices for the player to make, I say buying it is justified by its low price tag. I hope this game helps give the Shadowrun setting more publicity, because it's definitely unique and worth investigating.			"

												Great game! I've never reviewed one before, but I think this a real hidden gem. The graphics are lush and immersive, player creation is simple but very detailed. The abilities, classes, and combat are very true to the paper and pencil Shadowrun RPG (which is great). NPC dialog and dialog response options are some of the best I've ever seen in a game. They really went all out with this one, even more impressive because it was made by a realtively small developer (I'm going to look for more games from Harbrained after playing this).Best feature of all though, great TURN-BASED rpg combat. Reminiscent of some of the best rpgs ever made, but with gorgeous graphics thrown in. I would recommend the Dragonfall scenario too, just because this game is so good, one story isn't enough!Also, I got the core game on sale for just $5, literally best five dollars I've ever spent!The dev team really hit it out of the park on this one, I'll be looking for more of your games and any future kickstarters you do, please keep up the amazing work!

For me it wasn't a big problem since English is not my native language but i think many native-English gamers will find it annoying .The gameplay machanics are good but have small problems that can be annoying at times .Some of them are technical (like when you set the character to overwatch a certain enemy/area and then it goes out of the previously set range and waste a bullet and an AP point) and some of them are design flaws (like being forced to traverse a whole floor in battle mode even if there is no enemy left) .For the game design in general i really wished that the developers have reused the previously visted locations for side-missions to increase the game time and value because in the end this is an RPG game and not COD .This game have its flaws but i was able to look past them and enjoy it .That's why i'm recommending it .

												Shadowrun Returns is a decent CRPG that has definite bona fides back to the isometric giants of ages past.  The content is well written and fits the universe it's set in.  The combat is fun, if a bit less than challenging and less common then you'd hope.The game does feel a bit ""on rails"", however, especially when compared to the games it harkens back to.  This isn't the utter gigantism of something like Baldur's Gate.  The game is pretty small, the party options are limited (you only get to allocate stats and alter the inventory of the main character, for example).  I bought SRR during the steam summer sale.

												Shadowrun Returns is a surprisingly addictive isometric cyberpunk RPG. The combat has enough tactical depth to keep you on your toes, but the real strength to this game is the story. The dialogue between characters is both interesting and meaningful, often making use of slang specific to the Shadowrun universe which aids immersion. The game does feel quite linear at times and conversational options are often inconsequential, but it doesn't detract from the experience thanks to engaging storyline. I'm genuinely surprised at the quality of the game, especially when consideration is given to the asking price. I think anyone looking for a modern take on old-school RPG'ing would be wise to try Shadowrun.Note: ignore the playtime, my shadowrunning was done offline.			"

												I've never played the Shadowrun tabletop RPG, those aren't my bag. I did love the Shadowrun game on SNES that I played as a kid. This game brings a good blend of nostaglia for that previous title in a similar, but updated look, but it definitely also takes advantage of lessons learned in gaming in the intervening years. Combat in both the real world and while dekking is intuitive and easy to grasp. There are a number of skill tree options to monkey with, but not so many as to require a spreadsheet. Overall I found the game to be a satisfying experience, not terribly difficult, but that's not what I was looking for here anyway. Good times, definitely worth picking up if you enjoyed the old SNES game or the trailer to this one appeals to you.			"

												The Dead Man's Switch(DMS) campaign is forgettable and is only notable for having an annoying enemy that can only be killed with a cumbersome mechanic. There are a handful of interesting interactions during DMS but overall its honestly not worth playing through and can be easily skipped.Dragonfall(DF), on the other hand, is awesome and is filled with characters and scenarios that are as imaginative, well written,  and worth exploring as some of the best RPGs that I have ever played. DF additionally contains a much better structure than DMS, by that I mean rather than having a linear quest with hardly any side branches that you undertake with some flavorless NPCs, DF tasks you with a central goal and allows you to lead a team of fairly unique characters along a questline that has scores of opportunity to explore more of the world of Shadowrun. I enjoyed the vast majority of my time with DF, save for the hacking bits (called decking in this universe), and some later game fights with some annoyingly powerful enemies. Altough, I wholeheartedly recommend DF, Its a shame that you have to buy both to play DF but since thats the case I would advise that you buy the campaigns at a reduced cost and skip DMS.			"

												Gameplay is topnotch Tactical RPG stuff. Its fun to make your character however you'd like them, and the skills are laid out in a straightforward way. Spell variety leaves a little bit left to be desired, and I personally wouldve liked greater variety for implants, but is all in all very solid. Storyline for the default game, called ""The Deadman's Switch"" is boring and linear, and you dont spend a long enough amount of downtime to talk to and connect with your party members. Also playing a decker is a waste of time as theres very few times you actually get to enter the Matrix. Hold your hand too much and feels shallow because of itThe DLC, Dragonfall, fixes the above problems. It starts a bit linear just like before, but theres multiple ways to clear any area, as well as plenty of time between missions to talk with your fellow Shadowrunners. The plot is much more interesting and there are more ways to use your character's skills, both in the field, and in dialogue choices. The game opens up and you get to start taking missions of your own accord, with each having a small storyline within its own mission.Theres also a metric crapton of great workshop content out for the game, which I think will add tremendously to the games longevity.Bottomline, buy this game, and buy it with the DLC.

The DLC/expansion Dragonfall, however, is absolutely fantastic, and is completely unrelated to the core campaign.  It's one of the better written RPGs I've ever played.  The characters are great, the story is interesting, the decisions are difficult, and although the ""epilogue"" is a little weak, the overall ending was solid.  I heartily recommend Dragonfall to any RPG enthusiast and especially to anyone who has ever been curious to explore the Shadowrun setting.			"

You follow a group of shadowrunners led by your character, and the game really makes you familiar with everyone. All species of sentient beings have their own ways of speaking and there are very little stereotypical characters. Strong female leads, strong male leads, and all around strong side characters. Dead Man's Switch overplayed the in world slang a little bit too much, but Dragonfall made it very easy to get what certain words mean.Overall: 4/5			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a game I find hard to give excessive praise, but it's a game that I also find hard to dislike. When it comes down to it, it's a completely solid game, even if it's shallow. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and feel fully satisfied with the experience, and I didn't have any trouble playing all the way through. There are certainly some notable flaws, however.Let's start with the story, since this game relies heavily on it's writing to motivate the player. The writing and characterization is good, I felt very absorbed in the universe, but the story itself is fairly lacking. It's a shame as well, it starts out great. You got a murder mystery with a lot of interesting faces dying to be talked to, with a few twists and turns here and there. The problem is that it just doesn't developed. It feels extremely rushed. The characters are lovable and relatable to the very end, but I started skipping through dialogue that dealt with the actual plot about 2/3rds through the game. It escalates in a comical direction, with an extremely weak and one-dimensional villian. It's extremely predictable, and just plain boring. The last stretch is so typical and lackluster that I had little to no investment in the actual plight, I just wanted to see if the characters would drop some more interesting backstory about themselves. It gave me closure, but it's not memorable at all. It's just too bad, the beginning was really good, but the plot started going so fast in such a linear direction that it forgot to flesh itself out, leaving some questions unanswered and plot points underdeveloped. It got the job done, but I was hoping for more.Where the game really shines are the characters and their own personal issues. Almost all the staple characters have their own personal motives and vendettas, and I was interested in all their stories. I enjoyed going back to base and talking to every single one of them that were willing to open their mouths. The game does a fantastic job of setting up this belonging feeling, that you're part of this organization of runners. Although, as I stated before, as the game escalates it leaves behind this deep characterization in order to fawn over its own hilariously absurd and out-of-place world-threatening dilemma.The combat is serviceable. It's ultimately shallow and linear, there isn't a lot of variation or depth, and there are some balance issues. But it's still fun, you get to characterize some characters simply by their fighting styles. It's too easy as well, but not game-ruiningly so. It's fun, if you really like X-COM-like turn based combat, you'll probably enjoy it if you can stand it being a tad shallow.The game is overall fun, I would recommend it. It doesn't really have any offending flaws, it just doesn't quite reach the large potential it could've. It's not particularly memorable, but it's enjoyable. I would wait for a sale, but when the price is suitable to you, I'd say to go for it just to get immersed in the world.			"

												A good old school RPG with tactical battle. True (as much as it can) to the univers of Shadowrun (cyperpunk). Sadly the game is very short - which mean not a lot of different skills & weapons, and it don't take full oportunity of the wonder that is the matrix.To really enjoy the game, you're going to have to use the mods and campaigns created by other players - or create them yourself !In short : good game, worth it's price (especially if you play mods), but the main campaign fail to use the game mechanisms to its fullest.

												Ignore the Metacritic rating.  This is a fun RPG with a great storyline and setting.  No it doesn't have cut-scenes and gigs of bad voice acting, what it does have is a great story and excellent writing!			"

												My only experience with Shadowrun before this game was the first-person shooter version. I never knew that Shadowrun was so rich and immersive. If you're a fan of the original Fallouts and/or XCOM then you'll enjoy Shadowrun. Dragonfall enhances the game so much more.			"

												Once I sorted out the crashing issues, (Thanks to this website http://shadowrun-returns.wikispaces.com/Troubleshooting+FAQ, I did the ""Audio Problems"" fix, and run the game in 1024x768) the game works fine. I will admit I never played any of the older versions, but Shadowrun Online has been on my wish list for a while and when I seen Shadowrun Returns for under $5 (I love you Steam Summer Sale), I snapped it up quick. After playing for only 15 mins, I was sad I never played the older versions, and I was doubly sad I never even heard about the Shadowrun series until this year.As for this iteration of the Shadowrun series, I was blown away, when one of the NPC's feels an urgency to get a mission done, that sense of urgency if felt by the player too. I'm looking your way Paco.The sound effects are really well put together, there is something satisfying about beaning a thug over the head with a baseball bat and that bone on wood sound chimes in......... (Makes note to get more baseball bats in game.)The dreary, miserable, wet, outside world is not only a joy (in the sense it feels real) to walk around in, it is also a joy to explore and talk to the locals and see how downtrodden they are as well.The loading screen DM style scene setting briefs even make the game feel like you could almost be playing the tabletop version with a friend over the weekend.Game play 10/10Graphics 10/10Music 10/10SFX 10/10Atmosphere 15/10All in All 10/10 will spend WAY to many hours playing.

												This review is for Shadowrun Unlimited....a dlc created by Southwind. Basically, this add on takes Shadowrun Returns & makes it the game it should have been. Don't get me wrong, SR is a very good game in itself but it tells a very linear story that takes around 12 hrs to complete. What Southwind did was take the basic gameplay & created a sandbox like game that a lot of fans of the table top version were hoping for. In Unlimited you have a back story of avenging your brother but while trying to accomplish this you have to become an experienced runner first. To accomplish this you start gaining contacts for different job types you can choose from such as being a bodyguard, cleaning up problems, asassination & delivery jobs. You also meet other runners which you can contact to help you on the different jobs you take on. You have  a lot more different areas you can travel to & different options to complete your missions. I've played about 4 hrs at the time of this review & I am still working on just building my character up for better jobs. That is what makes Unlimited so much better than SR....it gives you a feeling of being in the Shadowrun world rather then just getting to the end of a story.Unlimited introduces some very cool game elements that expands on the game & helps make you feel even more in this world. You can rent different safehouses to heal between missions & store your gear. You also have 3 new ""stats"" to check on. Street cred, which affects the quality of missions you can get. There is noteriety, which can cause you problems with the different gangs & corps. Lastly, there is heat. This one is for how the Lone Stars (cops) treat you.My understanding (this is the best part) is that there is no ""end game"" for this. Southwind & others are working to continually expand on what is already in play by adding more missions, maps & characters. My only hope is that once the backstory is finished a new one will take it's place. The only downside to this game is I don't think you can import an already created character but it is definately worth starting a new one for this.In closing I feel that Unlimited took what the dev's put together & made it so much better. If you already have SR than this is a must have. If not but were thinking about it Unlimited should give you that little push to get the original just so you can jump into this excellently done add on. Oh, by the way, Unlimited (not Shadowrun Returns) is free.			"

												A solid game. I would recommend it for all those:1) Who like classic RPG2) Who like turn based combat3)Who like to follow a storyIf you like the Shadowrun setting, then it is a must.Shortcommings: The visuals are outdated but they do the job. The mechanics could be a bit deeper. The missions are linear.			"

												One of the best turn based rpgs out there.  Rivals FF Tactics in terms of gameplay and story.  Found myself enjoying this game much more than I thought I would.  The writing is fantastic, but mind you there is a lot of reading.  If you dislike dialogue you may want try something else. I, for one, love a good story so the reading doesn't bother me.			"

												Awesome game with a lot of classic Shadowrun references.  Very atmospheric, the main campaign is engaging but a little short.  After investigating every nook and cranny of the mostly linear map it took 20 hours to complete the campaign.			"

												This is one of the best RPGs I've ever played. If you like the SNES SR and you like Shadowrun in general this is probably going to eat some time up. It also has a DLC campaign that is WORTH the money. All in all running through the story mode linear took about 18 hours. The community content can keep you busy for 100s of hours. 10 times better than most indie games that are getting a lot more cred and hype than this game.

The pros far outweigh the cons. Any TBS fan is sure to enjoy this title. Well worth the reasonable price tag.			"

												The Dragonfall expansion single-handedly did justice to Shadowrun Returns. The Dragonfall campaign build brings a much more involving and intricate storyline, choices, side-missions and memorable NPC companions, resulting in longer gameplay and satisfaction compared to the 12-hour long original. There were certain tweaks to the mechanics of the core game, it seems. For example, there will no longer be extra action points garnered from cybernetics, but this is compensated for via game balancing. There are new portraits to choose from (though still quite limited visual customization) but no changes to the skill trees. Games can be saved at almost every point of the game now, not just at savepoints, so that's another step forward. There are new music scores with this campaign, and they all set the mood satisfactorily for the throughout the gameplay. I still find the beats from the original campaign more to my liking, but that's personal opinion. Some issues inherent in the original was still present in this one. Missing sprites, limitations to allocating picked-up items to teammates outside of combat and the occassional AP bug can still be encountered. However, I would not personally hold this against the expansion as this one is does seem like the developer's turn of churning out an AAA campaign using the same builder tools made available to the community. I grew up playing and loving role-playing games that were akin to reading sci-fi fantasy book sets. After Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Arcanum and Neverwinter Nights, I am relieved to be able to add Shadowrun Returns into my collection of RPG games worth the ages. To enjoy this one, you'll have to read, children, and dig into your storeroom for that old thing called an 'active imagination'. If Shadowrun Returns left you feeling wanting, then Dragonfall will bring you past dessert.			"
