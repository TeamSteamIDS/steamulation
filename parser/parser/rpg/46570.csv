												Can I just point out that I played this offline for a few days so Steam hasn't recorded the fact that I've actually put about 10h into this gameHmmm. I played the 1st one, out of desperation - it was the only game I had installed on my PC that I hadn't clocked, and that was unlocked - didn't need an online key for - in a week where I had no internet. It was fine, passable. It had it's flaws, but it was passable.This particular installation, however, I am sorry that it is not. I liked the corny story of the first one - except for the ending where you get killed by a freaking mushroom in a cutscene thing . That part of the story was meant to be corny irony, but they didn't really pull it off. Pros:The graphics are much better, and the maidens really are something to look at now. Thumbs up for that.Cons:They took everything that worked in v1, and messeed with it.There is tons of back-and-forth in these missions, they are less linear - where you would be transported to an area with a defined goal in the first, now you have to keep going back to places you have already visited repeatedly to unock a tiny bit more of the map at a time, usually by talking to some guy and doing something with the last guy so that you can talk to the next guy. I got tedious at about the point that I quit.The control scheme is ruined. It's harder to navigate. This is merely a side-effect of...They changed the camera angle. Now you can rotate the camera, but you can see less (the camera is too close) with a more isometric / top down view, you feel really restricted after playing the previous game. It's painful.The story is long winded and drawn out. With the first it was always just action action action - back to base to heal - teleport to some more bad guys - Now it's go back to the other side of the map, talk to some girl, got tot eh other side of the map, talk to some other girl, steal her chicken, go to the other side of the map, hug some trees, go to the other side of the map, cook the chicken, go to the other side of the map, talk to some girl and give her the cooked chicken, go to the middle of the map, talk to some girl to join your party, go back to the tree hugging place, talk to some girl... Oh goody! a mission! I only discovered halfway through the 1st game that there are a limited number of potions in the world... that is to say, once you have bought the shop (wizard) out, that's it, you can't get any more. I discovered this just in time to really start conserving them for the invetible boss-battle. So glad I did. If i'd had none, at the final boss I'd have needed to have replayed the entire game again, conserving health as best I could. That would'a happened, sure. Same messed up scheme here.OH THIS IT THE WORST PART: The battles where you have to protect some NPC - So you get into a fight, right? (yeah, finally). but you gotta take this gimp with you that you have no control over. He is an idiot, too. He rushes in headlong in some random direction, and if you don't keep up with him, he'll go in 1v6 Solo, and die:Game Over -Try Agia. If you do keep up with him, he'll rush in and try and play meatshield so you gotta take out the guys he's fighting. but as soon as you do, he will rush straght for the next batch. Remember that some of your strongest guys in your party are very slow (can move very few tiles per turn) and the more you protect him (kill the guys doing damage to him) the further from your best characters he runs, making it harder and harder to fight these... Oh he's dead:Game Over - Try Again. That is of course presuming that you can follow him at all - when he starts goig for it, you don't even always know where he runs off to - the fight may be over several screen-widths, and you may be trying to move one of the slower characters up toward the battle when it's won, so he rushes off on his own, you don't even see where he goes, so you run foward to find him only for him to have doubled back and gone the other way... on his own...   This wouldn't be quite so bad if it didn't swicth between a free-roam mode when out of combat and a turn-based mode when in combat. I can't be bothered explaining why, except that he can get into trouble faster than you can get to him. Yay.That's pretty much all that I can think of at the moment, but the combination of drivel, tedious and unexciting mini-missions, restricted camera views, and scuicidal NPC's in battles are what broke it for me.

												The first Grotesque Tactics was an amusing combination of Tactics and RPG with gaming satire. If you enjoyed the first, I think you will really like this one as well; it carries with it pretty much everything you may have liked and in fact improves upon the graphics, adds fully voiced dialogue (which I thought was surprisingly well done), familiar as well as new characters, new and more abilities and accessories, and lots of new places to explore and monsters to battle. Really the only thing I thought was a downgrade was that the camera feels zoomed in closer, but it is still manageable and you can rotate it freely at least. Definitely recommend!			"

												I love this game, I just started playing it and can't stop. I love the story and I also love the characters    in th game, also I love the funny humor sayings through out the game. I probably would have not tired this game, if it was not on sale. One, being I never heard of it and second I might have not tired it out. But it is very well worth the money and it is even better if it is on sale. This is the best game I brought so far for only 2 bucks. I am very happy. The only thing I really don't like is that there is no mini map. The dungeons are easy to navigate through but in were the princess is, it is a bit confusing on where you have been or not and it does suck that there is no way points to tell you really where to go or start with first. But I guess you just got to read them and pay attention to the people you talk to and what they say and you should be fine. I really recommend the game especially for people who love rpgs. I love rpgs and this one of them I like so far.			"

												Grotesque Tactics 2 is a worthy successor to GT1, a game I really enjoyed because of it's humor and the fact that  being a Straretgy RPG, it wasn't too hard to play at all.GT2 continues being funny, though it's not just a parody anymore, but a full fledged RPG on its own. One has to admit though that the turn-based battles may be too easy at times, but what keeps up the enjoment I had, were nice colorful characters and the fun the game made of popular RPG themse (e.g.""heroes amnesia""). Of course, a lot more fun is there for those who played the first one, but after all I think it can be enjoyed on it's own.  "

IntroductionGrotesque Tactics 2  - Dungeons and Donuts is developed by Headup Games and Silent Dreams while being published by Headup Games. It is indeed a fortunate case of a sequel done right, since it improves certain areas in which its predecessor was lacking. GameplayJust like in Evil Heroes, we have a hybrid that intertwines elements from both role play and strategy games. Outside of combat, you have an inventory system (filled with ludicrous items in tone with the game’s subplots) and conversations with NPCs that feature multiple choices, as any self-respecting role playing game would have. When you do have to fight, the action takes place in standard turn-based strategy mode: allocated action points which can be spent on either movement within a tile set pattern, or by attacking/defending. Only during combat, you can access the inventories of your unlikely allies and equip them as the situation warrants it. Speaking of friendly characters which join you temporarly or not, they are just as over the top as they were in Grotesque Tactics 1. Once again we can relish in the company of “His Semidivine Humble Self”, the Holy Avatar (the perfect caricature to any paladin/goody two shoes type of personality found in most RPGs) and his scarcely clad Maidens (another well implemented moment of self-irony). And you still control a world-weary emo goth kid that breaks the mold from conventional video game heroes or even antiheroes. If storywise no flaws can be reported, the gameplay did suffer from quite a few pathfinding problems that relate directly to NPC movement. I did have to save and load the game to resume play after an ally blocked my path and refused to step aside. Isolated cases but if they weren’t pactched by now, you must be fully prepared to accept some minor issues. Luckly, the solution was simple enough and the game’s main plot keeps you guessing what new silly quest you shall embark upon next.Released just one year after its predecessor, Grotesque Tactics 2  - Dungeons and Donuts looks more than decent for a 2011 release. The textures are well detailed, asset variety is present and even the voice acting seems to have improved (or at least the audio quality). While many sequels that span over a short time frame, are mostly just graphical rehashes, in Dungeons and Donuts we have a new and well deserved game engine that is far better than the first game in the series from the stability perspective as well. I had no more resolution or scaling issues with it and I could take as many screenshots through the Steam Overlay as I pleased. A job well done from a dev team that clearly wants to improve its creation. Pros+ Even more satirical than the first one+ Pleasant blend of story-driven TBS/RPG elements+ Steam Achievements (Store Page doesn’t mention this)Cons- Occasional pathfinding issues- No Steam Trading CardsResult / Final thoughtsIt goes without saying, that if you enjoyed Grotesque Tactics: Evil Heroes, you can’t go wrong with Dungeons and Donuts either. Since the stories are just barely related to one another (apart from the recurring characters) you can safely just pick up this sequel and enjoy its unusual portrayal of a fantasy world that is fully aware of its absurdity. There aren’t many games on the Steam Store that can be both self-ironic and fun at the same time.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA titles.

												As much as I liked the first Grotesque Tactics game and recommended it, I cannot recommend this one.  As a sequel it's just too unpolished.  It should have been an improvement on the first game.  I don't think it was.The path finding is awful.  Sometimes I find the hero bouncing around between his own teammates instead of moving.  It happens enough to be annoying.  Uncontrolled members run off in the opposite direction and start combats.  There's no way you can stop them.More annoying, however, is the lack or direction and description in quests.  The quest journal is unorganized and minimalistic at best.  Some people might prefer seeking out and talking to every single NPC again when trying to advance the story line.  I don't.   So this might just be personal preference, but there are a few quests that don't even tell you where to go.  In others the area is named incorrectly.  I searched several areas before I found the right one.It's probably better the second time through.  I might try it again now that I know where to go.If you are really a fan of the first game you'll probably still like it.  I have to give it a thumbs down, though, as a disappointment.			"

												The game starts out very good and sadly gets worse over the duration.+ Fun dialogues (mostly)+ loveable characters+ interesting combat- lots of bugs that render (side)quests unable to play- Game cant keep up with the great first hour of gaming...- Some dialogues in the game are not translated and thus produce an error.- Combat ist not challenging at all. Not dying even once during the whole game is very likely.Considering the extremley low price, this game makes for some great fun while waiting for better games =) "

												GT is back and as funny as ever. This time fully voice acted in English. Continue Cake's adventures as he sets out to save the Kingdom of Glory once again in a world filled with videogame parodies, maidens and a complete lack of fourth wall. Is Holy Avatar still there? Why of course! His semidivine Humble Self has formed his own exlusive female only guild, the Holy Avatar Fan Club. ^^ What are you waiting for? You're playing Skyrim? Pffft. Why so serious?			"

												Improved gameplay, plus the stereotipical humor drips sardonic from your system's speakers thanks to the unexpected, yet oh so welcome, voice acting.  Sure the dialogue was funny in GT1, but the voiced characters have individual personalities.Basically, if you liked or haven't played GT1, GT2 has been a fresh take on the turn-based/RPG style that seems worth $upporting.  Enjoy.			"

												the 2nd game is as good as the first one, BUT i think the English dub of the game is less fun than the german one (the angel rages in the german one sometimes, in the english it sounds more like ""omg i don´t want to say the same thing twice, lets sound bored"", the game is a german one and in the english dub, most fun parts are not funny. (i think it is the same in the 1st one) anyway, the game is fun in english and in german.BUY the 2 games if u want a realy good fun strategy/roleplay game			"

												Really enjoyed the first one, which I bought on sale, so when I saw this, though the initial price a bit expensive for a light hearted parody game. Stuck it on my wish list and was delighted pick this and the third title up for pactically nothing. I did not see any of the flaws mentioned in the negative reviews. You need a developed sense of humour for this game, preferably some experience of playing classic JRPG's in the nineties or even eighties. If you like call of duty & grand theft auto, you probably will find this is over your head, so don't buy it. Excellent fun.			"

												An interesting experience, let's see why..storyNot the best i've ever seen, but it is always interesting and we want to get further and further.graphicsbeware - this is not a game for people who only want to play with high end graphics. It has its own charme and in my opinion it's enough. The strenghs of this game are others.camerasometimes it is really frustrating and difficult to handle. it doesn't destroy the game feeling but it could definitely be much much better!combatnice combat system which needs strategy. it reminds of games like heroes of might and magic or king's bounty. i liked it, but here we will also have some camera problems.difficultyi played on normal mode (the middle) and had no game over. it wasn't really difficult but it definitely needs to think about the actions while the battle and to be careful.charactersoh they are lovely and soon they will be one of the most important part of the game. They are fully voiced, also in german, and most of them very good and with voices that some of us already know from TV or other games.humourthere are many enjoyable conversations between our heroes that will bring us to smile about or even to laugh. The game is a parody about its own genre and this is beautiful and well done. even Pokemon and Final Fantasy get under the wheels of its humour.questswe will solve different kinds of quests, not just ""kill 10 of these"" or ""bring me 6 of these"". for example we have to cook a special donut for the princess, hug trees, find a big and strong guardian for chickens and must catch a pokedude *grin*soundnot a masterpiece but is suits well to the different situations and it is never annoying.buy it?this game is for people who like an interesting story, adorable characters and a nice kind of humour about the whole rpg genre.I had a lot of fun playing it and i can honestly recommend it.love,himye			"

												Hmm what to say about this? Well for starters it's a bit more of the first so if you liked that one you'll fine some pleasure in this. Things went quite well, though what I hate is I can't seem to organise the group in how they move or where they go so sometimes in battles my party either ends up spead everywhere near enemies which can be good or still several miles away which is a pain in the ♥♥♥.They added a cooking mechanic which is new, unfortunatly you do not cook yourself but get someone else too. navigation is a pain as some characters seem to blend into the background. I never knew Sir Silver was standing by the Princess until late in the game where I had completed most of the quests.Voice acting is quite hit and miss sometimes saying something quite different to what the textboxes say and right at the end it seems to be a real miss with the option *End Conversion* turning into -Translation Missing- and everything about the end seemed quite rushed.

												Ever thought how lol is to kill is to kill the same monsters again and again in rpgs? Why all the women want to have your main chars children and idolize u? Grotesque tactics 2 is a game that builds on those questions and more. This awesome title offers all the lol stuff u can think about while playing rgps and more. Awesome heroes, funny dialogues, great maidens and oc the usual crap u can find in any rpg game. Only downsize in this particular title is the suffering gameplay which makes this game kinda nervebreaking with that damn revolting camera.Grotesque tactics 2 does what it predecessor did better and funnier. For me it was worth the 2 euros i spent buying it. One of the most funny games i have even seen and played. Well done.			"

												Well....first off the bad things, then the good:The camera is sometimes very ♥♥♥♥♥♥, blocking sight, very close to the ground, while you would need it farther away and it tends to rotate needlesly.There are some heavy bugs, crashes on: loading, chat, saves, phase transition, although these bugs are rare, they still ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. In 15 hours, there were about 10 of them. WAY too much for me...The controls are quite bad, SOMETIMES making aiming an game of patience.A whole ability tree is useless as it is heavly bugged. DO NOT ever skill anything with berserk. If berserker wears off, you won't be able to attack these targets anymore. This might ♥♥♥♥ your game up!The endportal was invisible...which was somewhat of a fat blocker, as i moved around with my mouse to find it...-.-Saving/Loading is somewhat bugged. whenever you do you will realise that the game saves specific values, but not everything. Movement range is reset in fights, sometimes even the initiative is ♥♥♥♥ed up.....LOTS and LOTS of walking, AND they killed the speedup botton from the first game....which was the one feature i thought was great.Now the good stuff:Its cheap.Its funny, if you get the references.Its challanging, on higher difficulty.Overall i do not recomend this game in general. If you enjoy rpgs and share this fairly specific pop culture /gaming humor, yes this might still be a good game for you. If not, don't touch it.			"

												This is a good game, well better than the reviews seem to say. I played it with no major bug (only pathfinding is a bit weird), and I loved some of the characters so much I bought GT 1 just after I finished GT2. Also the dialogues are (greatly) voiced. he game has a nice ""classic RPG"" atmosphere while being parody and funny. FR : J'aime bien ce jeu, il est amusant (pour peu que vous connaissiez un peu l'anglais), les persos sont sympas (il y a pas mal de persos féminins que j'aime bien), bien sûr la caméra n'est pas terrible, mais c'était pareil dans NWN 2 et le jeu est injustement mieux noté. L'ambiance tant musicale que visuelle est sympa, il y a des bugs mais beaucoup sont faciles à résoudre en faisant save + load.Un jeu sympa, je recommande !			"

												This game is an overall fun game, but with major caveats.Like the first game, there is tons of humor and parody in the game, system, and dialog, making fun of common stereotypes found in other RPG's. We also see the return of certain members, but not all.However, this is one of the few party-based RPG's still around, unlike the majority of RPG's nowdays where for whatever reason you are the single savior of the world. This game is definitely harder than the first game, and also slightly longer. My first play through of this game lasted about 19 hours.Unfortunately, this game is still afflicted with serious bugs. While largely playable, keep saves often. The game also has many minor details missing, such as <MISSING TEXT> in various places. Pick it up if you're hankering for a party RPG, or if you're a fan of the first game. Otherwise, I liked it, but buyer beware.			"

												Ah Grotesque series... What can i say. So many bugs and cheap humor all of them has but somehow the first game was a big favorite of mine after playing it a bit more. Second game in the series has voiceover and better graphics but generally the same clunky graphics engine and nasty camera that require some setup to be more bearable. The whole works. So did i mention the game is buggy? terrible humour? So many bad things... But somehow it just works. Or doesn't. This game is definitely not for everyone. The anti-hero emo...sorry. 'goth' guy who is always out of luck and has more blue balls than Link with Zelda. And lets not forget his entourage of more or less unstable people that is the bread and butter of this game. Many dumb and hilarious moments in the game when team members comment on things they encounter. Weird characters. ex. Angelina with her angel wings and  pink dresses and moments of rage are just legendary. And Holy Avatar with his maidens. Annoying characters no doubt but as the same people are seen in many games it just puts a smile on your face to see all the same dumb things repeat themselves. Repeat a clichee and it becomes funny. And then there is combat and adventure too. But that is a weaker part. This is also the part that people mostly judge the game on. Perhaps that is good for them but i choose to judge this by the avkward hilarity of it.  This game would be just so worth nothing without the characters that flesh it out.  For me the long combat stretches in dungeons are a pain as i just want to see what weird happens next. And things do happen and for that i like this game. Combat itself is bearable - especially after you learn some talents but as pointed out the early game is just terrible. A big weakness to this type of game. Overcome that and you got a pretty decent game in front of you.			"

												Unfotunatelly really buggy combat system makes this game unplayable.With few more words:good: Game/story itself is great, still the same parody of rpg games and grotesque series itself, so lots of funny moments.Game is dubbed, although voiceactors are overacting, but its parody so i rate this as +.Sexist screenwriters tried even harder than in the first game, heroes are teasing and arguing all the time,so something like school bus full of teenagers, for me it worked just fine but can imagine that bus drivers, educators or mothers of 3 or more children would hate this part of game.Sometimes voices are mixed or voices and subtitles are mixed, for example drake talking with voice of aterius (dont think it is supposed to be this way, but its parody so +)First part of game there is no healer in your sqaud, so you will use potions a lot,thats tough and fun, cause they were useless in first game (and they will be useless in the middle part of this game again)bad:Special abilities of heroes are gone (heroes have skill trees, they are small and not described good enough).Bad description of everything in the game, quests are confusing, no minimap or anything to help traveling.After 2-3 hours you will probably get lost without any clue what to do next, where to go, who to speak with ...very bad:COMBAT - bugs, bugs, bugs: stuck in combat mode, stuck in mode you cant do anything (no wait, no defend, neither skip turn, only load works or save/load sometimes),respawnig killed monsters, npc/monsters that dont turn into enemies ( so they hit you and you cant hit it neither with sigle target spell nor area damage spell)defending stance have no affect, you take the same or more damage, start of combat i was complaining even in first game and ofc now its same hell,they added bonus dmg from behind, thats fine, but AI cheats, your heroes face last ai after each hit, so therefore each ai hit is from behind (!)on the other hand ai never turn so you can hit from behind only onceCAMERA - is evil, you cant zoom out, you can adjust it by middle mouse button, but you can select only from range (topdown - totally useless),camera autofocuses on heroes (randomly), never on heroe you are taking turn right at that moment,so most of the time during combat you just fight with camera,also it macrozoom automaticaly without reason throught textures to the first floor/ground when you are on higher platforms (which is for sure great, epileptic friendly experience)PATHFINDING - because of it you can start combat broke into 3 groups in three different corners of the map ...,you can also get stuck in narrow spaces (party members will block your way and again only save/load works)ESCORTING MISSIONS - all previous 3 together + dumb suicide AItip for escorting missions (if you really have to play it):finish all eligible quests to lvl up your heroes and buy all movement +2 jewelery from merchants (you will need it)			"

												I own about 95% of the Meridian 4 catalog, and picked up GT: Evil Heroes during that package. I later purchased GT2: Dungeons and Donuts during a sale.The BackgroundGT1 and GT2 share the premise of the player taking control of a moody sap (Drake) who overcomes personal challenges to become The Hero That Saves The World. The game is largely a parody of main-stream RPGs, with characters often throwing out asides and references to other games. The jokes are campy and are mostly of low-brow humor; some would say the designers are mocking how sexualized female characters are in other games, some would say the designers are part of the problem.CharactersThroughout the games, you get the opportunity to recruit new party members with different skillsets, for example:Angelina: Healer""The Semi-Divine Holy Avatar Himself"": 2 handed swordsman.Candy: ArcherEach character has a relatively well fleshed out back story, as there is a LOT of dialogue to read. In GT2 they have actual voice actors to play each character.SkillsIn GT1, skills are tied to your player level. Your character has an additional skill titled ""Obsession"", which is kind of an automatic passive attack with unique abilities.Ex: Holy Avatar's obsession is the ability to talk everyone everyone to sleep in a 3x3 radius. Including your party members.In GT2, skills are tied to your ""Talent Tree"" (which is not very well explained).When you max a bottom tier Talent, it unlocks your 3rd skill. A second tier talent unlocks your 4th skill, and a 5th tier talent unlocks your ""ultimate"".Additionally, GT2 skills have a timer, so you can't use them every turn. Your Obsession meter (more like an ultimate meter), builds up to allow you to cast the Ultimate skill.The ultimate skills in GT2 are actually pretty useful, with one of them doing massive AOE damage which is needed later in the game when there are seriously 20 monsters in a room.The ProblemsThe camera is terrible. It frequently locks onto random locations, and you have to reset the Follow toggle to return to your character. You might even feel sick from it. The Bloom doesn't help either, and may be part of the problem in inducing motion sickness in players. There is extreme camera smoothing in both games.Characters frequently get stuck. If I have a party member that stands in a doorway, and I try to talk to a NPC outside of that door way, I cannot pass through. My character will choose to run into the party member, and constantly try to move past. The controls are locked and I cannot disable the ""queuing"" of the talk command. To fix this I had to use the cheat console to teleport Drake to the NPC. This happened at least 30 or 40 times.In GT1 there is a major gamebreaking glitch where the Holy Avatar would be completely disabled during a battle. The battle round timer would still be enabled, and you would be stuck in an infinite loop. This required a reload of an earlier save file to fix.In GT2 the quest journal offers only Italicized and Normal text views. It is unclear if a quest is Completed, In Progress, or Not Completable. That last detail is interesting, there are at least 5 quests in GT2 that if completed, disable your ability to complete other quests. Some of my quests that were ""completed"" still remained in the journal, while some that were incomplete just disappeared.GT2 lacks progression logic. Finding your next mission requires you to talk to just about every NPC to figure out what you're doing next. The need to do so is not tracked in the quest log. There is also no notification that informs you to talk to a NPC. If you surf the Steam or Gamefaqs forums, many players ask ""WTH do I do next?"" And the answer is usually ""Talk to everyone"". This was not as big of a problem in GT1 as the maps were not as large.Final CommentsI eventually used the cheats ""goto//god//healall"" to complete both games. ""Healall"" resets the movement tracker so you can move from one end of a map to the opposite end in one turn. This made progressing through the (really boring and tedious) fights much quicker. Even then, it still took about 10 hours to finish GT2 because of all the walking and talking you're required to do. I would estimate that GT2 would take over 30 hours without cheating. And let me tell you the 10 second ending is not worth the effort[1] .Humblebrag: This post here is more comprehensive than anything you'll find online. Nobody wants to write a walkthrough or a guide for these games because GT sucks. If you're stuck on a mission/quest, leave a post and I'll see if I remember how I did it.			"

												This is an enjoyable game. But, there is no reason to buy it. There are so many enjoyable moments but there are too many flaws to sustain the experience. There are bugs. There are crashes. The crash report has bugs and fails. The camera is bad. The controls are bad. Sometimes you can open the inventory while walking and other times you cannot and there doesn't seem to be much reason why you can or can't. It just sort of works or doesn't. There are other examples as such but I will not belabor. The gameplay is really good. I'm playing on easy to get all of the achievements which makes the game relaxing and whimsical. It's also nice to know that there are games where you can get all achievements without 1,000 hours of getting slaughtered over and over. Even on easy I feel fairly challenged at times but not all the time. The humor is fairly immature but consistently so throughout the game. I really enjoy playing the game but there are just too many issues with it that I cannot recommend somebody else spend money. I recommend you play it. Or find a friend who made the mistake to spend the money. But, as far I can tell so far, this game cannot be recommended in the intent that these reviews should be written.			"

												Literally all the same problems as the original game, only with better graphics. Won't list them all here, if you are curious feel free to check my review of the first one. Funny and moronic how they didn't fix any of the original problems, and all the poor design choices are there. The tiny camera that can't pan out but this time instead changes from in/out to going straight overhead and in a different directional plane at a certain point, which I've never seen before and may be the dumbest thing every. The middle mouse button can be used to manipulate camera, which is the crappiest button ever. My favorite thing I noticed was how mechanics don't even work properly This is a grid based game, so at one point I was fighting 4 guys and I lured them back into a corridor where only 1 grid was possible to move so the first one would block the rest and I'd fight one at a time, quite smart I might say. And I know the person blocking the others exists because it happened to me in the first game when I was trying to attack someone my guy was blocking the way. Well somehow even though there was one square, their guys WALKED PAST THE GUY BLOCKING THEM and surrounded me somehow.....dumb. The single greatest part was when I tried walking past one of them to get out of there, I COULDN'T MOVE BECAUSE THEY WERE TAKING UP THE SQUARE I WANTED TO MOVE PAST.......I honestly have no logic or reasoning available to justify how the computer can break a part of grid based RPGs and then the very next turn the same rules do not apply for me. It's also great how the game never saves in an area so if you suddenly die you lose all progress. But for that terrible instance listed above it shows how much this developer screws up basic mechanics. There is a reason 90% of developer ""heads up"" games have mixed or negative reviews on steam, they don't correct mistakes and won't listen to the community. This deserves the 3.5/10.			"

												sadly again this company had a chance to have a good game but yet another one plagued by bugs. had camera that would keep spinning constantly. had to keep clicking things to fix it. character running in place had to reload game. the loot button always on when nothing to loot. the camera angle again being all wonky. anyone who has played the others will know what i am talking about. my game crashed as well. so every single one had a crash. so save often.the bugs are what make me not recommend it. i am not the only one to mention them. this game is not worth it at full price in its current state.pros-voice acting-most of it is pretty funny. maybe 1-2 eh ones.story- i like the story and the jokes/puns. If you don't mind some bad ones then this part my grab at some people. if anyone has played first or the holy avatar vs the maidens. I always point this out because to some people it will be a downvote right away. remember humor is subjective so i will always warn people that the jokes won't always be funny to someone else.combat- its not too bad. there is a little tactics involvedmusic-isn't too bad eitheri've seen some people complain about the ai involved units. well to those people get better. i had 0 issues with being able to keep up or even get ahead of the units so i always had combat. none of my ai units were even close to death. don't blame the game because you couldn't keep up. i can understand if the game was just against you but this is clearly a player issue not game. sure they run off but you can easily keep up or outrun them in combat.edit 1 so since playing it more there are more annoying bugs that happen. this is all stuff you can see for yourself.so despite i have a different screen resolution it never starts in it.spider body can't be looted no matter how many times clicked.loot in eleven graveyard could not be looted. no option on loot button and no matter how many times you used your mouse nothing.quest bugged with hippie grub.2 rain barrels in 2 different locations unclickable/loot.you know i would recommend some of these if there wasn't so many bugs or common issues. again its the bugs that make me say no. the story is fine to me. i laugh at some of the comments.edit 2 ok so i finally beat the game and still didn't mind the story. 2 more bugs 1st camera would like to spin out sometimes, when rotating the camera you can only do partial rotations before it spins half way. so i know that is annoying to some people. looking around the with the camera can initiate battles so your stuck in title moving mode until everything is dead instead of explore mode. so this is actually a few but all camera stuff.2nd bug is voice acting didn't always read what the text said.

												You can’t feel totally ripped off at only $15, but you have to wonder if the quality doesn’t match that price. On the one hand, both games can be pretty funny at times, what with attempting to parody a wide variety of games and pop culture references. On the other, it often comes off as clumsy and the gameplay reflects roughly the same.  There are many times where luck is valued more than skill, so regular saves are a must.I still have fun with these titles, but only in small bursts. If you enjoy parody games and you’re willing to put up with some seriously clumsy, flimsy design, these games may be right for you. Just keep in mind that, much like Pyst and Driven (parodies of Myst and Riven), you may be getting more parody and less game at times.			"

												Boring, unimaginative quests, childish humour .... well okay we can forgive the childish humour as that is what this series of games revolves around but this particular title is a step backwards.  The graphics are better than GT1 as you would expect and the characters are voice acted which is a nice addition to the English version of the game but that's it as far as forward momentum is concerned.  The rest of the game bogs down in the mire of run here and there and gather this and that to make this that xyz character wants before he ZZzzzzzzzz!!  See what I'm getting at? As if that wasn't enough there are a great many game breaking bugs that seemingly strike at random, such as quests not completing for one person while working for another etc.  The result is that only the very very few will be able to complete the game as the majority will hit a brick wall somewhere along the line that is impossible to get past.  By the way, that bloody awful camera that plagued GT1 is alive and well.  Sorry but I just can't give this game a thumbs up.			"

												See my review for Grotesque Tactics 1.  The sequel is somehow more uninspired and monotonous than the original, and this time with the added thrill of bugs galore.  I consistently got stuck in combat because my character had no more action points left, but wasn't allowed to end his turn.  Saving and reloading fixes the problem (though you may have to do it 3-4 times before it works), so it's not a game breaker, but it's irritating.  Don't waste your time on this game.			"

I like the concept and could enjoy the game... if it would work for me.Turns out, many people have problems with bugs - pity there is no demo to try before buy. For me the game is unplayable, even restart from the beginning does not help. And the game is not SO good to justify hours spent on workarounds.			"

												really struggled with this game, maybe because i'm not a heavy pc user but the controls seemed dodgy and the screen was never at the right size no matter how much I adjusted the settings. waste of my money.			"

												By far less funny than the original one. Plenty of tranlations gone wrong or missing (this was coded with german text). AI of your companions get's them killed a lot as they walk ahead of you.Less skills and tactics compared to the first game. Not a bad game, but stays way behind it's potential and predecessor.			"

												As a sequel to what i feel was a good game, this one isn't as good. What you'll find listed in discussions as ""glitchs"" it realy just a lack of game direction. It does have better graphics and has gotten ride of the lag. -dark*This is my review but in games the best way to find out if you like it is to try it.			"

												I recommend that you DO NOT GET THIS GAME.  It is terrible.  In attempt to be humorous they took whatever ""heart"" the last game had and pooped all over it.  The end chapter is glitchy.  Artwork is improved music is somewhat improved.  They made some changes to leveling up and special abilities.  But.  Who cares.  Play the first one.  Don't bother with this one.			"

												Buggy and just generally not an enjoyable game.  The ""humor"" is bland.  The voice acting is pretty bad.  The graphics are ok.  I'm not too sure about the story because I just couldn't play the game long before getting annoyed by the bugs and voice acting, but it seemed to be going nowhere fast.  Sorry guys, better luck next time.			"

												Hmm I cannot say I recommand it. The dialogue is ok but still kind of forced humour. It's almost there but always just almost. A pretty generic kind of dungeon exploring strategy game. I only would buy it if it is on sale at like 75%			"

												Fixes from prior version:- they actually paid an artist this timeReversions from prior version:- more crash bugs- sometimes dialogue just isn't there- game actually stops displaying text boxes if you use FRAPS on itStable from prior version:- still complete, indefensible ♥♥♥♥ that you'd be better off ignoring, substandard to any other RPG on Steam, and yes, I mean ANY OTHER RPG, no matter your tastes- less funny than most tragedies: at least a funeral might have nervous laughter, this would be lucky to get a pity chuckle			"

												Until I played Grotesque Tactics 3, this was the worst rpg and the worst comedy I had ever seen in my life. If you buy this you are subsidizing idiots who think calling pokemon ""pokedudes"" that you catch in ""pokedudeballs"" is in itself a joke and also who are horrible people.			"
