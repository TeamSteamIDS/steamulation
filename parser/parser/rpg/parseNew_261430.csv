												TL;DR at the end of the reviewI've played this game since 2011,with some breaks ,but I've still played it for a long time,don't mind my steam hour counter.Now,things you need to know about this game,and why my review is negative. - the EU servers are basically dead, thanks FailForge, probably the game is now available on steam to boost the players - P2P system. If you want to talk in the LFG chat, the most used chat ,you have to pay 9 euro to get a gold pack which lasts 30 days - If you want to trade, you need a gold pack. - If you want to search for a group,you need gold pack. - Plenty of events, but if you want something nice, you need items from the shop, or donate more money. - Did I mention you can sell your gold pack in game? Yeah,basically you can convert your real life money to gold in Aion by selling your gold pack for some millions. That's how most people got rich. - You want a cute pet ,which is also useful ? Pay for it! - You want a good mount with useful stats? Pay for it! - The game balance between the two factions in game is too big on many servers! On my server, [UK]Perento Asmodians were destroying the Elyos, almost every day ( but Elyos still managed to get lots of important victories , even securing 4 fortresses in Tiamaranta, btw rip Tiamaranta) and now the game invites the new players to join the Asmodians? Offering them a gold pack? Shame! - High amount of hackers at level 65. - Toxic community, 95% of the players won't help you with a mission,dungeon,boss,reviving you,not even your guild members. - Horrible publisher. - You need a lot of time,and when I say a lot, I really mean it ,A LOT of time to farm Abyss Points to get at least a nice PvP gear,and then later you will get one shoted by hackers. And now,for the pros  - PvP system is nice - Nice landscapes - Sexy characters and outfits - Nice dungeonsAs you can see, the cons number (13) are winning against the pros number (4) TL;DR: Horrible publisher, Pay-to-Win game,servers dead,toxic community.However, if you still want to play this game I suggest you should go on the NA servers and obviously,join the Asmodian master race.Shame FailForge!PS: At least here my review won't be deleted.

												Update: Since Gameforge is 'stimulating' people/players to give good reviews on steam, it's my guess to say that half of good reviews here from people with only 1/2 games on steam and no other game reviews are a bit fake.I just hope they lose the rights of publishing this game on EU.Played this game since it's release in 2009.It's a great game but on the hands of wrong publisher.When gameforge took the game and made it F2P servers had 1500-2000 players on.Now you are lucky if you find 500-600 online at the same time.They are trying now to fix it but is already too late.Play the game on NA or other region but not EU.-Empty Servers-P2W Style-Even they say is F2P you need 9€(GoldPack) otherwise you cant even chat, not talking about other things-Horrible publisherIt's not worthy the GB on your HDD.-0/10(At least here the FailForge can't delete the negative reviews)PS: Forgot to mention retard event.To do them you need items from their shop.STAY AWAY.

												Do I recommend Aion to anyone??Yes, highly recommended!!Do I recommend to play this game via Steam and so via FailForge's system??No, never ever!! And that is why I give it here a thumbs-down vote.I have played Aion for many years and I am glad about to haven't merged my NCSoft account with FailForge. Here are the restrictions of Aion whenever you use FailForge's moneymaker Client:  X Starter Veteran Gold Pack   Pre-Condition none former subscription available in shop and AION Club   Duration permanent permanent temporary   Character slots 2 8 8   Bonus no no yes   Quests yes yes yes   Equipment yes yes yes   Customization yes yes yes   Maximum character level 65 65 65   PvP yes yes yes   Crafting yes yes yes   Chat limited yes yes   Trade limited yes yes   Personal shop limited yes yes   Mailbox limited yes yes   Trade broker limited yes yes   Legion limited yes yes   Gathering limited yes yes   Item extraction limited yes yes   NPC selling low normal normal   Amount of instance entries normal normal high   Fortress siege rewards limited limited yes What does that mean? Your inventory is filled in no time You cannot trade or exchange items with friends You cannot sell useless items at NPC's You need to destroy items immediately and permanently You are allowed to gather 1050 minerals A WEEK. Usually you gather 1050 minerals in under 30 minutes!! Where is the sense in crafting so, which is not restricted. You won't be able to craft anything... Not to mention your highly restricted in-game Bank Account Aion is here @FailForge like watching a YouTube video instead of playing. Better watch videos...Make your own thoughts about FailForge's concept here:https://en.aion.gameforge.com/website/featuresdetails/What about North America's concept? Any restrictions? No!!You likely get the Gold Pack concept there in no time and 100% TRULY FREE!! Do your Kinahs with ease.Make your thoughts about NA's truly 100% Free2Play concept here:http://truly-free.aiononline.com/truly-free/index.phpWhat about high pings for EU/Asia people?A Ping of ~250 +/-50 is absoutely acceptable. You won't feel any lags in-game!!Download Aion here:http://na.aiononline.com/en/Have fun, truly.Best Regards,N3			"

												Empty servers, toxic community, a developer that keeps making the game worse and a publisher that only cares to milk the customers.Ok let's write some more stuff about the game that I have spend few thousands of hours the last years (ignore my steam playtime...).The game itself is pretty decent, with outdated but still pretty graphics and a tab targetting combat system that works very well most of the time. The problem is that it started as a game with a strong focus on aerial combat, to stand out from the rest mmos but NCSoft with the updates turned it into a generic mmo and made aerial combat a secondary aspect of the game that many players never really experience. NCsoft also focus on making the game appeal more to anime fans instead of actually improving it for everyone. It looks more and more like Tera,etc...just look at all the skins the last years! Also while with each update they try to make the game less grindy and easier to new players, those players will have to face a game design problem that got introduced with patch 4: the pvp gear is restricted to high ranked players and it's impossible for new players to reach high rank in most servers. It's only possible on dead servers, but why would you play on a dead server anyway? One big problem the game always had is its community: unfriendly, toxic, with daily drama on public chat channels. The old players will not invite you in their groups, they will never help you in the end game. It's the worst community I have ever seen.Second big problem is the faction balance. At the moment every server is unbalanced, they are all dominated by the elyos faction, that's why Gameforge tries to make people roll on asmodian faction. But I believe the publisher cannot fix this problem, as its created by the game design and the bad community: the two factions should cooperate to balance the servers but instead the elyos faction is  always greedy, dominating the fort sieges, increasing even more the gap between the two factions in terms of gear,etc.The publisher doesnt do much to improve the situation. They promised server merges after a long time of players requesting them, only to announce they gonna delay the merges cause of the steam release...They do nothing against the cheaters, when even some player was able to develop a tool that can detect them (aidpsmeter). They keep making pay2win events that give valuable items only to those that spend loads of euros. They restrict way too much the new players that do not have a gold pack, to prevent the gold sellers, which kinda works but those restrictions should be lifted when a player reaches some certain level. Their workaround for this problem for the steam release is the free 15 days gold pack, but they should get a better solution. Also their support is one of the worst you will have to deal with, they are usually clueless and refuse to help you with things that NCsoft support would deal with in minutes. I will never forget that I got a perma ban for ...jumping on a rock! and i had to make a video to show to their support...how to jump on that specific rock for my ban to get lifted...they still banned me for 2 weeks cause apparently jumping on rocks in considered a 'bug abuse'. They also love to ban people for 'offensive' language, even for words like 'noob' or other words that are not really considered offensive in the real life world...A good thing is that its not heavily pay2win like many other free2play mmos. With the exception of those stupid p2w events that Gameforge has introduced lately, a player can have everything without spending any real life money on this game. Gold packs can also be bought from other players with the ingame currency. I personally have only bought cosmetic stuff and mounts from their cash-shop.So what is started as a very interesting mmo, is now another dying generic mmo, managed by an incompetent publisher. I can't recommend it, especially when there are so many other mmos, but hey, its free to try it for yourselves!			"

												First of all, don't evaluate my experience with this game with my 5 minutes gameplay. It would be 0 if I wouldn't need to have 5 mins to write a reviewMy evaluation is made from my experience since beta (2012) to 2014. I tried the game a few months ago, and the game is at the same state as it was before.I played this game since beta. The game is amazing! It's my favourite game pvp wise, dungeons can be challenging, tons of skills. I love this game.BUT, it's at the hands of the wrong publisher. Gameforge aka Failforge destroyed this game with their p2p style on a ""f2p"" game.Why is it p2p? Starter players can do nothing in this game to make any ingame money, dungeons with tons of CD, etc.But the main problem here is the money farm. The game itself has a gold pack item ingame where people buy it with real money and sell it for ingame money. Gold pack gives you the full game for 30 days. So basically during this 30 days you need to farm gold to buy more gold packs and keep your game running smoothly. There is nothing wrong with that. I never payed for the game but since I played on the beta I had a Veteran account. The veteran account is basically the full game with more cooldowns on dungeons and some limitations on the game (but not game breaking).So my point is: The hard part is to farm the first Gold Pack. After the first one, you will be able to keep gathering money to farm the other ones. As a Starter Player (aka f2p player), you can't mail items, open a private shop and not use the trade broker. This are the 3 possible ways to marketing on the game. So it is impossible for you to buy a Gold Pack, since you can only sell items on ingame npc's (getting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ income from it).Because of this, new players leave and the only players that stay are the ones that pay for the game basically, since the prices of the gold pack increased so much that you can't really buy one right now. The only way you could play this game is if someone that plays it already helps you get the first GP. I sold my account back in 2014 when I wasn't able to get any of my friends to stay on the game and the servers were loosing a lot of population, resulting on a dead game.Since then, what did Failforge do? Did they change the starter account? No. It remains unchanged since 2012 and they talk about lack of population on their servers, and they try to find a solution to fix it by merging servers. This still not fix the repopulation of the server, just try to keep making some money and try to hold the current population, which is being lost every day, specially with Blade&Soul coming to Europe next January in the hands of NCSoft (thank you so much NCSoft to not let Failforge destroy that awesome game too). Thank you guys for reading and I hope that you found my long and confusing review helpfull.IF TOO LONG FOR YOU HERE IS A RESUME:Game is p2p. If you are a f2p player, don't even waste your time downloading it. Really good game, really bad publisher. If you are from NA, I totally recommend you to play it on the NCSoft servers (their trully-free model is really good). Really good PVP, Faction System, Sieges, Dungeons. The game has really good content.			"

												Although Aion is not in the best state at the moment, it’s still an amazing game and still very much playable for veterans and newbies alike. This is one of those games that if you played it when it first came out, years would pass, you would try multiple other MMOs and realize that you keep coming back to Aion. The main problem that the game has now ( and pretty much the only really major problem ) is that, while there still is a decent amount of players, they are scattered among 16 different servers, which with some exceptions are all kinda underpopulated. There are merges promised though for january/february which would make the situation better, but they were delayed once before, plus I’m not sure how competent the publisher is in that regard so I’ll just leave it at that.Overall it’s a fast paced tab targetting PvPvE mmorpg, that has the classic “holy trinity” roles in the party. Leveling can get kinda boring at times, but getting to the level cap of 65 is fast and the main fun lies in the endgame.PvEwise: There are plenty of instanced dungeons you can go to and most are doable and manageable to find a group to. There are of course more challenging ones.PvPwise: PvP gameplay in general is deep and very enjoyable even if classes aren’t perfectly balanced in 1v1’s. Word pvp exists, but not super active right now, since maps are deserted, due to low population of the servers (merges might fix that in a way at least) and a lack of engagement in current endgame areas. Instanced pvp is hella fun though. There are tons of instanced pvp arenas and battlegrounds, which open daily/weekly. Sieges, a zergy battle between the two factions for fortresses, can be fun too, but most servers are Elyos dominated, so sieges are very often one-sided and I don’t see any change to that anytime soon to be honest.The patch is 4.8 and 4.x has been here for a while now, so as a new player you’ll meet some players that outgear you, which might be frustrating since gear plays a big part in this game, but having a general mmorpg know-how should be enough to get competitive in not that long period of time.To sum it up: if you have the patience to wait for merges and can stomach a pretty hands down publisher give it a go, if not wait for the merges, hopefully the game will get healthier then.P.S most of the negative reviews the game gets are caused by the publisher, not by the game itself			"

												Pros:Good Graphics.Best PVP mechanics.Cons:Empty servers now.Deleted best pvp maps (Katalam / Tiamaranta's Eye and more).So much difficult now to collect Ceranium Medals (To buy PVP gear).High prices on manastones.High prices on enchantment stones.Manastones posibility to success are -70% than before (P2W).Enchantment stones to success are -70% than before (P2W).Free-To-Play version is better to uninstall Aion.On latest update many quit the game.On the server merge more will quit the game for sure.Gameforge destroyed this awesome game.

												What all the negative reviews have missed out to write is that this game has the best, most complex, and fastest-paced MMO mechanics. I recommend it to every average/hardcore gamer. While the community is toxic and stupid, as you can see from all the people writing negative reviews to drive off people while still playing themselves and complaining that the population is low, the game itself is amazing. People say the PVP is balanced and it is but not in the way they might imagine. It doesn't mean every class is equal to any other because the game is highly aimed at group versus group and larger scaled PvP(up to hundreds versus hundreds) and strategy is often times more important than the classes present.The engine is over 10 years old now, so it takes a heavy toll on your CPU instead of your GPU and Gameforge(the EU publisher) is like the Donald Trump of publishers, but it still has some of the best graphics and mechanics ever made. Even the guy with the 1.3k+ steam products hasn't stopped playing it since its release. The game is highly addictive and challenging. It takes a while to gear up at first and the ranking system isn't exactly friendly to starting players, but it pays off with hours of fun experiences, explorations, and fights. It really has taken a nosedive in the past few years in terms of population and this is like a last attempt at saving the game and I do suggest everyone give it a try.Lastly, if you do get banned right after registering/without doing anything wrong - don't worry, just write a ticket to their support and you will usually get unbanned in a few minutes. It's their main way of preventing botting as that was a big problem plaguing the game in the olden days. Enjoy!			"

Posted: June 9, 2016
												I have a lot more hours of gameplay thad the ones shoing in steam. Have almost 4k hours in the gameforge. Almost 3 years of gameplay.This is one of the best mmorpg i have even played. Very good end pve, pvp, raids, world boss, sieges whit more than 100 in each side of the 2 factions, reaching 300 in some servers actualy. For a new player you will have a good time leveling. Now is far more easy, but still needing one week to reach 60.Just 1 big disease. FAILFORGE.The true game starts at level 65. Everything starts in you being a veteran player. To be a veteran player you need gold packs thad need to be bought in the aionshop whit real cash. Dont whant to be a veteran. NP you just cant use action house, you will have larger dungeon cooldown, smaller kinnah(game cash) cap when selling uselless thinks to npc, and the best, lose a LOT of really but really needed rewards thad they gave you by colecting gold packs, yes one gold pack just last 1 month.If you dont have goldpacks at level 65 go away you are uselles. You can buy goldpacks in game marked also. So you see players farming for the pay to winners players sell them the goldpacks. I have 1700 days of gold pack. Thad is almost 6 years of veteran, what makes 70 months +-. Thad is what you need to have to get all the rewards they give you and belive me you need them. 70 goldpacks and they will put more and more. 1 gold pack is around 5 euros. This is 350 euros for the 70. A gold pack is also 70kk in game+- depending of the server. In one week if you have realy good gear, strong  list of players to play and no life you can make 50kk to 100kk easely.OKSo gold packs we can make enough cash to buy them. No problem xD.Now lets talk about gear. If you are rich now you can buy all the gear, using realy rare and expansive card thad let you trade untradabel gear, if you dont have kinnah you will need to farm like a crazy not the kinnah, but everything else like medals and ap thad you won in pvp, dungeons and quest, also in some events if failforge became drunk. The sistem of the pvp gear is simple.Kinnah will have a most important mission. Thad mission is buying manastons and enchantment stones thad you will need to upgrade your gear. And more other itens but this 2 are enough. The sound of breacking when trying to enchant or puting manastone makes everyone sick. Spending 1 billion trying to enchant one armor from +0 to +15 and put all manastones is more than normal. The sucess rate is so low this days. I know players thad have cried in my TS( team speak) trying to pass his armor from +10 to +15 and it ended +1 afther he spends 2 billion of kinnah. I would cry and give up the game at thad time. How many months we need to have thad amounth of kinnahIf you have gear or good a guild, party... you get gear realy easely. If you dont have you doomed.Geting medals for the pvp gear is almost impossivel. The cheaper pvp gear for 65 will need 4 to 5 months to get for a new players. And i am just talking in the basic armor and weapon. Enchanting thad gear and puting the manastones will cost you billions of kinnah. And the cap level of enchanting is now at 20. You will lose your entire live trying to put it +20 if you dont spend all you cash at the game.Jewels are the best pay to win think i ever sow. The cap of the enchanting level is going to be infinite. And of course failforge is making profit of thad gaving the true pay to winners a lot of power. The feather, a special type of jewel, is also going to of infinite cap and the stats thad this jewel give are totaly insane.Its impossivel to compete whit pay to winners. Before if you got no life, like me sadly, you could but is geting worse.Now events are so bad thad no one makes them (killing mobs give you more proffit). They even make events for pay to winners, you dont pay so no event for you, WHAT IS THIS. They call it free to play.The community is sick, toxic greedy... The normal for a mmorpg sadly xD. So if you whant a party for late game dungeons, you need the gear you get from those dungeons, or smiliar, or a good legion or friends inside those groups.Its a great game. But is becaming realy no life and pay to winner.If you what a game to play seriously, this one for me is a bad choise. You will lose time, cash, and you will never reach the top becase now there is no top, you make the top; the pay to winners make the top.ps: i whas a gunner full best pvp gear +15 weapon and armor, if you dont have the same armor thad me +5 at least  and full manastone i would kill you in 3 sec, not more, and dont worry, you wouldent even see what hapened. Thas why you need the gear so much and not the skill. Skill is just for the top players whit totaly overpower gear or for the low levels having the true fun playing the game. Late game is not funny, its a race afther gear and power. "

												Played this game since 4-5 years and it was a very good game under NCSoft, but after the change to the F2P section, the game have become worse and worse. In the beginning of the F2P, the events were great and totally fascinating, nowadays it's P2W Trash. Many People arguing about that you can easily win pvp fights, when you are good with your class, but in fact - and that from a totally veteran player - it's not, someone who cashed to death and got a +12 Feather, +5 Accessoires and +15 -> +20 Gear its like fighting with a knife in a gunbattle and you are getting 2-3 shotted if you don't got these items you have no chance, except you are very rich and have fun to spend 1k of euros at this game to be successful at pvp. The newer instances like manakarna need good groups if you don't want to fail your run, but it's very hard, because you likely never find a group who is running this instance successfuly, if nobody knows you and if your are a new player, you totally can forget to run this instance, it's a circle where u need gear to get gear, but you need gear to get taken along. Not to forget the gold package, if you don't have bought this, you are like a prisoner, looking in the wide world, but can't do nothing. Very hard for a totally beginner at this game.Result: The Game was good, but the golden times are over. If you have money to spend, tons and tons of free time, a very lot of endurance and a thick skin for the very toxic community it's the game for you. Personally I would't recommened this game, because it was too much destroyed by P2W. "

												I've been playing this game since release, and i simply cannot count how many endless hours i've been wasting on Aion itself. I've never thought i would find a mmo, that i loved so much that even my friends told me i got skinny within time.To be fair, the game is good and really enjoyable, when gameforge wasn't a part of it. Less people are playing, more people waste in-real-life cash to buy goldpacks to unlock the rest to be a ""free"" player, gear and items to reach max lvl due it's 100% p2w. The ""free-to-play"", is only based on some areas, and have many downsides. Leveling is so fast, that i can get maxed on a week due i know my roads to pick. Costumization is a big thing in Aion, and they really allows you to adjust your character as your hearth please. The pvp part is my favorit, and i loved rifting, ganking low levels with my twinks back in the days, using team-speak with many friends and share locations. Now, everything is dead. No ganking, mostly arena is what people do, if not pve to get cash or skins. It just got so boring. Still, i get back once in a while because i miss the pvp. I just haven't found another game to replace this yet. It was good, hard and enjoyable once. Now it's dead, and i'm surprised this even hitted Steam. My little broken Aion heard would wish it could be different, but i simply cannot play it anymore. RIP Aion.			"

												Ive played Aion for over a year now and I would also like to point out some things.First things first Gameforge (or Failforge) is the main evil to this game with there every chance to money grab and put minimal effort into everything. Cut Gameforge out of the picture and most of the Pay2Win elements disappear. If your are able to go play the NA, NCSoft version, go do it, thats if you don't mind bots stealing your kills and complete amateurs that think there all pro ruining most of your runs. You often get the feeling that Gameforge doesn't care about there players or the servers as long as they can give you a false sense of security that they are trying to makes things better, so you fork over the cash (it frustrates us all). That said under all the mess this is an AMAZING game and you can really get sucked into its world. Aion is a fast paced open world PvPvE MMORPG ...WITH ADDED FLIGHT, using the classic classes, with some really interesting twists to make them unique. The world is split into 3 major fractions 2 of them are playable and have different story lines and maps.The fractions are:  Elyos, living in luxury with all the beautiful sunlight. (Playable) Asomdians, exiled and forced to adapt to living in the darkness. (Playable) Bulaur, the bigger evil that only have the desire to dominate. (NPC based) The higher level you go the more PvP action is available but in some places leveling can be slow and quite boring. with some know how this can be avoided if you know where to level at set times. I suggest following a leveling guide from off the web if you are making your first character.For any new players i strongly suggest you avoid starting with a Templar and Cleric they are the most expensive classes as they require different sets of gear to be played well. Also try to avoid using Assassin and Sorcerer as your first character because they are the harder classes to play and require a lot of skill and knowledge about the game.The Crafting system is one of the best ways to make a lot of money, but can get quite tedious and boring, its also very time consuming and has been promised to be improved some time in the future.The Guild/Legion system is fun and does the job but your limited to what you can do and can be frustrating coming form a guild owners point of view. Also been promised to be improved.The Housing system is grate and very well done, better than I first expected. Unfortunately most players are not so interested in it. Some world events are rather fun and keep you entertained and others can seam dull, boring and a waste of time or Pay2Win.PvE: There is plenty of instances to keep you busy, some easy some rather challenging. sadly only few let you go in without a group but they are all do-able. Some instances do include some PvP but not until you reach the higher levels.PvP: PvP goes into grate depths and is fun, enjoyable and sometimes can really get your heart pounding. There is a nice amount of PvP instances and battlegrounds you can enter daily/weekly. World PvP exists from levels 25+ but can be avoided using the ""rookie server"" up until level 55 if you wish. Big siege events call for all out war against the opposing fractions to capture fortresses and give guilds some where to place there name on the world giving them certain rewards and bonuses for there fraction.Thanks to NCSoft some big changes in the updates soon to come will fix all of the games major issues, besides Gameforge. Like..Even though it says free to play, this game use to be a subscription game and remains that way. If you continue to play free you will only get a demo version of the full game, until you buy a ""Gold Pack"" that lifts all restrictions, oh ..there also tradeable :/ . At the moment this is causing economy problems because there is no way to to trade items with other players without one but they are looking into ways make it possible to lift the trade restrictions, without currency sellers abusing it. Right now there is a population problem, although there is a decent amount of players altogether, the world is rather empty because everyone is spread out across 16 servers. This is being solved by merging a lot of the servers together and the whole point of bringing this game to steam ..to bring in more players. They plan to go through the merge in Jan/Feb time. Another problem to do with the population is fraction based. Most servers are Elyos dominated. They have reason to believe this because the Elyos seam more appealing to newer players, as they have no mane/tail or claws like Asmodians do (i play Asmodain by the way, I feel being an arrogant goody-two-shoes human-like life form is boring as reality is not all rose petals and fresh air and I'm already human, so i'll rather play something thats more imaginative). This will be fixed with the option to keep or loose the mane/tail and/or claws in the character customization, as they are apart of the Asmodain lore. This is expected in aion 5.0 said to be released summer time 2016. Gear is also one of the problems. Gear plays a big part in Aion and Aion mostly concentrates on PvP. At end game you start to climb the ranking board for the No.1 spot. As you climb the ranks better gear come available to you ..doesn't sound so bad right? The issue is the fact that there's always going to be some who has been playing longer than you and so they out gear you. unless you play with some skill you will struggle dealing with these players. If your new on the server this will become frustrating, fast. lucky for some in Aion 5.0 the level cap will raise from 65 to 75 so all high ranked players will be on equal ground ..at least for a little while but it still gives the lower ranks and newer players a chance. A minor problem is that the graphics engine is out-dated so everything looks kind of plastic and there is a lot of noticeable, sometimes funny texture glitches. This is also getting fixed in Aion 5.0 when we get a graphics upgrade and a new day and night system ..the one we got sucks but better than nothing.If you feel like you are a patient enough to stick with Gameforges bad habits and can wait for these things to be fixed, download the game now and have some fun but get to at least level 30 before you decide if you like the game because level 1 - 25 is basically the tutorial.

												The fun starts right here in steam. You download the full size game, only to find out the game uses its own updater to download even MORE.This used to be a great game when it was originally released, subscription based.Open world PvP was great, dungeons were hard, just maybe a bit of a grindfest.Then, gameforge took over, made the game free to play.Nowadays, Gameforge will do anything in their power to extort money from you.A ""free player"" is so damn limited, you might as well be playing a single player game.So just list a few reasons why Gameforge shouldn't be running this game:- They removed game masters. All you have is their support ticket system with an average response time of 1 week or never.- They are incompetent, the average maintenance (every wednesday) is lasts 4 hours longer than their ETA. After that they stop giving you ETA and you're lucky if you can still play on wednesday.- Patches are SIGNIFICANTLY delayed. The NCSoft is usually 1 or 2 MAJOR versions ahead.- Reporting players is of no use, ""hackers"" will never get banned anyway. You (the reporter) probably will.- Random bans because of their no-proxy rule. Oh, your IP address changed? You must be using a proxy! PERMABAN.It's not all GameForge's fault though, here's the general list:- Performance is BAD. Framecap at 60fps, game is heavily IO dependant. If you're not playing on an SSD you can expect MAJOR stuttering. Sometimes freezes of several seconds depending on the player density of your location. ""Sieges"" with on average 100+ players will usually bring down ANY pc to sub-10fps. (And trust me, my system isn't low-end xD)- Classes are unbalanced. Especially the ""Gunner"" class. 5 seconds silences?! 2 OF THOSE? ON SEPERATE COOLDOWNS?  Who comes up with this ****?- As a WoW player, the amount of ""WoW has done this so much better""-moments is ridiculous.- The bugs. Oh my god the bugs. Getting stuck, quest texts missing, graphical glitches, artifacts, random crashes.But, there are some good things:- The graphics are decent in new areas. Old areas have serious texture stretching.- There are some good communities in the game. Closed groups of friends. I've met loads of people in this game, people that are now irreplacable in my life.- The class system is unique (or was unique, now everyone and their grandmother stole it) and actually quite fun.- The ""campaign"" quests are usually quite nice, if you're into lore-stuff.Overall, I do not recommend this game. Not in this state at least.Gameforge needs to give up on this game, and give it back to NCSoft. And yes, I do know that that will never happen.For now, just pick another MMO, this one isn't worth your time. It literally isn't.			"

												Played hundreds of hours from 4.0 to 4.5 - unfortunatly can not recommend this game! Well it was fun in the beginning but after a friend shown me GuildWars2 I realised the amount of mistakes Aion has is unforgivable.== BASICS ==Let's start with the basics: Aion is a generic themepark MMO with PvE AND PvP and high progression. When you start you will do kill and gather-quests, which used to be fun in the beginning but becomes boring grind in the middle game. Combat is traditional tab-1-2-win, nothing that challenges. In a nutshell you don't have any freedom or open-world, but only a campaign that leads you from point A to B. In endgame (quest-)grind becomes ridiculous, you accept a quest, kill 15 mobs and return, nothing more. If you expect challenging PvE-content or Openworld, this is wrong game!== ENDGAME ==does not exist.. well that's my opinion. Actually the game has high complexity, there are many upgrade options that you really have to deserve to get. The game has a lot of equip to farm, skins to collect, ways to improve your character, but well .. there are only few dungeons worth to play. When I completed my equip I stood there like ""so what do I do now? I saw every dungeon, and now?"".== PVP ==Now for PvP: Aion used to have a really cool OpenPvP when I started. You always felt the adrenaline when you entered PvP-Areas with your mates and group-combats were exciting as hell. Aion is GROUP COMBAT only, and just to defend this game a bit, classes are UNBALLANCED, because teamwork always will lead you to survive.On the other hand, when 4.0 you are thrown in the one-and-only PvP map which feels like a giant arena full of zergs and gankers, because the real problem is that starters are killed within seconds by the veterans who already have high equip but can't match with their league. Maps are small, it's really difficult to keep covered, gankers are just waiting for you. So if you want to enjoy Open World PvP, you really have to be patiently until you have something that's better than your starter gear. But in a nutshell, Gear > Skill.In Arenas there's NO MATCHMAKING, you want to level but fight against a veteran / you want to have heavy pvp but fight against a rookie who will go afk because it's senseless. Aion should not have an arena at all.. and really not call itself a ""PvP""-Game like the Gameforge Launcher does.Seriously, this was the point when I decided to quit. Although I had the equip to fight against most of opponents, I expect skill in a PvP-Game. Tournaments are not possible, I recommend Blade&Soul or GW2 if you want to.== COMMUNITY ==Toxic. But that was predictable in a PvP-game which rewards solo-players and idiots who give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about teamplay. Pleasant people just leave and go to GW2, FFXIV, ArcheAge and TESO, idiots stay. I don't know the reason exactly and I don't want to waste any more time thinking about.== LAST BUT NOT LEAST ==When you want to play PvP, you have to run dungeons (PvE) to farm your equip, when you want to play PvE, you have to go through the PvP-zones. Aion tries to mix PvP with PvE, but seriously, it doesnt make any sense! The game is only recommendable for both, PvP AND PvE gamers who need progression, easy gameplay that never overwhelmes and grind that always give you your daily serving of confirmation.PS:This review was edited few times. When you don't agree with me, feel free to comment.			"

												Great game, just wrecked by the publisher Failforge due to mega high prices on store. There are that many things that make this game imbalanced for competitive play, they have took these items out of the game and only available in the cash shop.After you got to End Game and got all your ""PvP weapons, armour accessories"" to get a +10 plume and all accessories to +5 will cost you anywhere between £500-2000 gear to +15 about £400 and to +20 gear will cost about £2000-5000depending on how lucky you are.

			Views: 659		

			= 14 DAY BAN, thank you gameforge.		

Support won't help you and will tell you often that they don't know how the game works and don't have to tell you about the mechanics of this game.It appear that game master are volunteer and are also players.They are just turning this game into a cash cow.Now about the game itself it was great but now with the new update you reach max level, you get your stuff and then you wonder why you spend so much time doing this.RVR timer was like 1h per day and was fun, now it is 5 min and the 2 race do everything to avoid combat, they just rush for the reward so you get no pvp.Same thing for the rest of the game, seems like people just want to greykill or rush the reward and don't care about having fun.Anyway you get more rewards by doing pve instead of pvp, great logic NCsoft.Maybe NCsoft will release good update in the future but for now there is no point of playing the game once you reach max level and have a decent stuff.

I'm not saying this game is bad, but it's dead compared to how it used to be. As it says 'AION Free-To-Play' the game should be free to play, but you still have to put in your money on the game to unlock certain things in it. I do recommend playing AION but not w/ GameForge.

												So as i noticed this game is available on steam(for what reason server population dying?)I decided that i will give the Coup de grâce to this game. Don’t let my hours on steam fool you, I’ve been a long time AION player. I bought the game in boxed retail version when it came out for EU back in 2009 and played it as a subscription based MMO for quite a few months and continued to play for years after it went f2p, i have thousands of hours put into this game. This was the golden age of AION. I wouldn’t say that it wasn’t an enjoyable experience, I wouldn’t write this review, or I wouldn’t have played for years if it wasn’t. Just the tendencies and the early nullification of the feedback of european playerbase(I must go into that deeper later on) made this game go into nose dive, topped with the renting of hosting rights to one of the most incorrect companies I met in online gaming : FAILFORGE.TL:DR and to new playersAION IS A NICE GAME just TIME has surpassed it. if u really are interested in it, go play on NC AION NA, north american servers are fine and actually playable! and f2p is actually f2p.-Pros:Some of the boss fights are actually challenging(only end-game)Fortress raids:When servers were more active, scheduled PvP raids were quite often, when about 1000 men forces battled for fortresses with raid leaders on a teamspeak, these wars were carefully organized, and the crowd was disciplined. mastermind tactics were utilized. Best MMO experience EVER!KMMO-Cons:It's all about milking a dead cow nowF2P players are restricted by many game-breaking things, top it with this game IS A GRIND FEST, u wont be able to achieve anything f2p.P2W since u could sell premium subscription packs in ingame market.( Nasty NASTY)GRIND GRIND GRIND. RINSE REPEATtab-targetingKMMOVery hardcoreFailforge gives a ♥♥♥♥Community oh that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ toxic community, internal wars, rumours about who is hacking or grinding money by buying LOADS of gold packs and selling them ingame, the top notch guys were 999999x ahead of the rest with most probably nefarious tactics. Hierarchy was kind of practical and obeyed, as it had physical(High ranking PvP players could transform into raid bosses) and prestigial benefits. aside from rare gems was mostly consisting of selfish icangrind24/7 kiddos, and livingonmummiespension 40 some kiddos. Failforge can't push updates(3 day scheduled maintenance that ends in an hour(72 times))Failforge can't localize(took them half a year to localize all prepared patch notes for eu servers)Failforge would delete threads or ban people for trying to make their voice be heardHave i said its full of cheaters who hardly ever got banned?(minimap hacks, flyhacks, stathacks, tp hacks, any hacks u could imagine) most of them were well documented and presented to failforge, their usual response: ban the one accusing ( WITH CLEAR EVIDENCE) the hacker, relating to TOS.faction pvp is mostly imbalanced, favoring asmodian master race( :C)			"

												Who ever says its about: publisher Gameforge.Is wrong.Iw been on NA also and its pasicly same. Gold pack for 10EUR a month... Is good!No bots and so on. Worth the money!But long story short.Aion was greated by talented game developers whos work got alot players hooked and they loved the game.Now developers still try but they have no clear vision about even the core of the game i quess.Developement goes: Good graphics and more pay to.. not win. Pay to RNG and Pay again to win.Personal EXP:First time i played AION was like 5 or more years ago. Server: Greed: Game was nice, addictive, intresting, challenging.Hard instas with alot different player created styles how to do them faster and how to win them, open world pvp with rifting. I loved the game and got hooked. Nice maps with strong athmosphere and alot different ways to get geared.Crafting, PvE Dungeons, daily quests, repeat quests, PvP and Sieges.Its all still here BUT its not the same after rushing trough all the great content... to reach lvl 66 good looking but blank content.Game was worth to explore... hidden quests and locations, hidden pathways and so on... Exploring and challanges... even little PVP was revarding as u got your first damn abyss stigma... so be welcome and try to kill me while lvling... lets have fun. Now its grind all day, grind all night, grind whole year.. give up and pay money.Well good graphics remain. Outdated for now but still decent.All new content is RNG and some more RNG. Game overall athmosphere is lost its like horror film with pink-tint-layer over it.You can pay money to level faster. Pay to get pasicly top gear: PVE: Runehero items can buy from broker. High lvl pvp and pve drops are dropped from instas and are comlete random world loots that can be bought from broker. Nearly any item can be bought by investing 25-100Eur.(Only not abyss gear that requires a year daily quests and pasicly being a human BOT). Not sure what happens next update tho.BM gear is only ""fun to farm gear""  cuz its not too long farm and u can do pvp/pve. Is outdated and nothing special tho. (Do weekly/daily quests at pvp zone)Game is getting worse and worse. Developers have no idea what they are doing besides getting as much money out of it as possible. Cash shop events and pay to RNG.So my personal EXP:I came back after few years. I loved to level and stuff. (Possible nostalgia). I liked new content.New maps look good... but thats about it.So i decided to invest some money about 350EUR to gear my char up as it seemed better idea than doing pretty boring time consuming things all the way again what i have done before.Got decent pve gear, some pvp gear, custom look items, did some RNG for gambling pleasure... STIGMAS oh the costly Stigmas.Now im kinda over the noobs and lower than veterans... LETS HAVE FUN!Everyone is hunting the gears. No i dont want gear i want fun...Hard to find but got some funs... but then we get the UPDATE!Hello! Since u have used nearly 100EUR on your stigmas on this character we dont think you need anything else here.We keep your char as it is. Stigmas that were used by your alt are now not useable and u can sell them for normal ingame money via survey. Good news is: Now you got those hundreds of millions costing stigmas for free.. just not the gold one.So what happened here?People who already had invested their money on stigmas got what they needed. People who refused to pay money for Stigmas got trough without vision stigma. They still had fully working stigmas.Now what should we do? This market is closed... Lets take away their core stigmas and say we wanted to give you those long cd nut fun to have stigmas. You always wanted them? Right?GOT IT FOR FREE!!! just kidding. You still need to get core stigma for desired vision stigma or you get worst option of it.We just tought you people are bored and your money is collecting dust... so we found a solution.Those who invested real money in old stigmas. Still have what they bought so we all are happy!:) NOT!Pasicly this is how game is evolving. Less and less to explore, less personal ways to obtain your goals in game.More RNG, More Pay to win and easy to see trough strategies to just make people pay more. "

												""This game has brillient graphics, i recomend it for the graphics although i couldnt play it as for some reason i got banned by someone for no reason (i had never talked or anything at all) so i havnt fully played it. As well as a bad comunity i find it a little confuzing as well at the start as i didnt realaly know what to do when i logged in."" that was my first review before i knew the truth.OKAY NOW IM EDITING MY MY REVIEWi contacted custemer suport and found out that the reason i couldnt get on and was banned becasue of the fact that apently my email wasnt verafied on my acount, well let me tell you aion I HAD VERAFIED MY ACOUNT AND IF YOUR SYSTEM DOESNT PICK UP ON IT, IT IS YOUR FAULT, AND THANKS TO YOUR SYSTEM I AM NOT GOING TO BE PUTTING AION ON MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL NOW!

												Don't be fooled by my hours on steam. I've been playing aion way before finding it on steamPros:From all the free to play mmos I've played, aion has the best combat system and the most enjoyableThe graphics are niceWINGS!!!!11!The best characer customization a free mmo by far. The options are limitlessCons:There is an excessive amount of hackers in the game. That is the worst to me.The community is cancerous. It's rare to find helpful and friendly people It's pay to play. If you don't have a monthly subscription, you're missing out on looooooots of things. For example limited chat options and the worst of all, you can't trade items privatelyThe story is mediocre (that's probably just my opinion though. Most people will play for the pvp and won't care about the storyline)I'm having a huge dilemma about choosing whether I should recommend this game or not. Well, if it's your first mmo, go for it. You won't regret it. You might find it repetitive after some time though. However, if you have played other mmos better than this like World of Warcraft, Guild Wars or Neverwinter, you most probably won't be able to play for more than 10 hours. Soooo... yeah if you're a starter at mmos, go for it. You'll like it for a while and you will appreciate the better communities at other mmos			"

												Awesome game destroyed by the company called GameForge! GF (G4YFORGE) introduced a GP (GoldPack 30 Days) system which costs cash, also you can purchase the GP from trade broker in game, but costs a lot over 75 mil kinah. So the game is Not So Free To Play as the title say. Worth to give it a try if you're a new player but from my experience you'll get bored once you reach max level 65 because repetition happens :\ Hard to find people for instances, high gear required for end game group instances. Have Fun! I do NOT recommend the game under G4YFORGE management.			"

												I spent lots and lots of hours on this game, even before the release on Steam. Sure, the resctriction for non-paying players are severe. But the rewards in-game are so many and the events so frequent that you can be competitive with paying users too.Leveling is relatively easy, doing the side quests gives you lot of extra exp and when I finish the mission in an area I usually am 4-5 level over the basic level of the next zone.EU Servers are usually pretty empty, although fusions between servers for repopulation is been already announced. Quests might be a little repetitive, affecting the replaybility and resulting a bit boring somethimes. But still one of the best game of his kind.			"

												Old game now out on steam, nice looking chars, skills, areas, etc. Has some nice instances  for PvE loving players with cool drops. PvP is really nice in this game, too, lots of open world pvp and dayly raids vs the enemy fraction and every saturday there is a raid vs players from all servers. The game has a storyline which means that every major patch they implement new areas with new instances and other neat stuff.In my oppinion the only bad thig is the weekly maintenance on wednesday which can take up to 6 - 7 hours where the game is not playable.

												Returning player reviewEN ---------------------------------------------------------The game was spoiled by the attitude of the players either general chat faction or the gameplay, then stupid cheats by using unauthorized third party software, and finally by gold sellers with Bots want you in here ...Players require there to be more active players BUT paradoxically players not having an end-game equipment are excluded (request the stats, gameplay style, etc.), which does not necessarily give you wanting more to play. Especially as for the latest PVE or PVP equipment is too long to get less to spend his days on the game, with a very low drop rate...I want to specify that I never had full gear of a set gear PVE or PVP, although I play for several years despite a long break... So a  no-life game to waste time...Few players who know the humility and respect in this game drifts, infact it already was.I do not recommend this game if you have an interesting life, otherwise you can spend your whole time in this game....FR ---------------------------------------------------------Le jeu a été pourri par l'attitude des joueurs que ce soit sur le chat de faction ou dans le gameplay, ensuite par des tricheurs débiles utilisant des logiciels tiers non autorisés, et enfin par des gold sellers avec les Bots en veux-tu en voilà...Les joueurs demandent qu'il y ait plus de joueurs actifs MAIS paradoxalement les joueurs n'ayant pas un équipement end-game sont exclues (demande les stats, le style de gameplay, etc.), ce qui ne donne obligatoirement pas envie de continuer à jouer. D'autant plus que pour obtenir les derniers équipements PVE ou PVP sont trop long à obtenir à moins d'y passer ses journées sur le jeu, avec un taux de butin très bas...Je veux aussi préciser que je n'ai jamais réussi à avoir tout un équipement complet d'un set d'équipement PVE ou PVP, bien que j'y joue depuis plusieurs années malgré une longue pause... Un jeu où il faut avoir rien à faire, et perdre son temps...Rares sont les joueurs qui connaissent l'humilité et le respect dans ce jeu qui part à la dérive, enfaite il l'était déjà.Je ne recommande pas ce jeu si vous avez une vie intéressante à côté, sinon vous pouvez passer votre vie dans ce jeu...

												I've played Aion for at least 3 years, recently started on the EU server.I had pretty low expectations as Gameforge tends to prioritize it's profits over user benefits. BUT The restrictions have been lifted a few patches ago and ever since, the game IS playable. 5.1 is new for me, I stopped playing when 4.5 came out. Leveling seems to be easy, but some low-level instances are quite dead. (At least I couldn't manage to find a BTHM group so far, only did solo/duo/trio)For those who are searching an MMO they can waste days on, try Aion, it's very good.			"

												Personally.. I havn't wrote a review in some time and none of them were bad so this will be my first.I won't go into a DONT PLAY this rant as i havn't been able to play this much for the following reasons.30-45min were spent verifying and making backups.5 min were used up then verifying the game files for security... Something you NEED to do at start up every time.When i got into the game the choices of classes were intresting and the into movie was good,,, Finally got into the game and managed to get to level 2 before the game decided to lock up.. Now i don't have a weak PC so this came to a supprise to me.. Maybe it's due to windows 10.Restarted.. 5min again verifying files. Got back in... Crashed again... So ran a repair... Again Verify and crash.Personally It's probably software on my end but the constant verify times and constant crashes have put me off.I'd have to rate this overall however on what i have played and not total score.. Maybe I will come back to this.Graphics - 7, Dated but still had some charmChoices - 8, No race options bar 2 or 3 really but the classes and the prospect of sub class is nice.Sound - 8, Music was niceLauncher - 3, The constant verify and occational backup and lond first run times makes the whole logging on a pain.Buisness model - 3, I know free to play games need to make money but this is a little much, Even Games like TERA and WoW didn't restrick F2P players to this level. Now The levels are uncapped but chat and other restrictions are a bit f a pain. From the chart on the website it even seems to penalise old players before F2P a little in favour of sucking up more money. But it's free to play so what did i expect?Playability - Undefined. I can't rate that as i couldn't play much. (Did email tech support so will wait to hear back)Overall.. F2P its an ok game.. Looks like it could have potential. Maybe if tech support can help me I shall return and give it a real go and re-view this again. Personally I say give it a go if you are not fussed about next-gen graphics and can see past the F2P restrictions. It looks like it has some potential. "

												This game was the most innovative title in 2009 and was very promising. EU players were not ready for the grind that would come and thus the game got into Gameforge's hands that is greedy. Best MMORPG ever at the worst publisher's hands. Also NCsoft Forgot how to be innovative and made this a generic MMORPG with flight not being a core element anymore. But there's a lot to see from Aion yet... Recommend it? Yes because the development is at the right way again. And no because of GF for having gold pack and sorta ruining the game economy because its tradable in game.			"

												Certainly not a bad game, however if it's worth your time you'll need to find out yourself.My opinion however, I think it's definitely worth it.As time consuming this game is, I find it quite amusing as I've enjoyed playing this game for quite a while now. But do have in mind that even though it says free to play, you'll be most likely to have to spend some money to keep up with the rest of the guys in PvPs and be able to trade items and such. Things I certainly enjoyed about AION:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+Tons of features, many different in-game systems that offer a variety of options, from mounts and pets and so on.+Tons of content, as each patch often includes new things to explore.+Great character customizations, offers great options to design your very own unique character.+A lot of quests, makes sure you are never boored.+Lots of unique loot, a great variety of looting from NPCs.+Great looking armour, most of the armour at higher level is just fabulous.+Nice community, met a lot of nice people I befriended.+Fun gameplay mechanics, great options of abilities within each class. +Great soundtrack, which I find qutie important while exploring the world of Atreia.

At first I think well f*** it, game was♥♥♥♥♥♥anyway but after few seconds I pressed create new account to only check if next accounts will be blocked too.Next try of creation was unsuccessful system accepted account name and password but said f*** it I'm registering system so I won't send activation token (total times this happened 6)Luckily register page have top notch account name suggestion so after few auto-blocked accounts or fail to create one I have went to account number wtfisthisshit10. On finish I will add few words for about Aion support site first of all they have atypical https certificate and against forgery systems can mark page as unsafe, second thing about this page is pain of logging in it, good tip page mail is case sensitive for some reason and lastly you don’t even get mail confirming your ticket.So I have spent 1.4 hrs. on getting multiple autoblocked accounts, if this isn't good entertainment I don't know what is.

												Pros:- Decently good graphics.- Very smooth combat animations.- Fun PvP.- Lots of instances both PvP and PvE.- Good balance in PvP between classes.- Can not drop a cent in game and still get everything you want.Cons:- Servers fairly empty, so you will have trouble finding groups for less popular instances. (mainly lowbie instances) But there is a merge coming what promises to fix the server population problem.- Publisher fairly ignorant of community. Most things get delayed.- Developer listens to its region mainly what is Korea.- Heavy grind if you want the best gear in the game.- Toxic community unless you find legion to play with, it makes it all better.Overall, the game is well balanced, couple problems here and there.

												AION- i never played this game before today i not really heard of it before i watched a few top ten steam rpg lists on youtube and basically i hav to say this game plays really well. but before i jum in and say what i like about it i have to tell you it took me almost 2 hours to get the game and the updates needed it is quite a big game so make sure you have over 20GB space for this game to be downloaded, it may also take a while my downoad did stop 3 times as it asks you ro manually accept the update, the download box will turn Yellow so just watch out for that, also a lot of people stress the fact that you have to play this game in a group or with more than one person, well i am playing alone, and i hae not interacted with other players im going it alone and it is easy to get through. i might find i need people later on but if i do i will try update this!the graphics are not the best and there are a few small issues with the character getting stuck on trees and stuff if you point your curser to far in front as it does not always walk around obstacles it will try walk through them and just get stuck, if this happens you might find you have to click around or jump to get yourself out of the object, this game is  great for cmplete noobs to mmorpg based/style of games, i have got some experiance of these types game now i am impressed with how this game works, i wish i knew about this when i got thrown in the deep end with much harder to understand games, i have only played 3 hours as i write this but the story line is kind of clever each task you do sends you further into the map and towards stronger enimies, you learn how to use way points (obelisk's) you do need to get some coins to activate these, i think there is a way to make the game a bit better if you decided to pay and upgrade your account but i have left my account on a free game for now, i hope this review helps and you give this game a try for yourself "

												I played Aion for a whole year after the release. After starting this up and testing a few things, it's become clear that the major bugs from the old days are still around. The Cash Shop on top of that, makes this a waste of time for any player who seeks competitive play. Gameforge made a terrible game even worse.			"

												I actuallly like the games content. Its graphical, it has a good story to the game depending if your following the main quest. It's got a World of Warcraft element to this game which actually i enjoy, without needing to pay every month, unless you want to buy something on this game. With these type of games you can game Solo, interact with friends, go on quests, having your own house - depending on your level and ect...Its a nice game to play as long as you have a upgraded account. There are different accounts to the game (only 3); 1, starters account (nice way to level and getting to know the games controls). 2, veteran account (only can get if you are a old player, or you at least buy a premeum account once or more.) 3, Premium account - temepary (This account can be brought for extra bonuses and more... This account is the only account which you buy once have a limited time and become a veteran).This game is a brilliant game and the only downfall to the game is that it says free to play and some fetures you need to pay for but you dont need to worry about it, its a game and its okay to support the developers because the longer you play the developers can build more games like this and come up with original ideas. And when the game gets even interesting ill be sure to support this games by buying a premium account.I know that the games reviews are mixed, some people don't like this game:And people need to take into account that all people are different and all our minds work in different ways, the haters that dont like this game have probably went into the game with high expectations and as they wasnt met they got bord really easy. This game is a MMORPG that needs you to go into the game with an open mind and grow with the story because its meant to set your mind free from real life and become that virtual character think of this virtaul world as your world and you've got a story to tell.If you have read this review all the way through,                                                                                  THANK YOU!!!Please help the developer and help grow the AION COMMUNITY. It's a Great Game hopefully you do to. Also id like to hear your thoughts, please comment below.			"

												I think Aion is a Very Good Game. Unfortunately this version is not.The free to play version by Gameforge limits you to 2 characters trading is almost totaly disabled and chat is restricted unless you pay for a ""Gold Pack"" every 30 days.The Gameforge version also tends to be updated several months after the nc soft version which is almost totaly unrestricted.Both versions of the game appear to be available on Steam but choice seems to be restricted by location, as I am in the E.U. I only have the Gameforge version available. Please Steam let your users make their own choice.Personally I've abandoned the Steam / Gameforge version and I'm playing on the north american servers via the NCSoft launcher.So while I do recommend the game I don't reccomend this version.

												~~ Don't look at my 2 hours here. I've played Aion since beta on NCWest servers ~~Graphically the game is stunning - certainly for it's time.The music the game uses is awesome, but what do you expect when singers like our late and beloved Origa have sung parts of the soundtracks.My main problem is that after all this years there are still areas (even in low level areas) where there is FORCED GROUPING as well as a lot of FORCED PVP content.Problem with the FORCED GROUPING is the reason this game failed initially, because a lot of people could not find parties for these (low level) areas and could not continue on the MAIN QUEST of the game. IMO this is a big failure of the game...The FORCED PVP is not a problem to some players, but it's kinda BS that when you hit around level 25 and MUST go to the center of the world, where every level 65 from the other faction is waiting for you and gank the hell out of you. Same problem arises with the so called 'rifting'. These are portals to go to the opposing side and most of the time it's those maxed out level 65ers hopping there to (once again) gank lowbee players.Last but not least, it's publisher... I wonder if NCSoft even tried their best to find a EU publisher for Aion or just took the 1st one they came across. GameForge is one of the worst MMO publishers we have here in Europe...			"

												I've spent about 4 years in this game and I have to say, it is a good game. Or at least, it used to be good. The game kinda died after 2.0. I mean, I'm a PVP freak and this game delivered a good PVP experience, but they slowly killed it. It has lots of content, but if you're soloing, it sucks. The community is♥♥♥♥♥♥and is hard to find a group of people to constantly play with. Everyone acts ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and no one really plays for fun anymore. The game itself is great, but the way they handle things is... meh. Anyway, I had a great time playing it, especially the first 2 years (and that's mostly because of the people I've played with), so I'll give it a plus.			"

												You can call Aion p2w because of arena tickets and some other stuff in shop, but it's still not that bad. There are worse p2w games around, for example Mu Online. You can call community toxic, but You can still find nice people to play with and overall it's not that awful like in League of Legend for example. Aion is worth to try in my opinion, but it's getting harder and harder for new players to start from zero. High ranks are kinda unavailable to reach for starters. You basically have to farm rank 1 items which are more expensive and it will take more time for You to get into endgame like this. Anyway welcome in Aion!			"

												Hey,Aion is a decent game, probably one of the best MMORPG's out there. Don't let negative critiques make you doubt to try it out as it's just a lot of people downvoting because they don't like the publisher. Altough without gameforge there would be no Aion in EU.As a beginner it won't be easy, but if you follow a guide for levelling and just apply to everything you'll get money, gear, friends that can help you and so on :) It's currently in 4.9 in EU.

												Remember playing Aion when they started the F2p years ago... long before it was on steam (was 2.7 back then I guess), played till 3.X or something.Aion was a really good game.Recently I bought a new rig installed steam and saw that Aion was now on steam... so I though ""Why not ?""2 heures later, after full installation and update, I finally connected to my old veteran account... after the first nostalgic feeling and the few bad surprises brought by the version upgrades (lost rank/stigma broken/some map and features removed/empty servers/etc...) I had a flashback... memories of an orc I met in skyrim... that orc told me ""clinging onto things that have had their days is unbecomming..."" That's what aion is now.Graphics are now dull and obsoletes (I'm running the game with a I7 processor 57xx watercooled, 16go ram and a Geforce GTX 970 titan so every settings are maxed), same goes for the game mecanics (dont wanna have to TAB-target  monsters or other players in 2016).Also those mecanics that were already uselessly complicated and absolutely non-userfriendly (it's a hardcore korean MMORPG afterall), with all the stack of versions upgrades/bug fix/gameplay-wannabe-rebalances/non-working-anti-cheat (more than 50go of datas!)  it went to the point it became ridiculous. Not to mention how it shamelessly slided to the P2W side of the gaming... You can almost ear the scavengers gathering above the dying servers...We can call it a good old school Korean MMORPG... a game of another (past) time that WAS enjoyable, but who cant suffer comparison with recent MMOs and is now barely worth the trouble of installing it for nostalgics former players, or out of curiosity... but it's now definitely unbecomming (Yeah the orc's dead ^^)Aion is a monument of the MMORPG genre, but in the same fashion as the coliseum or the pyramid of kheops... a ruin of the past (though they dont sell postcard on Aion yet...). RIP Aion '-'			"

												Time for my review... biggest piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ rubbish, useless developer ever.So what to say, despite what steam states on my hours, Ive spent on and off 6 years in aion, I returned recently to find the game hadnt changed much (4.0) and that people were still pretty damn toxic in the game... the toxicity is due to people constantly moaning about everything, or simply trashing each other in the trade channel endlessly.Anyway this game only has one decent feature and that is the aerial combat... yes this is one of the only MMO's I've played where you can have free roam flappy wingy combat.... apart from my more recent venture into Riders of Icarus.Anyway aion would have been a winner if the likes of Godstones (its in the name, you have a paralyse or silence godstone, you will win in every fight, regardless of skill), were never included in the game, also the Lag and server issues are insane... if you have 1 fps in abyss pvp that is considered normal, also if your ping goes upto around a billion m/s that is again normal. So now onto Gameforge... what a bunch of baffoons... I've never encountered anyone capable of taking an NCsoft game... already pretty badly supported.... to then make it worse.... Gameforge introduced the system of Pay to win, also pay companies around Germany (where gameforge are based) to hack the game. The game is completely full to the brim with hackers. You will get a massive lag spike in most cases then boom your dead... nothing you can do... or you could be an assassin in advanced stealth, only for someone who cannot see you, or even know you are near them, run upto you exactly where you are and attack you.. yes hackers. They are everywhere, again ruining the game. And just so you are aware incase you think ""oh but hackers will be banned"".... no if the player has bought anything with real money on the ingame shop, then they will at absolute most recieve a 3 day ban then never recieve another ban. Gameforge rewards those who pay them with allowing them to do whatever the hell they want.So why the negative post, it is somewhat bias at the moment, I was just playing aion a few minutes ago, only to discover as of Aion 5.0 an entire armor set and weapon set I had prepared, enchanted and socketted and yes Godstones... was infact no longer in my inventory, it turns out, and ♥♥♥♥ you gameforge ,,, that if bought at 'x' time and not enchanted to +10  (all mine was at +8-9 as i was out of kinah (ingame currency)) it would all be destroyed... yes thats right over 500 million kinah wasted.... yes that number is correct many years of grinding and playing 500 million... So safe to say, never again.The games graphics are♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game itself is♥♥♥♥♥♥apart from flying around. I was one of the original players to be suckered in by the trailer from World of Warcraft, and my god I should have stayed with Wow... jesus H Christ this game is an epic disappointment....Just in case anyone thinks ""OMFG WOW FAN BOI"" no I hate wow... spent 7 years in that game... will never return to it.Anyway at the end of the day peeps its your money if you want to play aion, remember you can easily pay to win, and you will definitley die from hackers at least a million times.

I got to the login screen, I tried my steam account as a login, it didn't work ( WHY? Every other game I got via steam, and needed a login worked with it just fine. Warframe, Requiem, Star Trek Online, etc. Why this game isn't working, I have waited long enough alredy, why does it want me to go through a login creating process, and waste another 10 mins?)So I clicked the ""New Account"" button, which got me on a website. I gave my details, and got no verification e-mail. (More wait... GREAT!) So I tried to ask for a new verification e-mail. Still nothing. I restarted the client, clicked on ""New Account"" again, and the website I should have gotten was shut down, and I got a message saying that something went wrong, and they are working on it, and there was a link to the support site....I uninstalled, deleted all the content, and trying to forget this game atm...

												I have been around since 2.7. Was pretty late to discover this game :( started playing just 2 months before it went f2p. Anyway lets get started. I used to hate gameforge alot.. I hated them from the bottom of my heart with all the♥♥♥♥♥♥I had to go thro because of them.After 2-3 years I am starting to think ""Hey idk if its just me but gameforge might actually be Alright"". Because after growing up I realized their actions make sense. There is still things I hate them for. Like 1. One simply does not merge a english server with a spanish server. My english drama popcorn time global chat turned into gibberish I can't understand.. Mind you I speak 5 languages fluently. To top it of. These guys can't speak a second language. Even I can't communicate with theese guys... I am not learning another language just to talk with theese guys.Sieges and all the cool stuff that requires communication is destroyed beyond limits.  You just gotta go with the flow cause you don't understand♥♥♥♥♥♥anyway. Follow the mass and you should be ok. If they spilt up just follow your alliance and see what they are doing and try do the same. If they call your name for whatever reason. Must be cause you are doing it wrong so back off a little. Good parts.I haven't seen a single bot on EU. For 3-4 days now that I have come back. Chats are clean, except Spanish.Fair to play. They lowered alot of the starter restrictions. Think it should be more playable now as a starter. If you played but didn't like the restrictions I recommend you play now.If you happen to join me on Hellion. Make sure you make asmodian.

												I have been around since 2.7. Was pretty late to discover this game :( started playing just 2 months before it went f2p. Anyway lets get started. I used to hate gameforge alot.. I hated them from the bottom of my heart with all the♥♥♥♥♥♥I had to go thro because of them.After 2-3 years I am starting to think ""Hey idk if its just me but gameforge might actually be Alright"". Because after growing up I realized their actions make sense. There is still things I hate them for. Like 1. One simply does not merge a english server with a spanish server. My english drama popcorn time global chat turned into gibberish I can't understand.. Mind you I speak 5 languages fluently. To top it of. These guys can't speak a second language. Even I can't communicate with theese guys... I am not learning another language just to talk with theese guys.Sieges and all the cool stuff that requires communication is destroyed beyond limits.  You just gotta go with the flow cause you don't understand♥♥♥♥♥♥anyway. Follow the mass and you should be ok. If they spilt up just follow your alliance and see what they are doing and try do the same. If they call your name for whatever reason. Must be cause you are doing it wrong so back off a little. Good parts.I haven't seen a single bot on EU. For 3-4 days now that I have come back. Chats are clean, except Spanish.Fair to play. They lowered alot of the starter restrictions. Think it should be more playable now as a starter. If you played but didn't like the restrictions I recommend you play now.If you happen to join me on Hellion. Make sure you make asmodian. Elyos are not cool, and message me if you need help.Hmm so what else is good except the generic. There is not so much pay 2 win. Ofc it depends on how you see it but I definetly think EU is not pay 2 win. If anything I would call the ""praise the NA server"" the definition of pay to win.

												I really liked AION up until it got itself on Steam. I'll be honest. It feels a bit annoying as because I couldn't log in with my old details, and for some reason wasn't even able to recover my old account. So that did feel terrible, and led to a boring grind to try and get back where I was.Okay. So whole technical thing out of the way. AION is an absolutely BEAUTIFUL RPG for a free-to-play. And features some of the most beautiful graphics I've ever seen in an RPG. I won't give too much credit to it, as there are more graphically advanced games out there now, but as FTP games go, this probably has the most beautiful environment even on lower graphic settings.As for gameplay... I didn't really get much from it as far as I managed to get. It felt slow, and quests felt like a hideous chore as fights felt slow and tedious, which is irritating for an RPG with fighting elements. And the early quests... really felt like you got nowhere (bear in mind I played this before it got on to Steam). I did however try to get as much from the start as possible. I would maybe have liked an easier progression so that you weren't skipping quests to save so much time.Going on to controls, I liked how the game was controlled, and liked the familiar layout of an RPG. It felt like a game that could easily be played. Camera was easy to control, and made the whole game feel so much smoother.Character customisation... I wouldn't complain about it so much if it had more options so that it wasn't only humans. I mean, it's nice that they are. But I'll be honest, it's too easy for everyone to look exactly the same. So honestly, this isn't a game you should play for character diversity, 'cause to put it simply: it doesn't exist. There is a lot you can do with the bodies and face shapes, but in the end, it's still easy to make a bunch of identical characters.I would recommend this game to anyone interested in a beautiful game with some good game mechanics, as an introduction to MMORPGs this is an excellent choice. Would still recommend WoW over it any day due to it's rather non-existent lore and not a huge diversity of characters who're important to stories though.			"

 Positive: This game is awsome with this graphics, so many quests and a lot of things to do like :) you can craft so many items, believe me, crafting mode is amazing :) also you can got your own house and decorate it! :) so many pets, so many things to do and explore! But best thing is wars with other race, depends on what side you are... :) Negative: 1. You can't trade with other, because you need a gold-pack (10$).2. If you want to get your best gear, you need to spend some money for Gold-Pack, because you can't get best rewards.3. If you not living there, you can't get gear, because it's takes ages... and then you get it, 2-3 month and here we got a new one - farm again! :)  P.S. It's only my opinion, all games got some negatives, but who cares, I'm still playing it since 3.5 version :))  "

												I did practice many of those free MMORPG, and I did abandon most of them for the same reason: although the software was supposed to be free, the gameplay was always restricted for the people who don't invest in one or another way in the game, by paying items, more evoluated personages, or ""Premium"" rights or features in game. A few are even very odd to play freely, due to one, many, or all of these reasons :- item creation system really badly restricted,- low number of allowed works and hobbies,- trade system forbidden or strictly restricted,- many quests impossible to reach,- personages development slowered,- forbidden races or shorter number of abilities...In most of the 3D MMORPG I had to suffer one or many restrictions that made me flee from the game sooner or later, and for this reason I was quite suspicious when I installed AION, wondering if it was deserving me to spend so many time on it (the game file is very big and take few hours to download through a basic ADSL modem).But as soon as I launched the game, I realized this one as nothing common with the other MMORPG. Free number of item creation in all the work categories allowed, armors and weapons easily upgradable for everyone, any quest can be achieved if you choose to accept it, interesting gameplay, and (at least at my personal knowledge) no ""Premium reserved content""... Everybody can choose to play totally freely, or to invest a few coins in a favourite item, pet or mount, to be able to get it more quickly. This is a clever way to make the money needed to maintain the game, and I really wish to say every MMORPG lovers that AION is a game that deserve their attention.			"

												Yes, AION is kind of grindy...Yes, AION is a classic fetch quest MMO RPG...Yes, AION is kinda old...BUT, everytime that I was going to start a new MMO RPG, I don't know why but I found myself getting back to AION. I think that's enough for my review...P.S. (american servers are far better than european ones)			"

												Aion is a pretty good MMORPG. Yes - it is a little grindy, it has mediocre graphics, and sometimes seems repetitive (go kill some mobs, come back and have a revard) but it still has something that will make you come back to Atreia. A very big advantage of AIon is that it has a HELL LOT of items, quest and acticities to do. This game has got some kind of feel that will stuck with you.			"

												I enjoyed lvling up, community of grownups and epic pvp huge battles.I mean i did play other mmorpgs like World of Warcraft, but Aion has truly unique pvp system.That's why i always return to play it, it has loads of fun.Now only problem is, 1v1 is not balanced, so some classes have big advantages over others, in group pvp it pretty balanced. Now the only hard part and the only negative side is to find balanced server with healthy populations and 50:50factions balance. Other than thatm it's perfect. And it's not a pay to win game.			"

												Hello All,This game is a great MMO/RPG. The experience I have had playing this game has been satisfying but as always, there is a better game out there than AION. I have now started Final Fantasy XIV and I understand that Final Fantasy XIV is not free-to-play but the money you pay is worth it. Enough about FFXIV.AION has a great story line, the game can get sometimes boring and you can at times... struggle with the quests or campaign missions that you have to complete. This game is always constantly updating which isn't a bad this but for the size of the updates, the game doesn't exactly benefit from this. You also cannot see any visualization via the updates either.I do recommend this game for its gameplay, the graphics are up to standards of how they should be. The character customization is very deep and is great if you have the patience to spend time creating your character. If you are a player who is trying this game out for a short amount of time then I wouldn't personally spend too much time personalizing your character.Loading times with this game depending on your machine can vary. Stutter occurs on any machine whether it is terrible or mint. Especially in the world Pandemonium. Personally I would choose the faction Asmodian. Elyos are the 'Goody two shoes', where as Asmodians are extremely tank whichever job you go for. I played as multiple jobs such as Chanter (Priest [Healer]) and Tank (Gladiator [Warrior]).But this game cannot be mistaken from the cons that it has due to its Free-To-Play Services. You are restricted with a few abilities that could be useful but these, obviously you need to purchse these abilites. A 'Gold Pack' (Purchased from the AION SHOP' is what includes the abilites that could be useful without paying for them.I hope this review was helpful but this game overall is very good. Give it a try and see what you think of this.Many Thanks, Kind Regards,Pure Phantom			"

												Going back felt like a mountain fell on me. Was prepared for 'felt like I got hit with bricks', but along came a mountain...*reminiscing in the corner*Apart from that, it's really has upped its game on the character creation, (yeee, free 'plastic surgeryy' good one korea ;3 )- changed the damn stigmas again -making it harder to find the one u realllllly neeeed T.T  *cries in the corner*.-some weird event has started, and hundreds of people are loosing their life...by no lifing over it.. :'C plz donate. - new region was a sight for sore eyes. -I am now homeless, yay.. all that effort for making a nice little house came to good use I see. :)  Everything is the same, but everything has changed.. It just has so many ways to build ur character and gives so much freedom to just explore ur character. And yeh, the server u choose is either a hit or miss kinda thing regarding the community.  But it's hard to get back on track as I feel like I'm in the matrix rn with the wrong gear and all. XD It's just a hit or miss game.  "

												(IMPORTANT)-For some reason they decide (or maybe they don't even know) to auto-uncheck an option that doesn't let you see below lvl 65 normal quests, only the main storyline quests and deep blue arrow quests.This is a problem,since you end having no quests whatsoever and being underleveled on maps.You also end missing some good gear,titles,coins & and money if you don't check the option in the beggining.I realized this too late (i'm lvl 40),don't get me wrong,you can still do the quests, but they will not show even if you check the option since they're too slow for your lvl.If you ask me, i'm not going to check every NPC on the low lvl areas again so yeah...not gonna waste my time.-About the F2P model, i don't see any problems at the moment, at least on the PVE element.-The servers looks like they're a little empty, maybe that's why they've merged ENGLISH servers with SPANISH ones (bad decision IMO).-I don't know about pvp, couldn't try it because of the quests problem,pretty sure i missed the Abyss quests because of that.Overall, i mean...it's a good MMORPG and the F2P model is allright,but it seems pretty dead for me, give it a try anyways.

												Personally I really like this game, the graphics are great and the overall storyline is consistant even with so many side-quests available, there are multiple campain quests in certain ares if your level is higher than it should be so there is more to do if something is difficult at that moment in time. The community is alright, I've had people help me out occationally and vice-versa. Gathering can be an issue when you reach the abyss however, there is one campain quest that requires a certain activation stone that can only be obtained through trade or by creating it whihc requires a high gathering skill as well as being able to craft it, using trade brokers needs a gold account as well so if neither of these are an option its practically impossible to finsih that one unless you want to pay for it. The game is pretty replayable as well, I mean there are two races and alot of roles to pick from with in them. On the downside: it's pretty hard to level up eventually when side quests give you minimal exp and you can't do another campain one until you hit the level requirement for it. Again gathering is an issue sometimes, more so because certain area have specific points needed to gather something, Aethertapping is something I find hard to improve when I can't find the lowest level vortex to use apart from the occational one or two in Verteron. Other than that I see nothing else to rant about in my view.			"

												I have played Aion since lauch in 2009 over here, and only recently quit because of how much time I spent in-game, though you can take that to mean the game is brilliant! The only thing you have to get over is the graphics when you start playing it. The new content from around level 60 onwards looks far better. Anything wrong with the game is always eventually fixed by NCsoft and/or Gameforge. I'm not really sure why Gameforge get so much hate when they do a lot to keep this game going with events and such. The servers will go through a server merge in Jan-Feb 2016, so player population is nothing to worry about. Remember to play on the 'Fast Track Server' at early game to be surrounded by other players though. Definately worth your time to give it a go!			"

												Aion is not a pay to win game like many of the reviews have claimed. Ive been playing the game for 6 years now and I must have spent about £50 max on the game. Events are fun and you can win no matter what. Ive been through many different classes and characters. The pve system in the game is flawless and rewarding if you are willing to put the time in. Levelling is boring and relentless but non the less once you hit the level cap which can be done in 4-7 days, the game gets very fun and never becomes boring. p.s Im no hardcore gamer and work 35+ hours a week as many of you probably do, and I still managed to make time when I was levelling. The pvp system is great and once you get some decent gear which can be done by doing pve dailies and pvp dailies, you can have some amazing fun going round with friends and killing the other factions players all day long. This game is definitely a 10/10 for me. Theres constant updates and events and the game will only get better as there is always new worlds and areas and events. As the level cap increases too the game is just one of those you don't want to stop playing.			"

												Terrible game , quality is bad, you have to go across the whole map for quests, little fighting involved and fighting isn't very good in the game. Also there is no voice over what the people say for the quests thus making my statement of the game being bad stronger			"

												I've spent a good chunck of time on this game for the European release in 2009. Haven't touched it since 2011.On login today I had a metric♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of goodies waiting for me like 5 years of events and stuff. The community is vetry different and this is for the best!!! It's obviously a bit empty compared to what it used to be but it's just fine and I have found pvp when I was looking for it. The whole Gameforge thing seems much easier to handle. You do not have to download the game twice, I had like 2Mb of patch on launch and that was it. Important: if you ever try to use any services of Gameforge behind a VPN all your accounts get banned and you have to contact the customer suport to unblock it. It usually takes a couple of hours. I'm gonna have some orange juice now.			"

												I have been playing Aion since 2006 /07, i still have my original hard copy and Game time cards, i paid for this and all cause i loved it, and i still love it. The game is beautiful, and the content which it contains is fanastic. its one of those games that you really get out of it, what you put in. Since NCsoft released control of its european servers to Gameforge, admittedly the content flow and server stats have decreased alittle aswell as the amount of support and rewards you get for playing the game, if you compare the EU servers to the NA servers then installing the NA Client from AION.COM is probably a better option, ive been playing on both EU and NA servers since the game has been out, but i was originally paying to play on NA servers which has most of my characters, and which gets the most attention. However this should not stop you from downloading and playing the Steam Client which is Gameforge, Gameforge do maintain and look after their servers very well, and like any MMO the people you meet are the people you meet, they all vary. Aion is a graphicly Beautiful game, and its combat system, although alittle one sided, in the sense first hit is usually the winner ... in some cases, the combat effects and abilities are on their own level. One thing about Aion which is incredible though even from the very start and has never changed even up untill now is the Music. Aion's compisitons are just incredible and so touching, there are many moments in the game which are just made so much more amazing but the music and even now when i watch shows or hear simalar music i immeditly am drawn back to Aion. The game is not very taxing on your system thankfully even though it is an incredibly detailed piece of work, and there is a great vairty in weapons and armour aswell as cosmetic options, and their unique guild system which is called a ""Legion"". One of the most noticable and key features of the Legion system in the game is the emblem, where you can choose from their exising selection, or you can design and upload your own Emblem which is then usable on your cloak, Horse Armour, and on your Shield! This is a feature which i have always loved because it means that every Legion is then unique and those designs are more noticeable and rememberable. Even though the game went free to play i was worried when it happened but im not worried anymore, i am probably always gonna keep playing Aion because it holds a dear place in my Heart, and i strongly suggest that you download it and give it a try. Do remember though as i said before, that this game will only give back what you put into it, so to some it may be ""grindy"" but the end results show the hard work youve put in, and frankly i believe a great game is one which you get rewarded for working hard, not having it all handed to you on a silver platter. And Aion is a Great Game!			"

												Gry MMO są niezwykle ważnym segmentem rynku pecetowego. To jeden z nielicznych przypadków, w których można mówić o naprawdę dużych zyskach i udanych próbach radzenia sobie z piractwem. Oczywiście istnieją nielegalne serwery prawie każdej gry, ale wciąż wielu graczy decyduje się płacić abonament, żeby bawić się w komfortowych warunkach. W ciągu ostatnich kilku lat pojawiło się parę dużych tytułów z tego gatunku, które miały przyciągnąć ogromną liczbę osób i zagrozić pozycji lidera, czyli World of Warcraft. Na razie nie udało się to nikomu – nawet tak duże marki jak The Lord of the Rings Online, Warhammer Online czy Age of Conan nie zdołały wywołać większego wstrząsu. Po drugiej stronie globu, w Azji, czyli prawdziwym królestwie MMORPG, powstał Aion. Tytuł dzieła firmy NCsoft to imię boga, stwórcy tego uniwersum. Czy w samej grze można znaleźć pierwiastki boskości i geniuszu? Świat Aiona został rozdarty na trzy główne strefy, zamieszkałe przez odrębne rasy, mające jednak w pewnym sensie wspólne korzenie. Gracze mogą wcielać się w przedstawicieli dwu z nich, czyli w Asmodian i Elyosów, skłóconych ze sobą nawzajem i walczących dodatkowo z bezwzględnie złymi Balaurami (kontrolowanymi przez sztuczną inteligencję). Ci ostatni zamieszkują przestrzeń zawieszoną pomiędzy dwoma kontynentami, znaną jako Abyss. Poszatkowana w potężnym wybuchu „otchłań” składa się z pomniejszych wysepek i twierdz, znajdujących się pod silnym wpływem Aetheru, czyli magicznego surowca, pozwalającego między innymi na unoszenie się w powietrzu. To niezwykłe miejsce staje się głównym polem konfliktu trzech zwaśnionych stron, oferując graczom mieszkankę rozgrywki PvP (gracz kontra gracz) z PvE (gracz kontra otoczenie).Do naszej dyspozycji oddano cztery typy postaci, które później rozwijają się w łącznie osiem dość stereotypowych klas. Edytor postaci jest naprawdę potężnym narzędziem i pozwala wcielać w życie zarówno fantazje nastoletnich chłopców, jak i prawdziwe koszmary. Większość graczy decyduje się oczywiście na tworzenie pięknych, wysokich i umięśnionych mężczyzn oraz drobnych, uroczych dziewczyn, ale zdarzają się wyjątki. Dzięki dużej swobodzie można stworzyć i wysokiego elfa, i mikroskopijnego, brodatego krasnoluda, który biegnąc w zawrotnym tempie wywija nóżkami. Na pewno zostaną więc zaspokojone osobiste aspiracje twórcze każdego z graczy. Duży zakres skalowania poszczególnych części ciała oznacza też niestety zachodzenie na siebie niektórych elementów zbroi, włosów czy uzbrojenia, ale to już drobny szczegół. Wybierając stronę konfliktu na danym serwerze, nie możemy stworzyć postaci reprezentującej przeciwną frakcję. Szybko okazuje się więc, że przychodzi nam zmierzyć się z częścią znajomych, którzy wybrali inną ścieżkę. Zanim dochodzi do kontaktu, czeka nas sporo zadań, potworów do ubicia oraz krain do przemierzenia. Generalnie podzielony na strefy świat gry zamieszkuje kilka gatunków zwierząt i bestii, które przewijają się przez kolejne etapy fabuły. Treść zadań szybko zaczyna się powtarzać, skupiając się na absurdalnej eksterminacji wszystkiego, co się rusza (najpierw zabijamy wilki zagrażające bydłu, później zabijamy bydło dla skór). Gra jest liniowa i nie pozwala na żadne wybory czy decyzje (oprócz sporadycznych przypadków), czasami prowadząc na manowce (łatwo przykładowo ominąć małą wyspę idealną dla poziomów 20-25).			"

												After 4 years of playing this game I must tell that there were times that it was boring and entertaining, obviously like every other game ! I recommend it for people who have time to spend their days trying hard to make money for goldpacks or simply like to go p2w. So yeah it's fun with goldpack, but when you aren't planning on spending whole days farming or throwing money on this game, choose a different game or play feeling ♥♥♥♥♥♥ :) Of course it's all thanks to gameforge so you can always go and play US ver, where gp isn't needed. GL(EDIT) I have to correct myself here. DO NOT PLAY AION EU. Support is irresponsible and not serious at all. I lost half of my items from my inventory after 5.0 update and they dare to tell me that it's my own business and they won't help. You really don't want to deal with them. Bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Run as far as you can from this toxic support and toxic community as well!			"

												For all the people that like grindy stuff, leave my hours of this game on steam, I play on NA servers. Grindy game, rewarding for hard work, failing and a bit of pay to win. The longer youre in the game and the more you farm, the better rewards you'll get. I think that farming is pretty fun and challenging. My experience with NCSoft is pretty nice. Yes, they had some major ♥♥♥♥ ups concerning pay to win methods, but Gameforge won the tittle of the most dumbest. Since when one must pay for a basic function in MMORPG? Since when do you need to pay real life monney just to use trading? And not to mention that you need to PAY WITH REAL LIFE MONEY just to get XP? Gameforge ♥♥♥♥ed this♥♥♥♥♥♥up. If you want to play Aion, donwload NCSoft Aion launcher and play on NA without any worries for the ping. Dont waste your time leveling and spending money for nothing. NA servers are free.			"

												Good game( NCSOFT south korean company), but worst EU company (gamefore) to launch.From the company payments, the gold pack is not the key point to be negative. The key point is1. It is very expensive for enchanting, like 100Kk Kinah to enchant 1 time of your gear,129 aion coins one time(roughly= 8£, 10 Euros).I can not believe how can gameforge charge for enchanting gear like this, never saw this charging way in Chinese and Korean server.You have got 10 parts gear can be enchanted, normally the maximum number of a gear can be enchanted to lv 15.If you failed to enchant, the high Daeva gears will be destroyed.2.The worst in the game( EU server) is the old players are really unfriendly to new players. Once you reach level 66, if you go instance without buying several sets(1 set called Ancient Coin gear set around 300kk, 30£. 1 set called ""rune set"" from handcraft making around 1000KK, 100£)from old players, you will be kicked out of the group because of low Hp, or attack, magic boost and nobody will happy to play with you even if they can pass the instance with you.I hardly met this situation in other regions server based on the aion.So if you are really interested in the Aion in EU server, you at least to ready for paying 150~250£ initially, for gold packs, a Wing(+10), an entire set(+10), a mount.That is the reality in the game in EU server.
