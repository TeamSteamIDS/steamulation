								( Updates at bottom. )A friend got this game for me, I looked at the title, looked at the screenshots and groaned. ""Not another 'zombicide game' trying to say it's a 'survival game'."" But he got it for me, and it woud be rude to not atleast give it another shot. I'm rather glad I did.I started play in a -private game- with my friend, set to the medium difficulty. Day one was a mess, I figured I was playing another left4dead 'survival' game which was all about killing as many zombies as one humanly can before wandering to the next area. Well, after breaking a few weapons on zombies and getting no reward outside of what lint was in the zombie's pockets, I knew I was wrong, and night had begun to set in. My friend luckily -had- played before and warned me that things got a lot different at night, so we managed to make it through with no deaths, but many close calls.50 days in, I'm more than hooked. Survival is the key- Food, water, scavving, repairs and building at day. Shelter, security and stealth at night. Crafting damn near anything in a Alpha game, from multiple layers of cobblestone walls outside of what used to be a log cabin. Each peice taken the long crafting process of finding rocks, chopping them down into stone and then turning into cobblestone. More? We built a second story for storing items. More? Two layers of spiked pits surrounding our 'cabin' with only a ♥♥♥♥♥ for us living people to cross. More? Another story, turned into a rooftop farm of corn, blueberries and potatos. Nights can get rough at the ""Spillway Estate"" as we have now dubbed our fortress, we try to keep quiet throughout the nights, limiting player activity to things that dont make sound, or carry foods on our person that generate smell. ( Yes, that's a thing!) A chest near the front door full of easy repaired and built weapons. Pistols, a shotgun and some ammo for it, fresh from the forge! when things get really bad- The newly crafted fallback point, a basement/bunker. Metal walls , floor, and roof, only one entry which is blocked in times of emergencies. Beds, emergency food and water (or tea!) supplies stored next to some of our most powerful weapons. ( Chainsaws, landmines, a rocket launcher, and a whole lot of shotgun ammo! )To sum it all up, it has a few minor bugs, but it's in alpha, and they generally get fixed up rather swiftly! Worth the money, great with friends- Especially when you notch up the difficulty and find yourself hiding for your life in a closet with nothing but a stick to protect yourself!Lots of potentiel, and fun as is.9/10(Aug 19, 2014 Update: 1)Been awhile since I posted this, but it has been brought to my attention that a good amount of people have read this. So I thought I owe it an update due to the many, many changes to the game:Crafting: Crafting is mostly the same beast as it was when I started, though so, so much more crisp now than it was before. A lot of the bugs have been worked out (Some still linger). You now can upgrate tiles after you lay them into more fortified version of their previous selves. (A wooden frame - Wooden block. - Reinforced wooden block - Metal reinforced wooden block.) As well as many other types of similar things, it's rather neat I think.Random world generation?! I admit the same ol' world was getting a bit old and such. So when I heard they had a random world with some neat UI upgrades I was excited. And it is nice, though has its bugs and the occasional cluster of buildings you recognise from the old world, but still adds a great stuff. Maps now have a ""fog of war"" making it harder, and more exciting to go scavanging!To come? I heard character creation comes at the next big patch. Could be wrong though.My rating remains the same.			"

								Three friends and I spawn in the wasteland biome.Thought we could make a shelter out of this apartment complex.Was going well at first.Gathered many supplies.Fortified the door.Was supposed to be temporary, started turning into something permanent.Everything was going well.they broke down the door...Everything went to hell.They started pouring through the stairwell.Dogs everywhere.The only way out was down.Started running down and dodging walkers.We got separated in half.Two of my friends made it out.My other friend and I were still stuck inside.Figured we'd spend the last night, hiding.The moaning of walkers never stopped.Morning came..It was time.We had to go.My friend and I continued to drill down passed the horde.Got desperate.I jumped out the second floor.Broke my legs.They were everywhere.Managed to limp through the horde.Met up with my other three friendsDon't look back..We crossed the river into a forest.Started off with a small shack.Turned it into a four house village.We had a wall, a trench around it.We had something.We never did forget about what happened that day in the wasteland.That right there, is just a small story (that wasn't even in full detail) of what 7 Days to Die is like. Very few may say that ""Oh, it's just another zombie survival game"" or ""Oh, it's just a DayZ knockoff"". Well, I'm here to tell you that this is not the case at all. I own H1Z1, DayZ, and 7dtd. I have to say that this is the best one. Why?1. The developers are actually going in the right path.2. Loot system is pretty awesome.3. Crafting system is also pretty awesome, may take a bit to get used to. But, still awesome.4. Instead of just piling blocks and making a box-house, there are actually physics to the building system. Like, in some cases, you actually have to put support. Otherwise that sniper tower or that neat house will collapse on you. Which has happened to my friends. It's kind of satisfying to watch, but damn you're mad if it's your structure.5. The different variety in enemies is cool! Right now, you have: bees, dogs, and zombies; and other different kind of zombies to add to that.6. Speaking of zombies. This game's zombies have something that DayZ doesn't have. You know... They actually pose a threat and can move in numbers. There are moments when you see that police station surrounded by a horde of zombies and you think to yourself ""No, I'm good"", because they actually threaten you. The fact that they sprint at night by default (settings can be changed) also adds a thrill to the game. To a point in which you don't even want to leave your shelter at night because you can hear a spider zombie calling a nearby horde. Hordes also happen randomly at anytime and anywhere. This is also unheard of in DayZ. You never see a horde in that game. Also, as the days go on, the zombies start to get a little tougher. You start to feel that the apocalypse is worsening. Zombies are also smart.7. There's nothing more satisfying than fortifying your base to prepare for the undead. This game does a very good job at that. You can do almost whatever your mind imagines.. Wanna put a trench that surrounds your base and put spikes at the bottom of it? Do it. Want to salvage land mines from an overrun military base and use them as your own? Do it. Want to build a huge wall around your base? Do it. However, don't think that just putting a wall around your base will help. Zombies will rip through it and actually dig under the wall. We've seen this done in our server before, and it's frustrating, but it's so awesome having to constantly keep maintanence on your base and look for new ways to prevent them and to see your weak spots.These are just some of my points, and you wanna know the awesome thing? This right here, is just an alpha.. A ♥♥♥♥ing.. Alpha, and the developers have already come this far. As I type this, the alpha11 update is imminent and should be released any day now. This is said to be the biggest update this game has seen. This game is going nowhere but up.Unfortunately, I can't tell you about the PvP, because my friends and I just normally play on a private PvE server and survive together. I have no idea how well PvP works. If I ever play PvP, I'll tell you how it goes.Get. This. Game..It's a solid 15/10.			"

								First time playing when it turned night I had no choice but to burry myself in the dirt....Sitting in the pitch black hole just listening to the insane sounds of the zombies outside.I felt a real rush and fear not knowing what would happen.....Its rare a game can do that to you.Pros:Great extensive crafting mechanicLootingZombies present an actual challenege especially at night when they runMining for resources feels like you actually acomplished somethingCons:DOGS, $^#@ themStill in alpha so some glitches may occurPerformance can be rough on older systems unless you turn graphics all the way downAll in all though i give this game a strong 8/10 -The Fun Pimps seem to care about the game and are quick with fixes-It can be insanely addicting to play-I love the mining and crafting mechanics-The fun to be had in this game is only limited to your own creativity-LOTS OF REPLAY VALUEI am not good at writing reviews but I hope this helps at least one personFINAL VERDICT:  BUY THE GAME			"

								I have been playing this game since Alpha2, it is my and my son's favorite game to play together (he's 14). We have written a few suggestions that would increase longevity of gameplay, efficiency and fun.1. Decrease the stupid wasp noise, way too loud and obnoxious2. Incorporate rope, and simple machines including but not limited: pulleys for drawbridge function, trip wire, netting, and levers.3. Equipable ruck sack for additional storage, but decreased speed.4. Weather? rain would dampen smell and sound sensed by zombies, slow player... etcetera.5. A zoomable minimap6. Ladder lock, jump to eject, I have died way too many times falling off of a ladder.7. Easier book reading for recipes.8. Laser sight, red dot sight, and mechanical sight. Add a sword and a spear.9. Alliances, groups, clans?10. Big military base instead of those small camps. a lot of loot a lot of risk.11. First aid kit to restore either half or full health.12. Restaurant food prep/ovens and MREs13. Fall breaking: IE pressing space bar breaks fall.14. Silencers for the weapons15. ammo in inventory carries to belt with a reloading speed penalty instead of having to manually transfer16. Stamina regens faster when undected, slower when detected or hunted. "

								Minecraft was too boring for me (I'm not a creator for creations sake).Terraria was fun, I enjoyed the additional combat focus. DayZ didn't have 'it' for me, I didn't like the lack of building (at least when I played it)Ark was fun (dinos!), but it got stale as there was no forced conflict. No reason to explore, no reason to keep building. So it fell into the minecraft trap.7 Days to Die allows me to be creative, but gives me a good solid foundation of conflict and purpose to my building. Not only that, but it creatively forces/encourages me to get out of my safe keep and risk exploring which causes me to engage with the game content in a very enjoyable fashion.This was a recommendation from a friend based on the steam sale, and I've dedicated 90% of my gaming hours to this since I bought it over the holiday break. Strongly recommend.			"

								Considering the amount of hours I've poured into this game, I believe a proper review is far overdue. To give a bit of background, I first discovered this game back when alpha 9 was the current build. My adventure began when I logged into a singleplayer game in Navezgane with all the settings on easy. This was the first game of its kind that I had ever played, and I had no idea what to expect or how to play. This was evident, as I spent my first day sprinting through the Wasteland in which I had spawned, completely panicked because I had no idea what the game controls were and I had no idea how to get the endless trail of zombies off my back. I never did, either; I ended up dying multiple times and that was where my solo beginning of 7 Days to Die ended. Then, a few months later when alpha 9 got updated to alpha 10, I convinced my friend to buy the game when it was on sale so that he could help me learn how to play it and actually enjoy it. He caved, and so our adventure began in Navezgane once more. Of course, we spawned in the wasteland again, and it was like the horror of my solo journey all over again as we desperately tried to escape the zombies while scavenging for what little supplies we could manage to stop and gather without getting bitten by a dog or smacked by a cheerleader. By the time the 7th day had rolled around, we had finally gotten a grasp on how to play the game... or at least we thought we did at the time. I say this lightly, as we also considered killing ourselves a better alternative than the progressive zombie infection, broken legs, and the endless dysentery that we always seemed to have - probably because food was so hard to come by that we were filling ourselves with old sham sandwiches, rotten flesh, and raw eggs. We hadn't the slightest clue that we were completely destroying our chances of survival as our wellness plummeted down from 100 to 60. Then, our blissful ignorance turned to incredible terror as nighttime rolled around, and the hordes came for us. We had shacked up in the desert by the river and made twin towers out of the incredibly ineffective log cabin wood, which the sprinting, bloodthirsty masses of zombies tore through in a matter of minutes. We had little choice but to hide ourselves on our top floors, watching and waiting in horror as the dead simply demolished everything we had spent the last 7 days working for. But then, in a final moment of hope and desperation, we whipped out the chainsaws we had found and quite literally blasted our way through the masses, only to escape in the night and return in the morning to pick up the pieces and kill off the stragglers. We considered calling it quits and starting over, but ultimately decided against it and decided to dig ourselves a series of bunkers connected by tunnels across the desert. As time passed, we became wiser, and we grew stronger. It was day 35 that we had finally built ourselves and our base up enough to fight off the hordes of the 7th night. We were victorious.From that game on, we've stayed ever-faithful to this game. With every new alpha that's been released, we've been waiting on baited breath to launch a new game, each time slowly but surely helping us progress from the dark, early days of alpha 10 to the hardened, survivalist veterans that we are now in alpha 15. With countless play-throughs on both Navezgane and Random Gen, on servers belonging to friends, random people, and eventually even ourselves, we have learned the game, though we are far from masters. Each new alpha released is like an entirely new game, and we revel in the chance to start anew and work at the chance to better ourselves and our tactics even more.So, do I recommend this game? Well, that would depend on what you're looking for, and what you're expecting to take from the game. You will pour an endless amount hours into this game, you will sometimes regret it, but most of the time you won't. You will be frustrated, you will be terrified, you will be inspired, you will be determined, you will be devastated, you will be excited. The accomplishment you will feel is immense, and it will keep bringing you back to this game even when you think it won't. So, yes, I do recommend this game, because this game is golden, and it just keeps getting better and better.10/10 will continue to be terrified by dogs but explore the wastelands and cities unarmed anyway.

								Day 1 - Got attacked and almost killed on my first night. Then I went Rambo. Fought my way out and ran to a house. Hid in the attic until the sun came up.Day 2 - Found a few weapons and some rudimentary armor in the house next door. And the upper half of the owner. Gotta stay mobile until I find a place to settle in and make it defensible.Day 5 - Snuck around and scavenged houses for food and potable water. No sign of...people. Am I the last one alive?Day 10 - Found an abandoned military outpost. Made a door and barricaded myself inside of the largest tent for now. Will scavenge the surrounding area during daylight only.Night of the 10th day - They're everywhere. Oh God. They walk right by my tent. I'm cowering in a corner behind a desk with a pistol and a wooden club that I wrapped in some scrap iron. Only 15 rounds of 9mm for the pistol. I hope that they don't decide to tear the tent down around me.Day 11 - Began collecting resources. I think that I'll try sleeping tonight.Day 12 - They woke me up 2 times, but never took notice of me. I'm glad that I don't snore.Day 25 - Have been fortifying my position, dug a trench to trap the undead. Only the ""Spider Zombies"" can get out. I need to contain them somehow. Day 50 - Currently I have a fortress surrounded by metal tipped log spike traps 3 deep so they can't escape. Then I just stand on my roof and snipe the spider zombies. Collect loot and smile. I think that I'll be ok.Day 79 - Been farming. Food is plentiful now. Weapons and ammo are easy to make. I built my fortress on top of a deposit of iron, lead and potassium nitrate, with coal deposits poking out of the ground all around me! What luck!Day 1?? - There's no end to them. I heard a scream the other night. Not one of them. It sounded...human. Female. Close. By the time I made it outside at first light, all I found was a pool of blood and entrails a half mile from my fortress. Next to the carnage I found a purse with some pictures of a pretty young blonde lady with a cheerleading outfit on in one picture, in another she was in an expensive looking dress cuddled up to who was probably the star quarterback at her high school. The last picture was her with what must have been her family on vacation at an expensive looking beach house. They looked so happy. Her driver's license said that her name was Cindy Batross and she was 17 years old. There was a notepad with illegible scribbles and crude drawings of people eating each other. I cried as I realized that she saw my lights and was desperately trying to make it to the safety of my home. What may have been my only hope for companionship was now in the rotting stomach of the undead.Stardate 4/20 Delta V - Venison stew is good. It's lonely here. I found pictures in houses and I talk to the nice people in them. You want to be my friend, Jimmy? Ok. I promise that I won't chew on your bones. Day whatever - What was that noise? They scratch inside my skull sometimes. I saw the cheerleader. She doesn't have a stomach anymore, but she walks around with a little smile on her face and coos sometimes. Then she screams when I try to talk to her from my roof. Maybe I should let her in. Maybe she just wants to be friends.Night time now. She didn't want to be friends. Only my iron helmet kept her from chewing my face off. I cut her head off with my hunting knife. She didn't have any manners at all.Hump Day - I sewed her head back on and sat her in a chair. We talked for hours while I cooked some vension stew for us. She's nice, but a little cold. I hope that she's on the pill.Year of the Rat - I caught that ♥♥♥♥♥ Cindy looking at one of the other guys in the photos today. She denied it, but I know there's something going on while I'm out risking my life for us. Ungrateful ♥♥♥♥♥.Judgement Day - Cindy had to go. I had no choice. I had told her too much about Mrs. Doubtfire and she was plotting a coup to reap the benefits of our trade agreement with the rabbits. I loved her, but now her bones are scattered in the ashes.The Day I Die - Spent the last 30 winters here. I lost my mind a long time ago, though I regained some of my faculties after much reflection. I can no longer keep up with my home. It's only a matter of time before they break through. I never did find anyone else. No one came. The supply drops stopped long ago. I can only assume that the rest of the world succumbed to this hellish plague. The undead continue to march in all directions. I have stockpiled a large amount of explosive devices, guns and ammo. Tonight I will open the bridge to my door for them and when they are clamoring to peel my flesh from my bones, I'll let them in. The world will see the last survivor, not dying peacefully in my sleep, but raging against the darkness in one last epic battle. But I won't let them kill me. When it's finally hopeless, I'm going out on my own terms. Let them eat what is left of this shell after my spirit departs. Those damned fools won't make me one of them. My life is over.I can hear them now. There must be close to a hundred. It's time to face my fate.Here I come, Cindy. I'm sorry for everything.NOTE: This is a dramatization of in game events and doesn't represent actual game play. Don't get me wrong, the game is amazing and I can't wait to see where they take it for the end game. BUT, this little story was entirely made up in my head based on my experiences in the game and a fateful first encounter with a cheerleader zombie that seriously freaked me out. And based on the positive comments so far, I may turn this into a short story.Update 7/21/15: I've managed a plot that I can mold as more content is released and have been working on a solid beginning to explain just ""appearing"" as if from nowhere in Navezgane amidst the carnage. It should please quite a few fans of the survival horror genre. I'm not looking to invest a lot of time into a project that won't yield any revenue, so a very short story will set the bar and sway my decision to pursue a published work (with TFP's blessing, of course) in the future. I'll see how well it is received here and on some FanFic sites first. But rest assured, it's in the works as you read this text.Stay safe, survivors. And happy hunting!			"

I am speechless.I bought this game together with two friends after we ran out of Coop-Games to play.And since this game has been on my wishlist forever, I decided to go with it. It was on sale, after all.After a 5.5h session on the first sitting, we became addicted.And I mean, really addicted. Couldn't wait to come home from work and continue.To prepare.To survive.This game is basically a survival-bulding game. DayZ+Minecraft, to be  really general.You can build and destroy blocks, create furniture, traps, weapons, houses, etc.You can find blueprints and craft even more things!There is also a skillsystem in place where you can teach yourself recepies and f.ex. craft ammunition.But most of the time you're just gathering resources to set up a base and not die.And of course you alos have to eat, drink, stay warm and dry and not get sick.There are multiple ways to do so and the more you play, the more you'll learn.Pros:- Big world for you to explore (Either a map or randomly generated)- Lots of stuff to craft and build- New enemies with 7 days- Upgrade your weapon parts and build weapons from scratch- Change the world the way you want to! Dig caves, live in trees, etc.- Play with friends together / against / or alone- A lot of places to discover, change, upgrade and live in.Cons:- It lags when zombies spawn (Down to 20-30fps)- You can get stuck underneath the ground when you join a server- A few minor glitches- Not easy to get started; you need to read most stuff on the wikiOver all, I do recommend this game.In 3 days I logged 23hours of game time and I do not regret it. There's a lot to do, a lot to plan and a lot of fun involved. You get better, quicker and smarter with each day & move.If you love a scare, some pressure, crafting, harvesting, looting, creating, building and shooting, this game is for you! "

UPDATE:While I haven't played the game at all recently, I felt as though I needed to update this review to reflect on some of my experiences over the past couple of years. I have picked the game up again on occasion, but didn't find myself as content to continue playing as I used to be. There have been many changes over the past couple of years; mostly in terms of your character having a skill and perk system, which is a nice addition and adds a lot of RPG-feel elements. However, the game suffers from something I feel a lot of survival games lack; 'end game' replayability.Being a new player in this game is fantastic, as written in my original review below (long before I had so many hours played), but the fundamental problem is that once you are established, once you have access to creating your own munitions and have the hardware to farm resources effortlessly, the game becomes quite stale. I'm sure the addition of more NPC's etc. in the future will amend this, having a reason to leave your stronghold and go out into the world, but I feel as though the developers are perhaps setting their sights a little too high.A recent cross-platform release (consoles, *sigh*) was met with a huge backlash of negativity, mostly because the game needs so much work - not in terms of content, the game has an endless amount of items and block types and there is still the potential for a massively popular RPG/Survival experience in this game. The problem is that some of the core engine mechanics really, really need work. Movement feels sketchy, aiming weapons and firing them feels far from smooth and the game doesn't exactly run smoothly at high settings even with beefy hardware. This was forgivable 2 years ago, but for it to still be playing this way is dissapointing.I still hold out hope for this game, and I'm sure I will return to it, but I would love to see the developers iron out the creases in the core game mechanics instead of having such an enormous amount of focus on adding new things. Finding poop in toilets and having the ability to throw that poop is hilarious, turning that poop into compost to grow crops more efficiently shows great ingenuity, but I only wish they would iron out the creases before adding to the already vast amount of items/blocks/locations etc.I have no doubts about keeping my review positive - this is a fantastic game. I would still recommend this game to new players without hesitation, it is a great experience, especially with friends, but for it to become a true blockbuster, I feel the developers need to take a step back and improve on what is already there.Original Review From October 2014My first time playing this game was one of the most enjoyable noobie experiences I've ever had, digging a hole in the side of a hill before nightfall and hiding inside, starving and hoping nothing would find me, seeing sunrise has never been such a relief. After some exploration and scavenging for food and water, I found a town, thinking this would be a good place to lay my bed and fortify a building to try and hold off anything that came for me at night.What a mistake that was, a horde came for me and trashed my defenses, the few crossbow bolts I had managed to craft were consumed in no time, and I found myself in a backroom hacking through the roof trying to find an escape route, my friend below me yelling at me to hurry up as he desperately tried to repair the door that was being pounded on by zombies. ""I see daylight, I've found a way out!"" Our glimmer of hope ruined when I looked down to see my friend, looking up at me, with the floor beneath him almost completely destroyed and a horde of zombies under him, barely a block left to stand on. I told him not to look down, but naturally he did, what ensued was a genuinely fearful collaboration of curse words, desperation wouldn't be a fitting enough word to describe it.Genuine adrenaline rushes and forever fearing for your life, this game has brung about a whole new meaning to the survival genre, being in a fortified position and crafting yourself a lot of ammunition simply won't cut it, you can play rambo for a short time but your resources will eventually diminish if you use them too recklessly and you will find yourself back to being starving and hiding away once again, you really need to think about how and when you're going to engage the zombies by choice, because when a feral horde comes for you, you won't have a choice, and you better be ready for when that happens.Not only is this game a great thrill-ride and at times a genuine tester for your grey-matter, it is also a brilliant game to play with your friends and rewards co-operative gameplay. Sustaining yourself, by yourself, is indeed possible, but with friends you can assign eachother certain tasks, for example me and a buddy built a fortified bunker with a deep mineshaft underneath, he spent most of his days underground mining, creating ammunition and such, providing me with raw materials, while I worked on our surface defences and food supplies. Do-able alone but so much more efficient if planned with a friend, or a few friends is even better, unless you are the hardcore lone-wolf type.I have yet to play on a ""no rules/ PVP"" server, I can imagine that adds whole new elements of fear-factor into the game, knowing that other survivors may just snipe you from a distance and steal your stuff, at their own discretion, or maybe they will help you, it's up to them, I may build the courage to try this someday, at the moment I'm happy enough just trying to survive waves of zombie hordes on a PVE server.Overall this game is already almost a finished product in terms of crafting and survival aspects, there is the occasional annoying glitch/bug here and there as to be expected in a game at Alpha stage but I have found nothing game-breaking as of yet. To think that there is so much more to be added in terms of character customisation, experience points, more weaponry etc. is a very exciting thought indeed. I can see this game making a huge impact on release, it is genuinely brilliant fun.Highly recommended, especially playing with friends! "

								I originally played 7DtD for barely 3 hours when I first purchased this game because I didn't see the hype and that was a HUGE mistake seeing as I only made it to Day 2 (I'll give details on that in a bit) and in that time I died twice (I collapsed my base and then did the same with my mining tunnels) I got annoyed as I thought the game was broken and buggy, I then looked at the design, the fact that gravity affects structures, the fact that you can get cold, or overheat if you work for too long, the fact that if you get an illness and don't treat it you'll lose wellness, it's got a sense of realism that I've only honestly ever seen this game provide.The main aim of the game is to survive, you begin by building a base, getting some farms going for food, finding lakes for water, you go and raid some towns that you found whilst exploring to find the perfect spot for your base, and start making better tools, this is the first part where you need to be careful: There's a heatmap, if you make a forge or a mixer to get your base stronger you'll start to generate heat based on usage and that... Can draw zombies, you need to work out if you REALLY need the forge running 24/7, or your Campfire running to cook those extra eggs. Then you look to the top of your screen and realize... It's day 6... 23:48, panic sets in, you know that in less than 18 hours you're going to have some unwanted friends because: Each day you hit that's a multiple of 7 (7/14/21/28/35/So-on) the horde attacks, you can't just hide in your base and crouch whilst praying they cant see you, you're hunted constantly, you need to plan ahead and build a bunker, or get ammo together to defend yourself actively, your base defenses hold them off for a time but they begin to shatter, the spikes you laid down begin to collapse under the sheer weight of the rotten, malodorous corpses baring down on them, your walls begin to crack as they're relentlessly pounded on by the undead hordes that seek to make you their next meal, then... a friendly jingle plays, it's 6AM on Day 8, a smile crosses your face as you realize you survived, you realize that once you've slaughtered this wave of undead fiends you're mostly safe for another week, your bow thunks a final arrow into the Burned Survivor and he drops to the ground. Relief washes over you as you set to work repairing and strengthening your base.Exhilaration,Panic.Joy. Despair.Hatred.Nervousness.Anxiety.Pure unadulterated pleasure as you let loose a crossbow bolt into the zombies that berate you for breathing. This game will make you feel things you've never experienced before, my review barely scratches the surface, PLEASE, genuinely give this game a go, I promise you'll never regret it.			"

Early Access Review
								Firstly I want to say I’m really enjoying this gameSecondly I WOULD tell what is good about it. But I rather tell you a story.Once upon a time, in a hell hole, far, far away there was a nameless man who could punch insanely quickly and break bushes with his fists.He plopped into existence on a remote server. With nothing more than his starting items and a zombie mauling his face due to server latency.His journey started light heartedly. He came across a body of a dismembered fellow citizen, he politely inquired if the citizen would be requiring that wrench on his persons any longer. The man took the gentleman’s silence as a “yes, please good sir! I cannot bear to have it in my locale any longer!”The man then starting using the head of the wrench to mate with the faces of walking dead - It was the start of a beautiful relationship and symbiosis between two sentient objects. Man and wrench.After some through mating with skulls; the wrench began to tire, the man acknowledged his silent partner’s weary state and left her (My lawyers say the wrench must be a she due to gender neutrality) in his inventory to rest.The man travelled onwards, admiring the fly tippers that had plagued the lander with their rubbish tipping on public highways. “Are there no gentlemen left anymore?” the man asked himself. His companion would retort, is she were not so tired.The man after many minutes of walking the man was ambushed by 4 gentlemen, all armed with firearms pointed at him.The gentlemen asked in the most gentlemanly fashion:- “Want 2 help us come build a town :D ?”That man pondered for a while, this could be a trap. What he was more worried about is that following 4 burley white men into the bushes late at night could ruin his reputation as a stand up and decent gentlemen.Weighing the risks he agreed politely.The 5 gentlemen travelled down the road, for what seemed like many hours (20 minutes) until they came across a small town, partially build in the middle of a plains area.For the next few days the man and his fellow gentlemen laughed, sang, and drank the polluted water from the river merrily. And as a result were plagued by the ungentlemanly affliction of diarrhoea.Many days passed of incontinence and building.Then, a large pack of ruffians assaulted the town’s walls.The more nimble ruffians simply vaulted over the walls IN A MOST UNGENTLEMANLY FASHION while the slower Ruffians pounded on the walls and demanded an audience with us.I stood upon our half built watch tower. Gazing at the ruffians…The ungentlemanly behaviour…The pounding on the walls…The way they attacked us like feral beasts…The way they were dressed and many of them unclothed…Being a gentleman I knew this could only mean one thing. The French had found us.The walls fell, many died from being driven indoors and (presumably) forced to sample their heathen food.I did what I could, but there were too many Frenchmen to repel. I came down from my tower, firing my rifle as fast as I could at the hordes of unwashed Frenchmen. I could have sworn one was wielding a baguette.I was forced inside, I fired my rifle with the most British and gentlemanly fury I could muster.The Frenchmen piled up by the door. But there was too many.I then barricaded myself inside – buying myself only time.In my last efforts, I took out my tired companion. I bashed and bashed and bashed the wall in front of me, breaking through enough to escape.On the final swing my friend broke into pieces.I heard her speak to me, broken on the floor…“Be free”I ran outside, jumped over the fence and off to freedom.Then I disconnected.===THE SERIOUS REVIEW===In a nutshell 7D2D is what early access games should be. It has a good range of features to keep you entertained while updates come out. The devs were friendly and helped me with a FoV problem I had with the game (I suffer from acute simulation sickness).What put me off is seeing people and curators endorse the game as “like minecraft”Can we please get out of this trench of comparing everything to Minecraft?The genre is Voxel world not “Minecraft”, it’s like calling all FPS games “Like CoD”.There is much I still have to explore and it honestly is one of the best survival games I have ever played. Compared to a game such as DayZ everyone seems rather friendly. Which is much better than other zombie world based games like Dayz (not making many comparisons, for obvious reasons) because not many people seem to shoot me on sight. Which was refreshing.Once you get access to guns everyone loves you (totally unrelated I’m sure). Definitely worth a pickup. I can’t find much wrong with it. The only problems are purely cosmetic and don't break the game. Which is nice because every build seems to be very stable, aside from the few bugs that do get fixed rapidly.The only major complaint I have is that the range of melee weapons and a zombie’s reach feels misleading, if a reticule turned green when in range and red when out of melee range I would be happy with this. But it's hard to judge range and distance, espically when you are like me and you modded the FoV files because you suffer from motion sickness.Aside from that, completely worth the money - nice to see someone finally did the genre justice.The only warning I will give however is that this game is pretty damn taxing, not on your hardware, but on you;-1) The ambiance will quickly start messing with your mind (really good, props to the sound artists) and it's easy to give up because of it being ""too hard""2) Thankfully 7D2D isn't hard just because it has to be or it feels it must be. It's hard because it is. And thats what counts.			"

Early Access Review
								I've played most of the survival games out there, and this has to be by FAR the best one available. The Devs are very active, and are adding things at a very reasonable rate, with consistent patches and updates.This game just has everything you want. Zombies, and tons of them, especially at night when they turn into 28 days later crack zombies.Building, you can build underground, above ground, build castles, huts, shelters, expansions on already existing buildings. The things I've seen in this game amaze me. The creativity of some people is astounding. I've literally seen kilometer long tunnels leading from a base, to a nearby town. I've also seen castles surrounded with spikes, and hidden doors / passages.The looting system is also great. Items generally spawn every 7 in-game days which is a very reasonable amount of time. The randomly generated maps are amazing, and literally endless so you have to potential to find hundreds of towns, etc. So much freedom you can even deconstruct buildings in towns, use dynamite to blow things up, chainsaws, augers.The leveling system is very well done too, and very unique as it hasn't been done in other popular survival games. As you level up, you become more efficient at crafting - being able to create higher tier items. At first, you'll be able to create Faulty items, which are the lowest quality, as you level you'll be able to create from Faulty - Poor - Good - Fine - Great - Flawless. It takes forever to gain a high enough level to make flawless items so you can spend lots of time leveling up which adds highly to the game playability. There's also PVE servers for people who don't want to deal with PVP. Every server I've joined, the admins are great and active. If anything happens, they're generally happy to help regardless of the situation.Highly recommend this game over every other survival game available. Don't read anymore reviews. This game is in Alpha, and is very playable and has lots to offer in content, features, and enjoyment.			"

								I'm very conflicted about 7 days to die.* I love the world; the looting / scavenging / building / survival vs. zombies * I HATE ""horde night"". - every seven days a super horde tries to kill me. - a little planning and work all but removes the threat from ""horde night""- in the end it's just a leash that prevents me from exploring the world I'm hopping the FunPimps make ""horde night"" optional instead of forced content. I want the option of playing a nomadic survival lifestyle instead of a tower defense game. An option to have horde night happen randomly would be nice too.			"

								After having spent over a day total on 7DtD, I must say it is my favorite game as of now. It combines all of the best aspects of The Forest, Minecraft and DayZ with few bugs that are hardly noticable and it lets you take the game into your own hands. Build a massive corn field? Sure. Keep a cage full of living dead? Go for it you sicko! Build a giant statue of Shrek? I have 3 already! You can do what you want and more whenever you'd like, and it doesn't require internet, which is an important aspect for me because I live in a rural community and thats why I never really got into Rust. Overall I say it is completely worth the money10/10 would build shrek again			"

Early Access Review
								700+ hrs played when writing this review.  In a nutshell, Minecraft for adults.  However, unlike the Minecraft --- these Zombies are not a joke.   In fact, early on the game your best bet is just run.   Zombies are just mean --- and it is fantastic.   Raiding old building, building your own guns, riding mini / motor bikes --- it is a very rich world.    The multiplayer is fantastic as well.    My kids year love this game --- and my 65 year old retired Dad loves this game.   That REALLY says a lot to me.   My wife, kids, friends, and Dad all play together on a private server.  Rockets, exploding crossbow bolts, flaming arrows ---- you just have so much to pick from.And on top of all of that -- the building engine is one of the best I've seen.   Blocks have and strength --- you can't just build whatever you want (like Minecraft) --- you have to plan support beams, or your building will fall down around you.    Think can just ignore the Zombies while you hide on the roof?    Good luck with that --- I've had them beat the walls down --- and then the ceiling will fall in (you scream while it happens, then you run away and scream --- then you laugh).In single player mode, it is a slow creepy game (you are playing an episode of The Walking Dead).   In co-op mode you are basically a gang of zombie killing mad men.    It is my favorite game on Steam.    By far, head and shoulders one of the best co-op (play together) games I've ever played.   It is WELL worth the money.  I well like I owe the developers a personal 'thank you' card.   They really have something great here.  PS --- Madmole --- where the hell is my helicopter?			"

Early Access Review
								This is the only voxel game that I like outside of Minecraft, and I like this more than Dead Island and State of Decay, and those are the only ""pure"" zombie games I really enjoyed. I missed the Kickstarter, and have only started playing with the 7.9 Alpha patch. I have been watching the game on Steam since it made Early Access in December. I bought it when I caught it on sale for $20.First let me say what it is that I do NOT like about the game, so that any notion of fanboy-ism can be dismissed:1) Getting others into you game can be tricky. Hosting a game isn't an issue, rather, the problems arise when friends try to even FIND my game on the server. Regardless of physical distance or ping, even friends that have my game favorited cannot always find my game and connect. While in game, some friends do not receive invites to Steam Chat, but can when they exit. I don't know if the issues are related, but they happen at the same time.2) Sometimes, when the server load is high (and at random), my computer will freeze while hosting, usually just after friends join. I have to do a hard reboot, and when I load my game, any alterations to the environment and containers are saved, but my inventory is reverted to the state it was in at the end of my previous session. Moving precious tungsten from chest to my inventory and having it lost to a freeze is very annoying.3) Zombies are a little too aware at times. If I can't see what is atop my tower, how can they? As for being sensed, I don't carry food with a smell radius, and the sound radius created by various actions isn't large enough to carry through my walls AND over the trench, but zombies hear/smell me. AI pathing needs work. Nightly hordes will run through my base and stand on the corner of my wall and do nothing. A freshly spawned zombie can sense me, causing it to arbitrarily attack the hardest section (and most costly to replace), instead of running into the opening a few blocks away and into my sledgehammer.  Spawning is poor. When just loading into the game, zombies tend to spawn way too close, which means they are in my base. This isn't an issue when first starting the game (as you are in the open, unprotected), but hunting the crawler zombie that keeps clipping into my walls for the first 15 minutes of a session gets old. Zombies sometimes spawn stuck in blocks. I then have to dig them out to kill them so that they don't alert and attract other zombies.4) Lighting doesn't always have the intended effect. I can see better when I am near, but torches do not always stay lit when far from players. I can still see them, as they are rendered (my base isn't THAT large), but without the light being ""on"", zombies have no problems spawning at night right in my base. I have had issues where zombies IN the light when it IS on will still behave like they are in the dark. This means that the one or two zombies that managed to get in my base (or more likely spawned there) will still be a large threat inside, even when the sun has come up.5) Gathering materials can be a pain. Killing zombies and having them fall into grass often means you have to destroy the grass, or walk around it, to loot the zombie - same goes for picking up items near grass. Corpses de-spawn too quick. I appreciate the game cleaning itself up, but I don't like missing the opportunity to loot every corpse (part of the game IS scavenging). A horde of ten zombies often results in half the bodies de-spawning before I can kill them all. Sometimes, the body will even disappear while I have the loot screen up. When mining or digging, if you are not quick to grab all the voxels, they can be gone before you realize it. To add to that frustration, anything on the ground (not placed) have collision. This means that when you hold the key to pick up all the dirt or wood you just worked for, it has to travel to the player with each unit bumping into itself and the environment. When breaking down anything, you have to work from the top down, or risk everything crumbling under gravity from removing the support (think sand in Minecraft). Though this may mean getting materials quicker (chopping a tree down at the base), the falling blocks can destroy themselves and de-spawn, often hurting the player in the process. I don't mind getting hurt, but I shouldn't lose all my materials because of one misstep. Some blocks, crafted or found, drop nothing upon being broken. This is really frustrating for items made out of metal. A tungsten door or iron bars broken by zombies (or needing to be moved by a player) will leave not even a piece of scrap, much less the some of its whole. It is too easy to accidentally throw something out of the inventory. Placing something on the grid instead of in a slot means the item is now on the ground, and might de-spawn before you realize it.6) Crafting can be ambiguous and cause a lot of wasted effort. Example, a crossbow: you need sticks and plant fiber. With these materials in the required amount, the recipe shows up in the list in white. When clicked, the 5x5 grid will highlight the squares that you are supposed to place these materials in. But the game does not say how MANY of each item is needed, nor WHERE they go in the grid. Once you make the crossbow, the recipe then turns green in the list, and when you click on it, it automatically places the items in the grid. You can even queue up multiple to made (you don't have to leave the crafting menu open for it to finish). This does make it easier than the initial attempt, but what if you completely forget what a crossbow is made of, or are one stick short? Then the recipe will not be in the list at all. You cannot preview item stats before creation: how am I supposed to know that a rusty iron door is better than a scrap metal door?Now, let me say what it is that I LIKE so much about this game that I have convinced several friends to buy it:1) The construction is amazing. There are several materials, each with varying degrees of durability, structural integrity, and acquisition difficulty. Anything that can be placed can be rotated. Turn a ramp piece upside down for the lip of a wall (to stop those pesky spider zombies). Turn wooden planks vertical into a fence. Lay a ladder horizontally to make a walkway. The construction lends to creativity. How a block looks and where it will line up can be seen in a transparent overlay before you place it.2) The game looks good for its current development. I don't need 4K textures, but for a voxel game in Alpha, I am impressed. Some textures repeat more than others, but in most cases you would have to make a 2x2 section of blocks before the texture completely repeats.3) Zombies are a THREAT. Even in the day when they are slow, letting one get close can result in not only health loss, but infection and bleed-out. At night they have increased spawns, run, and do more damage. Zombies vary visually and have different behaviors, loot, stats, and sounds.4) There are a LOT of settings to choose from each time a game is created or continued. There is a cheat option for the lazy or new player, but it can be used to test weapons and materials, or to gain back anything lost in error or glitch. Multiplayer supports up to 16 players. The standard game is survival, but players can choose horde or deathmatch for shorter sessions.5) Heatlh, fullness, hydration, and stamina all make sense. Decreased stamina means decreased effectiveness in work and combat. Lower fullness/hydration means less stamina.6) Weapons/tools degrade and do less damage to entities and blocks. They can be repaired, or more can be crafted (ammo too) or found. Blocks can be repaired and reinforced with siding.7) Farming, hunting, and scavenging are all viable, and sustainable, gameplay options. Players can settle or be nomadic.8) The updates are regular.TL;DR This is the zombie game I have always wanted: buy it.			"

Early Access Review
								Although I've seen a fair amount of people downvoting this game, altogether I disagree. Admittedly yes, there are some bugs in this game, but fortunately most people seem to accept that the reason for these is the fact the game is still in Alpha. However most of the complaints on this game I have personally found to be inaccurate, and therefore should not be considered fact by those wishing to purchase the game. The price is a bit steep, but if you enjoy this type of game then I'm sure you will have as much fun as I am.People say coop isn't working and that they're paying close to $60 to play this game with friends, only to be left alone in a server with error mesages. At first I was also unable to play with friends without going to a public server, but a quick 2-minute YouTube video showed me a very simple way to connect.They also say the game is laggy, to the point it's unplayable. To be fair, yes I have experienced lag at times that was frustrating. But 100% of the time? Not even close. I'm playing on what isn't even a gaming laptop that's a few years old, hosting a server, and things are fine.Some say that the gameplay is uneven, which I also believed during my first few playthroughs. But that's because I didn't understand exactly how to play this game, and approached it like other survivals: with the mind frame that I am invincible. That isn't the case at all in this game. You are incredibly vulnerable and will need to put a lot of work into ensuring you can simply survive, let alone more sophistcated things. If you prefer a game where you run around at night killing hundreds of zombies, I don't recommend this game. But if you like knowing that your choices truly have consequences, I completely recommend it. The gameplay isn't uneven at all if you treat the game the way it's meant to be treated (or at least how I believe it should).Overused textures? Perhaps, but they don't bug me. If I'm stranded in the middle of the desert, I want to feel like it, which is something the developers nailed. But I've found other environments such as the forests to be quite interesting. The fact that there is currently one map that is not randomly generated understandably bothers people, so all I can say is the fact that this remains in Alpha needs to be remembered here. Though this review is for the current game it targets those looking to purchase this game, who need to remember that it will be updated to contain more/improved features.Overall, I loved this game, but it does have flaws. Most of the flaws are fixable even on your own to create an intricate and enjoyable experience, but others remain to be fixed by the developers. I eagerly look forward to further updates and content for this game and would recommend it to those with interest and experience in games focussing on survival, not superiority.			"

Early Access Review
								So I've had 7DtD since they first dropped it for early access. I played it a bunch, even when it was still VERY rough-cut. And rough-cut it was. But I still had plenty of fun with it, and was especially impressed with the building physics and support mechanics that force you to build something structurally sound. The drawback, however, is that it used to be a bit of a grind and the grind overwhelmed me a bit, so I took a very long break from playing (more than a year) to wait for some updates. I just came back last week and was not disappointed.They overhauled the crafting system, added a leveling system complete with tiered perks and skills that train as you use them. Combat is a LOT more fun now that they added a ton of animations to the zombies' movements and attacks. They changed the way materials gather from sources so that the game is MUCH LESS of a grind. Survival, especially in the beginning of the game, is still pretty brutal and unforgiving unless you have good luck. The challenge is definitely still there.If you like zombie survival games, give this one a chance, and ***♥♥♥♥ING BE PATIENT***. It beats the hell out of all the others.I was worried for a while, because updates have been a bit slow to come out, but I'm just glad to see that these guys aren't RUSHING production like so many others. And when they drop an update it's a fatty. I still have hope! This is the best zombie survival game on the market already, ifinitely better than DayZ, infinitely better than H1Z1...and it's only in alpha. Dig it.			"

								7 days to die, October 17, 77 hours played, will continue playing today at 17:00Its really hard and scary in the beginning. All those growls, whispers in the wind and many other sounds that you hear the whole time. But you somehow get used to it and start to ignore them as the days go by.Started alone in Navezgane on medium level. Was like a real hell. Died 7 times a day. I was really thinking about quitting this game.Then started to play with a mate. You gotta learn from your mistakes and find ways to overcome obstacles - thats probably the best part of the game. Switched to harder level in about 7 real life days and after another 7 days we realized we need even more challenge. Dieing once in 7 days is no fun at all while sitting on tons of supplies...Now playing on random generated map, 70 zombies and all furious and running the whole time, hordes unlimited (0 setting). Thats when you get the real taste of it! Just like a first day in game - you can only survive for more than 3 hours on hills or in desert (thats where they cannot catch you if you use the setting that they are always running).We managed to build a little tower on 3rd day and it was almost destroyed the same night.No food except cactus and blueberries,.. Few bottles for tea... Have not found any metal tool yet... Scared to think about visiting a town or green zone...Man, only now i come close to understand what zombie survival genre actually means :)			"

Early Access Review
								EDITED for A14.7Easily the best zombie survival game on steam, and probably the most promising alpha I've ever seen. I often watch youtube videos before purchasing a game, and this review has been written with past experience of all the games I've mentioned, with DayZ, Rust and H1Z1 being played on friends' accounts. It's a blast with friends, but the main reason I recommend this game is because it has some things which are almost unheard of in the zombie survival genre:1) Zombies. No, not the glitchy, ethereal zombies in DayZ, or the ones they just simply couldn't be bothered with in Rust, because Zombies in 7 days obey the laws of physics, and are everywhere, and the regular hordes (completely unheard of in almost every other survival game), as well as variation in zombies keeps combat fresh. We already have vomiting police officer zombies, ""feral"" boss zombies take horrendous punishment, undead dogs (which are extremely dangerous if not properly handled), bears (and undead versions) and mutant hornets.  The zombies in 7 days are threats, and, for a long while at least, not a manageable one. By default, they run at night, gaining speed and finesse, turning an already- formidable foe into a nightmare. I won't say much more, but it is called ""7 Days to Die"" for a reason...2) It's actually a challenge to survive. This isn't like in H1Z1 where you can live forever off of blueberries until a bear mauls you to death, or in Rust, where starvation feels practically nonexistant. The scavenging itself is rewarding, but food is low in quantity and far- spread. However, once you survive long enough to have a fortress going, you have time and opportuinty to hunt or farm, where the goals in the game radically shift from getting by on cans to actively improving your wellness, which takes me to the next point:3) Unique mechanics- Be it the wellness system (eating good food and staying healthy increases physical fitness), weapon quality, the fact that you can get infected and become desperate for a cure, building a base or even simply that zombies run at night, 7 Days has many things that similar games in the genre have merely scraped the surface of, if they've even bothered at all. It's a true game hidden amongst several cash grabs. Something I will note though- the devs are currently experimenting with temperature based survival and hordes, and both are fairly broken atm. Still, they're making progress, have no intention of giving up and listen to the community. Besides, that's what early access is for, right?4) Singleplayer- This one is probably coming off as a surprise to you right as I read it, but I think it's worth a mention. Singleplayer is a feature that most similar games lack, and that's a really crucial feature for those who want a decent survival game without the constant PvP like in DayZ or H1Z1. It's obviously not initially intended for single player, considering that there's still chat, but it still works, and works wonders.5) Base building- This isn't like in Unturned or H1Z1 where it is seemingly bolted on as an afterthought. Base building in 7 Days is important (not essential- you can still get by by moving from place to place) for survival in the new world. There are many items easily lootable that serve no practical purpose, but are instead simply decorations to further the impression that base building is a core feature of this game.6) The devs and community- The Fun Pimps listen to the community, and the community itself is very helpful and supportive. The (incredibly) steep learning curve is quickly offset by the community, who tirelessly answer all questions the noobs may have. Plus, there are NPC bandits and traders in the works, and that's awesome.7) ANYONE can mod it- The Fun Pimps have deliberately designed the XML files for the game to be easily moddable. I'd check out Valmod once you consider yourself truly hardcore- it makes the game way harder. Alternatively, you could do what I did, and mod more recipes and guns into a private game with friends to get a more walking- dead style vibe. If you get confused, again, the forum section on modding is amazing at helping you with whatever problems you might have.The game itself has regularly been referred to as a mashup of Minecraft and DayZ, but I disagree. From the perspective of a buyer, this may look the case, but it isn't. It's a completely different animal, far greater than the sum of its parts. I will not lie to you, there are more than a few balance issues, bugs galore after every major patch and big patches take a while, but I believe that it's all worth it in the end, because there's no other survival game to my knowledge that doesn't act like that Goat Sim parody DLC, while also having hardworking devs who are willing to put more than ten minutes into the game.If you're still skeptical, get it on sale. I mean it- 2 hours is nowhere near enough time to judge this game properly. There is just so much here that you won't find within two hours.Recommended as a 7.5/10- the learning curve is steep, and there are balance issues- and the devs are hardly experts at meeting their deadlines, but that's what Alpha was meant to be about. If you're the type of gamer who wants survival, building, a true zombies game or an amalgamation of the three, then this is the game for you, and you won't regret buying it.PS: If Dogs end up killing you a lot, ask politely on the forums for help. Us forum folk are tired of seeing ""F***ING NERF THE DOGS OP AS **** YOU GUYS ARE MORONS"" threads when they try to punch them or something else stupid. There are tactics to beat them, and a lot of them. The forum guys who are better at surviving than me could probably point you in the right direction.			"

								I don't think it's fair to compare 7dtd to other survival zombie games. The other ones just lose to it so bad...There are pvp servers but the community, and devs, seem more focused on pve. Yes dealing with other players can be stressful but in 7 days the zombies and environment are the real threat. At night the zombies all do cocain and bathsalts, going from shambling little sneaks to full on oh god why mode. You are not zombie apocalypse rambo. You are a meat sack that got the idea in its head that a little stone on the end of a stick might be effective against something that doesn't feel pain. Situational awareness is key as you will often be snuck up on during the day. Tired from cutting wood? Perfect time for a zombie to silently shamble out of the tall grass behind you and use the loud crash of the tree falling to essentially grapple you and begin mauling your face off.Towns offer their own unique challanges. Tougher and more frequent enemy spawns make looting difficult early on. You will spend hours slinking around trying to make as little noise as possible while going building to building praying for that one thing to make the trip worth it. And then you realize the sun is setting... The house you are in is a one story home in the middle of town... Time for a good ol garage night cry. You sit in the dark, unmoving, hoping the zombie outside will just go away. It's scratching at the walls aimlessly. You hear more footsteps. Stay away from the windows, do not open any noisy containers. That juicy locker in the corner probably has something nice for you but its going to groan and clang when you open and rumage through it. A long moan has your attention on the window again as a shadow moves across the broken frame.And then it happens. You haven't been keeping track of your own needs and hunger pangs cause you to grumble and moan. The god awful scream just outside the garage send you into a panic and them into a frenzy. Your hiding spot is beset by the undead, riping at the siding and pounding down the door. The flimsy walls begin to split, arms flail wildly through the openings grasping at anything in reach. You haven't moved from the corner. It's time to make a judgement call. Do you bolt into the house, knowing that they will see you and begin sprinting around the house trying to find a way in? Staying in there might work. The house could hold up until day when they slow down and you can escape. Making a break for it may work to. Or do you just not move and pray they lose interest before they fully breach the wall?Panic wins and the cold night air kisses your skin as you burst out the front door. They're on you though, but very slowly falling behind. Your stamina only lasts so long... They finally lose interest in chasing you as you dodge and weave through side streets. But you're tired now, and still very hungry. The run wasnt enough to warm you up and snow begins to fall. You finally stagger to a stop, practially stumbling around the corner of a house as the area is slowly blanketed in white. A low dark shape pops against the white before you. It begins to snarl. The zombie dog is faster than you, and you're so very tired...This is the only zombie survival game where the environment and undead, actually surviving, feels fantastic. Early to mid game is stressful and you will be startled from time to time by unexpected events. As you progress into zombie rambo, you still need to worry about basic survival. You may be able to wade through a horde of shamblers with your shotty and heavy armor, but at night you will only ever feel safe behind your fortress walls. And then the red moon rises... Good luck.Fantastic devs. Frequent updates and progress videos. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFrUPm0uNQgiPRos3TYOpEA/videosI have only experienced a few frustraiting bugs. Mini bikes falling out of the map when you dismount,  which is frustraiting after storing loot on them... And the very rare physics bug that has you catapult into the air and break your legs for no reason. Very rare as I have only had it once in 138 hours of play. I have lost 2 or 3 minibikes though.Decent sound, ok graphics, great mechanics. This game was made to be played with friends. Single player is fun to, but in a more stressful way if you like that kind of fun.Remembering that it is still an alpha, though imo a very complete feeling alpha, 8/10The game does get a little boring after so many hours. It's one of those play it for 30 hours then come back in 2 weeks and enjoy some new features for another 30 hours type of games. Starting fresh every time keeps it fun unless you just love building, and the building system is very nice...Although I'm hoping console release doesn't slow down development as it feels like it is starting to... Time will tell.			"

								Last night a friend and I were making our way through a bombed out city. It was getting dark and we came across a building that was mostly intact, All the other buildings were missing large chunks and were falling apart. we decided to enter the building (which appeared to be a large apartment high rise) and seek shelter for the night. We had to break boards off the front door to get in. Did this mean the building was sealed from before the outbreak...and therefore safe? (shrug) We settled in an apartment on a lower floor as it got dark, You don't wanna be outside at night, At night...they can RUN, FAST. A horde is scary enough during the day, 20 zombies or so shambling along...maybe trying to catch up to you. But...at night a horde is terrifying. A screeching, sprinting mob racing through the dark. The dead don't get tired...but you do.  Finding lots of supplies in the cupboards and what not. We didn't realize that all the noise we were making...as night fell...was disturbing the tenants of the building. Of course the entire building was inhabited by zombies...all locked in their apts ever since it all started. They must have been dormant until we disturbed them. The screams and bangs and crashes from all around us got louder as the darkness became absolute. You could hear walls, and doors and even the ceiling starting to give way. We had a long wait for dawn. We couldn't stand the pitch darkness anymore, it made the cacophony that much worse. In the server I set up...The darkness of night lasts a full half hour or so and that's how long we sat there in the near pitch blackness listening to the zombies tear the building apart around us. We couldn't make a run for it because all the noise that our neighbors were making was attracting other nearby hordes on the outside of the building. As dawn broke...so was the rear wall of our unit....they were getting in... fun game! (I didn't even mention the zombie dobermans.)			"

								(Updated for A13.6)7 Days To Die (7DTD) is not a truly ""unique"" game, but that is, in fact, one of the greatest things about the game. It blends the best parts of many games (the building from Minecraft, the open-world aspect of Skyrim, the terrifying zombies of... etc) and makes them its own. For instance, while Minecraft building uses grids and is unrealistic, 7 Days To Die takes that, adds gravity and dynamic changes while retaining all the fun.One of the first things you will notice about 7DTD is that the graphics are surprisingly high definition. Granted it takes a pretty intense system to utilize higher graphical settings, for a ~$20 game that often goes on sale, the graphics are superb. Even on the lowest settings the game looks incredibly realistic.Then come the zombies. Depending on your settings, these guys go from terrifying to downright unstoppable. You think you're safe behind your walls? Not when they rapidly bash their way through. You think they won't come for you as long as you stay quiet? Not when the feral horde comes seeking your blood. The zombies are made to punish the unprepared survivor and they do it extremely well. Of course, there is not just a single static zombie type. You have police officer zombies that launch projectile attacks, zombie dogs that will viciously run you down, zombie hornets that are just plain annoying, and zombie bears - yes, you did read that correctly, zombie bears.7DTD is challenging for the new survivor, it is made to punish the player during the early game. You are affected by the temperature (you can actually freeze to death), you require sating of both hunger and thirst, and there are more things that can kill you that you can possibly count (including falling trees). Yet, as you get further into the game and explore further into the world, there is a sense of reward and accomplishment that accompanies the hard earned experience. You begin to harvest raw materials faster, craft stronger tools and weapons, build more fortified bases, etc. Eventually, it is no longer you who needs to run from the zombies, but the zombies who need to run from you.My two favorite aspects of 7DTD blend nicely together: crafting and building. I have not seen a (similar) game that has as extensive a selection of craftable items as this one. There are tons of items to craft and then use to build into castles, homes, crazy-spiky fortresses, or whatever you wish really. In a game where everything is destructible, you are also capable of building anything your heart desires. What you make depends on what strikes your fancy. If you want to create something grand, build an epic castle. If you want to create something that will withstand a sea of zombies, then layer spikes and walls and, of course, ever more spikes.While all of these features are great in singleplayer (honestly, you can play hundreds of hours in singleplayer without getting bored), the ultimate fun in this game comes from playing with others. Get a group of friends and play on insanely hard settings while trying to survive from heat-seeking, running zombies. If you don't have any friends (amumu...), you can still go on multiplayer servers to join up with or against other players!In conclusion, 7DTD is simply a lot of fun. You get out of it whatever you want. You can be a survivor, you can be an architect,and heck - you can even try and be a pacifist (VERY hard). Whether you choose to play alone, play with strangers, or play with friends, you'll find yourself losing countless hours in senseless fun. I highly recommend buying 7 Days To Die - it's worth every cent.			"

			Views: 338		

			Base built in survival mode, our first real home within the game. About 76 hours of play on this map. This base can survive a hoard of zombies on VERY HIGH settings without us firing off a shot.		

The above is my base video (amateur but lots of work !)Well, what Can I say...this game is dominating my life.....When I first began to play, I wasnt sure. I have a monster rig, play in 4k. The graphics are maybe a couple of years behind. I had to turn my mouse down in sensitivty......worrying start.....Crafting, oh dear...is this a game where its impossible to move forward without searching for hours and hours......i get bored....Well, I should not have worried.I have not experienced such a tense and great atmosphere since STALKER.For me, the balance is just right, each 7th night, a bigger and bigger horde come....that wait for the red sky is awesome.You spend a good amount of time making your home (and it does become your home, not just a base !)....and learn how to do things better and better....This is a fantastic game, sense of achievment at getting your first cement mixer, forge, etc. etc....just great.Took me about 14 days to realise I could disasemble things with my wrench....this was a game changer....suddenly I was getting engines from cars and able to get forges from abandonded houses etc.....I didnt realise I could do this !When I am mining, collecting wood etc, you are constantly on edge.....pausing to look around, making sure you are not being stalked. Not all zombies are LOUD, so this game does provide genuine JUMP scares.I play on a ""private"" self made game with my daughter and have had no connection problems (granted its a LAN), but we meet up, work together and fight the horde having a great time.Really dont hesistate to get this game, its superb. If the first Hour of play - you are feeling unsure.....stick it out. You become good...but the game keeps pushing you.The first zombie I encountered was a Frozen Lumberjack and I just felt the zombies were bullet proof......dont worry...as you get better and craft weapons....it all changes.....Good Luck ! Do yourself a favour and get the game....I find myself working out amendments to my base whilst at work....sometimes in the board room ---- which I think is funny, but a testament to how this game GRABS you.Enjoy !

								LISTEN... SERIOUSLY!I could not love this game more if it were a human baby! For over a year 7 DAYS TO DIE has brought me and my family (all 5 of us) SO MUCH happiness and joy! We have laughed our asses off and screamed in terror... for hundreds of hours and many more to come! It is absolutely amazing to watch it expand, and I'm happy to drudge through the growing pains as it creeps up toward perfection. 7 DAYS TO DIE is a game that I (and many others) have always wanted. My only regret, as a novelist and gamer, is that I cannot personally be part of it's development. However, I will happily play from the sidelines and keep laughing and screaming with my wife and kids while we narrowly survive the ever expanding zombie apocalypse!!! :DSIMPLY BADASS... PLEASE KEEP IT UP FUN PIMPS!!!  ;)			"

								TL;DR: Don't. (Yet?)This might be less of a review and more of a message to the Fun Pimps. Can't put it on the forums because it will get deleted.I rarely have such conflicting emotions about a game, especially since Alpha 13. I didn't follow the whole kickstarter thing but bought the game a year ago on a boring night without any prior research and quickly dismissed it for its mediocre performance despite the very crusty graphics.After several attempts of playing it, the vast options of a sandbox finally hooked me and allowed me to half-heartedly overlook the - at times - very annoying bugs. I usually play alone or semi-alone with an emphasis on exploration/large scale underground building and don't really bother with coop play or PvP.While I was racking up hours and hours of gameplay, my occupation as a software engineer got in the way of my passion for gaming the first time in my life. I really wanted to like the game and grinded through it 8 hours at a time just out of spite, but jesus tap dancing christ, this thing is riddled with bugs and game breaking inconsistencies.I could make a huge list of all the bugs and weird things happening, but it pretty much all boils down to two things: A severe lack of experience and no mentionable quality control. Now, don't give me that ""But it's an alpha!"" crap. If you build something, anything, you start with a good foundation and then gradually add stuff. With 7DTD it seems like there's a very messy but somehow working foundation that noone really wants to (or has the ability to) fix, and instead of hiring someone to do it, every patch appears to be a string of quick wins and cosmetic changes that are hit or miss at best and completely pointless at worst. At times, it seems like the Fun Pimps are done doing actual progress and alternate between doing ""most flashy thing for the least amount of work"" (pre-patch) and ""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥we need to put out fires left and right"" (post-patch). I mean, just look at some of the ""improvements"" of A13:* UI was completely broken and a massive exploit-fest. Now it's completely broken and a massive exploit-fest with a new flat look.* The game couldn't handle decent amount of zombies; the animations, spawning mechanisms and attack patterns were totally off. Nothing changed about that, but now we have new motion captured zombies that have weirdly skewed models depending on the viewing angles, have non-existing keyframes and move like an epileptic Michael Jackson dance movie in anything above 60 FPS. Oh, and zombie dogs are broken. Again.* A lot of the harvestable resources are suddenly gone. No more sticks, branches, different meats, all the stuff that brought some variety was taken out. Why? Just so you can inflate the patch notes?* The grunting, screaming and huffing and puffing of the alter ego is now voiced by professional voice actors. I can now hear myself moaning of hunger in crystal clear quality while trying to use the broken camp fire that mysteriously eats fuel and never finishes crafting my damn meat. That's right, meat. A bear now has the exact same kind of meat as a rabbit.* Performance is _abysmal_. ""But it's an un-optimized alpha!"" You know the first rule of optimization? - Don't. You can't build a complete dog turd and then flip a switch on release date and suddenly it runs like hell. It's not gonna happen. Start with a good foundation and then add stuff. Yes, i'm repeating myself.Multiplayer is another huge disappointment. Don't even get me started with multiplayer. It's an integral part of the game (despite the Pimps backing off again cause they are not able to fix the related code), yet it's the most broken one. The netcode is horrible and the dedicated server is a hot mess that WILL bring your hardware to its knees. Memory leaks gallore, 32/64 bit Linux versions randomly (don't) work depending on the patch level and administration is XML with a bunch of strings and a ♥♥♥♥ing TELNET interface.I mean, props for providing a Linux server (and client!), but if it's going to randomly break because noone is testing it, why even ship it?Oh, if you want to have a laugh, check out the website. ""a small dedicated group of highly experienced Game and Software developers"" and ""The average 7 Days to Die Team member has over 14 years of experience in Game and Software Development working with or for many top companies."" Yeah, right. I bet that's the reason why you're using ♥♥♥♥ing Unity and can't update a label without a bunch of null pointer exceptions and out of range indices.The communication is very professional, too. If you have to introduce forum policies that explicitely forbid talking about release dates or criticizing anything about the game it's HIGH ♥♥♥♥ING TIME to think about how you're communicating with customers. If you can't be arsed to do it yourself (and i can highly sympathize with that!), hire someone to do it. And I'm not talking about giving some fanboy moderator rights on the forums and letting him wreak havoc.God damn.Now, don't get me wrong. Despite the massive bashing, I kinda sorta like this game. I'd never pile up >300 hours of gameplay and write a long review about a game that i hate. Sometimes the only thing that'll help is some good old tough love. I fear that if nothing changes, the game has already reached its zenith and will crash and burn. So please, use the money we gave you. Hire some real software developers. Make the software as good and enjoyable as the gameplay you have created. I'd revise my review in a heartbeat if there was any positive change.Please make it happen.			"

								Honestly, the best Alpha/Early Access game you can buy.It has the most content.It is (one of) the most playable.It has one of the most dedicated developers.It has a pretty sizeable and dedicated playerbase.In a nutshell, it's minecraft meets DayZ. That's probably the way you're sick of hearing it described as, but it's appropriate. It's a first person zombie survival game that you can play with/against other players online, with a fully fleshed out crafting system that allows you to make weapons and craft incredible buildings. Though this game has a more ""realistic"" way of building houses than Minecraft does. Houses actually look like houses, and they even have structual integrity, so if you build a house without much support, it will collapse.Walk on an old, decaying bridge? It will probably collapse.Try to build a single line of wood as a temporary bridge? It will fall down after about 3 or 4 blocks.Mining looks great. It looks like you are actually creating a cave, with smooth walls and dizzying geometry. However mining has had some issues over the course of development. It's been ""nerfed"", made too abundant, nerfed again, and sometimes even being made impossible. Be warned that mining in this game is a bit glitchy, however this shouldn't come as a surprise in an Early Access title. The game used to have a blocky asthetic, but the game has since had an update that makes the terrain smooth with rolling hills. It looks great, and it's not even done yet as the developers are working on random generation and on smoothing out the terrain even more.(SEE UPDATE AT BOTTOM ABOUT RANDOM GEN) Oh, I also need to mention, at the moment, there is only one map. It's a pretty decent size, but you'll see most of it within a couple playthroughs. Building your own structures, especially when playing in an online server, does change it up however.This game can be played in single player as well, or with a private server. That's another thing great about this game: Options.There's literally an option for just about anything. How durable blocks are and how long it takes to mine them.How many zombies spawn.How much damage the zombies do to you.How much damage you do to the zombies.How much loot spawns.How many players can join your server.PVP on or off.And many other options.This game can be just about any way you want it.Some people will point out that options have been both added, and removed, and sometimes options don't have much of an effect at all. Again, be warned, things are constantly being changed, including the amount of options and their effectiveness. There's a chance an option you really like having may be taken away, or accidentally broken. It's all a part of the process of making the game balanced and challenging, while also allowing you to create a personal experience.There are a few mods, and a few custom builds, but those are pretty few at least until the game becomes more complete. I'm sure once the development moves futher along, you'll see a lot more custom levels and mods being made and updated.Combat is bit floaty though. As it stands now, melee combat doesn't have that much impact, and guns need better sound. However, usually combat works. Guns shoot bullets into things, melee weapons bash things, but this can be temporarily broken during any update.Crafting is a major component of the game. You find resources, either through loot in the environment and buildings, or by getting your own from mining from rocks and trees. Crafting is done in a grid fashion, which will look a bit familiar, in that you can place certain components in a certain way to create something. However, it's not all guess work. It's usually outlined what you need and where, you just need to place it. It's a bit simplistic and easy this way, but it works.For now, 7 Days to Die is a fantastic experience. It still has bugs and optimization issues, such as mechanical bugs, sound issues, and sometimes even having parts of the game you really like being taken out or being made useless. It's part of the process, but overall it's the most complete of the Early Access titles that you can find on Steam, and continues to be updated pretty regularly.Update: Random Generation. This game NEEDED this. Like most things, it's not perfect, but it's a welcome edition. A random seed is generated depending on the name you give the world, and the results are impressive. You get rolling hills, random buildings and points of interest, large cliff sides, both deep and shallow areas of water (which also added the ability to finally ""swim"" underwater with neat effect), and a large central city to explore.The ability to randomly generate worlds now alone has potentially increased the replayablility of 7DaystoDie by countless hours. My first couple hours with random generation I just spent exploring around to find all the nice looking terrain.			"

								UPDATED 12/15/16: This game has been out for 3 years, has made millions of dollars, and is still just a sketchy early access title. This is one of those games that will eternally be in early access. The devs just sit on the money instead of hiring new talent to complete the game in a reasonable matter of time or an acceptable level of quality. Frankly, they lack the vision to move the project forward in any meaningful way. This is the kind of developer that thinks adding lens flares is polishing their title. In the Community Hub stats you may see claims that theres usually 10,000+ people playing at any given time - but if you look at the server browser you'll see maybe 10-20 people on ever. TEN TO TWENTY. Not Ten-Thousand. Just TEN. Got a top of the line pc? Maybe an i7-6700k with 32GB of DDR4 and an 8GB GTX 1080? Get ready to have your jaw dropped -- because the performance of this game just tanks randomly. I've seen Sega Saturn games with more consistent framerates than this. Do I recommend this broken, unpolished, steaming pile of goo after all these years? LOL.... no. If you want to play a game that will never relive its former glory or break new grounds, ""7 Days to Refund"" is for you.Original Review:Many features that were attractive about 7 Days to Die in alpha 11.6 have been removed in a12. Here is a list of common user complaints from the steam forums.-Hostile community moderation, posts containing negative opinions and bug reports on the game are being deleted by PR on both steam and the games official forums and users being unjustly banned.-Mouse moves to the top left hand corner of the screen on its own.-Characters are black and textureless until a worn item is equipped.-Overpopulation of powerful bear and dog enemies with no rhyme or reason to their locations.-Bows now doing nearly no damage.-Weather effects and environment textures change depending on which type of biome voxel you're standing on. Two people standing right next to eachother will see completely different worlds, one snowy and one desert depending on which they are standing on.-No randomly generated lakes or rivers, only small prefabricated ponds.-Even the prefab water ponds are too rare.-No more natural caves.-Getting hit by an enemy reduces your wellness (maximum health).-Removed item category colors from item icons in inventory.-Loot rarity is now limited by the xp level of the looter.-Physics are nice but perhaps introduced more lag for servers with many players.-Buildings spawn with voxels benethe the terrain, which cause these voxels to free-fall under physics and contribute to poor server-client performance.-Certain areas looked ""Stamped"" into the heightmap of the terrain with little or no blending showing a distinct circular feature on the map.-Many objects and environment textures have animated rain reflections playing constantly which make the whole game look ""slimey"".I made a post on the 7 Days to Die Steam Community Discussions boards with a simple list to outline some of the issues that were causing people to dislike this version (A12) of the game. The post was called ""Whats wrong with A12?"". Many users found the post helpful and we were creating some valid feedback for the developers. Shortly after making the post I was confronted by ""Red Eagle LXIX"", STEAM_0:1:5711787, a forum moderator who was getting very defensive and attacking users personally, calling me a ""Troll"" and a ""Whiner"". I tried to have a civil conversation with him and he banned me from the 7 days to die steam forum with no warning. The thread has also been deleted (for his own protection) as many other members of the community recognized that he was being abusive to the contributors of the thread and commented on it. Today I am banned until Jul 11th @ 1:20 pm, here is the last PERSONAL message that he sent to me;//""Your very first post broke the Steam discussion rules with insulting the game and the developers (on an issue they listed in the notes, and was listed as temporary in nature)""Standing on an environment voxel causes that players textures to adapt to the biome type of the voxel you are standing on. Standing on a single voxel of snow in the middle of the desert makes the whole desert appear to be a snow-covered tundra. Take one step and it all turns back to desert. This was probably a ""feature"" however it was poorly thought out and implemented.""Further you broke rules arguing with a moderator.As for your ""rights"" you should re-read your Steam Subscriber Agreement, Terms Of Use, Code Of Conduct, Discussion Rules, etc again as you have no ""right"" to free speech on a privately owned forum.""//As you can see, saying that a feature may have been ""poorly thought out"", was in this moderator's opinion grounds to ban me from the steam forums and call me a ""whiner"". According to Red Eagle LXIX you are not allowed to have a different opinion than his own or you will be banned. If that isn't abusing his powers then I don't know what is. I believe this moderator should lose his privileges.I've requested that steam support restore the thread to examine it's nature and that moderator ""Red Eagle LXIX"", STEAM_0:1:5711787 have his privileges revoked.The point of the post was to give people who previously enjoyed this game a place to discuss what they don't like about the current build so we can offer feedback to the developers in a place that was easy for steam users to find.Unfortunately this isn't the exact same list as the original post since it was deleted by the maverick moderator. I don't know how many other participants of the thread were also banned. The original thread was a simple checklist very similar to the one above.I have opened a ticket with steam support on this matter and have also left a copy of this on the fun pimps 7 days to die official website forum.When a number of other users and I brought this up on the official 7 days to die forum, my thread was deleted yet again and I was issued private warnings from another administrator named ""Fox"", STEAM_0:0:22519404.As to this day The Fun Pimps have been unapologetic about their moderators behaviour, although their efforts to silence complaints about their game are being overwhelmed by a largely dissatisfied player base.I do not recommend 7 Days to Die at this time.

								Take Minecraft. Like it? Good.Now take the Minecraft zombies and make them look more human. Add various creepy textures like blank eyes, fat, gore encrusted bellies, naked eviscerated corpses, and nurses in outfits suitable for a low-budget porn flick. They come at you in degrees varying from your college roomate after a bender to how your girlfriend looked after she found out you don't actually have a sister who lives with you. Interested yet?You get plunked down in the center of this with a bandage, a bottle of water, and a single torch. By the way, you aren't wearing any shoes, shirt, or pants (and for some reason, if you chose a female character, some oddly chosen underwear for an apocalypse). From this, you are meant to avoid numerous ways of death, including, but not limited to, starvation, dehydration, mauling, stabbing, dysentery, eaten by wild animals, crushed beneath rubble, falling from cliffs, and the always enjoyable slow death of z-virus infection. And that is just during the daytime. By the way, did I mention that when the sun goes down every zombie gets a steroid boost that turns them into beings that would make Olympic sprinters jealous? 7 Days to Die is unforgiving, time-consuming, rage-inducing, and will give you new reasons to fear sunset. You will spend hours upon hours searching for the next town and even more nights cowering in your makeshift structure while the world goes to hell right outside your door. Should you buy it? The better question is why haven't you bought it yet?			"

								This is a great survival game that has a smoothly connected world, the houses look realistic, tunnels in the ground actually look like tunnels, there's many things to craft, books to teach you more crafting recipes. There's hunger, stamina, thirst, and health. You can sprint, you  can cook food on fires if you have cooking pots or a grill. There's a fair amount of fire arms, and you can even craft the bullets for them. You can construct quite a fottress, barricade existing structures, repair damage on structures, upgrade parts of your structures to withstand more damage, grow food, hunt, and the longer you stay in one area, the stronger your scent gets in that area, increasing the chance of an invasion occuring, there's many types of zombies, most look standard, but there's a few special ones, and more are going to be added, not only can you eventually craft standard digging tools and cutting tools, you can find an Auger to dig faster, and a chainsaw to cut tree's down swiftly, multiplayer works fine too, the player sync seems to be perfect even if ping is around 100-150 levels. There are many clothing pieces you can find as you scavenge, head, chest, hands, legs, feet, and they have armor value against attacks, you can even use hides from animals you've hunted to make leather, and then leather armor with the proper knowledge. They recently added the random world generation, which i've been testing, it is done quite well, biomes seperated by rivers, if you look enough you'll find roads, and there's even generated structures to be found, you can also mine a tunnel down anywhere to find yourself some metal ores to make whatever tools, bullet casings, or bullet tips you need and coal, as well as nitrate, to make gunpowder. You can make torches, there's a few ways, and you can find flashlights, there isn't anything that can't be destroyed by you, or the zombies, everything has a different durability depending on what it is made of. The options for playing either on single player or multiplayer are fairy customizable, you can increase drop rates of all items, durability of all blocks, amount of zombies that spawn, how long days last, and how large of percentage of each day is night time, you can also decrease all of these options as well. I'd strongly recommend getting this game if you like a good survival, or action game with an extensive crafting system.			"

								Lili's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playWhen my friend first gifted me this game I thought right away.""I hate zombie games, So I probably play this for a few minuites and then find a way to tell my friend that I don't want to play anymore""I opened the game and honestly the first thing that hit me was wow, the graphics are amazing. Yes If you run them low then they are going to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking but the amount of effort put into the graphics alone was just great. I started to play for the first few minuites trying to find my friends doing all the starter quests figuring out how to avoide zombies. And they are ALOT of zombies, normally in most games during day and night time zombies are like meh for open sandbox worlds but they were so many everywhere. (i think my friend had the extra zombie option on) Honestly as a person who is super duper afraid of zombies I really enjoyed that there was alot more to this game then just zombies. Survival is huge in this game. ANYTHING can kill you. Ive died to pretty much everything and anything. My first death was to a tree falling on top of me, then when you break your leg I swear you would rather be dead then have to walk everywhere. You can bleed out, die of infection, die from falling, drowning, eating something thats bad for you, ofc zombies, zombie dogs, zombie bears, zombie zombies, plus the range of type of zombies is very intresting, you have ofc the basic zombies who dont do anything much other then try to kill you, then you have fereal zombies who can run fast even during the day time, then you have zombie spiders who can crawl up anywall and crawlers who can break your legs, zombie bees who create hordes and zombie screamers who look like the little girl from the ring who will scream a horde into exsistance. On top of that in the next patch they will be adding zombies who are like from attack on titan who will distroy bases. The game might be called 7 days to die but honestly i should be called, how many times can I die, because it never ends.Scratch that. That was a lie, you will die. No matter what, even if you beat the first 7 days and the 2nd 7 days, the rivers dry up, the animals die out, the trees dissapear, the zombies gets stronger every single day, the more you play the worse it gets after a while the food you stock up dissapears the water and drinks you secure drie up, the snow melts the earth becomes a scorched wasteland and then finally the zombies eat you and no matter how many times you respawn there will be nothing left to do because the earth is dead and you are dead inside and the zombies dont care. And its great its ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. 10/10 game. Theres a few diffrent ways you can play the game, 1. With the same type of map over and over again. 2. Random gen so you will never know what you get and 3. solo play with a smaller map size. On top of that you are able to control how long days and nights are and how many people you want in your server or how many you do not want in your server. The only downside to this game is that its pretty hard to run if your computer is ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Sorry for the weird review its my first one but i hope you enjoyed it.If your gonna play this game add me! I definetly want more friends to play with :D "

								GET THIS WHILE IT'S ON THIS $9.99 SALE!!I have owned this game since the ground was Minecraft cubes. I have a million (okay, that's hyperbole) other games and this is the one I always keep coming back to. I've watched as the land has smoothed out, a skill tree has been added, trees and zombies have been beautified,  and additional zombies have been added, among other things. The NPCs have been a very welcome addition.Pros (Build 15):Continual work from The Fun Pimps. I don't think any other alpha can boast this kind of attention from its creators.New NPCs.Certain levels of hilarity.You can make Lucille!The game runs beautifully on my $500 laptop that is overloaded with programs for college.Creative playBiome VarietySkill Improvement Increases Damage, Item Quality, Access to New Skills.Building materials respond to zombie damage in a logical manner.Physics are logical.Choice of randomly generated world or predetermined world.POIs everywhere to loot.Many challenging things to craft and improve.New quests to be accepted or not.Zombies aren't the only things to hunt.You're never truly safe.Combat requires technique and improves with practice.Cons (Build 15)You have to kill dogs (Yeah, it should be on doesthedogdie/gaming.com (I made the gaming part up...the website just exists for movies).Water slows you when walking through it and I think that swimming should be faster than walking.Temperature system is still wonky.Bears. I hate bears. Bears are sneaky jerks that don't fight fair.It's Thanksgiving break and I've been spending my time playing this rather than writing the papers I'm supposed to write. This game feeds my natural tendency toward procrastination.Verdict:If you don't like change, don't get this, or any other Alpha game.If you don't have patience, don't get this, or any other Alpha game.If you don't like challenging combat, don't get this game.If you like variety and seeing how a game grows over time, get this game.If you like the idea of going from a guy or gal in his or her underwear to a survival king or queen, get this game. If you like creating things that become better and better quality as time passes, get this game.If you're a college student, you probably shouldn't get this game unless you're made of self-control. *Exit, pursued by a bear*			"

								7 Days to Die has been one of the most immersive game experiences I've ever had. I discovered this game upon the recommendation of a friend and gave it a shot, sometime during alpha 9 or 10. We both spawned in the wasteland and spent panicked hours trying to avoid the undead while scavenging what we could. So great was our noobishness that we'd actually chow down on raw eggs and old sham sandwiches in a pinch just to regain our hunger, ignorant to the fact that we were slowly poisoning and killing ourselves as we struggled to stay ahead of the dead and cowered on rooftops at night, listening to the rushed footsteps of sprinting zombies as they tried to sniff us out, emboldened and strengthened by the lack of sunlight.I was a fool to think we were safe.After repeated breaking of legs and the development of bloody diarrhea, dysentery and an infecton, I actually ended up killing myself to purge myself of my ailments and settled with my friend near the banks of a river, ignorant to what would happen to us on the 7th night or the fact that I was sacrificing my wellness, growing frail and weak as my max health and stamina was reduced to a whopping 60. Day 7 rolled by with no incidents, giving us more time to stockpile on resources and think we were safe in our hastily designed log cabin towers, guarded by nothing but stick-based spikes and amateur trenches dug into the soft sands of southwestern Navezgane.Then Day 14 happened.My friend was outside when a massive day horde approached our homes, watching helplessly as I ended up getting trapped, and surrounded in our besieged base. The buzzing of hornets and the groans and vomiting zombified police officers turning an otherwise beautiful day into a horror show. She managed to sneak back in, but spent the entire time having a panic attack as the undead began to eat at the foundations of our towers like termites, destroying everything we had worked for. Glancing out of the windows on the top floor, our attempts to snipe at the numerous walkers proved futile as we resigned ourselves to a slow death and complete loss of everything we had worked for in our first fourteen days of play...Then we broke out the chainsaws.In a surge of blood and gore, we -barely- managed to carve our way out through the undead and ran out into the surrounding desert with no supplies but the clothes on our backs and few jars of water and canned food we always kept on our persons. We contemplated quitting and starting over, but decided to push on and rebuild. After many running battles, we managed to reclaim our ruined towers before the evening rolled by, and spent a few nights huddled in the relative safety of one of the interior rooms, and scavenge what little supplies that had survived the onslaught while filling the holes with what little materials we could cobble together.Then we found it...A small campsite, isolated and on the other side of a hill where our original ruined towers stood. For some reason, we decided to settle there, digging deep underground and building a series of bunker networks that we connected into one super-compound. With our supplies safe, we built connecting tunnels to a nearby town and heavily fortified one of the buildings there with every material we could find back then, sandstone, sand, stone, wood, scrap metal, you name it. We made a point to make our stand there every 7 days, retreating into our tunnels when the going got tough, which was pretty much every single day until day 35.After a long and terrible night...We managed to keep the Horde out, and surged out of our bunker during the day to meet them head on. After mopping up the remnants, we squared off against multiple waves before the undead fell silent, we had avenged our horrible defeat at day 14. To commemorate our victory, we built a giant tower with a sniper perch and elegant roof over our bunker, complete with beer coolers and chairs. We named it Isengard, surrounding our perimeter with layers and layers of (then-invulnerable) log cabin spikes and smashed the undead repeatedly from that day 35 onward. Gone were the days of our frailty as our wellness surged to 200, replacing old sham sandwiches with meat stew, blueberry pie and goldenrod tea. We even went back to our old base and refurbished it, combining our two towers into one giant platform where we housed giant, closed farm, connected to our main base through a series of tunnels. This lasted until a patch-induced server wipe ended our adventure, but we had learned valuable lessons. We were hardened.In short,10/10, would get bloody diarrhea and build Isengard again.			"

								Alpha 15 Review: 10/8/2016: [Revamped Review]I've owned this game since Alpha 8.7 and every update gets me pulled right back into this game no matter what it's that good imho. <-- That still holds true a year later :)Here's what I like about 7 Days To Die:1. Graphics seem to get better each alpha release.2. Gameplay is awesome I would know I have 450+ hours ingame.3. Joining servers is seamless.4. Ability to host your very own server if your into that.5. Performance is really good for me I now play on a 1440P with a GTX 970 and most settings are almost maxed out. [A15 does give you more FPS than A14 that's for sure]6. Zombies are harder than A14 but hey if they are too hard for you you can change the settings in SP mode in MP its up to the server owners.7. ALOT of new POI's were added and there is a trading out post where you can sell your items to a NPC and get tokens in return to use at the shop for other items. [When it becomes close to night the outpost kicks you out till the morning so you can't exploit the safe area the outpost provides]8. Farming is ALOT better now than older Alpha updates.9. There is also a skill tree you can put points in places you want to make life better in the long run.Here's what NEEDS to be improved:1. Faster updating---> Alpha 15 is out now so it's a bit faster updating cycle but the content drop was massive and well worth the wait.I will add to this or remove from this review as 7 Days To Die gets updated.Hopefully reading my review helps you decide on buying or not buying this game.

								#### UPDATED REVIEW - 29/01/17 ####A16 is nearly upon us and I thought I'd give a very quick update for those who've stumbled across my review. The development has been extrememly long but there are regular updates from Joel @ Funpimps - check out his blog. Many new editions and still more to come. The game is still heading in the right direction as far as I'm concerned and A15 introduced many new features like traders. The feel of the game has improved and the POI's on the supplied map feel much more genuine as does the terrain.There are more items being introduced in A16 which will enhance the game like snakes and an improved bear look.Overall I'm still loving this game, and will continue to play. I hope sometime this year it moves from Alpha though as the game in itself is substantial enough. While I won't be disappointed with additional content, it would be nice to see the end of the development for at least one of the early access games I've supported.If you like zombie survival games then this is very worthy of your time. It has a ton of building, various levels of difficulty and can at times be very tense.This is definitely going down as one of my all time favourite Zombie games.Thanks Funpimps :)#### UPDATED REVIEW - ORIGINAL REVIEW STILL BELOW ####Ok, so I've been playing this game for a long time now.. racked up nearly 1000 hours, and I'm still addicted as much as I was back in the very early alpha days.I'm a huge survival fan... horror is a bonus, but the idea of being alone (with or without friends) on a barren wasteland looking for food and supplies to survive really appeals to me. I've tried most of the genre out there but nothing else has a hold on me quite like this one.I like to play aesthetically pleasing games, and while I have no unrealistic expectations when it comes to how a game looks or feels, this game delivers for me on all fronts. So what's different about this game? Well it's covering a lot of ground, from finding food, to staying safe, building, farming and a whole host of other stuff to learn and explore. They've now included recipies so you have to work hard for those much cherished items, and there are quality levels in all that you make/find. Your character also has a long steady climb of experience before you're able to make nice looking items, so scavanging is always rewarding. The game offers both melee and range fighting which really appeals to me.. theres a time for stabbing zombies in the head, and a time to just blow them away!They have also included a whole heap of options for any single/multiplayer setup, like the length of each day, the amount of zombies that spawn and how hard they hit etc. The list is pleasantly structured increasing the chance to find a playstyle setting that works for you. You can even increase/decrease loot settings making things much harder to find and some things are really hard to find... useful tools and weapons that once found you guardThe games mood shifts at night on default settings and the zombies pick up pace, running rather than walking, but if this is too much for you, you can disable this too.. in fact, you can turn them off altogether, and this ends up being an enjoyable construction game with a few wild animals to keep you on your toes.I could go on and on to list everything I like about this game, and while it's still in alpha I'm loving every minute of it. Sure there are some bugs and glitches and it's been in alpha longer than I care to remember, but overall this is definitely an alpha I'm enjoying and I cannot recommend it enough to any survival fans out there. So in summary, If you like survival zombie games with a focus on building resources, weapons and bases, then I really would recommend you give this one a try. The updates are regular enough for me and give a strong sense of acheivement in each one as they bring more rewards into the game. I will definitely be sinking many more hours into this game, and it has now become my most played game of all time - fast approaching 1000 hours!Great work deserves great support and I thank the people at Fun Pimps for sinking much of their time into this great adventure.. I highly recommend you buy this today!###### END OF UPDATED REVIEW - THANKS FOR READING ########I thought I'd take a bit of time to review this game since it's occupied nearly 300 hours of my life!I'm a huge survival fan... horror is a bonus, but the idea of being alone (with or without friends) on a barren wasteland looking for food and supplies to survive really appeals to me. I've tried a few of the genre out there but nothing else has a hold on me quite like this one.I like to play aesthetically pleasing games, and while I have no unrealistic expectations when it comes to how a game looks or feels, this game delivers for me on all fronts. I've never played minecraft for example for the simplistic look it holds... missing out? expect so.. but nevertheless, its part of what I need to feel immersed.So what's different about this game? Well it's covering a lot of ground, from finding food, to staying safe, building, farming and a whole host of other stuff to learn and explore. It has melee and projectile weapons which really appeals to me.. theres a time for stabbing zombies in the head, and a time to just blow them away!I like the fact some things are really hard to find... useful tools and weapons that once found you guard and protect and that the mood of the game shifts significantly during the night phase.I could go on and on to list everything I like about this game, and while it's still in alpha I'm loving every minute of it. Sure there are some bugs and glitches, but overall this is definitely an alpha I'm enjoying.If you like survival zombie games with a focus on building resources, weapons and bases, then I really would recommend you give this one a try. The updates are regular enough for me and a strong sense of acheivement in each one as they bring more rewards into the game. I will definitely be sinking as much time into this as I did with Skyrim (800+ hours so far).Great work deserves great support.. I highly recommend you buy this today!			"

I keep buying other survival games, but I barely play them and then I am back to 7DTD. Amazing game. The tension felt while you are trying to explore or build is palpable. Even my wife loves playing this game with me. She has turned into quite the zombie killer, and dammit she is a better shot than me. Whimper.			"

								Let me start this review by stating that I have purchased into alot of early access games. By alot I mean at least 50+ games in early access state. One of the common tennants that I have noticed in these games from small developers is that they bite off way more than they can chew and fail to deliver communication on how thier studio is effectively tackling the challenges presented by thier intial overly ambitious goals. This studio is not one of those studios, this game is not one of those games. I have supported this game since it's kickstarter campaign and I have to say its one of the top investments I have made into the early Access game sales model.Reasons why I recommend this game:Updates: Are frequent.Bugs: When found are fixed promptly.Crafting: Many recipies in the initial bucket with tons more custom recipies if you decide to play multiplayerScalable difficulty: The amount of options that you are able to adjust for singleplayer make your experience playing the game as challenging or as easy as you would prefer.Multiplayer: There are some amazing PVP and PVE servers out therePersonal Experience: I play alot of games when I have the oppurtunity to do so. You can tell by the amount of hours I have into this game that it is definitely worth the price tag.Reasons why I would not recommend this game:None.If you are on the fence, and considering buying this game, buy it. If you love the genre of either sandbox games, zombie games, or survival games, buy it.			"

								Added 02/01/2015 - The game was meant to be fully released and completed by May 2014 according to the developers. It's still in Alpha as of this date. Original Pre-Alpha7 Review - http://screencloud.net/v/D4NS Original developer comment, finally changed on the 29th January  - http://screencloud.net/v/pVOJOriginal response to Developers - http://screencloud.net/v/vOcNAlso had my review marked as abusive for no reason by the developers - http://screencloud.net/v/kkMIAdded 02/01/2015 - The game was meant to be fully released and completed by May 2014 according to the developers. It's still in Alpha as of this date. Alpha 7 Review - March 2014 I decided to update my review as it was old and new builds have been released.Would I recommend the game now? No. For a multitude of reasons.Gameplay - The game still lags (on the one computer i've tried it on 16gb Ram, Nvidia GeForce 770M, i7 Processor, though I will try it on others also), though not as bad as before which is a plus, the game is now playable if you push the settings right down and it appears the developers have updated the recommended specifications to better match what the game requires. The updates to the Alpha 7 Build include the ever-so-needed stealth system, a rework of a lot of the in game textures, a looting-timer system (with noise penalties) cooking and a plethora of other things and since the Alpha 7 update random map generation has also been added. For me the balance between survival realism and zombie-shoot-em-up is wrong and the game feels boring like most of the other Early Access survival gamesSome gameplay feautures I do like though is the new loot-timing system. Instead of being able to see what is in a lootable container right away there is a short timer which in real life would replicate the opening of the container. There is also a noise penalty if you decided to 'take all' rather than each item individually which does add a nice realism touch to it. But that is my problem. The game doesn't feel like a sandbox survival game, it feels like a sandbox trying-to-be-everything game. I don't feel compelled to stay alive like I do in Rust, or build an awesome base like I do in Minecraft. I don't feel compelled to do anything in 7 Days to Die at all. I just don't find the game enjoyable. I've left the various 'bugs' out of the review, because it is an Alpha, and like all other Alpha's it has a ton of bugs, included some that are gamebreaking so beware of those.In all, the game is a lot better than it was before, but it's still not worth the price and I can't recommend a game where the developers believe that anyone who critisizes thier product is trolling and marks all and any critisism as 'abusive' and requests that Steam comes up with a way to 'anonomusly silence and report' all negative reviews or remarks. I have no desire to continue playing this game, mainly for that reason, though the game not being enjoyable FOR ME is also one. I do think for the price, and genre, there are many games that do the job of 7 Days To Die and are a lot better with better communities. The May deadline the developers set themselves has long passed and the game is still in Alpha stage. I recommend saving your money.			"

								The first few nights I spent huddled in a dark corner of a scrap metal shed, hoping they wouldn't notice me. Then I set up camp in a brick building in a town I found. Eventually I built outer walls with steel doors... and they noticed. That night they clawed through my doors and my walls. Killed about ten with my crossbow but then I ran out of bolts. A few more with a barbed club and then I hid until morning. After I had gained a respectable amount of loot I moved to the city. Picked out a concrete parking garage and filled all the walls with reinforced concrete and metal bars. Lived fairly comfortably for a week or so, It had been pretty quiet since I cleared out the area. Built a farm on the roof and put in a small well and a bridge to the next building as an escape route. Lots of loot, self sustained, great. I had built a foyer/shooting gallery so that after they got through the front door, they were stuck at another door and I could shoot at them.  Then one night they just wouldn't stop comming. I must have killed forty before they got through. I went to run but the dogs got me. Respawned with hardly anything and right next to where I died. Died again. Then a few more times before I retreated back to my small town with no clothes and my tail between my legs. (Sigh)  10/10			"

								Great survival game with a very scary atmosphere. It has very in-depth mechanics and a good crafting system. The devs have also included a tutorial which is nice. The graphics are also pretty good. As for the optimization, there is room for improvement but it will run fine on most computers. If you like challenging survival games this one is great.			"

								I'm writing this review after clocking a good amount of playtime and hope my lengthy review can be of some use to new/current/veteran/potential players. It's always good to start with the good:THE PROS This game is the love-child of The Walking Dead (TV show) and Minecraft Relatively friendly interface and easy-to-play (a contradiction noted in the THE CONS) Great sandbox experience; allowing players to adopt any playstyle they choose would suit them in the apocalypse: hoarder, scavenger, murderer, good samaritan.. with amazing potential for roleplay experience! Huge list of craftable weapons whether they be melee or firearms; each with their own advantages. Huge list of craftable materials which can be used to manipulate a fully functional envrionment (if you see it, you can destroy it) Good balance between ""risk/reward"" and ""time spent in-game/achievement"" Great modding options for setting-up servers to suit your playstyleTHE CONS - The majority of which are experienced in multiplayer games. This is Alpha. Be careful if you choose to buy/play this game. It is riddled with bugs/glitches/cheats/hacks.  Complaining or asking for help on official forums in relation to multiplayer games, will be met with: ""This is alpha"", ""Go play single-player"", ""This is alpha!"", ""Join a server with your friend"", ""THIS IS ALPHA!"" Unfriendly interface for joining multiplayer games. I still have no idea what some of those 'filter' options mean/do and there is nothing in-game that explains them; not even on the wiki or offical website. Anti-cheat system doesn't work Frustratingly annoying to connect directly to a friend's game. Port-forwarding, etc No option to ""type only to friends"" or ""private whisper"" in-game. All typing is global. Relatively slow updates from the devs Rocket launchers, advanced military sniper rifles and fully-automatic machine guns *sigh* (A personal ""con"" for me, as it destroys the immersion of a zombie apocalypse) Single player soon becomes extremely tedious/pointless.Known Cheats/Exploits No-clip. Players can shoot through walls, floors, etc. Duplicate items. Players can stack/duplicate items. Track bedroll. Players can track another player's base after he/she places a bedroll. Invisible killing. Players can attack another player from anywhere on the map. Flying. Item spawning.Despite there being more CONS, the PROS significantly outweigh them. Hope this helps. I strongly recommend this game. Buy it. "

								EDIT: 6/21/2015So, I've now played through every update, put in about 200+ hours through this and my other steam account, (Teknospawn), this one being my smurf account, and I wanted to explain EXACTLY what you can expect if you buy this game. This is going to be a mostly fact based review of what you will experience, and it will be up to you to decide if you will like it. I will also post this same review on my other steam account. 1) The game has been in alpha for a VERY long time and it will most likely stay that way for at least the next year or so. However they do have a daily updated developer page that posts exactly what they are doing: http://joelhuenink.tumblr.com/2) The game is ""mostly"" finished in that even in it's current state, it feels like a ""complete"" game. It rather feels like they continue to release new free ""DLC"" content every other month. 3) If you're looking for the best graphics quality, you will not find it here. However the graphics are good enough for a voxel based sandbox game, in my opinion. The graphics never take away from the feel of surviving and dominating an apocalyptic world and with the Unity 6 upgrade, it's gotten better.4) Although you will die A LOT in the beginning until you understand the game mechanics, the zombie element will eventually become easy, and the human combat is what you will have to watch out for. As the days accumulate the zombies become progressively harder.5) The game definitely ""feels"" like you're trying to survive an apocalyptic wasteland. The growing curve is not too bad, after you've put in about 10+ hours to understand how to survive and use the 7daystodie crafting wiki, you begin to feel like you have control over your environment. All in all, if you want to master surviving, fighting, crafting, and build a huge kick♥♥♥♥♥base, it will take you a total of 100+ hours to get there. In my opinion, although you can continue to play more, this game is worth about a 100+ hours of fun. So for the price, I think it's worth it. Although I play dota 2, which is free and I've played dota 1 + 2 a combined amount of about 10,000 hours.Now on to exactly what the game contains based on how you will experience it for the first time.You start off by spawning in a general area near a ""hub city"" where everyone spawns near. This city will have tons of low level stuff to loot to get you started including tools, food, resources, materials, weapons, etc.. If you want to know exactly what you can craft, go to: http://7daystodie.gamepedia.com/CraftingIf you're on a busy server, you'll need to travel further out in order to be safe from players and find less actively looted spots. In the beginning you will have to sneak around a lot of zombies, eat a lot of plants and animals to survive, and basically be a super noob, just to not die. I suggest finding a cave, and building a small easily defended starter house in it. You will experience a lot fear and death for the first few hours until you get the hang of it, or get lucky and come across someones existing base which has become inactive because the player quit that server. In that case  you will start with a plethora of items and will live like a king for a few days. However, unless you're playing on a PVE server, you must ALWAYS be careful for other high level players who are running around trying to kill everyone on the server, so building an underground base is best for noobies. The next few days will be pretty much exactly like minecraft. Learning to build structures, learning to build resources and making better versions of each as you go. Building a defensive outdoor structure will be the next big step. How you want to create this ingenius zombie proof castle is up to you, but be warned your tools dull down and break. Ammos is quickly spent. Feral zombies can detect your fire's heat signature. Spider zombies can climb up walls, and call forth a horde of zombies if they spot you directly. Zombie dogs will run faster than you, some zombies will crawl and break your legs, others will spit explosive puke grenades to destroy your building. But if you hide successfully enough, people will still come around and be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and kill you. But once you've survived for a few weeks, you should be rich as $hit and able to build a massive and well built mansion for which you can live out the rest of your days honing your building skills. Zombies will no longer be a challenge. People will still be a challenge, but build far away enough and it won't be necessary to be extremely defensive. (I personally play on a PVE server so that I can just focus on building.)As for building, the gravity challenge makes building realistic structures fun. It's not like minecraft where you can just put block on block on block. Each block can hold only so much weight before it comes crashing down. Make your foundational blocks strong, and build on those. You would be suprised what you can build with proper planning and strategy. I personally think the buliding part is the best part of 7daystodi. Once you've mastered the game, much like minecraft, it now becomes about what you can build through your honed skills. If you don't enjoy the challenge of building, then this game is not for you, as the zombies don't create much of a challenge for someone who has survived for a few days on one server. All in all this game to me, is the best ""updated"" basic minecraft building game with better graphics, and more surviving and I still play it to this day.			"

								This game is pretty fun. I bought it a little over a year ago and really only started playing it a few days back. I'll probably keep playing it, too. This is why it saddens me to have to do this, but I cannot recommend this game.The game itself is pretty straightforward: you're cast as a scantily clad man or woman in a deserted wasteland after some grand catastrophe, possibly (heavily hinted at) involving nuclear warfare. From the instant you enter the world (which can be randomly generated as per the world seed or a prefab world) your survival is in your hands. There are hundreds of items to craft, a handful of different biomes with unique enemies and challenges, and an endless number of forts/bases/shacks that the player can build in order to survive. Basically, the game is great, the store page is a fairly accurate rundown of what you get for dropping your dime.Now I will elaborate as to why I cannot in good faith encourage folks to buy in right now. The Steam game forums, as you well know, are for the discussion of their respective game or discussion of certain subtopics that relate to said game. Early Access games in particular usually encourage user feedback through their forums. 7DTD is, and should be, no different. Earlier today, however, I had a particularly bad experience with a forum ""Officer,"" in which the officer involved (Red Eagle) not only showed a blatant disrespect for me and other members of the userbase, but also for the rules and guidelines of Steam as a whole. Another user started a thread entitled ""A compilation of problems with A12"" or something like that, in which he detailed what he believed to be issues with the game's latest build. The user was in no way hostile, nor was he even making the slightest attempt to badmouth the game, the dev team, or anything even remotely involved with the project. He was simply providing feedback as per the store page suggestion: ""Report bugs and leave feedback for this game on the discussion boards."" <--This is literally a copy/paste, word for word text box on the store page with a hyperlink leading to the discussions right next to it. All was well, folks were discussing the topic, and everything was very civil, that is until the aforementioned forum Officer showed up. As if completely ignoring the thread's title and the original post's content (containing a list of issues with the latest build), he rudely replies to the OP these exact words: ""Release notes: read them."" The OP replies, stating that he had indeed read the release notes and asking the officer what his point was in making the comment. The officer then replies (rudely, again) stating that if the OP had read the release notes, he would see that all of the issues in the list were ""intended features"" and that he had clearly failed to comprehend basic English. At this point, having been keeping tabs on the thread I chime in, reminding the officer of his status and the conduct expected of him, and pointing out that the first thing in the OP's list was related to a mouse jittering issue. That, along with several other items in the list, could in no way be ""intended features.""At this point, Red flies off the handle, saying that ""If [we] had read the patch notes, I wouldn't be getting my panties in a knot"" and ""...end up looking like a fool."" I report his post for rudeness, then reply thusly: ""Again chill, please. This is a forum, you're an officer. Please act like an adult. If you're trying to spread information, there are several better ways than spouting out thinly veiled insults like a child. I.E. Instead of ""Release notes: read them,"" try ""Have you read the release notes? I tried to cover all of your issues there."" Red ignores my post and then attacks the OP again, claiming that his thread is a troll thread (seriously, he honestly said this) and that it serves no purpose if he isn't trying to ""make issues known."" The OP replies calmly, again, and states the purpose of the forums and their public status. He also goes on to state (correctly) that his thread was, indeed, feedback and that the officer was the only one trying to start a fight or troll or what have you.I chime in again, reciprocating OP's reasoning and telling the officer that the thread is attempting to make issues known, as per his own rules. The officer replies to me, stating that the OP now suddenly needs to give specific reasons for his issues or it's just a troll thread. In yet another display of extreme patience, the OP calmly restates his thread's purpose and reasserts its status as falling within the forum guidelines. I began typing my own response, but when I try to post it, I discover that the thread has been erased and the OP has been banned. Now, I'm not sure if OP said anything during the brief interval when I was typing my response that broke the rules, but I know for a fact that Red Eagle had no call to act as rudely and childishly as he has. As such, I am actively going to attempt to disuade any and all interested parties that I know of from purchasing this game until such a time that the mods take some action against Red and/or he is made to apologize publicly or resign from his officer status.It is absolutely disgusting that this kind of behaviour is tolerated by this team, and I cannot, nor will I ever support people who care this little about public interaction. TL;DR Verdict-- Avoid it like the fictional plague it so gleefully employs in its world. Forum mod abuse to an extreme and hostile extent. If any forum officers are reading this, take a look at the deleted thread yourself and see what I'm talking about. And to Red, you should be ashamed of yourself. Your behaviour was and is pathetic and I honestly hope you strongly reconsider your approach to public relations. Grow up.[EDIT:] Grammar and such.			"

								This in-development little gem really took me by surprise. I expected it to be just like every other zombie survival out there. In fact, while it incorporates many of the features we've come to expect in zombie and survival games, it also introduces us to new features, The smell of food attracting zombies, zombies using their senses to find you, being actively hunted, not to mention an array of different zombies, bloaters, bloated zombies who spit poison, ember zombies that catch you on fire if they hit you, runners, tree climbers, etc. The playing map is similar to minecraft, in that it goes on forever and there are different biomes. Everything is breakable in game, zombies can actually collapse houses by causing enough structural damage, which they will do if they sense you but can't find you. Remember this is still in development, so there are a few bugs, clipping issues etc; However, this game has virtually unlimited potential and has won me over already.			"

								I'm surprised I didn't play this before last week because it's amazing. This is what I've been wanting out of all the DayZ and Rust style games that are out now. Sure, DayZ and Rust have appeal in their own right, but this feels more like a simulation. You can pretty much do anything. You must use strategy and, if possible, teamwork. This game is super fun and addicting. The way it's designed makes sure you never feel safe or secure. There's always something that needs to be built or crafted to survive and you have to explore often to find supplies. I've had a few truly terrifying moments while playing this, and it's generally the moments where you CAN'T see what's going on that are the scariest.			"

								I have played 7 days for a while, just recently got back into it and I have to say I love the changes they have made, the little quests will help out new players, the new crafting interface is well constucted and the crafting menu still blows me away. There is a lot of detail in the crafting system which I love. It's not just a zombie hoard in this game it's a loot hoard.This game after months of playing still gives me the heebeegeebies, I hide like a little kid and if talking to my buddies I lower my voice thinking the zombies will hear me if I talk to loud. The sounds they make give me the chills and I just want to turn my computer off and never turn it on again. But as a grown adult I tell myself it's just a damn game...LOL..*Thumbs up* "

								Image Minecarft meets ""insert-generic-zombie-game"" and you'll have 7 Days to Die. It sounds cliched and is, admittedly, an overused concept but it works and is damned fun to play. Gameplay:Scavenging, building complex bases and, come day 7 (and it's multiples),  putting it to the test against the zombie hoarde is fun and very addictive. Being an Early Access game it does have its bugs and glitches but none of them, so far, have been game breaking.Audio:The musical score serves its purpose but isn't groundbreaking. The sound effects also fall into that category being nothing more than serviceable. Don't get me wrong, they're not bad but it doesn't hold a candle to the blockbuster games. Zombies sound suitably scary and you'll learn, very quickly, to fear the growl of a zombie dog.Graphics:The graphics are just...good....but that's to be expected what with the world being fully moddable. See that mountain in the background? You can, with time and dedication, level it completely. Want to build a complex cave system or bomb shelter? Go for it! It won't have the same prettiness as the Witcher 3 but it stands head and shoulders above other building games.Early Access:A lot of games (you know which ones) seem to be content with hiding in Early Access forever with little to no updates been released. Rest assured that 7D2D has recieved many, substantial updates and the devs are in constant contact with the community over at the official forums. The last update, for example, added mountains, a much improved random world generator and traders. Overall:I've spent 500+ hours playing 7D2D and I have loved every single one of them. I've built small houses with hidden access to a sprawling, underground base, a massive housing complex built on top of a mountain and a large rooftop farm, to name just a few. I've also killed over 1000 zombies which is always a plus.Score:8/10 - Highly recommended			"

								This game's crafting options turned me into a DIY nut.  Early game was spent by a riverside shack I created right next to a river in the forest biome.  I surrounded it with corn, cotton, maple tree, blueberry and potato farms.   Absolutely zero protection, but I was relatively safe during the night in sneak mode at the top of my 4 block high 7x7 abode wielding my handmade crossbow.  Had a hell of a time trying to find all the books I'd need for crafting, particularly the one that would allow me to build a forge.  Luckily, I found a cooking pot pretty easily (I know from previous playthroughs how screwed you are when you can't boil your own water).  Lived off boiled meat very early, but before long I was making a living baking potatos.Mid-game, I set up mining operations near my shack mining for stone,lead, iron, coal and potassium nitrate at night, while the hordes passed overhead (mostly) unawares.  During the day, I hunted, hit supply drops and did some supply runs on hardware stores and the homes nearby.  Stocked up a lot of rebar frames and wood frames plus came across a lot of tools from the hardware store runs.  I saved the rebar frames for later, and used the wood frames as fuel for my cooking and forge fires so I could stockpile wood from my maple tree farm.   Ended up with a metric ton of animal fat between hunting and those slow bloater zeds, the little I needed to make candles barely made a dent in my stock.  Used the corn to make cornmeal, then that to make clay.  With the clay and my supply runs, I was able to make molds of all parts of every firearm in the game.Late-game: prepared to make the defensible, self-sustainable lair of my dreams.  40 x 40, four block high walls topped with barbed wire that are three blocks thick using stone from mining to make concrete (outer layer is reinforced concrete, using the rebar frames from runs; inner two were simple concrete).  Surrounded by a 3 block deep moat with sharpened tree trunk traps at the bottom.  Entrances on the north, south, east and west sides secured with two metal doors each.  Inside, I had enough room to rebuild all my farms, all my forges and cooking fires, a mine, and built a two story house in the center.  Have a small lake for water.  Now, pretty much the only reason I would HAVE to venture out is to hunt to maintain my stores of animal fat and venison (fat for biofuel and candles, venison for venison stew, which is awesome) and ironically, sand.  I use the sand to make glass jars because the game, inexplicably, does not allow you to keep jars after you use water for anything other than drinking (like making venison stew or grain alcohol, which I use with biofuel to make my own gas cans for power tools).  Between the iron I've mined and continute to, and the molds I have, I'm able to build any number of guns.  Between lead, coal, potassium nitrate and a stockpile of brass (you should really be able to mine this too) I can make any bullet.  Have plenty of books for shotgun shell wadding.That was just one way to go about it.  You can be a nomad packing it up during the day and raiding any town or muni building you see.  Or you can fortify an existing structure and save on building resource cost.  What's most surprising to me is how a game that is in early access, which has made no attempt at a storyline (so far) can really make you ask yourself how you would survive an apocalyptic scenario.  Highly recommended, especially if they come through with the dirtbike they said they'd include in the game.  Would make late-game looting really fun for the stay-at-home types.			"

								I never do reviews, this is my first.  7daystodie is a brilliant game. I write this review as of alpha11 and while the new patch is only a few days and a tad buggy, the devs have already hotfixed some of the bugs and i have every faith the others will be fixed in the next few days.  Even this the bugs Alpha 11 is very playable. I have 835 hours invested in this game as of writing this review. Yes I LOVE IT!!! ... honestly the price is well worth it.  People come into a game like this for different reasons, my husband loves fps and loves the zombie hunting elements of this game. I have always sucked at that sort of thing so i focus on the crafting/building elements. My kill counts are always very low ...but just because i don't like to do to much killing doens't mean i don't enjoy the game as it would with so many zombie survival games out there. I focus on crafting the things we need to survive and building a safe place to lay our head at night and trust me there is enough to do in that respect alone to keep me busy without me needing to run around with a gun.  You can easily play this game as a pure survival, sneaking and hiding avoiding zombies as much as possible while you scavenge enough food/drink and build yourself and impenitrable bunker to ward off even the most mighty of enivitable hordes which will eventually come looking for you. (and trust me they can be terrifying.... i have literally logged off too scared to play untill my husband joined me)  Or you can play it almost like a fps ... living moment to moment scavenging for supplies while blasting the hell outta zombies with the multitude of weapons the game has.  The weapon system is great, all the weapons feel different, they have different usage. Some are better for up close and then theres your hunting/rifles and snipers for distance. It's rare to find a game with the right mix of elements to keep me and my husband both happy, because we are both very different gamers.  This game has managed to keep us both hooked for over 800 hours so kudo's to the pimps it's not an easy thing to do.  "

Early Access Review
								WARNING: The following review is my personal opinion of this game, and should not be taken otherwise. With that said let's beginI. What is 7 Days to Die?7 Days to die is a open world zombie survival shooter game. Deep crafting systems, multiple types of zombies, destructible environments, air drops, hunger system, medical system, and thirst system are just some of the main features avaliable in this game.II. Minecraft?NO! NO! NO! This game is not minecraft! This game is a zombie survival sim with many survival features, minecraft is a sandbox platform game. Please do not ask this ever again.III. What is singleplayer like?Singleplayer is in my opinion boring as of 9.1, reason being is the game has no NPCs or quest systems so it feels like a survive or die alone game with nothing behind it (though fans of this system will find it gratifying especially if they set the zombie spawn higher and loot chance lower to increase difficulty)IV. List the zombies please.infected survivor (basic)infected cheerleader (basic)infected woman (basic)nude walker (basic)crawler (hard to hit knee biter)lumberjack (double health normal zombie)bloated lumberjack (massive amounts of health don't even bother they are too slow)spider zombie (climbs walls and screams ALOT)bloater (triple health big slow zombie)dog (super fast enemy that will destroy everything you own)spewer (cop that spits vomit that melts blocks, blows up when close both do massive amounts of damage health is equal to bloater)hornet (zombie air force slightly slower than dog drops honey yum)V. How is multiplayer?Multiplayer is stable though there are the occasional stutter (that is not related to my connection or specs) but this is barely noticable. Multiplayer has a balance system to it in that the more people you have, the more mouths to feed and the more medical supplies you will run through. I personally have had quite a few wonderful moments such as a group of four surviving together and wondering if I should kill a friend because he's infected (perma death is on) I had a healing anti biotic but it was my only one, so I shot him to save my own skin later (they found out and executed me lol) the multiplayer has a lot of similar things that happen. Help a friend defend his house and waist your bullets that you just crafted or let him fight them alone and hope he doesn't die? Do you share your extra gun and hope that the others don't shoot you in a bad situation or just smelt it down and say you don't have one? These are literally endless and are controlled by you so it adds a sense of joy and excitement to the game that most zombie games lack in MP.VI, List the pros of this game please. (As of 9.1)Great multiplayerGood hunger system that feels balanced (not too hungry or too full all the time)stamina system is linked to your water intake Your character can run a long way to show that in a death situation your guy would give his allCrafting system is very deep and makes senseblock upgrade system uses resources and actually makes a differenceFully destructable enviormentFarming system is farely easy to do and can mean a lotzombie hordes are usually sizeablemultiple zombie types keep it interestingDisease and Health system with medical system Creative Mode is a lot of fun the ability to spawn a zombie behind your friend never gets oldProcedural generation makes new maps each time, with a few biomes and quite a few building templates this makes the world really fun to traverse VII. List the cons please.zombies will spawn inside your fortress and housezombie spawn settings only seem to effect hordes and not the annoying single zombiesspewer zombies seem to track you anywherethe falling system is a bit unreliablezombies will get stuck and glitch making them unable to die but still able to hit youno NPCsno singleplayer questssingleplayer is less enjoyable than multiplayer but can still be fun depending on you.VIII. Conclusion 7 Days is a zombie game unlike anyother I have found, the survival system is super fun and the multiplayer in my opinion is the best done. Early access makes this game buggy but, the devs update fairly often and listen to fans to make sure the game is aweomse. All in all this is a zombie game up there with The Dead Linger and Project Zomboid, this game IS NOT minecraft or DayZ this game is what you make it more than anything, the question is what will your zombie story be?IX.

								At first 7 Days to Die had me so raging it was hilarious.  As I began to learn to how to move through the game, I got better.   Once I learned to time the full blood moon and build structures that I knew I was safe in that allowed me perfect access to kill zombies and gather, i got better and better.   The bug with the motor bikes was fixed and it became a much better game. Learning, scavaging, surviving.  Each step through the game will show you what you're made of.  I really enjoyed it, thus put in plenty hours and took time to own our own server to ensure that the basic game without a lot of added in bonuses, was worth it .  I would definitely buy this game again :)			"

								This game is great for LAN or private play as PVE with friends. Positive review from me here.This is my first review on steam for a game and is because I am very angry at the whole way they are dealing with the cheating issues with the basic attitude of the developers who basically are saying theres no way to stop it so stop asking us to fix it.IF you play on any server your base will get hacked, basical the server is open to client map files allowing modification and checking map to see where player bases are, where players are (while not on your friends list.) They can change the damage given, the damage they recieve, where they spawn (without a bed). Even tunnel through bedrock to escape easily after they have filled in your base.Basically raids on bases are legal in PVP where your base is protected by landclaim blocks. In a hack - land claim blocks do nothing to stop hackers because they change their damage to a rediculous amounts. My friends and I on our third server we have lost everything decided to make a base hidden in a mountain, no forges would ever be running and all our stuff was at bedrock with a small tunnel as only means of entering. And about 10 minutes run from the main starting area. Took the guy 5 minutes to completely fill in our base and tunnel out the bedrock leaving a hole into nothing where you fall, then log out and come back in to be on the surface. We have taken screen shots of this.Usually you can spot a hacker when their ping is over 250 and they have the ability to set all pings to 0 there by disquising themselves. The steam ban does nothing for hacks as players can simply use family library sharing to get back on the servers they are banned from and keep playing the game.If you want this game to play with a friend and PVE its a really good game.If you want to play with other people, dont bother. Save your money cause all the work you do will be lost within minutes by hackers.If you buy the game to play with others on an open server enjoy - 7 ways to be Hacked!			"

								Day 1------Load in procedural Navezgane with one other person spawn in next to a lone burnt out house with very little to offer. i soon group up with my brother and he tells me of a town he spotted on his way to meet me.command console suddenly appears and i glitch out of the game.reload, night is here, mauled by bearDay 4------Together we launch a small raid on Diersville and fortify a house on the outskirts of the town and the border of the National forest.We begin preparations for night 7 and plans on the contruction of a bunker begin.Console suddenly appears and i glitch out of the game again but plans proceed swimmingly.Day 7------Final preparations are finished and we raid the Diersville hospital aquiring much needed medical supplies for the night along with blueprints and gear.The night begins with several load shrieks with a musical of screams and moans of desire for our flesh as we huddle in our cobblestone bunker reinforced with iron spikes along the top and along trenches around the sides. Corpses tumbled off above us and the bodies of the dead created a makeshift bridge across our fortifications. the door had been breached, but with a few well placed reinforced blocks they were kept at bay.Morning comes and as the sun rises the music of dawn plays, the command console appears yet again to remove me from the game.Day 13------ The Bunker is expanded and my brother and we gain a new member to our party and equip him with a new found sniper rifle. We tell him to post up on the second floor of our reinforced house just across the road from our bunker.Day 14-------The Zeds stood no chance against our defences and they broke upon us like the sea against the cliffs. we held not losing a single wall to the undead hoards.Day 17-------I set out alone to found a new outpost in the eastern reaches of Navezgane.I begin demolitions of a gas station and build on top of its sturdy foundation but a pack of 7 dogs interrupts me and hastily dispatches me.I respawn and quickly kill the remaining dogs and continue my contruction.it has also occured to me that i have lost complete sound of zombies at this point and as a result am left in a constant state of paranoia.Day 19-------Events take a turn for the worse as Honey, goldenrod tea and a hearty meal of bacon and eggs fail to increase lost wellness.Despite not having a forge or any infrastructure i am plagued by routine Heat Hordes.it occurs to me that all special events on the server happen around me, and myself only.Day 20--------I begin the journey back to the outskirts of Diersville to prepare for the next bloodthirsty horde but i am quickly ambushed by a random heat horde spawning directly on top of my postition. I am eaten alive. again.After reclaiming my equipment i move to salvage a derelict military camp in the frozen wastes but a group of 6 Frozen Lumberjacks spawn directly on top of me. i am stunlocked to death and eaten.Day 21-------- During a last ditch effort to salvage the military camp, the Horde spawns directly on top of me and my comrade and i quickly flee the scene. in my haste i accidently equip a flashlight on my main hand and it deletes my 550 quality sledgehammer.Zombies are still silent during this time.Day 22-------- After innumerable crashes, horrible mixture of snow, sleet and rain. i am reduced to a shadow of my former being. i suffer from silent zombies, hypothermia, constant hunger and thirst and minimum wellness along with constant surprise hoards and horrid Frames per second.i come to the realization that i am a masochist.i also ♥♥♥♥ing love this game.10/10 would get rekt by bugs again.

								I played this game for a total of about 5 hours now and my adentures have been great. First, my friend thought that you could get gas from hitting a gas barrel and exploded me and my bed. It took me about 20 minutes to swim back only to randomly die and have to swim back again. We robbed a bank and built a house on the roof, then my friends set out on a great bear hunt. After much struggling, my friends killed the bear, only to have one of them run into his own spike and die. Next, we had to prepare for the super wave that comes on the seventh days, which basically consisted of us covering the entire bank in spikes and then sitting on our roof. At approximately 21 hours, the wave washed up against our spikes like the Americans on D-Day, and we watched and listened to the terrifying chorus of zombies and mutant dogs crying in pain. As the sun came up, we saw almost a hundred corpses lying against the spike wall and the few zombies remaining were spinning around having PTSD flashbacks. 10 out of 10 would commit mass genocide again.

A note from the future: at the day of my review the game had an enormous update and graphics and drawing distance got better relatively but still needs a a lot of work; especially combat.			"

Early Access Review
								A wonderfully fun zombie survival game. The best one out there I'd say. The amount of content the dev's continuously bring to this game is amesome and I am grateful for that.. This game is addicting and surpasses what I ever expected of it to grow into. So why am I giving it a negative review?Lets just say this games anticheat software is rather worthless and the developers don't seem to care or be focusing on that issue. I have more than once, ended up on a server with ONE single person modding/hacking/cheating that destroys it for everybody on the server, literally. It drives me crazy. The game is difficult as is and I'd like people to comment to see if their experiences is rather the same. I want to know if hackers and cheaters are as bad in this game as I think they are. Here is my experience lately. Most recently I had a server that I put 2 days straight worth of work into to have it gone in a second due to one single person. That one single person somehow was able to hone missles from out of nowhere and kill everybody on the map as well as destroy all their supply crates, beds and you name it.. gone. I was also deep underground. To the bedrock. Yet a missle came from nowhere and killed me. Destroyed my bed, crates and everything, continuously no matter where I spawned. Me and the 2 other players I was playing with were furious.. As well as the rest on the server. What a waste of time.This is the problem I run into with every multiplayer server based game out there is hackers and cheaters that just ruin it for everybody. I really have no interest to return to the game. What is the point in putting in all that hard work. Hours, Days or weeks worth of work just to have it gone in an instant.  My recommendation is if your going to play, play on a server that is watched and you know is safe and possibly password protected and private. Otherwise, prepare for the worst on open servers. So please, if you will. I want to know everybodies experience with this issue.			"

								I've been playing since it was released on Steam, and in my opinion the development of the game has gone in the wrong direction.  If you take out the (glitched) minibike, random map generation, and smooth terrain there have not been any major content updates to the game.  They have sprinkled in mocap, new HUD, new zombie skins, some graphics upgrades, and a whole load of xml tweaks.  There is an absolute obsession by the developers to take a mechanic that is working just fine (forge, resource harvesting, and crafting) and change it.  There is also a focus on making the beginning of the game more difficult and much more tedious, but they have not added anything for once you get past the early stages of the game.After over two years: just one rudimentary vehicle, no npcs, no quests, no electricity (and the plethora of items that could be added with electricity), no gates/large doors, no animal domestication, no fishing, and no rivers in random world generation.  These are just a few things that could be added for content, not a dispositive list.It seems like the devs are just constantly shuffling around small features and fixing other features that are not broken.It's a shame because this was one of my favorite games.  Hopefully they are able get it back on track.Edit:  Another aspect of the game that is not the fault of the developers, but needs to be addressed regardless is the cesspool the Steam forum for this game has become.  It is basically open hostility towards people who put forth their own negative opinions on an alpha game.  The tone of the forum has drastically changed over the past few months into  an echo chamber in which it is required for everyone to either like every change the developers make to the game or to make excuses for the game's shortcomings.  This is not how you make a game better, diversity of opinion should be encouraged, not chased off and silenced by the angry mob.Edit: An example of forum decorum: http://steamcommunity.com/app/251570/discussions/0/412449508276608974/ "

Early Access Review
								Dug myself a nice cave [√]Got all cozy and laughed as zombies walked over my base, oblivious [√]A dozen dogs spawn two weeks in [√]Dogs dig down into my base [√]Dies every time I respawn because dogs in base and zombie horde outside [√]10/10 Would get gangbanged by zombie dogs again======In all seriousness though, I have to highly recommend this game. Even though I play this on a Mac for the most part where it's no secret that bugs, crashes and a plethora of frustrating issues arise from time to time, overall I think this game has huge potential for just an alpha. Something that very few games manage to do even 40 hours into gameplay is keeping me on my toes and worried all throughout. The ""difficulty"" progression of the waves seems to match pace with the progress made very nicely, imo. While I tend to play settler style for the most part, at any point of the game I would never be completely relaxed about the nights. Yes, generally the nights pass by in silence as the zombies simply walk over my base, but occasionally when they sense or even outright detect me underground and start mindlessly digging towards me, it's always a nerve racking experience. (My bases are generally shallow, eg only 10 or so blocks down. Something I should probably fix)Overall, the game is wonderful because it allows so many different styles of play, but still forces players to do one common and core function. Exploring. Now I talk about this from a vanilla server or SP perspective where you have no recipes unlocked. As you progress in the game, it becomes apparently harder and harder to survive with just a crossbow and some cloth armor. You start requiring later and later game items which require more unique resources. Eventually, you'll be forced to go out into the wild to gather and find these resources that will be paramount to your success in the game. Want a shotgun? Better know how to make one. What's that? No ammo? Gotta figure out how to make that too. Don't know how to make it? Well sucks to suck. Go out and find the recipe book. Keep getting rekt by the zombies pumelling you? Well get that janky cloth armor off you and get some iron armor on. Don't know how to make one? Find the recipe book. What's that? Need leather? Better figure out how to make that too. The point is, you can't progress in the equipment line without these recipe books that you won't be finding unless you actually go out and explore. Personally, I enjoy the idea of packing up a lunch, grabbing a stack of water, putting on some armor, taking my shotgun and seeing what I can find out there. I've been playing on Navesgane for a little bit now and I have a pretty good idea of where all the major things are without needing to reference an online map or anything. Even then, I keep stumbling upon encampments, houses and other POI that I forget exist. It's an exciting experience when you legitimately don't know what you might run across on one day of exploring.I would go into more commentaries on the mechanics and nitty gritty of the game, but there are already tons of reviews that do that much better than I ever could. This review is just an honest opinion of my experiences with the game thus far. Hopefully others will find that the game might be worth their time and money to do a bit of exploring with :)			"

								Fun game.  In early stages of development.  Challenging to play, until you get the hang of it, then it's pretty easy.  After your character is maxed out and your base is built, there's not much else to do in this game at that point.  Each major update comes with new fun things to try out.  Game needs to add more content such as quests or missions or some type of long term goals that make people want to come back to the game over and over.			"

Night 6: They didn't stand a chance!Day 7: Stocking up on ammo and other supplies. Got some blueprints but not enough materials to craft any of it.Night 7: Trench did not do the trick.

								One of the most immersive games I ever played. To give an example: I found myself systematically looting a hotel, checking every single room hoping to find human turd in the toilet that I could use to make fertilizer for my roof garden that I started on an abandonend old gas station.Also, if you ever found yourself playing Rust, and thinking ""I wish there was a game where I could build bases, loot cities, hunt, survive, farm, craft, ... WITHOUT NO NOLIFERS COMING TO BLOW UP MY♥♥♥♥♥♥WITH THE C4 THEY GRIND 24/7 WHEN I AM OFFLINE LIVING MY LIFE !!!"", then 7 Days to Die is for you. It's a great PvE survival game for co-op or solo fun. It has PvP, but I didn't try it, and I am not going to. PvP in survival games attracts the most cancerous scum players of society.Some say 7DTD has been in early access forever. Well, whatever. Just look at gameplay videos from 3 years ago, and look at current ones. This game has come a long way, and the devs are working on some really cool stuff. Don't believe me? Check dev blog. This game is not dead, and it's not going to die anytime soon.Also, the devs are not greedy, you get a complete game for your money with built-in detailed character customization. Building customization is also coming. You get all of this without no♥♥♥♥♥♥♥DLC. Playing Rust, being a white dude with a small♥♥♥♥♥♥ but you really wanna be a black chic with monster boobs? Garry doesn't care. You get RNG character bound to your steamid. In 7DTD you can be anyone you want.			"

								Hello, Normally I do not write reviews, but in the case of this game I feel that I should due to a lot of negative reviews based on someone's opinion on how a company should operate not on the product the produce. So I have 500+ hours into this game and the Devs are always updating and adding new textures, systems, items, just all around improvements. If you have any doubts and think that it's just a money grab look at how active the Devs are on the forums. All I can say is that with the amount of money they are asking for this game if they stopped updating it tomorrow and just fixed some of the small bugs that A15 has. I would still buy this game in a heartbeat. Also back to the note at the top I see no signs that the Pimps are planning on ditching the PC community for the Consoles. Honestly now a days we PC users get crappy Console ports, this game is like a throw back when Consoles got crappy PC ports.			"

								This is one of those games where you will need to give it some time. Honestly, while the game has gotten better over its many patches and alpha updates it still will look horrible on most computers. The normal human will look and think ""err, my eyes! What ... errr"". But don't be put off. Overall, this game is 7-8/10.Before going into anymore detail, I've played this game for around ... 800 hours as of writing and have played since alpha 5 or something (old ... very old). I've played mostly PvP but I've also played a healthy amount of PvE and CoOp.My computer specs: i7 3.7ghz 8core CPU, 980 Nvida graphics, 16MB (good speed which I cannot remember) RAM, installed on a SSD. (5 months old)So, the good:1. You can spend hours ... and I mean hours loving this game. From when you get in and start raiding your first NPC town while mumbling ""♥♥♥♥♥♥shit♥♥♥♥♥♥its nearly night! (when they run) to the trantilising moment when you finish off a gigantic base. This game is close to a MMO but its fast past not horribly grindy (though it has bits)2. The PvE. Its good! Yer sure the zombies are a little dumb, but they are getting clever and they are zombies! I expect them to run into walls. You are gunna die, you are gunna run and you may even scream if you're like me and the bees (Why are bees in this game!!!). Assuming you don't join a overpopulated server the zombies are all over the place and they can creap up on you without too much trouble. At night its worse, if you're like me and you don't sit in a base dropping axes (you don't wanna know) then you will be out at night a lot and the zombies can outrun you (until higher levels) they hurt like hell and they are tanky as bricks sometimes. 3. The skill system. Its skill system is second to none ... well kk that isn't true but its good.  You gain exp from most activities (hint: killing zombies is the best now) The exp you make will become levels as any normal system at which time you get 5 skill points to spend. There are hundreds of skills and this is where most of what makes you a ""stronger player"" will happen. Do you level up a skill that makes you be able to run for longer, get better loot from scavenging or hit harder with a club? One makes you less likely to die while trying to escape, one makes you more likely to find something to shoot with and the last means you can kill your attacker as if this were season 7 of the walking dead!4. The PvP. Where the game shines and dimes the most! PvP is what this game was built for in manys eyes. Tactically stalking, scouting and then raiding somones base is fun, scary and rage worthy if it goes wrong! Defending is also fun and can often be mind games with the enemy.Now the bad:1. The lag. Sigh ... sigh ... sigh, yes ... this game has all the above and A LOT more good stuff, but damn does it lag. This can be solved moslty by good server admins and a 3rd party system (which most servers used) called CBSM which can be used to limit and kick players with high ping (high being 150+ ish). You get use to it after awhile, but don't expect this game to be smooth. What to expect: Generally lagging gameplay, skips here and there, ""that didn't hit me game"", ""Goodbye bike"", ""That zombies just teleported""2. The glitches. The general theme of the ""bad"" is bugs and glitches. Mostly the same as the above ... This game can be one hell of a gltich fest. ""I just died from nothing"", ""Where did my gun go?"" , ""Where did I go?"", ""What is this fps lag?"", ""Why can I not build here?"", ""What is that ... omg , thattts not right ... zombie ... err"". ... You get the picture. This game has many a bug. 3. The cheaters. This one isn't too bad, but there is a bit of cheating in this game. Mostly glitch releated. Duping of items is beyond easy and many do it. Sometimes its hard to blame people but most of the time its plain cheating. ""kk well my bike just zoomed off into the nothingless bit .... I'm gunna cheat it back"" VS ""This server looks fun! Lets zoom around it like superman and kill everyone in 1 shot before blowing up their bases""4. The developers. Yerp, while they are making a good game I would be lying if I said they don't have some issues. Most of the playerbase plays this game on servers of 15+ people and enjoy doing so. However, the developers have openly stated they want the game to be played on a max of 12 people and seem to care little about lag and fps issues in regards to higher population.To their credit though, the updates are not all too spread out and often come with many new/improved items and mechanics of the game. They seem very detached from the game they're making but ultimatly seem (somehow) still good at doing it.TL;DRGreat game that you can sink many worthwhile hours into with good first-time scares which you as a player learn to adapt to. Good PvP, PvE and CoOp but can sufer from horrible lag and gliches.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is like a roller coaster - it has many ups and downs.For me, Alpha 9 was this game's zenith. It worked, it was good looking and there were minimal game breakers (but quite a few dupes).The crafting grid was useful, and recipes readable if you knew them.Biomes didn't really blend but they were all there and functional, flowing beautifully with hilltops and cliffs and flats and random islands in giant lakes. Rivers existed and wound their way through landscapes randomly. It felt real.Hordes worked, coming and going as they pleased. They consisted of a good mix of zeds and followed sort-of predictable patterns. End-game content was (and still is) pretty limited, but there was always stuff to do. It didn't take weeks in-game to be able to look after yourself and there was no absurdly long list of recipe gates preventing you from doing fairly simple and intuitive things. For the most part, if you had the resources you could do it.To survive, all you really needed was a good, defensible location and a determination to make it yours. Everything else you could find underground or a short walk from the front door, past your huge walls and defensive spikes. Some people didn't like this mixture of easy to learn but harder to master. I loved it and I sank hundreds of hours into A9. A10 came along and 7DTD changed a little. We got a heatmap. Spider zeds became scouts that came when you did too much cooking or forging and they brought hordes with them if you didn't cap them ASAP. That was the biggest change. It didn't ruin the game at all, it just meant your defences had to be even better. You could still take care of yourself and play the same way (mostly).Everything else was still pretty good, I even got my feet wet in online MP and discovered things like vanishing trees and new defence ideas. I sank hundreds of hours into A10 too.Then... the rollercoaster passed its apex and started heading down when A11 was launched. The world switched to Unity 5 and, I think, became much uglier. Terrain became difficult to navigate and felt much more rigid. It didn't ""flow"". Rivers were dead straight, cliff-sided and always divided biomes. I could be wrong, but I think this is when devs also added biome blending. This on its own wasn't bad except they also added fog and biome effects. The fog was everywhere, in my house, outside my house, underground, just everywhere. It was ugly and unnecessary. It was like they turned the atmosphere dial past 10 and broke it ... and left it broken. Some biomes became nearly impassable at all times of day with dust and fog in the air all the time.The devs also introduced dog hordes on day 6 in the 7 day cycle. Why? I don't know. I just knew that without warning on day 6 you would find yourself assaulted by (sometimes) 20+ dogs, usually being mauled to death if ill-equipped.Speaking of ill-equipped, the devs also introduced item quality into this build... and the much-maligned forge-gate, Forge Ahead. Great concepts, but hamfisted implementations. The game became tedious in the first week or so. Your choice of play style was taken from you. You now HAD to survive by looting, because unless you found Forge Ahead, you couldn't do anything. You couldn't even replace your supercrap stone tools with supercrap metal tools that broke almost as quickly. You HAD to go into caves to find randomly allocated ores. You HAD to do all of this with utterly crap tools and equipment before ridiculously oversized dog hordes found you. The game became 6 days to die and the rollercoaster sank lower with every hour I played. I devoted significantly fewer hours to A11, but I did get back into MP just before A12 came out.Speaking of A12...The devs introduced a great sounding RGEN3. A poorly working RGEN3. Biomes became dictated by height and rivers vanished. Most of the world is desert (which is now THE place to be) and everywhere else is full of bears. In my first few spawns on literally THE easiest, most bludgy settings that still involved zombies I died in under 2 minutes. Most times involved getting eaten by a bear that I spawned next to, the other one that sticks out to me was spawning in the middle of a city and getting eaten by dogs as soon as I had left my ""safe"" bubble. I then turned off zombies and found the game to be marvellously enjoyable. I still had bears everywhere to worry about, but the sheer number of game-limiting recipe gates didn't bother me. The fact that I now had to grind for 2 in-game weeks to even find Forge Ahead or another recipe for anything/everything remotely useful wasn't such a bad thing. The paucity of biomes other than desert is thoroughly disappointing though. The rapidity with which heighmaps change can render entire biomes (like plains) mere metres thick before the next biome up (forest) appears and then disappears into pine forest and snowy pine forest. The game world is a mere shadow of its former A9/10 self. I am pleased to say, however, that the devs have tweaked the item quality system and you're now endowed with less-crap crap tools at the start. I hear you can still get eaten by dogs on day 6 though. Unfortunately, in truth, I've become so disillusioned with this game that I'm yet to make it to day 6 in A12. It just isn't fun to play now.Also, my minibike keeps vanishing when I open/close the chassis for the 2nd time. That really annoys me, given the amount of resources one must expend in order to craft it in a vast, sparse and depressingly depressing desert.Yes, the rollercoaster is going down and picking up speed.The devs have also heralded further un-fun-en-ing (unfunnening?) with the announcement of their intent to remove the game's core crafting grid mechanic and replace it with a list based crafting menu thingy that sounds like shattered dreams and sweaty, sleepless nights (not the good kind).And so I must say with much regret and a stabbing feeling where my heart was... I do not currently recommend this game.A13 UpdateMany things have been fixed, and many things have changed.The most noticeable is that the world has multiple biomes again and they're expansive. As for gameplay? You're extra slow, the hunger and drink bars are gone and have been replaced with a VERY brief popup of percentage remaining and you get chills and cold and the like.Everything must now be harvested.Zombies don't die like they used to, they stumble around and soak up excess ammo because it's hard to know if they're dead or not. They suffer some stagger and knockback but generally only with the 2nd or 3rd hit, so you usually get hurt in melee.The devs were correct in saying this plays like a completely different game - a worse game. I have to stand by my red review. This game is still a shadow of its former self, A9/10. Speaking of which, if A9/10 was released as a standalone I'd buy it and I'd tell everyone else to buy it too. A13? Not worth it guys.  I'm deleting it and if I could I'd ask for a refund.			"

								7 Days to Die is a Zombie Survival, Voxel Based Game. Do not let the trailer on the steam store page turn you off, it is extremely outdated, atleast more than two years ago. The game has changed drastically. This game started out as a voxel based, blocky, survival hode crafting game. It has turned into a voxel based, randomly generated, smooth terrained, amazing visuals, and overall VERY fun and hardcore game. (You can choose between Random Gen Map & Premade Navezgane)UI: 7/10 (Relatively easy to understand)Graphics: 7/10Animations: 6/10 (First person is fine, third person needs work)Crafting: 9.6/10 (Fun and engaging)Singleplayer: 7.9/10 (You don't NEED friends, but they are always fun)Multiplayer: 8.4/10 (The game is just as fun with friends, and is more of a co-op experience rather than PvP)Content Amount: 8/10Hardcore Features: 10/10Overall Rating: 9.3/10The reason I give it an 9.3 is because not that many of the flaws in the game are because of the fact it is in Early Access. Sure, the animations and things like that will be improved, but I feel like the way the game is going now is not the way it was originally going, and this may be for the worse. I'm not saying to not buy this game, because it is truly a magnificent game. Definately worth a buy.How many hours will you get out of this game no matter who you are? Between 40-2,000Thank you for reading my review. If you would like to see more of my reviews, check out my profile.			"

								I've played this game for some time and i have to tell you: You get what you paid for.The game is not some epitome of well-madeness, but it will keep you entertained for a while.Pros:- Not too easy neither too hard to progress in the beggining.(It's easy to get started but the starting stuff is not all that useful)- Big Maps and a decent excuse for their limits(i only found a limit that you could walk past but then you'd die with radiation)- Nice control/crafting- Zombies are slow enough so that you can hit them and retreat before they hit you- The game marks the place you last died on the map so that you can get your items back- Additionally, if you die it's not difficult at all to get new basic tools/clothes/weapons, should you die too far from the respawn.-  When you crouch, you can see wether you have been detected or not by zombies.- The game is very ""realistic"", almost anything can be used as a weapon.- There are [daily(can be changed)] airdrops with useful stuff.- The game really puts you in control of the stuff you need to be in control while not letting you change at all the things you shouldn't have the ability to.Cons:-(maybe this was my pc) The game is visually monochromatic, and you will get bored after a while- The single player mode gets tiring after a while.- Zombies are really strong and will break even forged steel in one night, making it very hard to properly build your base and be safe.- Zombies are also tough, so hitting them on the head with an arrow does not kill them- There are very few weapons in-game, but it's still early access - Some items are very fragile(A wooden club -The basic blunt weapon- will break after 20 hits or so) - The temperature seems a little over the top to me(If you wear too much  on a hot area or too little on a cold area, you get penalties.)Neutral:- Creative mode(access to all items) can make the game a little too easy, but it's fun to test and you can disable it if you like.- There's the option to loose your whole backpack or just your toolbelt upon death- This is not your usual hack n' slash game, and if you don't time/aim your attacks you WILL get hit by zombies.- They have put some real effort on the realism part, to the point where carrying raw meat attracts zombies.Some tips:- Try and find one of those old decrepit houses to make your base. It's easier to fix them than to create one from the ground. Also, when you do find one, make sure you build a second floor that can only be accessed via ladders. This will protect you even if zombies break through your walls, as the vast majority of zombies cannot climb ladders.- Avoid going out at night until you have a mining helmet, a nightvision goggle or a gun with a flashlight', because the torch is really weak as a weapon and you won't see a thing without a source of light.- Gather as much wood as you can during the day and make spikes around your base. This will cripple most zombies, making it easier for you to kill them.- Make sure to get a lot of iron(can be mined from rocks) too, as you will need it to make your walls be even worth something if there's ever a horde chasing you.- Don't forget to hunt animals. The give you animal hide, animal fat, meat and bones, and all four are very useful.- Search everything and anything that is searchable. If you kill a zombie, loot the body and the destroy it to get the bones. Waste is not something that this game forgives.- Remeber to leave stuff at your base before venturing off scavenging. Your inventory is limited and you will run out of space quickly, even you don't have anything on your backpack upon leaving your base.-Always carry a source of light with you, sometimes there's not ime to make it home and you DEFINITELY don't want to get caught outside without light.

								Easily one of the best Zombie/Survival games in my opinion. If building & fortifying your base to be zombie proof didn't sell you on this game already let me go ahead & tell ya that that is just the tip of the iceberg. With so many different features in this game there is never a dull moment. Between the walking zombies, running zombies, red moon zombies, dogs, bears, bees & lets not forget the players. There is a thousand & one things out there trying to kill you... So ya best keep checking your back because it's not safe. Unfortunately you are going to need some supplies if you're going to survive the horde that comes a knocking every seventh night. So keep mining & looting them abandon buildings and maybe juuust maybe you might feel safe within that little tiny base of yours presuming you know how to build & fortify like a boss!			"

								This is my first time and possibly only time I will every write a review for a game. 7 Days to Die is my favorite game of all time. It has everything. Action, horror, FPS, crafting, a fully destructible world. The only feature lacking in the game is PVP which I am not a fan of anyways. It is very fun playing solo and even more fun playing co-op. The game is constantly being updated and the devs are very receptive to player input and regularly provide previews of upcoming update content. I think everyone should give this game a real chance. I admit I am a fan boy. But if you play this game for a few hours at least, I promise you will also become a fan boy too. I bought it a couple years ago during a summer sale. Best $12 I have ever spent. Let's support this game and genre. Go buy it. See ya in the apocalypse!			"

								It's easy to dismiss this game as another zombie game in a horde of zombie games, or another Minecraft clone, however, this game takes the Minecraft formula and replaces it with something a bit more intense.  The graphic system has come a long way since the alpha video shown on the store page, and with a group of friends, this game is tons of fun building a secure base, forraging for food and supplies, and raiding bombed out cities.  I really can't wait to see how the final game is going to turn out.  The devs have done a great job adding content and quickly squishing the more severe bugs as they come out.			"

								After few tries i decided that i need to build a fort. With a ditch around it. So i had to dig a ditch... I made a lot of dynamite, positioned it where ditch had to be and detonated it. It took me whole in-game day to kill all the zombies that i lured with that explosion.After i built my fortress in desert biome, with deep ditch and spikes inside, with two outer walls and reinforced cement building in the middle. I thought i am now immortal in this game.I did hear some zombies though... Constantly somewhere... Oh well, all the walls are allright so this zombie must be stuck somewhere.It took me almost a week to finally understand where the hell this zombie is. Unfortunately it was not just one zombie, and they were not stuck. They have digged away my mountain and this fortress of mine fell apart on itself with everything i had and killed me. When i returned there was a huge pit with zombies left...All this building all these resources are now gone... And i have to start from scratch. I was so proud of them though (zombies).Best game there is. Shooter, slasher, FPS, building game, simulator, you name it. I had never had any other game that ""drew me in to play"" like this one does.P.S. I did not build this fortress alone though. I have built it on my private server with my wife. Surprisingly i never thought my wife could enjoy zombie slasher. She does though. And she does it extremely well for an amateur. So i guess you could try offering this game to your girlfriends, wives or female collegues too.			"

								7DtD is a work in progress, it's true. And, as such, it still has some bugs, though not that many in my limited experience. And the rumors are true: it's an ugly game, mostly. I'm not here to give an in-depth review, however, I'm here to tell you why I like this game and why you should give it a chance.To give you just a taste, imagine if you combined Minecraft with DayZ and got rid of the terrible community of snarks, hackers, and griefers (DayZ players, you know what I mean), all while fixing the zombies so that they not only work, but work smart instead of hard. Yes, at times I can't help feeling that the same people who did the art for Killing Floor had something to do with this gem, but think of 7DtD as the one who can't coast on looks alone who instead tries hard to bring something to the table besides inane meteorological commentary. If 7DtD has anything, it's brainzzz... No, I'm serious, it's a smart game with smartly done zombies.Imagine playing minecraft in a world without the blocky style (or the odd beauty that accompanies it at times), where instead of laughing at vanilla zombies you run and sneak and generally fear for your life because they are ""coming to get you, Barbara..."" (sorry, I had to... the flying turtles made me). Imagine a world where you choose between Romero or 28 style zed, where said zed can smell if you're carrying  some rabbit or deer meat on your person, where zombo can hear you searching that house because you broke a window to get in and then had to break into a fortified area to get at the safe you spied between the boards over the doorway, where the walking dead might be easy one on one, but damning and deadly should you not stay on top of your game and get cornered by a horde, where you never know what the game is going to throw at you next because although some things remain predictable, those things seem refreshingly logical and limited. You take down an infected nurse and find some medical supplies. You search a car and find some auto parts. Medicines are where you'd expect them. Guns are where you'd expect them. Food and supplies are pretty much where you'd expect them. You're not going to find a wolf carrying a sack of gold or a rat carrying bits of materials for you to use in crafting. Sometimes, a town will have a pharmacy and be full of rare medical supplies. Sometimes, a town will have a weapons supplier that has nothing left on its shelves. Sometimes you'll stumble into a snowy region or a fallout zone and find some unusual things. Sometimes you'll feel the game is unfair, but it's up to you to set your boundaries because, like Minecraft, you can set the game to creative and enable cheats if that's the way you want to play it. Run from those zombies, or fly, the choice is up to you. Either way, I've solidly enjoyed my brief time in this game and I urge you to consider not skipping it even though you may feel that you've killed all the zombies you could want to kill in one lifetime.  My one qualifier on my recommendation is that you should factor into your decision whether you will be able to play this game with friends because, like Minecraft, it's perhaps most fun when it's done with people you care about and enjoy spending time with. Thanks for reading. Hope to see you in game soon.			"

								As of late 2014 and up I hereby proclaim this a sucessful Early Access Title!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Long have I waited to play a proper zombie survival and this game has filled my ever longing need for a zombie base defence type game.When playing this game I have went through 5 major stages so far:1. ♥♥♥♥ yeah! My gravel hut is amazing!2. R.I.P. gravel hut3. Alright, I have just built a proper wooden structure with a spike defence that stops them from immediately ruining my base. Exellent!4. Grind it up, because my next base is made out of reinforced concrete and has a decent spike defence, which will prove to be nearly impenetrable.5. Now time to sit back and watch my success unfold before my eyes when hordes of zombies fall before me without having to lift a finger.This game will reward your knowledge of the game and challenge you by exploiting your weaknesses.Then there is multiplayer, which I can assume is a significant raise in difficulty to counter player inteligence.Anyways, thanks for reading my not very entertaining, funny, or in-depth review of the game.

								I bought 7 days to die for myself and a friend in a Post-Final exams splurge.Accidentially pulled a 24-hour gaming session. Barely survived zombies on day 14 tunneling underneath our base, forcing us to go out into the night. It's almost needless to say that this game has captured my attention and my heart.tl;dr I wholeheartedly recommend this game, even though it is in alpha.This is my list of pros and cons, as of 5/12/16:PROS Amazingly immersive gameplay. Incredible diversity of crafting options. Scavenging feels intense and exciting. Power-gathering materials is immensely rewarding and oddly calming. Good balance between realistic and simple mechanics for  Vast options for difficulty settings, not just in terms of combat, but also regarding death penalties, loot rarity, Length of daylight, in-game time compared to real life time settings, and much more. You'll never feel that this game is ""too easy"".CONS /STACK OVERLOAD /STACK OVERLOAD EXCEPTION DOGS, MAN. If you get an unlucky spawn and find yourself being chased by dogs before you have at least a level 100 bow, you're dead. Melee combat needs tweaking for hit detection and range, ESPECIALLY on multiplayer. Ranged weapon aimpoints need adjustment (not aligning with weapon). Rare Glitch: Corpses disappearing immediately after killing zombies. Occasionally, Enemy Pathing leads them to eitirely avoid  "

								I. Love. This. Game.After playing loads and loads of minecraft, and loving it, I began to feel something was missing. This is actually the game I wanted. Gather, build, hunt, survive. Lots of fun, but I wanted more. Voxels, zombies, and minibikes? Now we're talking! So what more could a guy ask for? Actually, I would ask for a couple things: - Blueprints or largely increased drop rates for wrenches and calipers. Its no fun depending on RNG for the necessary tech progression. - Collision detection cleanup/tweaking. Zombies can be clubbed or shot in the face through doors if they are crawling up against them. Which my survivor appreciates, but I do not. Also, crawling zombies may rapidly change elevation if they are crawling near traps or other raised surfaces. Makes it real tough to put an arrow in their dome that way. - I wouldn't mind a few more varieties of enemy, especially in the ranged and flying departments. Flying zombie things sound ♥♥♥♥ing horrifying, but once you've got an impermeable cement bunker up and a full arsenal of weapons/ammo, there's not much of a challenge left with regards to the horde events.I'm sure there are other things as well, but minor enough that I can't recall offhand.I still give it a 9.5/10. If you like minecraft but also enjoy putting crossbow bolts into zombie skulls, then this is the game for you!			"

								Out of all the early access games out there on steam today, I'd say this one is the best by far. It truly is a diamond in the rough. Normally upon purchasing an early access game I give up on it after 10 hours of gameplay because there simply isn't anything left to do but in this game the possibilities are endless. That being said, this game is quite challenging and I've heard of many people ragequitting before giving it a real chance. The learning curve in this game is pretty difficult to overcome but once you do everything comes together and it becomes SO much fun. You can build a base, secure it against zombies and other players. You can go exploring and find countless cities and structures to loot and you'll always find new stuff. The most fun to be had in my opinion though is raiding other player bases. It truly is a challenge finding people's land claim blocks and destroying them so that you can access their loot chests, it adds an element of thought that no game like this has done.The zombies in this game are unique as well, in my opinion. They are extremely committed to finding you, knocking down your defences and munching on your brains. At one point a horde actually smashed through an entire mountain to get at me, these zombies offer a true sense of fear and intensity that others simply do not. That being said, it is truly rewarding to build up a base and fortify it to the point that every night when the hordes come a knocking you can stand your ground and wipe them out.If you are  looking for a zombie survival game this is definitely the one to go with, it offers countless hours of gameplay, its crafting system is very in depth and seemingly endless and new items/features are constantly being added. This is the only early access game that I truly have faith in right now, and the way it's going right now it seems it will just get better and better. Great job by the devs, keep up the good work guys!Current rating: 9/10			"

								Not enough of this is usually said about games that are actually doing OK, so here's one. Keep it up Pimps! :)I played the game years ago in its earliest builds; it was a train wreck. For all the complaints the game gets now, people would have had a stroke if they had played it back then! Zombies spawned on your head and blocks were these wavy things that never lined up the way you wanted them to, giving the entire game a sort-of Tim Burton feel, cars blew up if zombies walked on them and you could find a sniper rifle within the first 5 minutes of playing at times.Years later, you'd be amazed at how much progress this game has made, especially to others in the genre. This is my ""go to"" game when comparing others I play to it and I don't think people fully appreciate everything this game brings with it, to the table.For one, the graphics are good. Not great, but definitely not bad, especially for a non-AAA title. You could basically run this game on a potato (like I initially did) and still get a great gaming experience out of it. The crafting is a step above most and/or has kept up with what people expect it to be and has definitely been made better over the years. I somewhat recall the earlier crafting to be a bit of a mess. When they ""dumbed-down"" the recipes to incorporate bulk items such as generic ""wood"" instead of half a dozen versions of wood, it felt like crafting became a lot more intuitive.Terraforming. This game has it, many do not. There may be lots of titles out there, but a lot lack the basic idea of manipulating the ground to do as you like; dig, pile, etc. A lot of games that are out lately do not have this simple feature, which is a defining point in the game for a lot of players. Just keep in mind that everything you walk on, in every random world you generate, can be dug down, through and around... and not just by the players.Block physics. Combined with the above. If you've played this game long enough, it comes as second nature... until you try another game. You'd be amazed at how much feels as though it is lacking in games that don't have these fully implemented physics.Atmosphere, atmosphere and atmosphere! From the music at the title, to the wind-swept pine forests on mountaintops. This game oozes atmosphere out of every pixel. The zombie models might not be as varied as some major titles, but when you're getting your face gnawed off after you step through a broken window of a book store, you'd be hard pressed to complain about the variety of the zombie eating your face off that second! The sheer ""Oh SH**!"" moments like those, make this game something you can't easily forget.Mod-ability is a major key to the game as well. With access to the game's files, you can change many of the game's features to fit your play style. For every update they make that you may not like, just go into the right file and change the value back to something you prefer. This makes many negative features of updates people may not agree with, more bearable as you can simply change them back to something more agreeable.Finally, this game has a reason to it. It has a driving purpose for you to play it. It has a reason you NEED to make sure your base is  up to snuff. It has a reason to make sure you have researched the recipes you need. It has a reason to make sure you explore the areas and learn and scavenge what you can - the 7th day hoards.You will die. When you first play the game, you will die on the 7th day. This isn't a threat or a challenge, this is just a fact. You will think you're tough and you can handle anything this game throws at you, until a few dozen ultra-aggressive, insanely fast zombies come to tear down every inch of the structure you though was unbreakable. And then, every 7th day after that, the zombies only get more difficult.This. This one feature is the one reason you will keep playing the game. Other games have some great base building features in them, but eventually, they lack a threat. 7 Days to Die has some great base building in it, but it will be along and far down the road before you can safely say, the zombies are no longer a threat. In the back of your mind, everything you add to your base will be about ""Will this survive?"" which is something many games in this genre only leave to your imagination, but never put to the test to the same degree as this one does.GET THIS GAME. Whether you have never heard of it, or own every single survival game out there, GET THIS ONE. This will be the only zombie/survival/base building game you will ever need to have in your Steam library. I just give the others in my Steam library a quick little pity smile every time I pass my mouse cursor over them to start this game up... "

								My first impression was lackluster. I expected another half-hearted pseudo-sandbox with pushover survival mechanics. My expectations were way off mark. 1) 7DtD has one of the most comprehensive crafting sysmtes I seen, even in building within the world, with many tools that provide a variety of benefits and a plethora of resources differing by biome that alter the way you manage your survival. The world is fully detructible, being able to dig and mine (with some decent physics) as well as destroying parts of the landscape (or cityscape), thrown in with many gatherable items for survival purposes.2) Survival itself is key and is directly tied into game play. Managing your hunger and thirst will determine not only how long you will live, but more nuanced features, like stamina and wellness. There are many resources available to satisfy both survival mechanics, but you have to manage them well to maximize their effectiveness, and you have to gather them without dying.3) Zombies are no joke. Even during the day time, if you're hammering on zombies with your crossbow, all it takes is for one not-so-noticeable zombie to flank you, and you're dead. Taking hits from zombies can detriment you in several ways, including bleeding, infection, and being temporarily stunned.At its stage in development, this game is already basically a fully-fledged game, and it only continues to get better with bugfixes and additional content. 10/10			"

								First of all let me state that this game is still in Alpha, not the final release, not in Beta, but Alpha. So understandably, there's still a lot more content that the developers are planning that have not yet been implemented (such as Mods, NPCs, story/plot, more types of animals, character builds/personalization, many HD models, and much more). That also means that if there are bugs, glitches or pereformance issues that you have complaints about, depending on how critical it is the developers will get to it eventually and release sub version patches (alpha 13.1, alpha 13.2, so on and so on). Now that that's out of the way let's move on.   As of V12.5 (literally days if not hours before the release of Alpha 13) after you ""create"" you're character/profile you start out in your underwear in the middle of nowhere with nothing but a bottle of water, a can of food, a torch, and ..... I forget what else, but it's not much.   You have a certain amount of time in this starting safe zone (like 5 minutes or something) to procure the materials that you need in order to create your starting survival gear/tools before the zombies start to spawn around you. Collect grass to make grass pants, collect cotton to make cloth armor, some grass, some sticks, and some rocks let you make your first stone axe, some grass and sticks make a bow, and with some feathers, sticks, and rocks/metal scraps you can make some arrows. It's not much, but it will at least allow you to defend yourself.   You can see a list of what you are able to craft as well as what materials are needed in your menu, and you can learn recipes for other more advanced items by finding recipe books. Currently your crafting qualityand skill is determined by your level, but I think when Alpha 13 is released it's being changed to a ""use it to improve it"" system. For example, the more you use/craft bows the more proficient you become with them and you can create better quality.  You can customize a lot of your settings/gameplay options when starting a game, but in a standard game the zombies walk slowly during the day and run during the night, so you'll probably want to take the oppotunity of your first day to make your basics and then find some kind of shelter to hide in for when night comes (a cabin, a cave, or even dig a hole in the groud and cover it back up from the inside). You also want to be careful about creating noise and heat (chopping down a tree, firing a gun, cooking food in a campfire) that will attract the attention of zombies.  The random generated maps are currently infinite in size and come with many different areas to explore called biomes (dessert biome, forest biome, snow, swamp, plains, etc.) and are blended together very well now, so there's not any noticable borders between them anymore.   I could go on but this getting a bit long winded alredy, so I'll just let you figure the rest out for yourselves. I highly recommend this game, and it has been a blast seeing all the changes and new content as it has developed.			"

			Apologies for the quality of the visuals in this - I'm still having serious problems recording it in a way which doesn't end up mashed. (Watch it in a tiny screen, perhaps!?		

I'm going to recommend this on the basis that I have just sat in a poorly-lit attic absolutely scared out of my wits praying that the door I had made would hold and the zombies would leave me alone - knowing that in the morning I had to go back OUT THERE and find food and some kind of cure for the disease I caught drinking dirty water because I had nothing else.YIKES.You should, however, be aware that things are getting slightly buggy. It's so good you'll forget it's alpha, and my God is it alpha. Mind you, the Zombie Breakdance of Death is almost enough to make up for that.			"

								Still in alpha, this game atm has 14 different alphas to download if the latest one don't work on your system, or if you prefer an older one. Also has an awesome discussions forum, if you have any problems with the game.A game must have enemies, and this one have zombies, dogs, bears, gravity, weather, hunger, sickness, caves, water... In an open world only your own imagination limits what you can do. Many players have devoted thousands of hours to this game, many modders constantly adds new dimentions to your gaming experience, and there are plenty of server owners who like you to join in on their worlds. I might have restarted this game 100 times, but never made it to the end. I don't want it to end! Will you survive 7 days?			"

								Best survival game I have played so far. If crafting is your thing, then this has it all. Take over a building and make it your own, or build your own stronghold. The hordes can be nasty, but that's what it's all about surviving. With the newly implemented skill system you can cater to all your needs. There simply isn't anything you can't do really. Can even find a poop in toilets. Now THAT is in depth. Highly recommended over Dayz and H1Z1. So much fun to be had. See you in game!			"

STUN, cant move, get slapped by 100 zombies, die)- Why is your food/water stats hidden away?- I'm sure there are many more that I can't remember Overview:Honestly I enjoy playing this game but my friends can't say the same.

								I've just the game and at first I wasn't immediately impressed. I was pleased by the gameplay I'd seen on YouTube but given my limited understanding and (most importantly) my one dimensional thinking, and my first 45 minutes in game were not pleasant. My buddy and I got together with someone who'd been playing a touch longer and she showed us a few things we weren't thinking to do.My buddy and I come from playing all manner of games but when it comes to survival games, DayZ is where we started REALLY getting into those hardcore kind of unforgiving games. But it is limited in what it all can do. We moved on to DayZ Epoch and even still, given everything it's capable of, we just weren't prepared for this level of construction and destruction. The sheer amount of freedom you have at building and destroying things, is mind boggling. I can safely say, my initial impressions of this game were WRONG. I love this game and I've already begun building my secret underground base. It's insane what I can do. It won't be for everyone, I know that but really, if you're into minecraft and/or DayZ, give this game a go. It really is something fresh and the devs did a great job here. The only major issues I can level at it, for the moment, is perhaps graphics but I'll take a hit in that department for wonderful gameplay and that's where this delivers. There may be other cons but this game isn't a full release yet so listing them would perhaps be negligent on my part, as given that it's an Alpha, problems are to be expected.			"

								The premise of this game results in a great co-op, team player event. While the game can be soloed the real fun comes when you play with a group of friends. The mini server approach means you can have your own server and allow PVP between a group of players that you trust to not try to ruin the game for others. Or you can have your small group play PVE and try to survive in a world gone mad. The game is a blast, find a group and have some fun.			"

								I wish there was a ""possibly"" option for whether I recommend this game.In a way I love (or loved) it as you can see from the amount of hours I've played, but had I bought it now with the current version, that would not be the case.I played on a dedicated server with friends I know well from other games (in a multigame guild with them) and at first we loved it. But the MAIN problem we had, time and time again was the hordes not working,  We spent ages building a huge outpost with walkways etc to kill the zombies from, only for none to turn up. On the 7th (or multiple of) nights, we would be eagerly awaiting them and nothing,  Very occasionally they did turn up and it was great fun, but I'm talking one night in 100.Forum post after forum post has complained about the hordes. A game like this, the hordes are the main thing, if they dont work, the rest of the game isn't really worth playing, unless you enjoy building huge bases just to look at.One by one my friends stopped playing, every single one of them stating the same reason, the lack of hordes/zombies to fight.It ended up with just 3 of us paying for a server, we stuck with it though to A15 but we have now decided to stop paying and play another game and wait until they have finished messing about (and I mean messing about) and we know what sort of game we end up with, then we shall decide whether to resurect our server or move on.It's sad, as this is one of the games I have loved more than any other, but it seems like the devs are making it up as they are going along, concerntrating on things that while great, don't get around the simple problem that on a zombie survival game, if we dont have zombies that work properly, hordes turning up to give us a challenge, then the rest, while nice, is pretty pointless.Fix the hordes so the game is fun, then concentrate on the rest.They seem to take 2 steps forward then 3 steps back.  One of the things they have fixed is that if you are on a multiplayer server, hordes now turn up for all players, but I use the term horde loosely. When I used to play, IF the horde turned up, it was a real horde, non stop for ages, what felt like tons of zombies. Now you get something like 8 zombies per player turn up.The devs seem to have spent a lot of time with a new type of zombie that takes a lot more of your computer resources, when to be honest, I think most people (myself included) were perfectly happy with the original zombies like the hawian Tshirt guy etc, and for every person that is impressed by the new zombie, I expect theres around 5 that wish they had concentrated on fixing the game instead.There's threads such as https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?53991-Does-anyone-else-miss-the-old-hordes&highlight=hordewhich show I'm not alone with this train of thought.When I first played, we had different meats, you might have to hunt boar to make a certain recipie, you might have to hunt deer. Now you have generic meat. You used to have a forge that felt like you were using a forge when crafting, now it feels more like you are using a piece of software.I really really want to love this game again, but all I and my friends want to do is build good bases and have hordes of zombies attack and try to smash their way through, that used to happen sometimes, it now doesn't seem to happen at all.With the LONG release times between updates, and each update bringing in fluff that while a few people might like, it doesn't fix the actual game play, I fear for it's future.We were told they hope to go gold by the end of the year (but as I said, they do seem to be making it up as they go along), if this is so, I cant see many more updates coming first and the game is still severly broken. I really really wish they would fix the core game before concentraiting on things like zip lines etc.The devs release a Q&A or a game play vid almost every week now, I don't know why. He reads a question, mumbles ""maybe"" and moves on to the next one.You only have to go to the official forum under https://7daystodie.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?4-News-amp-Announcements to see how many people have given up.Look at the comments for Alpha 14.Various patches up to 14.6, most of them with pages of our responces 14.5 on 7th April 2016 had 84 pages of replies, just 3 weeks later 14.6 dropped and had 49 pages of replies.And on 6th October Alpha 15 dropped and had 76 pages of replies.Then on 7th Dec Alpha 15.1 dropped,  6 weeks later we have just 7 pages of replies and one of those pages is a discussion on grammer rather than the game.That shows me that many people like myself have simply given up on it for now.It could have been one of the best survival games ever, but in my opinion they have gone in a direction that is bewildering to many people that used to adore this game, Sure it's still got its fans, sure I've got my moneys worth many times over, but I'm talking about what the game is like now, not when I used to enjoy it, and sadly it is not the game it once was.Many of us stuck with it even though things like the hordes never did work properly as we could see the potential. But with every release it feels more and more like just another game and is loosing the things that to me, made it special.I really hope that in months to come, I'm writing another review where I can say that they ended up with a superb game that I enyoy, but sadly, from what I keep reading, I doubt that will be the case,			"

								This game is so awesome!!!! It has crafting, it has survival, it has PVP and PVE. It has something for everyone. The zombies are great and varied. I love the crafting, I love gathering. You have to gather to get the mats to craft your items. The items that you make will gain level as you get better at making them and cause more damage or do a better job!  I have lost hours playing this game because it totally sucks you into the world. The world itself its so beautiful, the grasslands (maple and pine forests) are so lush and green with beautiful landscape. The other places (desert, wastelands, plains, snow biom and hub cities) are harsh and unforgiving places with extreme weather which are more diffucult to survive in for different reasons. With alpha 15 you get to grow all new crops and even visit traders to sell items and buy things that are more difficult to find or craft. I have been playing this game for a while now and I have to say with each new alpha there are so many new ""toys"" to play with. We have bought four copies of this game for our house, also my brother has four copies in his house so we can all game together, enjoying gaming for hours on end as a family.I am a disabled mother of two girls, I am unable to run around and play outside games with them. We play this game as a family, where I am able to do all the things everyone else can, I can run and I can protect my family from the evil living dead!Thank you so much to the Funpimps for making this game, I love it so much and the freedom it has given me. I have had so many hours of fun with my kids and husband  thanks to you guys for all your hard work!P.s I love to watch joel and pokketninja doing the lets play's streamed from twitch!

								I truly enjoy this game. Only downside to this game it is a little hard to play alone. I dont play alone now but when i first started an trying to learn the game I felt like i wasnt able to learn bc i was dying ever five mins from other players. so if you get this game start on a easy server with little to no ppl.Now also prepare to spend alot of time on this game, it takes a long time to get everything going for you. I know once you learn the game, it wont take as long to do things because you'll know what to do an where to find stuff. HIDE YOUR STUFF WELL! I cant say that enough, now while i have robbed ppls bases when they were no longer online i do know the feeling when you log on an all your stuff is missing. It sucks. So hide it. Behind a wall or floor or be sure to landclaim the crap out of your place. bc trust me they will get in. landclaim or not. <-- hide those as well!Waiting on alpha 11 atm, so by the time you read this my thoughts on some of the game have been fixed or are no longer a problem. Please please please keep in mind this is an alpha game. that means its not finished so you will find things the glitch out. thats norm for a Alpha Game! Its an open world, so pvp is going to happen. doesnt mean every person will kill you but most will. I just killed my first person the other day. not much for pvp. an the pve servers still have ppl who pvp. its just a game.. get over it. So as nice as someone sound keep in mind they might kill you an take your stuff. Not all but most.I recommend you an a friend to play an start this game together, its more fun this way. also maybe watch some starting out video on youtube. they can help. Wiki helps too. Not every server is right for you, so you could start on one server an have a nice set up, but then you find one thats evern better. look at the bright side of starting over. you can fix what you messed up on your last house to look even cooler. Sorry kinda ranting. But this game is really fun. just have to give it time to learn how to play an then your set.  "

								My friend and me like to play zombies/survival/crafting games, and I gotta say that when I bought 2 copies of this game I wasn't expecting much, barely more than one of these games we sometimes buy and are bored of after a few days. Well I can tell you I was wrong.We started playing 7D2D on november 2014, the game was then on alpha 9 and it was already a great gaming experience, at the time where I'm writing this review the game is on alpha 12.4 and received huge improvements which make it even more enjoyable. The game is broadly very good, the crafting system is solid, scavenging and fighting for your survival is hard, but often rewarding and the feeling of accomplishment when you finally manage to have good tools/weapons and a tough fortress is simply pleasurable. I'm not very picky when it comes to talk about graphics so I'll subjectively say that, even tho it'll never overshadow engines like the CryEngine for instance, 7D2D is not an ugly game at all, I even happen to find the game really beautiful sometimes, mostly when I'm going through woods or clearings.There are of course some flaws and bugs, most of them appearing after every major update, but the devs often fix them very quickly. Talking about the devs, they are very attentive to feedbacks and keep the communication with the community really open, which obviously leads to faster bug fixes and advancement through the updates.My friend and I are coming back on the game every major update to try all the new features, items and other stuff, that makes it never getting boring. For instance, the major addition of alpha 12 is a craftable minibike, it makes the game so different once you managed to get one. We got one each and are having a hell load of fun with it. Being so mobile is truly enjoyable and driving over zombzombs (or innocent piggies and bunnies >.>) is even more.If you like zombie survival and crafting games then I highly recommand you to give it a shot, 7D2D is definitely worth its price, even as a pre-release game.

								TL/DR at the bottom.***Re-edited*** 01/12/17What do you get when you buy this game in 2017? Yeah, you still get a game that is in early alpha. Or more like not-so-early alpha. You still get to feel the love the devs have for the game as they add more content. Considering that the beta phase is when all the bugs will get crushed, and that anything related to multiplayer will be fixed at that point, one might not have the best of multiplayer experiences when playing on a server in the current state of things. But BOY is the coop/single player game fun or what! This last alpha version, the 15th (version 15,1 currently) is by far the one with the best challenge. The zombies are far from perfect yet but if you consider their limitations and give them a chance instead of trying to ""game the AI"", this is the first version of the game where the challenge is more about the zombies and less about grinding towards end-game (there was no end game before anyway).The best new feature imo is that the zombie hordes that show up every 7 days scale up as you play. The best feature overall is that the game is more and more moddable. The community asked for many options to be moddable when they were not and the devs made it happen. With all the mods out there it's hard to get tired of this game, even after thousands of hours... and I should know something about it as I've played a couple hours myself :)Next version of the game brings long-awaited electricity and ziplines to the game. What more could you want?***Edited*** 01/02/16What do you get when you buy this game in 2016? You get developpers that released a patch on December the 24th around 8pm EST, that's what! These guys are INSANELY dedicated to their game, it's unbelievable. You get a game that has more average players online now than at about any other moment since its alpha release, meaning that the health of the player population is very good and growing. And you get to pat yourself on the back because you've just bought yourself the quintessential zombie survival game available on Steam (and lost a fair chunk of this coming year to potential sleepless nights in the process). You've been warned.***End of Edit***What do you get when you buy this game? Well, if you already know that its a sandbox voxel-based tower-defense inspired rpg survival first person shooter.... damn that's a mouthful right there. So, what do you get? The bestest game ever made (that is still currently in Alpha), that's what!I never liked Minecraft. I started hating it after some years. I did like DayZ, played a bit but got bored because the maps were too big/empty. I guess I didn't play on the right servers. Then a friend of mine gave me 7 Days. I would have never bought it. No way. That was back during Alpha 9. I had nothing planned that Saturday so I fired up the game. Started digging down with a friend to make an underground base. He was teaching me stuff about the recipes and what not as I was digging. Then he left and I kept on digging a little bit more. And a little more. Then I figured I should go put the trash out since it was already 4am Monday morning... The trash never made it to the street that week. But my base got big, real big! I had like 20 rooms in it, 19 of which were decoys, and I had.... lots of sadness when the server got reset. Little did I know, a game in Alpha stage is often reset... Wow, ok. Now I know what an alpha is. That **** isn't for me. No way. Or so I thought. Then I told myself that if I had been raided by other players and lost everything it wouldn't have been any different. I love PvP so I can respect that. Then I fired up the game. I didn't have much planned that week. I started digging down with a friend and... another friend bought the game out of nowhere and joined the server we were on. So we dug more. But this time it made no sense to build a palace underground, all I wanted was some PvP resources to make ammos and go shoot people. Then one day I heard the sound of thunder! I mean auger! the sweet, sweet sound of fast-paced destruction! I needed to get me one of these!!!! Then the server got reset.Wow, ok. Now I really know what an alpha is. **** that!!!! Then I read the patch notes. I must have shouted out loud when I read them. It was filled with godly bits of pure joy. I could feel the love the devs had for the game. And the lack of sleep too. This game was gonna be the bestest ever made. That was back when Alpha 10 came out. So I fired up the game. This time I knew the resets would be plentiful but I didn't care, I just wanted to kill as many people as I could before the reset. So I started looking for a server with the exact set of rules I wanted and from those few that had them, some had bad admins, some had too low pop (that would include the one that a friend of mine started and that we tried to get more people into) and others had rules close to what I wanted but not exactly it. So I settled for one of them because having good admins that create a good atmosphere with little to no hackers is essential. And then I had a boatload of fun. Until one thing came out in one of the hotfix: a container that could be locked and couldn't get unlocked by the enemy players, forcing them to destroy or avoid it. No more raiding after that point since everyone would hide their stuff in those and we were not allowed to destroy stuff senselessly.Wow, ok, no more raiding, I guess Christmas is coming in 2-3 weeks anyway, I've played too many hours already, I got others games that are being neglected. I shall take a break. Then the devs asked for people to register if they were interested in being VIP testers. Hmmm... Maybe I could shorten the duration of my break and lend them a hand, this game has brought out the tester in me I think. Why not? So I became a VIP tester. For a while, **** ***** ** ******** ** ***** *******. And then ****** ** ****** * **** *** ******. The last month before the patch we ****** ****** ** ******* ** ********. It was ridiculous. Becoming a VIP tester was one of the best idea I've had in a while.While I was a tester I got to see from (just a tiny bit) closer how the devs work, well at least the QA manager. These guys must all have 2 hearts each cause they pour at least one of them daily into this game. This game must be sucking the living life out of them cause they barely sleep. And I'm sure they are enjoying every second of it. By enjoying I mean the sort of joy one gets while eating ramen noodles at 4am because they really really wanna pump out the next patch before going to sleep and they didn't go to the grocery store (who am I kiding, they didn't get them to deliver) in the past week (or was it 2 weeks?).During the 3 months we tested, I believe more than 700 bugs were (introduced and) fixed, while also switching to Unity 5. Using the word workhorses would just be an insult at this point. These guys are pure dedication and passion.TL/DR: This is not finished. Its not even close to getting in beta. Its the best alpha game ever made (hum, what about Star Citizen you ask?.... well....) that isn't kickstarted with 40M+ $$. If you like any of these words: sandbox voxel-based tower-defense inspired rpg survival first-person shooter.... or most importantly the word ZOMBIE, then by all mean, get this game!P.S.: No, H1Z1 is not as good. Neither is Rust. Even if Rust had a baby with H1Z1, on steroids.... just no.			"

								HERE'S MY UPDATED REVIEW! POSTED APRIL 6TH 2015My first review was quite positive and guess what.. It's still positive, perhaps even more-so than before. I have played every release since the very first one before this game ever hit steam so I've really had a chance to see this game grow. And it sure as hell IS growing!Let's keep this short and sweet. PROS:-A very solid voxel game (IMO)-Great Graphics (for a voxel game)-Good sound-Good controls-Good gameplay, crafting, looting, building, mining. It's all very nice.-Beautiful randomly generated worlds complete with ruined towns and even cities!-Wonderful smooth voxel terrain! As functional as that of Minecraft but much prettier!-Pretty damn polished for an Alpha!! Like really! -Great development team! These guys are serious, skilled and well funded!CONS:-It's an alpha so there's still some small glitches but honestly I haven't experienced any glitches in a long time.-Not enough different kinds of zombies!!! (I'm sure they're gonna add more though)-Doesn't work well on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computers. (Oh well, not a problem for me :P)-Building with certain materials has become a bit cumbersome and overdone. It's still ok though.-It's built on Unity. (I just hate unity, but these guys HAVE pulled it off so well I didn't even know this game was made with unity until like a month ago LoL)THINGS I REALLY WANNA SEE ADDED:-More freakin zombies!! Gettin tired of seeing that same fat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with his ugly♥♥♥♥♥hawaian shirt!-FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!! I WOULD PAY $20+ FOR THIS FEATURE ALONE!!-VEHICLES!!!!!!!! (I know they're coming soon, I'm just impatient!)PS I have seen several video's lately bashing early access games, and rightly so! There is a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥out there on EA.However I keep seeing 7 Days to Die kinda toted in the background and grouped in with all those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ never finished EA ""games"" which I think is an absolute travesty!The Fun Pimps have proven themselves several times and I think they've earned a little freakin grace on our parts! Hell, even If they never release another update I'd still say this is a great game EASILY worth the 25ish bucks they ask for it AS IS! It even puts some ""finished"" games to shame. cough..starforge...  :PWell that wasn't short and sweet at all, rather long and rambling...Oh well...			"

								Good game BUT.. I don't like the following formula being used by indie game devs:-make part of a game-sell it on steam as early access-make enough cash to keep gradually updating-delay development in order to make console versions of the unfinished game-start selling multiple versions of an unfinished game -continue to collect cash on the promise of one day actually delivering the product you're selling-Not be held accountable for ever completing the product you've been selling for years in multiple unfinished forms.

								This game is your usual Zombie Survival with more focus on survival rather than collecting items and killing other players which, lets face it, H1Z1, Infestation and DayZ are basically just open world PvP that happens to have zombies roaming around.  I'd recommend this for somebody who enjoyed the PvE side of those games more so than the PvP side of them.			"

								This game really puts into practice so well the concept of survival, scavenging, crafting and buildling - I really recommend it if you like this. Think about fallout 3 with zombies, hunting, and building/renovating a place of your own. Set in a post-apocalyptic landscape, the constructions players can set up are equally representative of a post-apocalyptic environment.If you heard of project zomboid, well if you ask me this is exactly that but better; the annoying needs are removed, the game plays fluently, the environment is already less buggy, and your freedom is more obvious. The crafting system is worked out very well as well: the game lists everything you can make with your inventory. When you choose something, it shows the shape but not the materials. Fill in the correct materials and you now know the recipe; so no need to fill it in yourself next time: just click what you want to craft (like in terraria). No need for a wiki indeed - great!			"

								Pro: It's pretty much the greatest open world zombie game ever made, honestly. If you like those Minecraft/Terraria games but wish they were set in a George Romero movie, then this is your game. In my opinion it's also way more fun than the current generation of zombie MMOs as well (I'm looking at you, H1Z1 and Day Z). So this is like the best of those two groups of games mashed together.Con: The development team moves at an absolutely glacial pace. This game was kickstarted like 4 or 5 years ago, and it's still in ""alpha"" (even though it's been released for PS4 and Xbox One). The updates are few and far between, and glitches from almost half a decade ago are still present in its current (14.6? 14.7? I dunno) build. The devs made a really fun game, but they don't update it nearly enough. Five years of an alpha build is pretty laughable, and an example of why some people don't like early access. Maybe it will enter beta before I enter a retirement home.If you can accept the game as it is, and deal with the fact that every now and then an update is gonna come out that makes you start over then I honestly can't reccomend it enough.

Early Access Review
								I've never played a better early access game than this one, It has so much potential and is definitely worth the $25. I would recommend 7 Days to Die to anyone that enjoys open world survival games.Over the 85 hours I've played this game I have never come accross a bug or glitch, this has surprised me tremendously and continues to impress myself and friends. This game has a lot to it and continues to add more things to occupy the community and multiplayer servers, however, after you make your perfect base, have immense amounts of food and water etc it can become boring and repetitive at times. I do believe that as the game develops many more things will be added and that feeling will be no more. So my personal thoughts on why I would recommend this game-Updates: The Devs are frequently updating this game.Bugs: Hardly found and when they are they are quickly removed. Community/Servers: Many friendly people, easy to team up with and assist others.Crafting: Crafting is one of the many things that make this game impressive and enjoyable, the crafting system is unique and has various amounts of recipes.Would I discourage you to get this game? No not at all. This game personally has definitely earned its place on my favourites list. However please be aware that is game is early access and you may come accross bugs, errors or other things that may effect your gameplay but if your okay with that go ahead and buy it. You won't regret it.			"

								I have fallen in love with this game. I like the skill tree for leveling. Its not nearly as grindy as rust is presently. Going solo is quite hard but can be done, But you can also play with your friends. You can adjust this game to anyskill level you prefer so it is always a challenge for you. It also has awsome building mechanics, I love the fact that you can dig underground to mine, build a base or a tunnel. You can upgrade your buildings to try and withstand the hoard. The hoard comes every seven days. They get harder every time. This gives this game its unique survival aspect. I would say that this game was a good buy for me. I hope you find it as enjoyable as I have.			"

  --ALPHA 12 REVIEW-- 7 Days to Die is an Epic crafting, open world zombie survival game that has a lot to offer from huge cities to endless deserts and forrests and even up to high snowy mountains. --PROS--  1. EVERYTHING IS DESTROYABLE! And i mean it. All of the buildings, roads, mountains and trees. 2. Physics. This ain't nothing like Minecraft where you can build a house ontop of a 10 meters 1x1 block tall stack of blocks. You need to add support pillars in order for the building to stay up. If you don't you're dead if the structure collapses on you.3. Crafting. You can make a lot of different weapons, tools, traps, mines and other items.4. Map is endless. + You can find a lot of different and cool cities, towns, lone houses and camps on the way that hold supplies.5. Zombies! Many kind of zombies; from fat slow ones to hot nurses.6. Wildlife. Deers, rabbits, pigs, bears, dogs and giant hornets!7. Sound quality is quite good to be honest, i like it.8. Survival all in all. It is quite hard to survive if you are playing on one of the hard difficulties. (There are 6 difficulty levels). You need to gather food and water to survive. And let us not forget medicine. 9. Combat is not really that great but you can manage it. 10. PvE and PvP! 11. At Every 7th night a lot of zombies will come in large numbers and try to kill you. And i mean it..In large numbers so be prepared. --CONS--  1. Bad framerate on low/medium pc's. Could use some optimisation as soon as possible. 2. Graphics are decent enough, can be done better.3. Some lag might appear after some time of playing.4. Some parts of the generated world is weird. Specially around towns.All in all. Great game and worth buying.

								So, I hated this game at first, it was janky, had ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics, and terrible performance, I bought it a long time ago put it down after playing it for a bit and didn't touch it again for over a year. One of my friends got me into it, this was because we were playing Project Zomboid, and she loves 7, apprehensively I tried it. I booted up a dedicated server for it, and as far as servers go, installing it with steamCMD, opening a couple of ports and changing 2 files, and you're fully customised, launch it from the .bat and you're good to go.One thing I did find that was odd, when setting your steam://... url for your website you have to +1 the port for the link to work. Now as far as starting on this game goes, you're gunna have a bad time, everything is covered by skills, from your damage, to the loot you find. You'll need to figure the skill tree out pretty fast if you want to be able to at least survive with something that isn't like hitting the zombies with a 10"" rubber♥♥♥♥♥♥♥The tutorial covers the basics but it only has 8 parts to it, and as far as I've seen in the option menu, you cannot turn it off, so if you're starting a game after a couple of playthroughs it may end up bugging you.So, the weapons come in your standard colour grades - with each tier doing more damage and lasting longer than the previous. I can't really see why you'd want too many melee weapons on here because the zombies are numerous and hit like a brick to the face. Ranged as far as I've seen it where its at for survivability. You can find a nice range of weapons in towns and military camps - however if you pass a bookstore in game make sure you go in plenty of schematics for weapons and tools within. After finding these schematics you'll need to find weapon parts to assemble a weapon, each weapon part has its own wear and grade which will give you a combined level and wear on your finished weapon. I felt this is a very pleasing aspect because it will allow you to upgrade your weapon as you go. But ammunition, this took me a little longer than I'd like to admit. To craft ammunition instead of reading a book like we did with the gun, you select and purchase it from your skill tree...? I don't get it either.Building woo, it's like a more intense gory Minecraft! No, building became a bit tedious and long after I'd built just a very small♥♥♥♥♥♥shack. Make your stone axe, go farm some wood, then you need to craft wood frames, build the start of your base, go and farm some more wood, then use your axe to build the blocks up. This felt quite long compared to most games, which isn't always a bad thing, it makes you take care in what you do. However, time is of the essence in 7D2D, at night zombies run, which means they're a lot more dangerous at night - so building a house and trying to defend it on your own isn't always the most enjoyable thing in early game. I feel they made up with the length it takes you to build, with the variety of what you can do with the blocks available to you.Now location, we played on 'Random Gen' ended up with a nice seed, the map feels huge, like it takes ages to go between cities which is awesome. But on my first spawn, I spawned on a tiny island...Now, this wouldn't have been the worst thing to happen to me, but you swim SO ♥♥♥♥ING SLOWLY o.O it was painful my first half hour was spent struggling to get to land. But following the roads on the way to the nearest city is nice, enjoyable, doesn't feel too repetitive. Over all after my initial distaste for the game and its graphics, the improvements and tweaks the developers have put into this game have made it a worthwhile purchase, the fact I've done 25 hours in 3 days speaks for itself, I'd happily recommend it to any group of friends who want to play it, along with any solo masochists. I would happily pay £18.99 for it again.If any of you new players are looking for a server to play with us on visit our website[www.godsofsalt.com] or just add me on steam. "

 7 Days to Die  This is the Sandbox set in postapocalyptic times. The game is set in the near future where nuclear war led to the destruction of humanity. However, it is only a small problem, because most of the population has been infected with a virus that kills within seven days, and turns them into zombies. In the game we create our hero that will be male or female. Creating a character is very well developed and immediately after creation, the game crosses us to map Navezgane or randomly created world. This production has been completely set in an open world that allows the destruction of all objects on the map. The big plus is a variety of locations to visit during the game, locations such as large cities, military bases, blocks and other types of buildings depending on the biome in which we find ourselves and there are several. Burnt forrest a place where there is not much to explore, the desert where at the day we're overheats and freezes at night, the forest place to build our sanctuary, having large amounts of food and very good access to water. Pine Forest is another very good place to survive like it is no different from ordinary forest that maybe the rain or even snow. Radioactive Contamination Zone, a place that shows borders of the map but also being in this place can be fatal for our hero. Plain, flat place with little amount of trees and animals that could make problems in survival for beginners. Snowy forrest, place for advanced players, intense cold can cause huge problems. Wasteland, a place similar to burnt forest so that it contains the huge city with a lot of loot, but also quite a few number of very aggressive zombies. As for the opponents, they differ in many ways, from usual zombie to a strong mutant. In the game you can also choose the difficulty level or set your own preferences. This production is quite a great title, single-player and multiplayer, create and develop your character from scratch, a huge world to explore and a lot of other things to do. The soundtrack is very good as well as graphically. In my opinion this is a very cool production and I had a lot of fun while playing this game. The game, however, is still in the early access, and some may not like it. But you can probably expect further updates. "

								I first bought this game during Pre-Alpha, before the Kickstarter was even a thing.I was even a pre-alpha tester, checking the game for bugs.I've watched the game evolve from being a voxel cube based game more akin to Terraria/Minceraft with zombies to an atmospheric, beautiful and smooth generation zombie survival game.This game IS a work in progress and needs to be played in that way, I never play the game for more than a week every major update. Most people burned themselves out and judge the game in it's current form, as a tester you need to help shape the game and inform the developers and keep them going in the right direction.This IS the definitive Zombie Apocalypse Survival Game.I am a huge zombie freak, I love all things zombie and The Fun Pimps capture the look and feel of zombies and will look even better once more Mocap animations are added (and more zombie models of course).The atmosphere in each biome is different and can give you a sense of forboding and the developers improve this all the time.The entire world is destroyable and you can also build to your hearts content with a more realistic building mechanic than I've seen in most games.The Fun Pimps are always listening to the community and are constantly working on the game to make it better, they're passionate about the zombie apocalypse as are we all that are like minded.I fully recommend this game, it's a full experience that WILL only get bigger as the game is developed.There's enough in the game for you to sink hundreds of hours into. But I obviously don't recommend that if you want to see the game shape over the coming weeks and months.If you feel you can't justify buying the game at it's current price, that's fine. Just put it on your wishlist and grab it during one of the many sales Steam has during the year. It's well worth it.Drop me a line and I may even show you some of the ropes (unless I'm taking a break from it until the next full release)			"

 7 Days To Die It's amazing. And here's why.7 Days To Die is an atmospheric survival sandbox that offers such a unique feeling that it's actually refreshing to play. It wouldn't be fair to compair to other survival games, but comparing it to other early access titles, it delivers with frequent updates(good ones as well, not minor text fixes.).Never have I been more afraid than when I was scavenging a small farm before nightfall, only to realize that it's almost ten P.M and that the zombies would soon start running after me. Being so scared, I took refuge in a tool shed, closed the door and hoped to wait it out(alive.). Nope.First I only heard many footsteps rummling through the grass, after that, it became scarier. The zombies started tearing down the walls of the shed and the sound of it made my bones shiver. I exited to the main menu, and went on to waiting for my friend to get in game.Pros Genuinly atmospheric game play, really makes you involved and keeps you on your toes. Everything is buildable(within gravitational reasoning of course, unlike Minecraft's no gravity logic.), and everything can be destroyed. You can even dig down, which I love, personally. Game has been massively optimized since it launched and I can't help but love the devs all the more for it.(At the start, getting barely 20 FPS on low, nowadays, getting 40-60 on High settings.) Constant fear of hordes, or anything else that will kill you.Cons Sound can be a bit dodgy, you'll hear something walking towards you and you'll turn around and see a zombie cc.50m behind you. Can be helpful, but just adds to the stress. There's character customization, but I can't but feel it's lacking at the moment. Not like it's a big con, it still doesn't affect the game at all. I would just personally like a bit more choice other than haircut and hair colour. Minibikes are relatively new to the game, but are still a bit dodgy to use. Nevertheless, still a great addon.In conclusion, if you're a fan of open world sandbox survival zombie games, and are wondering if this is just another early access game that will ♥♥♥♥ you over.No, no  it won't.Get it, you won't regret it.Preferably get a few friends to play with you, might get lonely in the wilderness.

								I really don't get the people whining about how they lost their base due to the new patch A11, A12, whatever. The Game is in Early Access, the Developers are churning out Awesome content, and there are xml files that you can use to tweak the game in just about any way you want. Servers can change the files or you can just change them on your computer for single player or games that you host.+ Can change biome file, so you can re-add ore everywhere in the random gen maps.+ Can modify Zombie Spawning, Recipes, Biomes (How much ore, what kinds of ore, what kind of blocks, water, etc.), pretty much anything someone is complaining about can be tweaked.+ Zombies, lots of Zombies, They can walk all the time, Run only at Night, or Run all the time.I actually tweaked the spawner, so that it just spawned animals and I had a fun and rather peaceful time of looting, building and just dinking around. I added a bunch of Hornet Spawns and those things are blighted evil. They bide their time in the sky and swoop down at you when you least expect them to. I did that, before they added the bears. Could have a lot more fun adding them and making your Zombie Survival Game into a ""Non-Zombie"" Survival Game.+ Can hunt Rabbits, Pigs, Deer (Stags only), Giant Hornets, and Bears. Yes, Bears. (Dogs are actually ""Zombie Dogs"".) The Hornets Drop Honey which is odd, but then again they are Giant Hornets. Who knows how they actually became gigantic, mabye they are mutated / crossbred  with bees.+ Need to eat and Drink to Survive. *Plans to add hot / cold survival features.* Desert/Snow Biomes should become a lot more interesting to deal with.+ Various food items, can cook, can grow crops. Just missing an option to capture and breed animals, that would make the farming experience complete, but still great without it. Can gather crops, make seed of some of your crops, replant your entire field, and have crops left over to use.The game is an Alpha release. So far the Developers have been doing an awesome job and usually release a hotfix fairly quickly after a major release to take care of the worst bugs.I got this game during a sale. I would have got this game a lot sooner, if I knew how awesome it was.I would whole heartedly recommend this game. Assuming, you don't mind re-building bases, starting over after each major update, and a few minor annoyances caused by this game being an Early Access Alpha Release. Personally, I like starting over every now and again just to see a new map or to try once again to see how long I can go, before my first death.			"

								I've enjoyed all my time playing this game. So much so that I will write my one and only steam review. I will only speak of general gameplay and not really of game features.  You can find those elsewhere.I only play SP and without the harder settings (e.g. zombies always run) enabled so there is even more gameplay to be had. I also only play on randomly generated maps which are infinite. You define a seed value to generate these maps. There is a standard map to play that I've never seen. =PThere are minor bugs in this Alpha build but no real gamebreaking bugs. The Fun Pimps are on the ball and do what they can to fix those even though the focus is on content (Alpha = content, Beta = bugfixes). I don't think I've ever had a CTD with this software.-Crafting is good and fairly complex. Quality in crafting is linked to your level. Loot is available at any quality level.-Structural integrity is a thing and does make you think about your basebuilding which can be massive both below ground and above. You are limited to about sixty meters below grade before hitting bedrock and much more above grade (if it doesn't collapse!).-Combat is varied with the different zombie types and rely on appropriate tactics. Firearms are great to use but turns you into a heatscore. Sometimes it is better to run away.-They have what they call heatmaps. Crafting, cooking, building and killing creates heat which attracts zombies. Heatmaps do cool down after awhile though so you do not have to be a nomad and continually wander the map.It can be a little frustrating at the beginning, starting off with nothing until you level up a little (stamina mainly) and start collecting gear. Pretty well everything is gated behind finding books to learn from. Those are randomly generated so unless you find a bookstore, you could be a while on your own without decent tools to work with. This varies gameplay a great deal.At this point, XML files are open so you can customize a fairly decent amount of the game and create content. Mods are being made already(!) considering the game is still in an Alpha stage. You are also allowed a wide range of options to click on when starting a new game so there is varied gameplay without editing XML files. This ranges from easy street to impossible.The ONLY thing that I dislike about the game is you are allowed a maximum of four hour days (one day compressed into a four hour period) and the standard gameplay is a forty minute day. Gameplay is not linear between the different time periods. Everything is centered around the forty minute day so you will have to eat and drink a lot more with an extended day period. With a four hour day, gameplay is easier because of more time to loot and build between the incoming zombie hordes. Even this is not really gamebreaking but it is a little weird.I do recommend this game. Even if they stopped development now, I've gotten my money's worth. Alpha 12 looks to be awesome with even more content planned down the road.			"

								The Game is only at Alpha 5 stage, lots of things still left to be implemented but as it is right now, it's very promising if devs get it right. The idea of crafting and building 'Minecraft style' is really appealing and addictive, on top of all the usual, seek for food, water, hunting, buidling your shelter or underground bunker it's all up to you to do anything you can to survive the night because when the sun is down, hell breaks lose as zombies will become super-aggressive '28 days later' type horde of them trying to get in and have a bite at you. It's really scary.I really enjoyed it.			"

								If you love Minecraft,DayZ,Basebuilding and Scavenge, this game is made for you.If you ever wanted to be an architect, but didn´t want to play Sims or Rust, then here you are right.The game supports very good whatever your style is to play a good Zombiegame.The mechanics are easy to learn and the controls are okay. I haven´t played with a controller, so I can´t say anything about it, but with keyboard and mouse its absolutely fine.One of the most important things for me to play 7days to die was, that I can play on my own or with friends.I don´t need to login into a world filled with Psychos and bad educated kids or people without selfesteem, who only get their kick from killing defenseless people, torture them or insulting them in the chat.Enough of ranting about these people they aren´t worth a thought tbh.I can recommend this game for above reasons and it looks pretty good for an Early Access. The Community is very busy and the Devs are making constant updates and take care of their fans. I myself hadn´t any problems with the game so far it was always in a stable condition.If you like survival with a game that fit your preferences then 7days to die is the right game for you.I apologise for my not so proper english, but it isn´t my native language:)			"

Early Access Review
								I do not recommend this game at all.  I've put in a lot of hours of play, and over the last two releases (A12 and A13) it has gone from bad to worse.  On the surface, there are signs everywhere of lack of quality control.  The GUI is sluggish at times, where a click to activate or select an item fails without precise targeting, or due to a lag stutter.  The new A13 GUI is terrible, and requires a criss cross of clicking and selecting to craft or operate forges or campfires.I find it amusing that so many things that worked fine in A12 suddenly didn't work in A13, as if they rewrote all the code as best as they could but missed a bunch of stuff.-Suddenly you couldnt use E to exit a forge or campfire.  People complained on the forums, and they fixed it.  Only now if you type in the name of an item in a menue to find it's recipe, and that name happens to include the letter E, you exit the forge when you type it.  Who writes this code?  Who tests it?-An old and ongoing issue has been the fuel timer and the cooking progress timer in campfires clock at different rates.  So if you add enough fuel to match the burn time to the cook time, your fuel will run out before cooking is done.  This hasn't been fixed, and it confounds me as to how it was coded wrong in the first place.  How do two items get a different clock rate?There are many more examples I can cite that reek of lack of attention to detail.  There seems to be poor quality control, and it is evident in many of the smaller details of the game.  Why is this important?  Well, if they can't code the timer on a firepit cooker properly, how competent are they on the really important tasks?Some more ongoing issues:-Zombies spawning in close prximity to the player and making no sound before attacking from behind.-Game breaking duplication bugs that are going unaddress and ruining server play experience.-wellness system that pealizes 10 points per death.  You start at 100, and after 4 deaths you hit the lower limit of 60.  Wellness must be earned by eating certain foods and doing certain activities, and takes many hours to recover.  Given the difficulty of starting the game, it is more than likely that you will spend the first 20 hours of play as a very weak and vulnerable player.  Low stamina makes this game a walking simulator, with POI's spread out far enough that it makes exploration very impractical.  A death while on such exploration can turn a 15 minute expidition into a 2 hour struggle to recover your stranded items.Don't bother complaining on the forums.  99% of the active posters are fanboys who lick the brown off of TFP starfish.  One TFP developer is especially rude, callous and dismissive to criticism.   And an army of fanboys will rally to his side and claim that the game is in alpha, so quit ♥♥♥♥♥ing and moaning about it.  It seems that nobody is willing to address any of the real problems, and developers will just say they are working on it.  But patch after patch and things are not fixed.I'm just about ready to throw in the towel.  Be warned.			"

								Devs would rather use the PC gaming community as a wallet to fund their console versions than finish the product we funded in the first place.Let me clarify this review since so many people seem to think that the game itself is an excuse for poor and shady practices on the part of the developer and publisher:7 Days To Die is a great early access game, as it stands now. However, development has already been rather slow, something that those of us who actually own the game have dealt with patiently. I know, it's EA. That isn't a ""get out of jail free"" card like many use it, but it does inform how harshly you judge bugs - which I have been very gentle with. I've paid for 9 copies of this game for family and friends. I like it a lot.However, the recent announcement that they would be pursuing console versions before even making it to the beta version is ridiculous. If you lot are happy funding something that will slow down progress of the product you paid for, and has nearly always resulted in a poorer product (speaking of PC-only games vs. 'consolized' games) then that is rather confusing to me. Why do you want the publishers spreading limited resources around instead of focusing on finishing the product that provided the funding in the first place?Furthermore, a great many of you seem incapable of reading. I know that the Fun Pimps are not the ones making the console port. If you guys honestly, truly believe that the console money came from nowhere, and the PC userbase that has provided almost the entirety of the funds that the Fun Pimps have isn't were the money came from, I have some of the most beautiful oceanfront property you've ever seen for sale in Kansas.The community for this game is so toxic (and I didnt even mention the hacking problem the online has!) that I've had to lock my Steam profile to stop the annoyance of spam and harassing comments. I am now deleting any and all comments on this review. "

								Ramps leading to two rows of wooden log spikes.  Build a Metal Trussing cage, put yourself in the middle, close the lid with more Metal Trussing.  The Thunderdome! For flare add torches all around.When the horde comes, watch as they come for you. Man mode, hold a fist full of pork!This game offer's a huge amount of exploring and entertainment (as is) Like the above, you can find a lot of different ways to survive the horde. For not starving Id recommend you read about the first human beings. Learn to use guides. Farm, loot, hunting and gathering. The first ever humans were hunters and gatherers. What the ♥♥♥♥ you think they were? To survive you need to be fit and use your brain. Not rely on fast food and ding dongs and mommy to come wipe your butt. That is the bottom line, you can go nomad and never settle down, or build a base. If you go nomad Id recommend planting some crops and return every few days to gather them up. If you build a base, maybe a bigger farm? Defenses is trial and error, nothing like siting in a prefab house with no defenses in the attic and only one can of chicken rations while a roaming horde is blasting through.Oh and plant trees, they drop seeds when you chop them, plant some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ trees! Use Vitamins after eating or drinking bad food.  When ALL ELSE FAILS, dig a hole and hide in it. Dig deep and cover as you go. This tactic is called the Saddam Hussein.Build 11 update: This game rips♥♥♥♥♥♥Build 12 update: Still shredding the♥♥♥♥♥♥Build 13 update: Meh, a few steps back.Skipped Build 14Build 15 update: Melee still is♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

								Winter 2015 review: Quote from madmole: """"We don't NEED multi player. We are making a great single player game and coop sort of fell out of the engine so we turned it on and people liked it, so we made a dedi and allowed that. Fallout will sell more than all these new ♥♥♥♥ty survival games combined and we'll be right next to them with a fabulous single player campaign. Are we abandoning multi player? Hell no. But its not our top priority right now. We want the game to run great in SP and P2P for a couple friends. We only support up to 8 players, yet people have 50 slot servers with hundreds of zombies on it, then complain its not working right.""Right then, so it's evident that you have went against your word during the kickstarter saga for this game. It's well known that he went and bought himself a mansion etc, when he could have put all that money into expanding TFP and employing CAPABLE coders. MM's comments regarding 8-player max servers are due to them being UNABLE to make such changes with their current developers.I'M NOT TAKING ANYTHING AWAY FROM THE CURRENT DEVS. They have done a good job with the resources infront of them. However, I'm afraid the game will die off if Madmole does not change his way and have a 2nd thought about where his game is going right now. MM suggesting MP is not important for 7DTD is extremely upsetting for great friendly communities that have formed together due to this game. I know of many servers who have been shattered due to unplayable servers (mine being one of them) Massive fps loss, memory leaks, duping, desynced enemies, shoddy random gen, etc etc Look at Ark, supports 100+ players on a server. They've sold more copies of the game than 7 days has altogether. MM, you're currently way out of touch with the fan base. A fan base which is slowly dying. Also, having your rants on the forums and attacking your customers is seriously destroying your rep.A small part of me believes you will redeem yourself.I will still be playing this game on occasion, simply for the community.

								This is one of the best zombie survival games I've played thus far.  It is very action packed, the choices for difficulty are nice and the crafting system is excellent.  When you start a new game or join someone else’s, you will randomly start somewhere out in the middle of nowhere and then it’s up to you to find shelter, water and supplies.  Grab a stick off a bush, some rocks and grass to craft a basic axe.  Then use that axe to chop down some trees.  Use the wood from the tress to make yourself a basic wooden bow and then craft you some arrows from feathers, sticks and more rocks.  From there the possibilities are endless.  Hunt down some deer for the meat and leather.  Make some basic armor to protect yourself.  But watch out, those zombies are hungry and they will smell the bloody meat on you and hone in on your location. Is night coming? You better run like hell to the nearest shelter and stay as quiet as you can, the zombies will become crazy aggressive and start to actively hunt players.  Note to self: They run faster than you do! =( So you better not get spotted! I do wish there was more to do in the game; more animals, more things to craft and deconstruct for parts.  Maybe even some NPC's to do some basic quests for.  When you go into a town and its completely empty and you are all alone and there is no one around for miles it just seems too unrealistic.  Get some screaming NPCs begging for you to save them in exchange for some basic supplies to liven and realistify the game up!Other than that I would have to say that this game is definitely a thumbs up for me.  I play on a server with like 6 other friends and we have PVP turned on.  You just have to be careful. If you die on my server you will spawn back at your sleeping bag or random location if you don't have a sleeping bag and all your stuff will be sitting pretty in a backpack just waiting to be stolen by someone else.  Better hide your claimblocks too. Those be some great things to build your base with =) "

								This game takes on a lot of features from Mincraft, but manages to not feel like a minecraft clone. The graphics aren't amazing but at the same time it manages to pull off some beautiful procedurally generated worldscapes. There are lots of settings to customize difficulty and gameplay to suit your style. If you aren't tired of zombies, like survival, scavenging, crafting and exploring, this is a nice game. This is not an ideal game for people who want to go on zombie killing rampages (at least not until you've played a while).This is one of those gems from the alpha funding gold rush. The developers have continued to improve greatly on the game and meet development goals.			"

								If I had to describe 7 Days To Die in the shortest way possible, I would say: ""It's Minecraft for adults"". It may sound like a broad comparison, but to my experience people found it easier to understand than ""It's a voxel based survival horde crafting game"". In fact I'll briefly show how 7 Days to Die differs from Minecraft: There's guns Blocks have gravity Has stealth Better graphics More realistic A thirst meter It's generally more complex (in a good way)I'm sure there's more aspects that I forgot, but the main one is that It's a lot more difficult to survive in this game, it's very unforgiving and that's what makes it so good.

								New edited review:Recent Pros:Balance has been fixed quite a bit, so this game is much less of a grind (given, there is still grinding to be done).Loving the new RPG-like elements. This makes it so the game doesn't get boring too quickly.Navezgane is bigger now!Optimization has improved the speed the game runs (for me) lately.Animations and new HD zombies make combat more interesting. Ability to stun and decapitate zombies is a great mechanic, glad it was added in.Beautiful world, and challenging survival elements keep me engaged for long periods of time while playing.Recent cons:While it is easier to level up skills than before, some are still way easier to level up than others (Example: Upgraded two existing structures with wood, and got construciton tools up to level 52 of 100 whilst having killed around 50 zombies with a bow and numerous animals, archery is STILL only level 2.. Weak).I am still experiencing weather bugs from a long time ago. Using ""debugweather"" in the console commands shows the outside temperature is registering as 137 degrees fahrenheit in the desert. I know deserts get hot, but I don't think there's a desert on the planet that gets THAT hot. That temperature carries on into the burned forest biome as well.^Strangely enough, this only occurs twice a day. Once at dawn, and once at dusk. In the middle of the day, when it should be the hottest, I get normal temperatures of between 90-100.A tutorial on harvesting and skills/perks would be helpful.Still a little grindy..-Would still recommend this game to anyone. I have enjoyed it immensely, and with the most recent update, I'll be playing it much more.			"

								If you ever thought of trying out a survival genre but hate dealing with trolls, toxic community in general and defend your base 24/7, 7 Days to Die is a way to go. It's a zombie survival, open world game, heavily PvE oriented with flexible difficulty settings, great for both solo and co-op. Player's goal is to survive each week that gets progressively harder by fighting zombies and by scavenging wide variety of items which increase survivability and allow to improve your base. Speaking of bases, it's a requirement that you build one and keep improving its defenses if you plan on staying alive as during the 7th night, a horde of zombies will rush at the player. Staying alive is the ultimate goal, however dying isn't a definitive ""game over"". You only lose your stuff which can still get picked up and a bit of wellness (health + stamina) which is gained by consuming top tier food products. Sadly, that's basically it and it gets redundant over time. Hopefully the developers will come up an actual goal like Mojang did with the Ender Dragon in Minecraft, like e.g, waiting for a rescue chopper or building/scavenging aircraft parts to fix some sort of aircraft and get away before the 7th day or whatever... Gotta keep in mind the game is still in development. Currently it's really fun to play and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a singleplayer/co-op survival genre game.Cheers to Bacon-Snack for this gift <3			"

								As someone who has put some hours to this game and was/is running a high pop server, i cannot recommend this game.It has changed a lot since the video on steam. There's a new graphic engine and the UI was changed a bit wich was a nice thing, what kills this game is constant bugs, lack of decent marketing, bad BR (as many before me wrote, you can't post a negative feedback on forums because you'll get swarmed with fanboys telling you're a whiner or insulting you).The patches are developed very slowly, the content in this game almost didnt change since over 6 months. Latest patch was supposed to bring something everyone were waiting for : weather engine, driveable minibike, new animal and new random generation engine.The weather engine is not like it was announced to be. It's simple texture change. It changed brightness/darkness so much most people are unable to see anything. The minibike that everyone were waiting for is broken and buggy. If it does work it falls under the map... Yeah that's the kind of endgame item you get here. I won't even mention adding 1 animal to the game. The random gen 3.0 is the only thing nice about the newest patch. Rest is just game breaking.Saying that there's also the coop aspect. High population servers (over 10) are not supported because devs claim that is game is not designed for this, even that there's a need for them. There's only one developer that works his♥♥♥♥♥off about the needs and makes server optimizations. In 2015 there's a game like this, with endless world designed for 8 players.. Really?The only good aspect of the game that i see, is that i've met enormous amount of good people in here and my server community is great. If it weren't for the people, i would instantly uninstall this crap. So much waiting and we get so little...I do not recommend this, at least in it's current state. Try it somehwere in 3-5 years, because with this speed of developing its gonna take them so much to reach beta phase.... "

Lots of Weapons to make or find!You can set the zombies to different speeds!!Different kinds of Zombies!!SO many more things are coming in future updates!Realism! (You have a Food AND Water meter that you need to watch at all timesbecause it influences your stamina directly!)Cons:When the Zombies die sometimes they glitch out.Sometimes you can partially clip through half blocks.Currently there is only one map (however they're working on random generated ones.)Zombie dogs!!!!!!!! (The only reason they're on here is cause they annoy me,there's nothing actually wrong with them.)So yeah most of the cons are only there because its an early access game!This game is well worth your time if you like sandbox games!

								NEW REVIEW FOR THE UPDATED GAME 4/21/2014  Thanks in advance for reading, whether you agree or disagree with my review. If you are warming up to type TL/DR after seeing the length of my reivew, just scroll on down and I'll have a short list of the plusses and minuses from what I saw. After a few messages popped up informing me that my review was getting pretty dated, I decided once again to step back into the zombie infested world of 7 Days To Die. Right off the bat I noticed a cleaner, more polished world, with flattened terrain and buildings looked more like blocky buildings, and not freaking funhouses. I then looked down to see if I still had akward stilt legs that had equal animations to a wind up toy you would find in a dollar store. But what's this!? I am missing my legs. So either the devs pulled the legs, knowing they were a visual abomination. Or they thought the game worked better without them. I myself prefer seeing my character's legs to increase imersion, but that is just my opinion. After coping with the fact I was nothing more than a floating torso, I headed to the nearest car. As I looted the trunk, I noticed there is now a small searching timer. I assume the timer is to make things a feel a little more authentic. Instead of being able to do a lightning fast snatch-n-grab on anything you see, you actually have to choose whether or not it's worth checking that box or car depending on your current situation and how many brain thirsty zombies are after you.After digging a pathetic excuse for a cave (more like a trench that just got deeper) I had a good 15 minute wander until I walked into what I would assume was a radiation zone of sorts. My character quickly lost health until I went into a comical death animation resembling a lawn flamingo falling over stiff as a board. I laughed, respawned, and made my way to a familiar little town and was quickly greeted by a few zombies and..... zombie dogs. Now, I understand having a variety of enemeis in games, but I find the zombie dogs and giant bees to be rather annoying. I would rather shut a door or window to stop those little F*%$ers from bothering me further. What I did like were the spider zombies. Lanky freaks with long arms kind of creep me out, so I'll bite on that one. Upon meeting my undead K9 freinds, I ran to a nearby house, closed the door, and started taking anything I could and headed to the attic. After hearing the repetitive ""crunch, snarl, squish, slam"" of the beasts outside for a few minutes, I skulked downstairs to see how things were going outside. I first was greeted by a running zombie (because the house was dark) and quickly dispatched him with what few shotgun rounds I had. I then turned the corner and ran into a fat zombie and a rather voluptuous female zombie (don't judge me!). I pulled out my  handgun and fired a few rounds into the fattie, but saw that they were just jumping in place instead of trying to eat me. After a few rounds I noticed Mr. fatty fat really only liked jumping when I shot him. I then decided put a round in head of his female parter and saw the ragdoll had been cleaned up a bit as she tumbled to the ground, which I appreciated since I am a ragdoll ♥♥♥♥♥. I finished off count blobberton and headed out the back of the house.    The rest of my play time involved me walking from house to house, collecting whatever I saw without caring what it was. My level of entertainment wasn't very high from the beginning, but what was left of it was draining fast. I eventually found myself doing what I did last time, standing on a rooftop, watching 20+ zombies gnaw at the same spot over and over. I decided to end it all with one last 'flamingo flop' death and called it a night.There were good things and bad things I saw in this playthough and I will list them to the best of my knowledge since I am a newbie at writing reviews and I didn't take notes.  PLUSSES!1. Ragdoll was cleaned up2. Sharper visual quality3. Looting timer (it's the little things that add up the the big experience)4. No more funhouse style!5. Character models and different monster types (spider zombie=cool. Dog zombie=bad)6. The price did drop from 35.00 to 25.00MINUSES1. I lost my hideous stilt legs in echange for a floating torso (possible plus?)2. Player and monster animations are still clunky and feel far from realistic3. AI pathing is pretty painful, it's at it's worst when you are indoors (fattie liked to jump when shot)4. Pretty much still the same experience as last time.5. Mining and crafting (although varied) aren't doing much to keep me wanting to find that last piece I need to complete my item.6. The landscape has been worked on, but nothing in that game makes me want to explore it. The radiation zone killed me, and did not inspire me to dig deeper to see what was in there. I would just turn and walk the other way if I ran into it again.7.  Zombies kind of feel more like a nuisance instead of a threat. I won't bother going into a dark house because I know it will just ensue a Benny hill style run around with some zombies. 8. The price still doesn't feel worth itThere could be more items but I will stop here since I JUST got a kickstarter update email from the funpimps saying that a new update is right around the corner. THE VERDICT!With bigger contenders like DayZ standalone, Rust, State of decay, the recently revealed H1Z1 (with crafting, building, and vehicles), 7DTD still does not do it for me for the price. When I walk around the world of DayZ I actually feel like someone trying to survive in that world, and I worry about attracting zombies and player kill happy gamers. In 7DTD I run to everything,♥♥♥♥♥♥off ALL THE ZOMBIES and watch them chew and slap the side of the house I am squatting in at the moment while growing bored. In State of Decay I LOVE going out at night to scavenge. And holy crap do I get a rush when I accidentally make a noise while looting and see zombies close in around the house I am in. I doesn't get more cinematic than when you fight for your life in a house full of zombies and jump through a window to escape at the last second. In 7DTD it's hardly a thrill when zombies come after you in a house. In the end, I still don't reccomend this game to players at it's current state and price. But to each their own.  I still hope to turn this negative review to a positive one day.  Thanks again for reading. --------------------OUT DATED VERSION REVIEW FROM 2013----------------- I backed this game on kickstarter in August. I played a good amount of the alpha when I got it and I didn't really like what I saw, but before people get mad I DO know how much more work devs promise to have done. I understand it's still in it's early stages, but over time I have not seen a whole lot of changes so far (My Opinion). In minecraft I actually WANT to mine and search for goods and I take pride in the places I build to survive in, and I fear what stares at me from the windows at night. In other open world zombie games I WANT to gather food and I get tense while fighting humans and NPC zombies. This game does not inspire me to do much of anything. I get guns, I build around houses, I watch the mindless zombies just stand at the wall below me wihtout trying much to make me worry about getting attacked. The night cycle is not even fun to sneak around on. The current character models are either a male or female characters with two color options (all pretty ugly). and the textures are acceptable. Do I reccomend this game currentlyat it's price? Hell no. Do I hope the game gets to the point where I can reccomend it for the price? Yes, yes I freaking do. But at this moment I could think of many other games I would rather have purchased with the 35 I spent backing this game. I also want to add that the hours played are only what I played on the steam version. I put much more on the pre steam release.			"

								Alpha 13 Seems like a step back to me - and a big one at that, After 6+ Months of Development (From Alpha 12 to Alpha 13) it's Amazing What The Fun Pimps have released.7 Days To Die is trying hard to be another generic zombie looting door knocking craft simulator that copy pastes design and streamlining decisions from Rust and Ark. It's Hardcore Casual, this game can't decide what it wants to be anymore.TREE AND DOOR BREAKING SIMULATOR 2015 - It takes WAY, WAY TOO long to fell trees and break through doors and walls now. If I wanted to take so long chopping down trees I'd go outside and do it, There needs to be a better balance between Game and Realism - The HP Bars on everything have led to you realizing how very generic and even emphasizes MORE SO how much of a GRINDFEST a few basic activities are.7 days to Dress Up, if you could carry a backpack you would need it now to constantly store your clothes in because for some ungodly reason you have to run around in your undies because if ambient temperature is above 90 degrees outside you're going to die of heat stroke. My main armor combination should not be Boots, Gloves, and a Hat; How was the gross obviousness of how annoying it is to not be able to use your armor overlooked?Crafting, forging, inventory control and streamlining.. I don't like it. MEAT, why hunt anything difficult, kill easy things and get their ""Meat"". Wood and the removal of sticks as well as many other streamlining aspects makes me wonder why at the same time this game keeps throwing more casual aspects in, it also gets balls harder - What Audiance are you going for? Rocks from punching rocks and Wood from punching trees, Come on. If the rest of the game is extremely hard, why do we need to streamline crafting and make it more Casual? I liked the fact you had to break things down to certain states to make other things, now I'm just throwing wood and metal together to build and mixing meat to eat. If the rest of the game is extremely hard, why do we need to streamline things and make them more Casual? I liked the fact you had to break things down to certain states to make other things, now I'm just throwing wood and metal together to build and mixing meat to eat,  the entire generic 'streamlining' of the entire 'creation' aspect is dumbfounding.""Skill progression"" means you get to play the game for 20 hours to build a base or kill more than 1 or 2 zombie at a time, I defiantly enjoyed this game more when it was rougher around the edges. As an adult with a job I want to get in to the ""Fun"" part of a game much sooner than being gated behind 200 books and grinding for 7 hours to be able to not have to use 10 metal and tons of wood to do achieve simple base building and block upgrading, because I'm not ""leveled up enough in that crafting stat"". Guess I'm too Casual for it now, You may use all your gitgud white knighting arguments to disparage my personal views if you wish, But this is how I now feel about this game.The mocap in general is also.. Tacky, I appreciate the fact that mocap is going in to the game but the entire thing is just over the top, Just because it's mocap does not mean you need to oversell EVERY SINGLE ASPECT. The walking undead should not grab limbs I hit/shoot and act like they are trying to win a tony award, there is more to subtle movements than to these EXTENDED overly long LOOK AT ME USING MOCAP type animations that seem to have been shoehorned into EVERY single thing the zombies do - There was something rather errie about a large hoard coming at you and firing at them and them basically shrugging it off and barely flinching while still advancing, Now it's like some poorly choreographed keystone cops re-enactment.The ability to behead and hack and slash limbs play counter intuitive to how you would think, honestly Melee feels like I'm playing Teken or something, you need to ""Ground and Pound"" to do it effectively, but the fact that zombies just spring back into a standing position basically warping into damage makes getting near them to take advantage of the 3x damage while stunned a lesson in futility. Oh that zombie was on the ground, you're going to finish him off? NOPE - Zombie hitboxes are poor, the 'dancing' aspect of dodging back and fourth while using melee is gone because you'll just get hit when the animation on the zombie skips frames and you get stunned and bled.Will I uninstall the game and never play again? No, I'll still try to salvage how much I previously enjoyed this title, but..TL;DR - It's really too much of a chore to play this game anymore, it feels like it's nearly turned into an MMO with the amount of grinding you need to do for the simplest things. There's a fine line in games between extending game play and sucking the fun out, For me personally this game has surely tipped into the later.Another Nail in the Coffin For this game in it's Current State:The Obsessively Hostile Fanboy LegionJoin the Steam  discussions to get told: ""getgud"", ""get a new computer your potato sucks"", ""it's an alpha so everything should be broken"" (even after 6+ months of work on a build), and everybody's favorite: ""I don't know what you're smoking / I'm not having those problems they don't exist""			"

								Survival isn’t about immense power, gluttony, or the ability to safely forage, farm or store an infinite amount of food in your home. Survival is about a constant struggle to stay alive in a dangerous and uncertain environment, where the odds are most certainly stacked against you. And it is this essence which 7 Days to Die captures adequately and beautifully in the beginning, but which eventually diminishes and peters out due to the game’s lack of late-game content.Starting out in 7 Days to Die is hard, very hard. The game is similar to Minecraft, it has no storyline or  tutorial to guide you on what to do next. Instead, you are simply thrown in the middle of the world in your underpants, no tools, only a can of chili, a bottle of water, a bandage, and a torch to your name, and tasked to survive.  Juggling your character's various needs, and managing your daylight time properly are both essential components of a viable survival strategy. And it's what makes 7 Days to Die so compelling and stimulating to play. Because frankly speaking, you never quite have enough at the start. And depending on your luck, that undesirable state may persist for a few more in-game days. The Fun Pimps have rightly, in my opinion, made some of tools that are important, but not strictly necessary to survival in the beginning, difficult to obtain. And herein lies 7 Days to Die’s biggest problem. Because so much of its appeal is derived from putting its players in the seat of a survivor who never quite has enough to eat, drink, and is constantly struggling to stay alive against the odds which the game stacks heavily against them from the getgo, the lack of a forceful impetus to survive in the middle or later portion of a game, as one’s character gains in strength and survivability, ultimately and ironically detracts from that appeal. This weakness speaks more to 7 Days to Die’s apparent lack of late-game content than its heavy reliance on a relatively unsustainable premise such as survivability. At the moment, the game fully expects and encourages you to become stronger, but imposes no additional challenges to test your new-found strength. Zombies stay the same, develop no new capabilities, and although the game attempts to shake things up by throwing massive hordes of zombies at you every 7 in-game days or so, they are easily countered if you properly fortify your stronghold. I fully expect, and have faith, that The Fun Pimps will properly flesh out 7 Days to Die's content. At the moment, 7 Days to Die is still capable of offering its players many hours of deep and complex gameplay. I have only spent 50 hours playing it so far, and I believe I will continue to spend more time exploring, surviving and building in in 7 Days to Die. As an early access game, 7 Days to Die is definitely worth your money.			"

								Loved this game since early alpha 4 and watched it grow and change in the eyes of the developers and their fans! Lots of their community have tried to chip in with ideas to make the game what it is today and they are still trying new things to make it even better. Remember this is still in alpha stages so dont kick their♥♥♥♥♥so hard if you dont like it! Anyway, from my experience, this game is amazing at keeping you busy, on the harder difficulties you're constantly looking around for the zeds and constantly trying to figure out your next move, theres little time for luxury because surviving is not as easy as it sounds! BUT. When you've set yourself up, and you're confident you can defend yourself... thats when you can truely give no F**ks. Building the most inpenatrable base possible is easilly the most time consuming thing ever, but by far the most fun! Watching a wave of zombies die in your traps and minefields is amazing... Panic inducing if a feral zombie somehow manages to break his way inside... I'll leave that to you... Play on multiplayer servers?... You have your own version of ""The Walking Dead"" ... Playing solo or just with friends... Well, i have 560 hours playing and with people i've never even met!You either love it or hate it... But before you dismiss this game try and survive a week without being eaten alive... It really grows on you!! -Considering i sound very biased ill list some of MY pet peevs on this game 1) They tried out a new minimalist User Interface which im not 100% sure i like yet... again looks like they're testing stuffs2) It can be VERY difficult to survive on a bad spawn and especially when you're new to the game! 3) Zombies sometimes make no sound.. and you can be hit and killed without even realising they're there!4) Performance can be a peice of S*** if you have a lower end PC if you tend to ""max it and forget it"" make sure u have at least a GTX970 and some sort of hyperthreaded i5 or 8 core AMD, an SSD would help too! (high ram would be good as there are some memory leaks!) 5) Crafting has a ton of bugs sometimes and hotfixes sometimes introduce new bugs, (not 100% sure on A14 yet) 6) Unbalanced crafting in somecased, you'l understand in game after a few hours..7) Dogs.Really do reccomend this game to any survivalist... It kicks the s**t out of Rust, DayZ, H1Z1 and those other games (so far)  "

								7 Days to Die is a very fun game and is going to be an amazing game when the developers finish all that they have planned. Currently gamepay consists of gathering resources with which to craft and build. If you need metals, coal, potassium nitrate, and that sort of thing then you mine it. If you need wood you chop down trees. To get weapons, recipe books, and any of the other items you may need you will typically raid major cities or towns that are zombie packed. There isn't much more to it right now aside from gathering the toys you want, things like SMG, Chainsaw, Auger, Sniper Rifle, or Rocket Launcher and then building your base up to survive the massive feral night hordes that want to eat your brains. HOWEVER, the devs say that their inspiration for this game came from Fallout 3 and Minecraft. They want to merge the two worlds. What's planned is NPC's featuring quests and storylines to follow, vehicles, metallurgy, electricity and generators, and a full blown living world of NPC survivalists to interact with. This is one of the best co-op games I've ever played. The zombie shrieks and growls will send chills down your spine as you and your friends feverishly repair your damaged structures as the zombies break through. You will feel an immense sense of accomplishment after you construct a worthy defense structure and successfully fend off a zombie horde. My background in games is Eve Online for 10 years, some WoW mixed in, and I love open world games and strategy games. This game does a good job of satisfying my need for killing, surviving, strategizing, and progressing. The only downside to this game, IMO, is that this game doesn't have intentions of being a full blown MMO. The game is on player owned servers with a maximum of about 64 players. This game could be the best game ever made for me if it were an MMO. But this is a great game, with one of the best communities i've ever been a part of, and a development team that's dedicated to making their dreams become reality in the form of a fantastic game that you should own!!

 Truly more satisfied with 7 Days to Die as time goes on. A rare thing for early access,   I have followed this game since early development. This game has came leaps and bounds above what it was before. A true masterpiece in the ""Sandbox"" genre. Highly customizable difficulty keeps the game challenging when you become a veteran of 7DTD.  The development team really keeps their word on what they are going to implement. A rare thing in Early Access as I have come to learn. I've had fun playing this game for a long time now. Nearly 200 hrs logged ingame.  Truly the only Early Access game I feel more satisfied with as time went on.   Thank you The Fun Pimps!  You guys really do pimp out the fun! =)			"

								- 7 Days to DieThe Fun Pimps somehow founded a company with that name and gave us a really fun survival sandbox game that is pretty surprising considering what they are trying to do and what they have actually done. Probably the best PvE survival game I have ever played with the looting, random gen, building and zombie hordes being some highlights. I always want it to be harder and better because these guys are really on to something. They somehow combined elements of Fallout with Minecraft with Zombies. If you haven't seen the game recently give it a look now because it is starting to take some serious form.			"

Early Access Review
								This review is based on Alpha 13. And for the direction the game has taken in this iteration, it is getting a thumbs down. I have little hope for this title to change direction in the near future, since it seems to stand to reason that the devs will be looking to ""wrap up"" after 2 years of Early Access.What I expected of the title when reading the reviews and watching the user generated videos (mostly based on Alpha 12 at the time) was a game focused on survival, base building, making your base self-sufficient in terms of resources, and finding creative ways to hold off the hordes. It's a voxel based game after all so I expected a good amount of creative freedom in base building and trap designs. I had multiple hours of intense fun figuring out how the crafting, survival and horde mechanics work on randomly generated maps as well as the standard map. Once I got the basic mechanics down, I started a new game on the standard map intent on surviving and outsmarting the hordes for as long as possible.Thus started the disappointment. I could do nothing like the creative base building I've seen other players do on Alpha 12. Turns out Alpha 13 introduces a skill/tool quality system that is preventing players from having fun. You need to invest ~15+ hours of repetitive grinding first, and that's if you know what and how to grind, before your character starts to get abilities that allow you to even start considering building something like a halfway decent moat. Basic building, resource gathering and looting is all terribly tedious when starting out. You need to do all of it to survive. There is `no time` to dig out a half way decent ditch for your base, let alone a fortified moat. After you survived long enough for the character to acquire all the gear and skill to actually build something interesting, you're way past the point where the game has become boring and has plateaued for its lack of content. There's also little incentive to try and build something interesting any more, becase once you've internalized the design principles of this game during your time climbing the learning curve, you'll realize that this is not meant to allow for 'interesting' outside of 'creative mode' a.k.a god mode. Which is one of several problems with the design choices in this title:Your base is supposed to be vulnerable, in the sense that you can't effectively wall off or trap zeds. The walking lumps of flesh will degrade and destroy every conceivable material in good time. Forged iron spikes, steel, concrete. All will disintegrate in time. And way faster than you think it should. Zeds will dig and claw through solid rock. So if you did follow through with your moat idea, you'll realize that once Zeds have fallen into it, they'll start digging tunnels under your fort until it is inadequately supported and collapses. You can place spikes at the bottom, but they won't help as much as they should. And by the time you can conceivably dig a moat deep enough to have Zeds actually die from fall damage onto said spikes: you actually can't, not with all zombie types, not while keeping the ability to effectively maintain your spikes at the bottom, and most importantly not within your first ~20 hours into the game. My problem with the above state of affairs is that it prevents experimenting with base and trap designs. There is only 1 or 2 effective base designs in Alpha 13 if you're playing single player. Everything else is either too maintenance heavy, so you can't go scavenging and resource gathering, or simply does not work well, because it is overcome by the zombies too quickly and too easily. You'll likely find out the hard way. There's too little viable choices in effective base design. Not in single-player anyways, where you have to rely on the passive defenses to do the bulk of the work, because you can't be in multple places at once.Along the lines of 'your base can't really protect you' design, which is misleading for new players, there is no way to actually be creative beyond static bulding. That's right, there's no moving parts like gears, levers, pressure plates etc. So you can't even build a retractable bridge, because well, that might actually be effective as a means of holding off the horde or building effective traps. And that would be cheap wouldn't it? So we can't allow it.Another badly executed aspect of the game is the randomly generated loot, that also depends on 'level' (griding time) of your character. That's right: skyrim-type leveled loot. Also the aspect of 'knowing where to go looting to find the stuff I need' is largely under-emphasized  vs. 'just being lucky getting what I need' or 'having looted 1000s of containers to finally be worthy to find something in good condition'. For example: on my first game, I found a chainsaw in a car around day 5. Needed gas to operate it, but it was awesome for felling trees and getting the Zeds off my back. In another game, I've not seen a chainsaw or any of its parts yet. Found 4 diagrams to build one through. And I'm well past day 100 with the game plateauing after day 49 where you'll see the strongest horde. Some more vital diagrams the RNG has not seen fit to grant me neither. So I was not able to craft leather before day 104, nor was I able to make steel or cement well past day 100. And that's after I started concentrated raiding sessions in all directions to finally get these books because I wanted to see what the game would have been like if there were more deterministic ways to progress in the technology trees, and what the benefits of the advanced materials were.Another issue are the item durability and quality systems. If a real world iron shovel disintegrated as fast as it does in this game, you'd need 4 of them to just dig out a latrine. But the fast breakage has a purpose: it allows you to grind your tool smithing skill by making a new one. And just 500 shovels into the grind, you'll be golden, achieving the level of quality on it that you had in pre-alpha 13 from the beginning.The 7 day horde spawns near you, and knows where you are at all times. Full on GPS Zeds. This is different from regular wandering hordes that get attracted by activity like burning fires and making noises. Those need to spot you. The GPS Zeds on the other hand have an all-knowing tracker on you. If the pathfinding code finds a way to your character the Zeds will follow it. If it does not, it gets as close as it can, and starts clawing at any blocks roughly in your direction. No way to outsmart, trap or outrun them. You have to kill them all before they wreck your base entirely. Currently there is one way to avoid it: dig very deep down and make sure the tunnel entrance is far away. The GPS Zeds will congregate just above you on the surface, and with the tunnel entrance far enough away, the path finding will not see a way to you. The Zeds cannot dig down vertically, only to the sides. So here you just stay put for the night, and once daybreak comes and Zeds lose their running ability, you go up and wipe them out. That tactic is the only way to be 'smarter' than the horde. And of course is considered an 'exploit'. There used to be more options for horde management in previous alphas. The Zeds' nightly running ability was hampered if they entered brightly lit areas. But the devs removed that. Character limit is kicking in, so wrapping up: much potential, too limited player choices, vital progression behind RNG, no end-game content, last alphas moving into tediousness and grinding instead of content. Not expecting it to recover.			"

								The game as it stands RIGHT NOW is very enjoyable. There are bugs and some issues, but even so, my 5 friends and I are really liking the direction. Let me explain:We host our own private server so my review doesn't take into account anything about that.1. It's a good looking game and runs very well on my i7 + 8bg ram + Nvidia gtx660 OC2. There ARE some graphica glitches, but not game breaking. Sometimes my prone, dead body will be what everyone sees even though I've respawed and am running around. Meh .. once I jump or climb it fixes itself.It get progressively harder as we've been alive and progressing. The 25+ zombie hordes that come at us on a blood moon can be dealt with, but they're still dangerous.3. DEVS !!!!!!!   I REALLY like how the clothing works in regards to body temp. GREAT concept but needs to be tweeked. Clothing needs to have  hot/cold properties. For example... The bandana should NOT make me colder while in cold climates. It's covering my skin and helping to keep body heat in. If you want to make it -2 in hot climes because it keeps the beating sun off, then that makes sense, but then it needs to be +5 for cold areas. I think ALL clothing should have dual temperature properties.4. Zombie animations are excellent! We can tell...for the most part... the type of zombie by it's movement/silhouette and sounds. Love the localized damage. Headshots ROCK!5. DEVS!!!! Can you make the TRACKING for friends permanent. I have to click the box every time someone logs in and out. That checkbox should be persistent.6. DEVS!!!! Schematics/RECIPES ... please show a tooltip/hover over tip for recipes that tells whether or not I've read it. Inventory space is limited and we need to quickly see if we've read that book or schematic so we can drop it to pick up something else.7. DOGS SUCK ... just saying. And I mean that in ""AHHH, 3 dogs have spawned and I'm screwed! They're fast and dangerous!!"" ... keep up the good work.8. BEARS!!! .... freaking awesome to tap a bear and watch them come running and then slaughter the zombies for us! LOL SWEET!9. Would love more Forged Steel tools. Pickaxe is the only one, but a shovel and better axes should be the progression of tools.This is a deep game, creative crafting and building/upgrading. Decent combat vs zombies as a pure survival game. Just kill them quick..nothing too outlandish. You're trying to survive and this is basic survival.Yes it can get glitchy / buggy, but it's a blast with friends.Keep up the hard work!			"

								great game be leary with negtive reviewers that only have a few hours of gameplay, This game has a steep learning curve and is still in Alpha. it is being updted every few months with big updates. the game is focused on survival and crafting, its a tough game and you will get addictaed  once you understand its not a shooter its not a kids game you have to think and plan and build. there is a ramdom map where you can play in an unknown land and explore or you can play in the standard map. you can play single, PVP or PVE. for the money this game is a great deal, with over 1300 hours into it i have gotten my money back ten fold in entertainment.buy it and play it for a while it took a few hours to get into as you start with nothing so you  have avoid the zeds until you level up a bit and build some good weapons. Once you build a base and establish yourself you soon become a force to rekon with as you can make bullets guns bows even explosives......so look as you get back my night to your safe base.			"

								7DTD was my first foray into early access and has become for me the Gold standard, against which I measure other titles. Although still technically in alpha, it is one of the most polished games I've played.Gameplay is addictive and although it can be frustrating on first spawn (ie - no gear, alone and up against lethal mobs from minute one), getting to the survivable stage with crafted weapons and food is very quick to achieve with some careful thought.The centrepiece is of course, the crafting.. which could be held up as an example of how to do it. Getting the recipies for advanced gear is deceptively easy in the main.. but actually being able to assemble all the neccessary bits is a challenge. Getting yourself ready for your first horde gives a sense of urgency to the proceedings.A superbly well made and well thought out title and rapidly becoming my number one 'just another 5 minutes' game of choice.10/10 and only getting better with each patch.

								I keep playing every new release. I keep being totally thrilled with everything they come up with. I had thought that digging underground was enough to stay safe, but Alpha 15 had a surprise for me. After 200+ hours of gameplay, and feeling bored almost with my sense of safety, quite suddenly, a horde of feral walkers and zombie miners fell through the ceiling of my mineshaft. I had never been so scared and surprised by anything in my life. My hands were shaking and my heart was pounding as I, bleeding, shot my way into and past the horde, ran through my base, closing doors behind me and made it to my minibike which had enough gas for me to stay moving until the daybreak. I came back, cleared out the remaining zombies, removed my stuff and dug a new base, much deeper. I still dread that scream at 10pm. Sometimes I just leave to go ride around because it’s better than just waiting for them. Maybe in Alpha 16 that won’t be safe either.			"

								Now, let's get a couple of things straight. As an alpha-state game developer, one of your major goals, if not THE major goal, is to listen to your playerbase and see what they have to say. You're developing a game with your community, you're not polishing a finished piece, the point of an alpha build is for the players to help create the game, otherwise you would just launch it at beta with whatever features your little hearts desire.This game was a major thing back when it came out, in my opinion peaking at greatness in alpha 11. What happened from there, you may ask? Fundamentally, progressive development ceased and became redundant. We're working with developers that are so far up their own asses (pardon the expression) that they don't really care what the players want or how they feel; any sort of criticism, be it positive or not, is treated with censorship back in their forums, I've witnessed countless times whole threads being completely obliterated by overzealous mods, who don't like it when they're told their favourite game is going the wrong way.And yes, this game IS going the wrong way. I remember getting my closest friends to buy the game back in A9, we pulled freaking all nighters playing that game, it was so immersive and an overall amazing experience, everyone had their roles during the day, and rendezvous at night to defend the fort. We really couldnt get enough of it, whole days we'd spend looking for the perfect safe haven. From A11 forward, it just became a redundant game, at its core. Update after update with almost 6 months apart from each other (which is pretty bad, considering its an alpha and frequent updates are essential) the game just got more and more simplified and less immersive. As of A13, you can build solid concrete blocks out of decaying wood. Take that for immersion. No more specific meats, everything is just meat, which means alot of recipes and farming went down the gutter so that shaved off alot more hours spent hunting for deer or any other specific animals, and overall we waited 6 months for basically, like I said previously, a simplification of the game's core engine that was perfectly Solid, and a visual rework on zombies that completely shattered the overall game stability. Thats right, a full HD remake, that took 6 months to develop, on an Alpha build. Thats like dressing in your finest suit to go out later before you've taken that shower you've been putting off for a week. Not to mention that they pushed it out so badly optimized that it forced them to work on about 5 patches in 3 weeks in order to fix framerate issues, server lags and other gamebreaking bugs. No other relevant updates.The game lacks content, and removing it to reach an end-game state quicker only affects it further. Everyone I played with got bored of the game, and for good reasons. I got bored myself and unfortunately I can no longer support developers that are working apart from their community. It pains me to let the game go like this, but I cant support something that's no longer what I payed for originally.			"

								This game is amazing. It is the #1 survival game on Steam in my opinion at this time. It combines the building modularity of Minecraft, with the crafting of Day Z or Rust. The survival aspects are well done and you really do have to keep your well being in mind while you play, rather than it being an occasional annoyance like many other survival games. Looting is very fun and there are enough items that you don't feel like you see the same stuff over and over for quite some time. There is as good mix of low level crafting (1 item into another) and high level (Multiple items crafted together to make a new one). You can really make a good base and there are many options for entrenching yourself at a location. You can even build a little motorcycle and explore way easier! This game truely morphs over time and you go from a shivering, naked husk of a person to a badass apocolypse surviver in a strong base who can do almost whatever they want. (But still feel a severe threat on the 7 day attacks!)Every week (7 days) you will be swarmed with a massive attack of zombies. This really changes how the game flows compared to most survival games. So many other games get boring after a few hours when you cap out your tech tree, but the progression is so detailed and varied, and these attacks so intense, that you never quite feel like king of the mountain for long. Really, the only complaint with this game is that the graphics are not great. The player models, right now, are very ugly but you cover up with armor and that actually looks cool. This game will also get a lot of updates over time, so you may not want to get in on this until more releases come out, or the game releases. Definitely recommend, and once they nail down the random world generation and some optimization, this will be an amazing survival game for a group of players!			"

If PVE survival crafting is your thing, there's plenty of value per dollar here even in its alpha form. It might not be finished, but it's a ton of fun as it is.			"

								It was the middle of the night. The light of the full moon poured through the gaps in the boarded windows, setting a sense of calm about the place. The shack that Dave and I had spent a few days building and fortifying stood strong and sturdy. We hadn't had much trouble from zombies during construction and fetching supplies, just a few stragglers here and there. The only thing is however, I didn't know whether that was a good thing or a bad thing. A very bad thing. A stag roamed past our shelter this morning, so quick to spring into action I aimed my crossbow at its rear, and pulled the trigger. It tried to run off a few paces before collapsing to the ground. I approached the stag cautiously making sure no zombies in the nearby area had heard its screams of pain and come to catch an early lunch. I pressed my knife into its throat and yanked hard down to its abdomen. The warmth of the beast reminded me of home. Home, before everything was so ♥♥♥♥ed up. Snuggled on the couch with a blanket watching the Walking Dead wondering what life would actually be like if a zombie apocolypse were ever to occur. I guess i found the answer to that one!Wrapping the Venison steaks in leaves and putting them in my backpack i headed back. On arriving Dave was boiling water over the campfire in a cooking pot. Placing the steaks down by his side i noticed him wipe away a tear and swallow his sorrow. Normally i would have asked him what was wrong however i knew the answer. Yesterday we lost Frank. It was only meant to be a quick in-and-out supply run to the local village for antibiotics but, while searching a medicine cabinet Frank did not see or hear a zombie dog behind him. Poor guy never stood a chance.A few hours later Dave and myself were just finishing a nice bowl of venison stew. A single candle burned between as to not give off to much light or heat to draw attention to ourselves. The windows were boarded up good but you can never be too safe. Taking both our bowls over to the rusty old sink I peer out of the window. And there, reflecting off the light of the moon, pressed to the glass, i see the harrowing face of a spider zombie...I get a shock and drop the bowls. They shatter into tiny pieces off the decayed brick flooring. The noise alone is enough to set the spider zombie into a raging frenzy. Its long black fingers crept through inbetween the wooden planks used to board the windows, solidifying its grip it pulls with all of its strength however it does not budge. Aggrevated, starved and looking for another way in it climbed onto the roof. Pounding with its almighty strength onto the wooden plank roof reinforced with scrap iron it knew that that wasn't going to work either. By this time Dave had ran upstairs and fetched two shotguns from the gun cabinet, a long barrel and a sawn-off. i took the sawn-off, loaded it, and held it tightly to my chest; and then came the sound we know the horror of all to well.The spider zombie on the roof let out an almighty screech which echoed off into the distance. An eerie silence hung around the shelter so thick you could bite it. And then, from over the nearby hill, a screech was returned...The silence came and went however this time was broken by the sound of footsteps. Not walking footsteps, but running footsteps. And they were getting louder, and louder, and louder. Then like an army of charging horses all at once the horde smacked against the side of the house, with a thud so loud it was like a gunshot going off inside your head. Faster than we could think of a survival plan the wall crumbled and the zombies came hurtling in. They were hungry. Very hungry. Dave was first to shoot, the buckshot spread enough to cover 2 maybe 3 zombies at once. Quick to follow i too took aim. Our gunshots rattled the woodwork in the shelter and i began to think we were overwhelmed. There were spider zombies all over the house. Bloaters spitting acid and disintegrating the foundations. Dogs growling and snarling from every direction. Saying a quick prayer I signal to Dave that we should make a run for it. Even if we could fight off this horde the repairs alone would be pointless and starting fresh elsewhere would probably be quicker. Opening the back door and making a dash for it we clear a smaller crowd. Running low on ammo confirmed to me it had to be this way. We were low on ammo, low on stamina and low on HP. Running up the nearby hill we had lost sight of the horde, pausing for breath we stood for a while. Looking at the remains of our home crumble and fall. And it was at that exact moment, a couple of crawler zombies come out of no where and killed us both, GG.11/10 would die again!			"

								Unlike other survival games such as, say, Rust, where the main focus was defending yourself from raiding parties of humans, this game puts emphasis on survivng the onslaught of zombies. Other survival games have set locations for enemy NPCs to spawn, while this one can spawn entire HORDES of zombies wherever it feels the need to. As they get considerably more powerful at night and increase in difficulty with each passing day, you are forced to spend days building up to continue survival.This puts a HUGE emphasis on players helping each other rather than hindering each other, as it would be a waste of their time and resources and leave them vulnerable to quick death should they run around hindering others progress with the scarce resources they have. And mind you, the nights are not to be taken with a grain of salt like other games. Should you hold back waves of the horde, more waves spawn immedietly, meaning this is not a game about simply shooting them to the point of destruction - it's simply about surviving long enough to see the daylight and bring an end to their siege for the night. There are 19 types of enemies too, including powerful bloated walkers whom are only vulnerable to headshots, as well as wall-climbing, window-smashing spider zombies and even infected wildlife.On top of it all, there is a noise engine - the more noise you make from firing a gun, setting off grenades, or even constructing and upgrading your house, the more the horde hears you and the worse it will get. This puts emphasis on having multiple fallback points too, as if you manage to attract them to one location too much by noise, you will need to leave and escape detection before coming back at which point you can only hope the horde will have left with minimal damage.And another thing about the night - you CANNOT survive by simply running and gunning with minimal shelter. During the night, zombies become not only more powerful and massively increase in number, but they also run at twice the speed of your standard movement speed. You can only outrun them by sprinting and just barely, which requires limited energy and depletes your hunger and thirst, which admittedly should not be too much of an issue after day 3, but regardless surviving an entire night sprinting is a near impossibility.Can you pull a minecraft and dig underground and just stick a block on top of you? No. Because zombies can break down ANY blocks in this game including the dirt on the ground, you are not safe anywhere. Once you are sensed, you can only prepare for the inevitable siege to come. What makes it worse is the fact that underground bases are very restricted - you likely have only a small number of escape routes which can easily be blockaded by zombies. This makes even the most secure underground bunkers only a temporary hold back point.Physics are in this game too, which means that if the supporting blocks for something are removed, the entire thing comes crumbling down. You have to have secure houses with more holding them up than just the walls therefore, and you need to ensure your platforms will not come crumbling down at first possibility.All in all, this is a FANTASTIC survival game where for once, you fight with others against truly difficult NPCs. I would highly recommend this over other games for those of you who are not major PVP fans.			"

								Day 1: This is pretty cool, like Minecraft with zombies and better graphics!Day 2: Sweet Jesus the map is pretty damn big!Day 3: Why did I spawn in this damn wasteland.....Day 4: That's a big group of zombies, I should check it out.Day 4.5: That was a terrible idea...Day 5: Hey I got some guns!Day 6: Well, it's one more day until the ""horde"" comes.Day 7: I should buy a boat.Day 7.5: How the crap did all of the zombies burrow under my house!?!?!Day 8: I honestly have no idea how any of that happened and how I survived.This game is outstanding. It's challenging, intriguing and fun all in one. I've died a good number of times because of dumb mistakes (see day 4...) but when you are able to make it through each of the horde days it's just satisfying. I haven't spent as much time playing as others, and I'm only through about 20 something days but this game is just fun. It would be even better if I could set up my own server and have a few friends in it and all of us were playing together. I'm looking forward to see what the future updates and actual release of the game look like.			"

								As of Alpha 15 I can safely say that this game has improved quite a lot, but it also has a very long road ahead of it where a great many things could go wrong..I feel like they're trying to change things a bit to much and as a result slowly drifting away from the original vision, and instead are trying to rebuild something completely new and very different.Personally I think The Fun pimps should focus their efforts on improving their original vision of the game and the great parts of it that didn't need to be replaced. Sometimes it feels like they're trying so hard to change and improve certain things that they end up making it even worse, but maybe that's just me.I really do believe that The Fun Pimps have good intentions and a real passion for this game, but I just hope they don't slowly drift away into a darkess that they can't escape.

								Pros:-Tons of items, recipes, weapons, zombies, animals, food, plants, clothes, armor, building pieces, and more to loot/build/explore/kill.-Many hours of things to do.-In-depth survival features such as hunger, thirst, stamina, temperature, armor, injuries and illnesses, with various buffs that affect most of these things.-A true sandbox where you can build anywhere you like. Dig underground, repair and reinforce an existing building, or build an all new structure. Upgrade your build from wood to scrap to concrete etc.-Challenging zombies.-A nice crafting system.-A persistent character progression system where you can allocate points into areas you want to specialize in. This adds quite a bit of longevity to the game IMO.Cons:-Wot.7 Days to Die is one of my favorite games. The devs have done a great job. They communicate with the community(even accepting help from the community to fix/shape the game), and almost every new milestone alpha build feels like a brand new game(really, look at the first few releases of the game and compare them to now---quite an amazing difference IMO). I think this game deserves way more publicity and players. Hopefully the console release will fix that. It gets a lot of flack for its graphics but I don't think it looks that bad honestly.			"

								I'm an avid zombie fan. I've watched many zombie films, TV shows, read books and played games like State of decay, The Walking Dead, Dead Rising, Dead Island and DayZ with my friends. I have to say that this game is the best zombie game out of all the ones I've played. Some people say it's bad because it's still in Alpha and some others say it's a Minecraft copy, but I say that this game is really good, really fun to play and WAY better than Minecraft at its current state. I can't even imagine how awesome it will be with all the upcoming features. This is the true zombie survival game I've been looking for, other zombie games are either not survival, just a storyline going from point A to B and the other ones like DayZ aren't really my thought of a real zombie survival game. I was looking for something with an atmosphere kinda like The Walking Dead: Cities and places destroyed by zombies, you're a normal survivor who needs to find weapons and resources like food and water to survive and it even has crafting and building which are the only things I liked about Minecraft. Plus the whole world is destructible.So, again, I find this game to be the best zombie survival based game out there. Of course it still has its bugs and it needs improvement but remember it's still early Alpha.Also, I can see the devs of this game are quite honest with their work. One can see that they do love their game and work hard on it, most devs I've seen care only about money and don't listen to fans. This is the first development team I've seen recording preview vids, gameplays and answering Q&As from the community WEEKLY.Now, go kill some zombies friend.			"

								In the midst of all these crafting/zombie games the Fun Pimps have pulled off an impressively honest development.  7DTD may not be the flashiest or prettiest game of the bunch but the game mechanics are reliable and the crafting is deep but enjoyable.  You can already find servers with one click hosting ofthe game (even in alpha).  They still have work to do.  There are some glitches in the voxel building system.  As of 9.3 there are areas and certain heights the physics glitch and blocks for no rhyme or reason fall apart when they should not.  Their one static map Navegane have buildings and bridges that where built before one of their patches but now fall apart when you traverse them since the current physics mechanics no longer hold them up.  Despite all that I can (and have) easily setup an instance of the game that my friends can jump on any time and enjoy a couple of hours crafting and battling hordes of zombies.  I hope these guys keep going with their development road map and more casual players give this title a try.			"

Of all the games in my library, I find this one the most thrilling.Pros challenging alright character & combat system plenty of possibilitiesThe gameplay is to my oppinion better than Minecraft, and in some ways it is what I would call an upgrade to it.The level design is lovely, but the graphics could be considered struggling compared to games like Rust. But of course, given you can destroy almost anything you see, the graphics remain stunning.Cons zombies often bug when killed (though it looks fun) There is only one map so far (besides the automatic map generator) Bugs sometimes happen, like items disappearing from your inventory.The game offers a lot of hours of fun playtime. But to my experience the game can quickly run dry of fun if you play singleplayer. Though with friends it is way more fun, especially if you play online with many people. Just keep in mind that playing this game on an official server may require patience, as people will try to kill you, and you might then lose all your items, having to start over once more. A bit like Rust at this point.I would without doubt recommend this game due to the game's potential and overall gameplay. "

								Ok where to start after over 4500 hours ingame...The game caters to 3 main play styles, single player, MP PVE and MP PVP.  If youre after a fun sandbox type SP game and you like building,crafting and zombies then youre in luck as 7DTD delivers a very good experience (with some caveats) and has a high replay value that will keep you coming back.  Note tht the developers have repeatedly stated that thi is the audince they are looking for.If you like MP PVE then again all the good things about SP carry through to this experience and depending on how you tweak the difficulty settings you will have some fun with your friends exploring, building and fighting off the occaiional hordes.My play experience was about 10 hour SP after which I realised the world was not challenging enough and the lack of people made it too lonely a world and I oved on to maybe 100 hours of MP PVE which was nice in that I got to meet other players and have some interation however the same sense of little challenge remained and I have spent the rest of my time playing MP PVP.The devs dont ike MP PVP, they dont code for it they dont make any allowances for it and generally look down their noes upon it like its some dirty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child in the corner that should get no love.  The funny thing i that MP PVP is where this game shines.With MP PVP you have the correct level of challenge (again can vary due to the particular servers settings) because now you not only have to survuve the environment (easy) and fight off the zombies (relatively easy) but you have real people adding in that random element.  Alliances are formed, enemies made, grudges held and acted upon.  Bases get raided and sometimes raised to the ground, sometimes they are taken off, sometimes you will rush to defend friends in need or gather your alliance to take down a particularly unpopular team.The PVP element adds uncertainty, challenge and real risk v reward elements to the gameplay.All of the above was pretty much true until Alpha 12, in Alpha 12 they introduced levelled loot so now we have the mind bogglingly stupid mechanic of your level directy affecting the uality of the items you find.  Want that flawless axe?  get ready to grind through 3-4000 zombies and god knows how many RL hours before the game decided you have levelled far enough to start finding high quality items.  Before this the quality element was truly random so you could get lucky on the first day or you could spend 2 weeks travelling to find all the parts for a high end sniper rifle, exploring was rewarded, effort was rewarded, now?  its just mindless grind and when you have killed all those zombies and reached level 60 almost every container has flawless items which is totally stupid.  This change did not increase the rarity of flawless items it actually did the opposite and made them commonplace IF you were prepared to grind countless hours.Now this mechanic is complete BS, what is in a ammo crate is there regardless of my experience at killing zombies but despite a lot of feedack on their forums they went ahead and did it anyway and this tells you a lot about them as a dev team.The second really bad decision they have made regards the upcoming Alpha13 release where they are doing away with how peple craft items in its entirety in order to dub it down for the console market, this change also extends to how you upgrde structres in place.  Up to this point there were many materials you could build with and the choices you made, the time invested in gathering resources and how you built your base were mssively fun elements in the gameplay that have been lauded by pretty much anyone who has played or reviewed this game.  Thats all going now because again the devs want to dumb the game down in order to port it to console and the deep breadth and complexity that was 7DTD crafting and building is being thrown in the bin.  A sad day truly and they will lose a large amount of players for it.The last thing you need to know is that their community site is pretty toxic, if you are not a rabid fanboi then you will be openly insulted, trolled and insulted and this will be ignored by their moderators (some of whom were so dismissive of any negative feedback that even TFP had to fire them eventually).  No feedback will be tolerated if its perceived in any way as negative or not in line with the devs ''vision'', dont take my word for it, go and read their latest A13 dev thread.I have had some amazing times playing this game, particularly with a wide ranging group of friends and particularly in PVP but the direction the devs are taking it now is thevery opposite of that attracted all the people I know in the first place.I have to put in a reccomendation as the game is now rather than as it used to be and for tht reason I cannot reccomend although I hope that the devs do see sense and recognise the huge playerbase of PVP'ers and how important they are to the games success and that they stop dumbing the game down for the console kiddies.Until that happens I have to say i do not reccomend.

								Great game :D , there needs to be a better assortment of clothing and weapons tho.... as well as placeable objects for your home.Sounds are nice, progression is nice, the look of the game hints at realism, both PVE and PVP are nicely implemented/ balanced.If you enjoy killing zombies, players and want to get creative as far as base building / terraforming goes, this is the game for you.The game is still in alpha, and as such the physics and models could use a bit work... (Edit: Models and model physics have been totally redone on a new engine in the upcoming patch)This game will almost certainly give your monies worth, buy it while its cheap!Additionally it has a lot of dev support and a team that will be sticking with it for the foreseeable future. (at minimum the next 5 years.)Edit: This is an early access review and the game is still in development, as such it is constantly being changed and updated.Enjoy!			"

								13.6 update breaks almost every aspect of the game and more than a week has passed with no comment from devs regarding fixes. There are many issues with video errors, sound issues, connection and EAC issues and severe MP server issues. Weapons never have lined up correctly and frequently glitch into a strange position that won't allow you to aim down the barrel. I have spent more time in this game than any other, but in its current 13.6 build state, I cannot reccommend it to others. It is  currently too broken and has become unplayable in my opinion.			"

								My first experince with 7DTD.I spawned in, a guy gave me some OP stuff and met a fellow noob. I said my farewell with the nice guy and proceeded to meet up with the fellow noob. I finally got to him then the other players told us that it was horde night so we dug a hole and hid underground. He got hot and sweaty, I got hot and sweaty, so we took our clothes off whilst hiding from zombies above us. We spent the night next to each other in our undies and once it hit day time, we broke our two wooden frame barriers and YOLO'd it. We saw 1 zombie that was actually the only one patrolling around us all night. We decided to kill it since we out numbered him. I pulled out my gun (now armored) and proceeded to kill him. Bullets didnt phase him. The game bugged out my newly made friend died, and I got smacked from 5 feet away. One zombie killed the both of us and one of us was armed. $25 Well spent. 10/10 Would get naked with another guy and die on the first day again.P.s. If you played this on console and are considering getting this for PC. I highly reccomend it. There are MUCH more players than on the console version. Plus there are dedicated servers. So no more pesky getting kicked out of games when the host quits.			"

								Update 1/7/17I logged on again to try this out after watch some of the achiement hunters play on the A15 release. A15 has brought the game back to something that is fun to play, and rewarding, I have found myself enjoying the game again. Still, i've lost a lot of faith in the developer ablity to ever actually get this game beyond anything but and Alpha. I wish there was a neutral setting because I feel like that big red thumbs down is a little harsh, but I can't openly recomend this game either. If you find it on sale then It would probably be worth looking at, especially if you are looking for something that has a strong crafting emphasis, but don't get too attached to your stuff, it's still and alpha and glitches are still somewhat prevalent.Update 9/24/16I decided to reinstall and try again, it looks like they have changed a couple things and messed with the crafting system again, but as for actuall adding anything to the game all you get is an extremelly simple quest system which is a step backwards from the open world sandbox this game is supposed to be. Even on easy mode it still takes more than 10 arrows to the head and 10 blows to the head with a club to kill a zombie. They've made the game feel even slower by making the walking speed even slower. I'm glad for those of you who are enjoying this game, but it just keeps getting worse and worse for me. At least the dev team is so slow that you can still see a resemblence of the game that was once fun.A12 hotfix updateThe game has gotten a little better, but is still more stressfull than fun. If I wanted it to be this difficult I'd play on the harder settings, but even the middle of the road and low difficulties are nearly impossible now. bears are still rediculously common, zombies spawn all around you at all times, loot has been reduced to nearly nothing. Sadly, I still can't recomend this game to anyone who isn't a hardcore survavilist. For me this game was a fun slightly more realistic minecraft, it filled a small niche that most survival games go right over. Now its just like every other survival game, you'll spend hours diggging trhough piles of trash and slowly crawling accross the world trying to find a few critical items that spawn so infrequently that I haven't ever seen them in A12._orignial review_ (still stands)For the time being this game should be avoided, Alpha 12 has sucked all the fun out of the game. It's an alpha, and pathes and updates may come and fix the game, but until they do I'd stay away.			"

								Was found by zombies and ran into a random house on the street screaming into the microphone for assistance from friends.Then proceeded to stay in a dark corner of said random house and cried as I went from ""sensed"" to ""unsensed"" for the next 10 minutes.Friends found me, but was too frightened to come down until Day 3.You could say that I'm a wimp.---------------------------------------------------------GameplayOkay, okay, in all seriousness, 7 Days to Die: The Survival Horde Crafting Game is a great game that I, personally, needed time to form an opinion on. My friends loved the game from the get-go, but it took me several play through's to even begin to appreciate the quality of the game at hand.You start out in a vast open world where you need to, you guessed it, survive. Zombies in Hawaii-themed shirts are after your delicious brain and the dogs are not your friends. I repeat, the dogs are not your friends (I made the mistake of thinking they were).Like many other survival games before it, your job is to build a suitable enough environment in which you can live out the rest of your post-apocalyptic life in (I'm guessing that is the purpose, I've never really survived that long...) Anyways, there are many items at your disposal and the possibilities are endless. Based off of the discussions in the forums, there will be more options in the future which only enhances the quality and price of the game. The developers are, from the looks of it, more than willing to listen to their player base which is definitely a huge plus.---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ I can pretend I'm in The Walking Dead+ Amazing replayability value here, all for a decent 24,99$ pricetag+ Offers a ""cheat mode"" which, of course, makes things much easier. Still provides hours of entertainment+ Very fungame to play with friends - I've already lost so many hours playing this, it's ridiculous (but clearly not as many hours as many others! That just proves how great this game is)+ Fun Pimps, the developer's, are amazingly responsive to their fan base. They roll out updates in a timely manner and are always working to better their product. You can't beat that kind of dedication+ This game is truly terrifying at times. It doesn't have a ""horror tag"", but I think it really deserves one. Then again, my threshold for scares is dangerously low... this game has been known to terrifying my most manliest of man friends though!+ Graphics are great - they have improved vastly since it was first released. If you can, play it on high graphics (you will have to restart the game if you change during the middle of your gameplay. Otherwise you will see chrome, neon, and black figures instead of a human being, etc.)Cons- Would like to see some improvements to defensive measures: items, like the spikes, prove to be too ineffective at times (zombies can glide over sometimes)- So many optimistaion issues; so, so many... the game has been plagued with lag since the beginning, and I hoped that it would've improved by now,  but alas, it hasn't- Can there be some achievements and trading cards? I know this is ""not the mark of a true gamer"", but I truly enjoy this game and would like to have a flashy badge to prove it- Can there also be some ""bandits"" and ""rivals""? Likewise, it would be nice to have other ""survivors"" that you can pick up along the way. They can either be persuaded to join your group or become enemies... Am I fangirling over The Walking Dead too much? Whoops.---------------------------------------------------------I've been playing this game since it was first released: from the basic blocks, lagfests, and terrible graphics, to its now far more superior quality and number of improvements. While I don't have the hours to prove it (since a lot of time was spent offline), this is a game that I absolutely adore.In the end, 7 Days to Die has a lot to offer and at a more than decent price, lives up to expectations. With more updates coming along the way, and a sufficient player count, you honestly can't go wrong with this title.Overall8/10Beware every 7th day... you have been warned.---------------------------------------------------------Like my review or have any questions?

								Love it. Been playing since beta 5. This game gets significantly better every update. And the Devs have so much plans! Can't wait for the next update, and the next update after that and the next update after that and the next update after that. The only thing I don't like is the amount time it takes for updates XD			"

								This game is coming along nicely, more content is being added all the time, the bugs are.. what bugs?? Seriously very minimal bugs the DEV's are keeping this nicely polished. The game even though in Alpha stage has alot going for it.Atmosphere: Great feeling game that really changes moods, not for the faint of heart or easily creeped out. This game has feeling by the bucketload, at times you will be hiding in a corner, sometimes you will be sprinting for your life while your heart tries to beat out of your chest and other times you may completely lose your mind and go on a rampage throwing all caution to the wind as you exact your wrathfull vengence upon the undead for daring touch your beloved minibike!Playability: This is a game you can really spend alot of time on without realising that its 2am and you need to start work at 8am. There is countless things to do in 7 Days, by yourself or in a group you will have no trouble finding things to do, explore, build, repair, renovate, create, be mischievous, compete and survive!!Interface: The feel of this game is great and it has really been done well, the menu's are simple but indepth, you can ""couple click start"" or you can spend time adjusting how you want the game to be, difficulty levels can be rather casual up to insanely ""messed my pants scary!"" Hard! Controlling the character is very smooth, easy and just feels so good, the ingame crafting is fantastic, the best I have seen.Graphics: Very pretty! Graphics are up to scratch and have all the nice bits that one would expect from a modern game with great lighting effects and smoothness of images. The landscapes and buildings look fantastic and make it easy to sink into the feel of the game.Conclusion: There are alot of crafting games that have followed and ridden on the success of Minecraft and now there is literally a vast sea of Minecraft/Zombie survival type games available now, most of them in Alpha/Beta stages, some are ok and some are absolute rubbish. 7 Days clearly stands above the horde with top marks in all the right places, you will not find a better game in this genre.

								I'm a little stunned at the replies of negativity.  1 said that it was laggy with his top of the line comp.  Really?  I'm running it on an 8 gig laptop pentium 2.7..It runs more than fine without lag.    Another griped of the blocky features and repetitive landscape.   Am I the only one that read in APLHA STAGE?     The Graphics needs some heavy updating to eliminate the blocky,  old nintendo game look but I can't imagine that not being on the menu.      Another wrote how the zombies always find you regardless of where you hide.  Really?  Me and my friend built a fortress that was completely unbreakable.  They haven't gotten even close to us yet.     It isn't a mindless shooter.  You need to put effort into the game, scavenging, foraging, forging, crafting, hunting and even cooking.   Honestly the only complaint I see valid is the cost.  It has the potential to be (With massive graphics upgrade) a 50 dollar game.  Right now?  It shouldn't be 20$ I'd price it at 15 for a one pack and 25 for a 2 pack.   I just saw it went on sale which annoys me as I bought it like 5 days ago the 2 pack for 49$.  I'd have saved 16$.  Grrr.  Had I known I'd have waited and bought 3 copies.  But I recommend the game mostly based on potential and what I see MAY be in the works.  Better Graphics and driveable cars?  2 thumbs up.    I'd like it if one could hide from the zombies to but I don't see that as a huge issue.  There should be roaming NPC groups that either want to join your compound, theives and Merchants, though I saw that was coming.  The scope and potential of the game is huge and limitless.  It really just depends on how serious these guys are about it.   So far I think they are and as such, I give this game a thumbs up and look forward to more game updates soon.			"

								7 Days to Die is a zombie survival, post apocalypse game, where you can build almost anything and destroy everything.I got this game and a few copies for guildies thinking it would be a nice distraction from our main games. Little did I know this would become one of our guilds main games. Our guild leader is now thouroughly addicted and plays almost nothing else. While I have played some on public servers, our guild has our own server, so this review and my experience will be based mostly on the private server side of the game. I  have found this game to be really addicting in the building aspect you can make almost amything you can think of and that is a major part of how addicting the game can be, you tend to keep saying to yourself ""ill just finish this little area up and log next thing you know you have built an underground comples, hollowed out a mountian for your mine and build towers and fortifications everywhere, while forgetting to eat and sleep. Another good aspect ""atleast on the private server is we can mod the world and setup game types form group survival to pvp which is very nice. The only issue I have seen so far is the new lighting system in update 10 while it looks very nice it really drops your frame rate (I was running game on max settings and now have turned shadows and anti-aliasing off for better preformance and some of our guildies with older computers and graphics cards are only hitting 3-10 FPS, after the update). So in short wonderful game but having a better comp will help alot especially on pvp servers.Pros*Nice graphics*fun building mechanics*fun multi-player (having a server is really nice)*Zombies are well done and alot better AI since last update*Easy to spend hours playing the game*Development team is doing a good job of updating and informing publicNegatives*FPS drop since new update (fixed real fast so not an issue)*Limited on the differant types of zombies (afew more types would be nice*some of the stuff in the world you are not able to build (mostly cosmetic stuff like beds, fridges and things like that)*really wanted vehicles in this last update (guess it was just a rumor)			"

								I was a HUGE fan of the original (and free) DayZ mod.  I have heard too many unfavorable things about the DayZ Standalone game and chose not to play it.  Since then, one failed clone after another left me thinking that the whole open world survival genre was going nowhere.  Then I discovered this game.  At first, 7DTD feels more like a Minecraft mod, but it very quickly proves that it is it's own unique experience.  Recommended for anyone who likes open world survival!			"

Early Access Review
								7D2D has always looked like a great beginning for a game. But each new update has just made that beginning longer and more tedious. The latest update has finally convinced me that 7D2D really isn't going anywhere. With Alpha 13 it now takes me 50 chops, with a really good Stone Axe, to get through half of a boarded-up door. That's 100 chops to get through one door. And all doors are now boarded-up, even ones inside a house. (Who boards up the door to their own bathroom??) But it doesn't really matter, because there's no good loot behind those doors anyway. No chance of something useful - like maybe an iron axe. More likely some empty tin cans, or more parts for a Hunting Rifle I won't be able to assemble for another 20 hours or so.I'll be lucky to live that long. There are dogs everywhere, and they're pretty much un-killable. When I do kill an animal (dog, pig or deer), I don't get hides, like I used to. So no chance to build a Bellows, or after that, the all-important Forge. Also, air conditioners don't give up Steel Pipes any more - which means no way to make a Grill, and therefore no way to cook food. So I'm rapidly starving. I'm also overheating all the time, over 100 degrees standing outdoors in a normal woodland biome. So I'm going through 10 water or more in a single day. That means more trips to the river, more boiling to purify the water, more chopping wood for fuel. Also, items wear out really fast now, so you'll be spending most of your time repairing and re-making the same gear over and over and over again.This is after almost 8 hours of play on Alpha 13, with most of my stats well up from their starting points. And with difficulty reduced one notch from the default. So when, exactly, does the fun part start?Each successive 'big, big update' to 7D2D has turned out to be mostly about better visuals, more tweaks to an already perfectly-adequate UI, and, above all, more ways of making the game agonizingly, screen-punchingly slow and difficult. Instead of extending the game with new content, TFP is just stretching what's already there, thinner and thinner. What they've got now, is a game that's both tedious and pointless. Grind your way up the skill tree as far as you like, and you'll find there's still never any actual progression in the gameplay. No advanced tactics. No grand strategy. No storyline. No fascinating new locations to discover. Just more of the same simplistic gameplay: see a zombie, kill a zombie. Build a fort and watch the zombies rip it apart in one night.This is a game so linear and mindless that it could be played by an actual zombie.So why have I spent so much time playing 7D2D? Two reasons. First, because it actually used to be a lot more fun. Back when it was simpler and not quite so mind-numbingly grind-y. Second, because I was sustained by hope. The hope that by the time I inevitably got bored - yet again - the next patch would give me somewhere to go, something to do that I'd never done before. But after literally years  of waiting, I have now officially lost that hope. I've crafted thousands of blocks, hunted down hundreds of crafting blueprints, fended off endless hordes of zombie dogs. And there's still no point to it all. Only now it's way more difficult and way less fun that it was back in the early days.TL;DR: I probably would have recommended 72D2 a year ago. Today, in December 2015, I can't. It's been 'improved' and 'upgraded' until it's become hopelessly broken. Don't bother with it until you see some signs of real evolution in the gameplay. And some serious reduction in the grind factor.EDIT: I've been informed that to get hides, you have to chop the animal with a bladed weapon. It works. Changes like this ought to be documented by the developers... nothing like a good 'readme' file.NOTE: Reading the ""How Alpha 13 Works (Basics)"" thread, I've learned how to level up my crafting skills in a hurry. Basically, just keep making the same stuff over and over and over. It works, and it makes the difficulty a lot more manageable. But it's also kind of the definition of 'grind.'There's a no-man's land in game design, between 'too easy' and 'too difficult.' The way to fill in that gap is with 'interesting.' TFP obviously don't understand this. They won't let players build an impregnable base, because they fear that would end the zombie threat permanently. They don't realize that the solution to the problem isn't simply to make the game tougher, it's to make it more interesting, to allow gameplay to evolve. When you've built the impregnable base, the game doesn't end, or become trivial - it moves to a higher level. Until they realize this, 7D2D will always be an exercise in futility.			"

								Well what can i say about 7daystodie that hasn't been said allready. The developers of this game, TFP -AKA- ""The Fun Pimp's"", Are a really good bunch of people.They keep you updated on the main forum as well as Madmoles Tumblr page on any progress and updates the game is due to have.They have a hell of a lot to do with the community and do actually listen to what people suggest and say.This game is brilliant.You get a real sense of achievment when you do start to get things going right.I have watched this game for a very long time, Allways pondering whether i should throw down my reddies,Well guess what,I wish i had done so alot sooner than waiting up till late alpha 7 - early alpha 8 before finally purchasing.Still glad that i did though.Basically, the game is set in the Zombie Apocalypse,You have to do anything and everything to survive,That could mean clearing out an area on the map because you need the house as a starting base or just going to the main city's that are dotted all over the map,Although i wouldnt reccomend that untill you have at least got some supplys in,Then you are good to go.The game has numerous options so that you can tailor your own version of how you would like the game to play out,By this i mean in the settings,You can have it where the zombies run / walk / run at night / walk in the day,Airdrops on or off or set to have so many spawn in a set time,You can also just play on the default settings.Just one note to potential buyers,Just remember that the game is still in an ALPHA stage,Although i must admit, this game is the best i have out of all the early access games that i do own,One more thing as of 18 November 2014 ""now"" there is an update due for release soon ALPHA10 - A10, This update is going to be huge as the random world itself lol,There is actual character customization of your face,Burning Zombies ""1st iteration"" of it,An enemy activity system so the zeds can sense and find you if you make too much noise or use the forge or campfire,There's a number of armor items coming in A10 There's just loads to come,Did i forget to mention that there is going to be more animal's added over time and also the one thing that we really need to traverse the freaking huge map ""Vehicles"" !.Just check joel hueninks Tumblr page and read the forums to see the love these guy's put into this game,You can clearly read and see it.Joel's Tumblr :http://joelhuenink.tumblr.com/7daystodie forum :http://7daystodie.com/forums/Right then down to whether i would recommend this game to anybody.DAMN straight i would,If you have read this far then what are you waiting for,This game is truly brilliant and a masterpiece in the making,Well worth every pound i spent on it.Dont get me wrong, there is the odd bugs like the duplication exploit and a number of others,None of which i have found to be game breaking to me..A TRUE MASTERPIECE :8/10 as it currently standsCheersmark117hI do truly wish TFP's all the best in everything that those guy's do.###########################################EDIT: 17-03-2015 @ 12:26.Currently 7daystodie is going through an engine change from Unity 4 to Unity5,This will bring with it a number of extra options including and not limited to performance and graphics enhancements.The ALPHA 11 release will be built on the new Unity 5 engine and is due to update anytime soon,This game is and has gone from better to utter sheer brilliance, cant wait to try ALPHA-11 out soon.One last thing,Grab it now why its at a lower price because if you like zombies and apocalyptic settings then this game is going to be right up your street and believe me, you WILL get hundreds of hours of entertainment out of this game from the start.###########################################EDIT: 15-06-2015 @ 15:43Just a little add to this review,I have noticed that some people have given this game a negative review,Just WTF when they have less than an Hours playtime,Totally bo110ks i'll tell ya.Whilst the game has still got a fair few issues with it,NONE & I MEAN NONE Are that bad you could class them as game breaking,This game is coming along nicely as to being one of if not they best game based around the zombie apocalypse scenario ever.LOVE IT - LOVE IT - LOVE IT - LOVE IT.

I picked the hay bale up and the roof suddenly caved in, hit the floor, and then the floor caved in. Dysentery was then the least of my problems, as I lay dead in the shell of the once proud barn. 10/10 would pick up hay bale again.			"

								This is a very decent game, well worth the discounted EA price.  At first, I was a bit apprehensive as there are too many EA titles that are creating really ""bad"" games with Unity; but this game kinda showcases what can really be done with Unity.I'm not a DayZ fan, I'm not a NationZ fan, I really don't like slaughtering Zombies, not really my thing, but this game has an appeal about it that allows me to kinda see past that ""this is just another zombie shooter"" -- it is not.While you can build your own bases in much higher definition in comparison to MineCraft, you can also create defenses, spike traps, land mines, kill boxes, and hidey holes.  The entire object of this game is to slug your way through 6 nights of Zombie waves until you get to the 7th night in which you are bombarded by hordS (yes capitol S because a lower case doesn't serve it justice) of zombies.If you are not prepared, if you took shortcuts, you'll most certinly find the consequence of that mistake on night 7.What can you do?1) Mod weapons2) Craft armor, cothes etc3) Create and loot medicines to keep you healthy4) Steralize your water cook food5) Create fires to stay warm, jump in water to cool down (or strip naked!)6) Build a scooter and run over zombies *SPLAT!* (strangely satesfying when I've had a bad day)This game does have some drawbacks though, and I would be doing my readers a diservice by not mentioning them.This game does get awefuly borning by yourself, and you'll find that the way the skills work, you need buddies to help create the perfect base that can survive a night 70 spawn (every 7th night the wave gets stronger, and stronger).With that said, you MUST password protect your server and invite people by invitation only.  Else you will be swamped with cheaters that have no other aim than to grief as many bases as they can.  Generally I wouldn't attribute fault to the developers or games for people being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, however the developer has made no effort to stop this beyond EAC (which only stops CheatEngine).  Admins have no tools included in the game to check for cheats, nor do they have a way to IP ban and dupping is terribly easy to do.You'll also find the multiplayer configuration file to be a bit wonky.  For instance, my guild's DS which I administer had a setting to prevent attacks/damage on bases when someone logs off.  My entire guild was offline and we wake up the next morning to find it raided.  Our guild likes PVP not Player Structure Vs Player, but real, Player v Player.  Naturally we were annoyed and we sought to find the ""cheater/haxor"", and come to find out it was someone we knew was not a cheater and had played several other games with us.  After questioning him he was able to demonstrate to us (and we were able to replecate it) that there is no real offline protection if there is any online protection (in which we had it set so structures were weaker when online).There are many little ""glitches"" like this that can build up to a big annoyance factor that could cause many players to rage quit.However, I can honestly tell you this: I might get annoyed and leave the game for a while, but I find myself strangely drawn back to the game after a couple of months of ""chilling"" the game.  The replay vaule of this game is quite high and by the time you come back to play again, there are new biomes, mobs, tactics, blocks, traps, etc, so I can't hold a straight face and tell you this game is not fun or worth the money because I'd be lying.Buy this game, buy it for a friend, tell the devs to fix multiplayer :)			"

								Me and my group just started this game.. we have been playing dayz togethor from 3+ years.. but this game is so amazing even in alpha.. Finally a game which actually feels like a survival game.  after playing 50+ hours in a week, i will try to tell about the game in points .....* Zombies feel like zombies.* Game is hard to survive, especially in the beginning. * You are actually scared and many times have to run for your life when you are starting out.* Map is infinite. Literally. So much to explore and enjoy.* Night time is awesome when you have to barricade some place with your friends and hide till its day again.* Buildings are all enterable, lootable and you can move around furniture and stuff to barricade.* PvP is also there, but right now PvP and PvE in this game are balanced nicely. I hope it stays that way.* You can make underground bunkers/bases. or If you prefer to be visible, you can make a giant castle xD* Soon, more places to explore will be added and vehicles, which will make this game epic.* Most importantly, this game is Fun !! Loads of FUN with your friends!!Also, i'd like to add that some of you prefer high quality graphics, but this is one game which is all about the gameplay. Like everyone else is saying this is the Minecraft version of Dayz but trust me, its way better, in every way. ;)			"

								7 Days to Die is a post-apocalyptic sandbox game by the aptly-named indie-developer The Fun Pimps. Part role-playing, part crafting, and part base-defense, the overall game takes place in the area surrounding Navazgane County, Arizona, some years after a third World War took place. Whether due to the radiation or some bio weapon, no one knows, but the resulting virus transformed most of the surviving population into the re-animated dead. And, much like the monsters in Stephen King’s Cell, they act as a single-minded being.Your automatic and understandable thought in looking at this game for the first time is that it looks a great deal like an upgraded Minecraft. In a way, you’re not wrong, and that’s what makes it play so well. The genius of this game is that the creators took what they knew already worked and built on top of it with new features and twists. So, the voxel-based world is built temporarily in a “block” form, though it’s cleverly designed in a way that buildings and roads look much more complex that the “Q-Bert-esque” world you see in most sandbox games.Naturally, crafting is where you’ll create the tools and weapons you’ll need to survive this post-nuclear world. The crafting is done via a recipe matrix, just as Minecraft is, but it’s been expanded to a 5×5 grid and has been designed so that now you won’t feel a constant need to keep a wiki page open in a side-browser to remember a recipe. Depending on the resources in your inventory, the possible recipes you can build, with what you currently have, will show up on a list next to the crafting grid. It’s still up to you to lay them out in the correct configuration, but once you create the recipe once, you can then simply click on the name of the recipe and it will automatically pull the ingredients out of your inventory. It’s a simple, and yet very welcome feature.The scavenging and resource system in the game fits perfectly with its post-apocalyptic theme. You also have a hunger and thirst meter so you’ll need to be mindful of where you can find water or food, and it’s done in a way to be interesting but not annoying. Resources in the world come in the appropriate form of scrap metal, wood planks, pieces of cloth, etc. Some resources can be picked by hand or dug up like certain plants or mineral resources, but the majority of the resources you collect will come from scavenging with tools. With a fire-ax, you can cut down a tree or a telephone pole. A pick-ax can break concrete walls or break up iron plating . Scattered randomly around the world are broken metal panels, steel beams, and piles of old garbage. From these, you’ll find all kinds of things you’ll use to build other items. Some can even be broken down further. At one point, I searched an old rusted car and found some hubcaps which could be broken down into scrap metal pieces, which could then either be used to create reinforced plating for my walls or used to create iron ingots for making tools or to craft the game’s vast assortment of booby-traps and explosives.Exploration has to be approached very carefully, since you are having to watch the safety of your surroundings as well as how many hours you’ll have to explore before the sun goes down and all Hades breaks loose. This goes doubly for when you venture into one of the towns where the urban ruins are surrounded by many more zombies and the dark narrow hallways and stairwells in the multi-story buildings introduce new tactical challenges. But all of these things make for exactly the kind of gameplay you want in a post-apocalyptic title.A great main feature is the way the game approaches structure integrity and physics. All building materials have different strengths and weaknesses and weight comes into play with that. Just as in the real world, you can’t just keep attaching block after block of wood horizontally in the air and expect it to hold. At some point it’s going to tip over and crash down without support. Wood, however, can be built further out than dirt, and metal much further than either of them — especially if it’s reinforced with truss work. Step too far out on a decaying roof and your body weight will cause you to collapse the chunk your standing on and bring you down with it. I learned this the hard way when I got on a warehouse roof, thinking I had outwitted the zombies below, and smashed right through the ceiling and into the auto repair shop below where they were waiting. Eventually, you’ll catch yourself actually thinking like a true scavenger when you approach a ruined building, quickly assessing how it’s built and if it’s safe. It’s one of those moments that really adds to the immersion. And the physics really shine for those crazy I-wonder-if-this-will-work moments, as it did when I blew up a line of gasoline cans at the base of a broken apartment complex and watched in amusement and shock as the building started to tip and then completely collapsed.The game is surprisingly complex and if it does have a weakness at all (assuming you consider it a weakness), it’s a realization that there is a lot under the hood and the game isn’t going to tell you what it is. It’s the same initial learning-curve that Minecraft players experience the first time, and one where you’ll want to at least give a quick-glance to a wiki site at the very beginning and get at least SOME idea of what tools do what. I was dead multiple times before I realized the sleeping bag I had crafted served as a selectable re-spawn point, and that I could actually have more than one if I clicked on the “tent” symbol on my map. I also struggled to find certain resources to build common tools, only to realize that I was simply in an area where the dead trees didn’t have the wood necessary for it. Or the fact that when you die, you lose the items in your hot-bar but keep the items in your backpack so the balance between “what you use” and “what you protect” becomes much more important. And then there’s the zombies.Zombies can hear you, smell you, and see you. They aren’t just lumbering hulks that walk around with no real goal. There are 15 different types: the shrieking spider zombie, the huge acid-vomiting Infected Policeman, the ground-crawling and the vicious and fast-moving Infected Dog just to name a few. Each one with its own attack, movement, and discernible noises. The zombies are affected by light (with the exception of the dogs) and so you find them in the daytime moving slower and much less intelligently. But when the sun goes down… well… that’s when everything changes. When the sun is down and the light is no longer inhibiting them, the zombies go from lumbering undead to ultra-fast monsters to begin hunting you down. Torches and campfires can temporarily slow them, but only as long as they are in the light, and if you haven’t prepared you’ll be dead before you realize you screwed up.7 Days to Die achieves exactly what it sets out to be. It’s a fun and intense post-apocalyptic sandbox with all the right mix of base-defense, scavenging, and exploration. There are an incredibly large amount of things to do in it, and though it’s still considered an early-release game, it feels surprisingly feature-complete even with what it has in its current state. Developers The Fun Pimps mention they still have a large road-map of features they are going to add, including new biomes, new zombies, and new points of interest which include an overall story revolving around the truth behind the zombie outbreak. Highly Recommended "

								This game is incredibly fun to play with friends, but there remain major issues. This game is a RAM hog and also has some FPS/rendering issues. Anyone playing on an i5/8gb ram/R9 build should be able to play this game on Ultra, not on Low with no shader detail. Have friends with i7/16gb builds that experience major RAM usage and issues trying to up to Ultra. It's actually quite frustrating that there is such a lack of optimization this far into the development cycle. There needs to be less focus on silly things, such as painting, and more focus on making the game enjoyable to play for the user. Glitching minibikes are also a major frustration. Add in that planting mushrooms on top of one another is a major glitch. You can't get them out, you can't destroy them/they never go away/create major lag in the area... I could go on... I recommend the game, but the developers need to get the major stuff right before making things like paintable textures.			"

								Once you get past it's graphics and interface, which could be somewhat improved, this game is pure survival gold. Whether you prefer to play solo or with friends(or enemies), this gem of a game will keep you entertained for a long time with its content.The best way to describe this game is as a mix of Minecraft crafting and creativity combined with best parts of other zombie survival games. Personally, the best features of the game are the game's atmosphere and zombie herds. Yup, herds, like The Walking Dead comic herds. Not so great in number(20-30 zombies) but every once in a while(with increasing frequency) they'll stumble past your house and either go around it or start tearing it down while you're inside praying they don't get in and gathering your most valuable stuff, ready to try and make a break for it in case they get inside. These herds give you new goals in the game, as unlike in Minecraft, you cannot build a home which will be completely safe with 1 layer of dirt, and will force you to try to constantly improve your home, run for your life and keep you on your toes. If you also set zombies to run at night, this game turns from a survival to a horror game.Might just be the best survival game I have ever played.			"

								Overall an amazing survival experience. It allows you to be inventive, strategic, and diverse in your techniques. So far my favorite zombie survival game.+ Crafting gives a wide array of options, allowing you to bring more shape to your forts, craft weapons suitable to your style, and give a more unique play strategy.+ Multiple types of zombies, but nothing overly ridiculous. The quick, the ranged, the tough, the animal type. The ""realistic"" idea of irl zombies.+ Several stats to keep an eye on including: health, energy, hunger, thirst, temperature. Making it more than just a zombie genre, but truly a survival one.+ Multiplayer works very well for this game in terms of gameplay, allowing both PvE and PvP to fit very well.- Updates are rare, which is a shame since the few updates introduced greatly increased the games likability.-/+ Items respawn unless chosen otherwise in the settings. But most players include them in their game, so if you don't like item respawns keep an eye on what games you're joining.-/+ Maximum health is lost on death. Making dying a bit more threating than just losing your loot.-/+ Cheat mode can be included in the game to spawn items. But whether or not a lobby has this chosen is shown before joining.			"

								I have progressively updated this review from game go to present day, want to skip to final thoughts go to the bottom of the review.-------------------------------------------------------------------Been rather excited for this game in a long time, and now alpha 5 hits steam !The video says it all on the store page, so I advise you sit and watch that.Its a game of great scope and its only just started with content, yes its another zombie survival but it has enough going for it that breaks it away from the other 23 games out there so check it out guys and girls as its pretty dam good.I like to state I love the destruction model this game engine has. Like its immediate close comparison MINECRAFT it has the same cube construction world and therefore has the same sandbox element of creativity and destructibility. This game though unlike MC, has a far more survival aspect with the need to drink, eat and rest. Ammo and guns are ripe yet are very valuable.The graphics are a touch basic at this stage and some things are nice to look at and some things are plain ugly (like the hands). But its alpha and looks I been told are superficial over game play (though a nice looking game doesn't hurt either !)The map of the game area is not very large at this time but of course there is so much yet planned and I am sure this will be added to.You start out in the wilderness, It becomes important to find shelter/supplies and build a safe house QUICKLY. As soon as dark approaches zombies become the things out of 28 days later and run, rip and claw at the very building and you at a horrifying ferocity.Many a time I thought I was safe in the attic only to be swarmed by zombies that got up !The game has also a great user friendly crafting system. No wiki needed to make stuff here as its as friendly to craft as like say in Terraria. There is a wiki though if you so wish to refer to for extra ease.http://7daystodie.gamepedia.com/CraftingALPHA 7.6 out and reviewed :We come a long way from version 5 when I first sat down to review this game. It has expended its map, more zombie types have been added and a major graphic & lighting overhaul has been implemented.The crafting system has been expanded, and you now have a furnace / camp fires / cooking, plus much more. This game is more now so in direct competition with Dayz and like but heads over and beyond that comparison when you have the lovely terrain morphing that lets you build underground bases, raise buildings to the ground and punch holes through anything to escape impending death. I mean what game has the scenario ;""Your in a tense situation, up stairs in the loft. A wandering horde has *smelt* your immediate proximity and the zombies claw there way in through the windows and breaking the door down. But they can not reach you by the ladder you deliberately broke, so instead they instinctively start to claw and chew at the surrounding beams/walls of the house supports causing a slow but impending situation with structural security! I thought at first I may have to jump down and try and fight my way through (probable death) but I go and place a fuel barrel near the corner of the loft, firing at it causes an explosion that blows a hole through the floor but also the roof. I jump through the hole and make my way up and out to the roof of the building making my hastily escape.""The game has got great scope and even now is SO MUCH FUN single player or a friend or two in co-op and I know we have a real gem here with yet so much more growth promised and coming.The updates as you can see, from Alpha 5 to now Alpha 7.6 are coming regular enough to keep this project healthy and interesting. (Unlike the SLOW ongoing update response from Dayz team - YAWN).ALPHA 7.9 out and reviewed :Lots again changed to the crafting system, more items added & lots tweaked. Mining is now a little more tricky and involves more time spent finding all that sweet ore.New FX added, Bloom and HD hands. Little things that make a lot of difference candy wise.This game is shaping up to be a really good survivalist game. But striking that balance of fun/challenge is still of course being tweaked and streamlined.Lately I have built my first base out in the wilderness. Nothing fancy but using materials like concrete and wood planks I have shaped a defensive base, with camp fire for food and a forge for building materials. I have a mine in the centre that spans tunnels and caves deep below, its great what you can do in this game.ALPHA 8.2 out and reviewed :Just released and is superb !New sun affects, better crafting eliminating Wiki use altogether now. With every patch so many changes come out its brilliant and fresh and far to extensive to list here everything that was included in 8.2. Needless to say that they keep adding so many cool things to the game and its looking better after every patch.We now have wondering hordes, we now have materials that can be upgraded ie, wood planks to metal reinforced wood planks. So many building options just let your imagination go wild with how to make the ultimate fortress.Smooth terrain is the big change to, its now fully in and makes the world much more realistic. So no more looking like Minecraft from now on.I so look forward to whats to come, ...ALPHA 9 out and reviewed :WOW - what a major change we have here. RANDOM maps in glorious techno-realism.The beautiful new Randomly Generated Worlds A.K.A. Randomz-gane which have full gigantic cities, roads, rivers, lakes, cliffs, mountains, roadside and wilderness locations and feature all biome types.they have also reworked the entire in game GUI with new Art, Truetype fonts and many new features including fog of war, waypoints, friend tracking and recipe search.Buff System enhancements including, Broken Legs, Sprained Legs, Dysentery, Drowning, Concussions and First Aid Kits. New rendering enhancements including soft shadows and underwater effects added. In addition the player can now craft a full cloth armour set and use scrap iron build and upgrade forts. Folks this update is jammed packed with features!ALPHA 10.4Oh my, this game gets better and better. Every update since I first brought the game brings fourth a multitude of awesome sauce. Finely tuned Random worlds with a load of POI (points of interest) buildings / cities and estates to scrummage through.Crafting increased, with GUI further more tuned and twisted into a delight to use. With now a fully customised character system to play around with and multiple clothing options to obtain.This game is on sale as of 20th / 12 / 2014 half price and really suggest you pick this baby up.ALPHA 12.1Things just got better, My god, for what a great looking game with better random gen / scenery.Crafting be overhauled again, UI improved no end.Feels so much better as a survival, balancing is getting there to near perfect.ALPHA 15 Official - NOW OUT !This is where we are at, 6th October 2016,,,Yes, this game is still getting amazing leaps in refinement and update joy. Looks the best ever with distent terrain. The GUI for crafting has been refined and tweaked. Zombies are more fluid and animate better with more variety. Updated Unity Engine that plays reasonably well on decent Pc's. I run this thing on a 980ti with a Over Clocked i7 and get near to 60fps all the time. It dips when  loads of zombies are on screen though so still has a fair way with regards to tweaking.The game has come along way, providing without doubt the best sand box survival this side of Steam and STILL in my mind holds the crown for best survival.Final Words...With total world destruction in a true sandbox world, zombies, guns, base building/defense, single player or multi and great continued support from the Pimps I am so digging this game !

								Let me start off and say this, I hate early access games! I tired multiple times to get into this game and HATED IT AT FIRST. That being said one night I decided to read a guide and see if maybe I didnt like the game because I didn't understand it. After that the game became pretty fun BUT when I convinced my friends to get the game THIS GAME BECAME LIKE CRACK. PROS______+ Basically ""adult Minecraft""+ In-depth building system (way more so than Minecraft)+ Customizable Difficultly settings!+ Huge map / Random gen map+ Hard! (It gives you a reason to keep playing after day 5)+ Fun Co-op!+ AT ITS CURRENT STATE IS VERY PLAYABLE+ Already so much and hopefully much more to be added!CONS______- Graphics are a bit of a turn off- Do not spawn with friends at start (but after you meet up you can set spawn with each other)- Zombies can sound close but be far and vise versa- Online has many ""sketchy"" players, needs better anti-cheat- Needs more player customization- NEEDS MORE FREQUENT UPDATES!- with friends is addicting as fudge______To sum up think about it like this...Did you like Minecraft/Garrys Mod? Its alot like that but harder and more realistic.Do you like survival games? This game can be set to a hard♥♥♥♥♥difficulty, personally I like my games hard.Do you have friends and like COOP games? This is definatly one of the better ones.Are you going to ease up on the game and take it for what it is rather than what its not? Good, you should do that.Got 25 bucks? Buy it. Easily worth it.			"

Although still in Alpha i can 100% say that i've seen games released by major studios in a way worse state than this ""alpha"". Very active developers, releasing patches very often.If you want a game that's really about survival, building and crafting - this is the one.			"

								7 Days to Die is a very good game. You use your character, which you either create or use a preset, to scavenge, farm fight, and survive in one of two map options, Navezgane, their hand crafted survival map, or a randomly generated world. Gameplay Elements:      You are most of the early game, in an up hill battle trying to keep your hunger and thirst, along with a third, ""wellness"" bars high, while trying to avoid zombies, and if you play multiplayer, people. You have to manage your inventory well, you never know when you will get something very vital to survival, but not have enough room for it, but that goes without saying in most games like these. On another note, every 7 days, as the name implies, a horde of zombies appears, And as the weeks go on, the hordes get progressively harder. This adds a really good pacing to the game, keeping you on your toes. Things I personally don't really like:- My computer specs WELL surpass the reccomended specs, but still get god-awful frames. - Ehhh, the schematics annoy me sometimes, but they do add a good gameplay element if you look at it that way. Conclusion      All in all this game is rather good. 8.5/10. If you disagree, with anything I said here, or if I have said anything wrong about this game, please let me know in the comments! "

								I've been looking for a realistic zombie game for a while now, and while this is not perfect (headshots don't always kill, very few improvised weapons, you can cure yourself, etc.) it's pretty close, and it's in Alpha anyways so it's subject to change.  It's pretty darned satisfying when a biter steps on one of your mines for the first time, and it's not to difficult to take out a few of them even starting out after you get the crossbow.  It's also pretty cool to build up some deffences like sharp sticks and stuff and watch the bastrids kill themselves at night.The learning curve is pretty steep though, so you may want to look at some videos or whatever before you start.Starter tip:  Make a stone ax (stick, from punching a bush; plant fiber, from punching grass and crafting it up; and a sharp stone, made from a small stone you can find on the ground).  It's an ok starting weapon (though you may want to trade it in for an iron/spiked club when you get the chance), and you can use it to chop down trees and dig clay to make molds for ingots.Bonus starter tip:  Get a ranged weapon (a crossbow works) or make a good melee weapon (at least an iron club) before you barge into a house looking for loot.  As a matter of fact, don't barge in.  Wait for the zeds to come out and then snipe 'em.Anyways, it's damned fun and *mostly* bugless as far as I can see.  Worth the price too, but if you can't afford it then you could probably wait for a sale.  Then you should deffinitely get it.			"

								I really enjoy this game! I started it in alpha 14 and feel like it's a complete game even now (although I have seen some of the things they have upcoming in the next update and it looks like it will be even better!). The co-operative play is very enjoyable, as a new player to survival games, it has just enough of a good scare factor to keep me interested without getting sick and tired of dying all the time. With the cheat mode enabled, I was able to ease my mom into playing and now we just play the game with the regular settings and she loves the game as well. It's become a family event to play together. Each time I play, there is always something new to learn and build on. Trying out the game with different settings changes the challenge of it, so it hasn't gotten boring yet and there is a big update coming soon. If your on the fence about playing the game, take the leap, it's worth it. It's great as a solo adventure or grab a friend or two and have fun setting up house and cleaning out the land infested with zombies.			"

Minecraft with zombiesI like this game since it nicely combines crafting and survival.pros:- In a better state as Alpha than some so called AAA games on release. Hardly any major bugs.- Many personal gameplay options already integrated in the interface. More, if you manipulate the .xml config files.- Graphics got signifcantly better over time and look now (A15.1) quite decent.- The long Alpha state shows that devs care about their game and so does their communication. No customer relationship agents but the real devs talking to you. Nice! Would you rather prefer the game being released half-baked and all else as costly DLC?- Some of the medical background is actually pretty close to reality. Golden Rod for example really helps ... with bladder problems though.cons:- Since it is an Alpha game your savings might get lost, corrupted or buggy once a new release comes out. Be aware of this; in particular, if you use mods.- Not too keen on some zombies look-wise, but hey these are small issues.- The ""Resurrector"" & ""Behemoth"" zombies should help against the late game dullness.- Since it is (nearly finished) work in progress, the balancing is an issue with some updates breaking the gameplay or render stuff useless.

Alone makes the game hell of a challenge, especially to past the first horde night (7th day) and yes, you will die alot and give up alot, but every time you play, it is never the same experience.Playing with friends makes surviving harder, due too food & water depleting fast, without good water sources ( eg. lakes / rivers ) and good hunters, the team wont last long :).

								To be perfectly honest, this is the first voxel-based open-world game that's grabbed my attention since Minecraft - and as a former developer at Mojang, that says a lot.The graphics are magnificent, the audio is the perfect blend of realistic and creepy, and the crafting is something that other games shoudl take note of. I'm enthusiastic enough about 7 Days To Die that I run my own server for my friends. Overall, the only negative worth mentioning is that the updates are few and far between, and it doesn't seem like The Fine Pimps concentrate on bug fixing, which can make things awkward at times.

 The Real Deal of Zombie Survival 7 Days to Die is an excellent zombie survival game.  Survive alone or with others in a post-apocalyptic world.  PROS:-Alpha 13 introduced a redesigned crafting system-Alpha 13's new leveling system -Alpha 13 also introduced some new graphics effects-Alpha 13 has also added in temperature that varies biome to biome, and effects how the player character thrives  (I.E: Stay too hot for too long and you go thirsty).-Large and diverse maps (When randomly generated)-Customability of game settings allows for games to be easy, or absolutely brutal-Voxel based building system CONS:-Optimization:  While 7 Days runs smoothly most of the time, sometimes it really struggles to churn out frames.  This typically happens in the cities, where fog effects and large number of zombies are roaming. -Online play issues:  Lag spikes occur frequently-General bugs:  Too many to list, but they are expected in an Early Access title.  Beware:  Sometimes zombies may sneak up on you without making a sound until they strike you.-New features of Alpha  13:  As far as I know this is the first pass for some of the features in 7 Days, including temperature.  Some of these features need rerfining.NEUTRAL:-Graphics:  7 Days to Die's graphics are good for the type of game that it is.  Don't expect anything spectacular, but they do the job. 8.5/10 as of 12/25/2015Looking forward to the future of 7 Days to Die			"

								Ah, where to begin. This is an early access alpha game, after over two years of being such. This doesn't count what ever time was before such that may have been used for development. The placing of blocks is rudimentary, you can't rotate them to various degrees and are stuck with building basic square and rectangle and octagonal shapes. Spacing between half and quarter blocks is exagurated to take up a whole section, even if it's only a sign on the wall. The lack of choices in the basic game with out modification is dry and very limited. Weapon choices are very limited.Animals which may roam the world (if they even spawn) are very limited. Zombies (if they even spawn now) are very limited and half the time glitch out with randomly missing parts while still trotting after you. There is no story line for the basic game in single player mode. Over 75% of what was promised by the go fund me for the game hasn't even been touched upon even after over two years. Crafting now takes from minutes in previous versions to hours now. And these are small amounts of things. Material usage is multiplied by ten times what previous versions used to create things. Duct tape is used to repair everything, yes, even your guns. I'd like to see some idiot fix a gun with duct tape and fire it.Everything degrades expotentially when you repair it, there is no maintaining anything, it will always fall apart even if you fix it. Once you actually build a base after spending hours upon hours doing so a group of five to ten zombies can buldoze through it in less than ten minutes. I wonder what sort of milk zombies drink that they can bash through a solid cement/concrete/ or steel wall with their bare hands and keep all their bones intact.The resources to make ammo, especially brass is so scarce that you may as well give up on making any ammo unless you are on a mp server with some sort of mod with copper and zinc. For servers, once you hit about 20+ players there are now these odd black graphics glitches, lines, black blocks, or jsut a full black screen. If you go near a fridge, forge, capfire when it's running the sound will usually bug out and cause a string of errors that wont stop all the while cutting out all of your sound except for some odd buzzing noise. The dogs have been beefed up so they can one shot you, all the while being invincible to melee atacks. I should also mention whats advertised on the 7 days to die web page as already being in game but never has. ""Dynamic Story Generation – The story unfolds through our “Dynamic Story Generation System” which guides the player to other survivors, better loot and undiscovered Points of Interests through story note quests.""""Looting, Mining and Crafting – Loot and mine a multitude of items and ingredients to create hundreds of items including melee weapons, guns, traps, generators, motorized tools, motion detectors, landmines, auto-turrets, salves, potions  and more using our 5×5 grid Crafting System.""Of course, I would caution against believing half of what is advertised to be in the game, simply because it's not. It's just false advertising. All in all when ever the basic bugs are worked out of this game and everything which was promised to be in it ever arrives it might be really phenominal. As for now the only thing which makes it even slightly playable or enjoyable is finding a good online community to play with on a heavily modded server. Other wise it's jsut another severly limited alpha game which is years old and shows the lack of either creativity or intelligence from it's developers.  "

Early Access Review
								12/27/16: Several major updates have added: a small campaign, somewhat better optimization, better and more graphics variety, vehicles, different zombies, zombified bears, a basic random world generator etc. All in all pretty slow but steady progress. Still in early access though and might not work with different setups.[/i]A few caveats from previous versions are that the latest version isn't compatible with previous save files unless you do some heavy modifications. TL;DR: MineCraft on crack, running around with the sh*ts and an axe simulator.Pros: What's better than a chainsaw? A GIANT DRILL!No dealing with @sshole players, trolls, and cheaters again! Just start your own game or find one of many well managed servers.Totally 100% destructible ""voxel"" environment!  - Locked door? HULK SMASH! No Problem!Build structures with real physics. [Add frames and trusses, unless you enjoy being a meat pancake!]Cross-Platform multiplayer AND CO-OP; this is an overlooked feature in many games. Play with your console peasant friends!Getting Crunk off grain alcohol and beer! :)Good crafting system - still needs work but a great startZombie ""senses"" A.I that can hear and smell you!No boring lockpicking minigame: either a delay or no wait depending on server/game rules!Easily custom tuned games - create your own apocalypse. Lots of settings to change.Randomly generated maps and biomes.Frequent developer updates and active community.Vehicles a scooter LOL!More Zombie wildife like bears....Cons:You will still find the trolls they are in every game. Also, rarely you will find a hacker but I found them to be mostly minding their own business. This is again, a problem in every game. It's really an arms race between the devs and hackers - it can not truly be solved ever - report,  switch servers or of course: start your own game!It is however nowhere as bad as Rust or DayZ, filled with psychopaths!A lot of the inventory, crafting and items in the game need work or are constantly changing!Not enough meele weapons at the moment.Breaking your leg from 4ft drops...seriously wtfGetting your face mauled of by packs of zombified dogs...biggest risk while first starting they are too fast!Zombified Bears are tanks and will ♥♥♥♥ your♥♥♥♥♥♥up!Dated graphics: hopefully this will change soon.

								If you want a good zombie suvival game, this is literally the best game out there to come of that genre and to be the best for a long long time.Even if you want no zombies and to get used to playing the game, you can turn them off and play yourself to get familiar with it, or better yet like myself play on hard difficulties and make looting percentages rather low to give yourself a 7DTD fallout 3 feel world ending.

								Epic zombie game with an unmatched crafting and gameworld sculpting system. Although it's still in early access the game has been very playable since it went on sale.If there are any negatives I would say it would be the graphical style and relatively boring zombie models  but this really doesn't impact on what is a really great game.

Early Access Review
								I played this game before Steam and was a very excited supporter of early access. Most of my 200+ hours were spent in the first few months came out. I enjoyed the crafting options for buildings, tools, weapons. The combat was loads of fun, and I had an amazing time using the many different ways to kill zombies with traps, weapons and environmental destruction. I was hooked after a Gas station explosion chained to all the oil drums as a zombie horde attacked.I know games change in Early Access and I do feel that I got my money's worth for the time I played. Sadly, I currently find the game unplayable. Some of the biggest issues for me are... - Zombies can hit you farther out than you can hit them with a melee weapon (Absolutely horrendous in multi player, but still bad in single player). I have a 2-3 foot spiked club and can't hit the zombie punching me from 4-6 blocks away!?! - The cross hair targeting for any weapon is randomly inaccurate. (Enjoy wasting all that ammo you spent hours gathering resources for and forced time spent crafting it up?)  - Crafting has become overly complex, not in options, but with the steps you have to go through to even find what you need to craft in the GUI menu's. (Can't see the recipe for the mini bike frame, unless inside the forge GUI) - AI glitching. (Watching zombies circle 4 blocks for a few mins before killing it or having one run away from you in the middle of a fight, is funny to watch but not great game play.) - Terrain glitches (Fall through the world to your death anyone?) I'm not including frame rates, or view distance issues, due to not being able to test properly on different computers.Many people have found ways to work around the glitch-ridden combat and just accept the obtuse crafting mechanics, but I don't feel that I should have to do that for a game about killing zombies and crafting for base creation. I would rather watch it on YouTube.Being able to have a zombie fall and crawl at me, after hitting them in the leg is great, but if I can't attack or kill it due to glitches, sloppy targeting, or a weapon blocking the screen, then I personally can't enjoy it. At this point I feel, that having more time and money may have caused a loss of focus on game play. I loved this game before and want to again. Hopefully the Fun Pimps will be able to correct these issues at some point. If that happens, I will happily change this review.			"

								At the moment the game is worth the cost, while ai can be a bit dumb, its still miles better then dayz's zombies. (although thats not hard) The crafting system seems interesting, and quite easy to use. The server setup is nice, giving quite a few flexable options to play around with as well as a couple mode options other then the main game. The block style construction blends seamlessly together to create a nice environment that allows for the zombies and you to have complete control of your environment while still looking pretty and natural. The transition from day to night can put you on edge sending you scrambling to collect as much as you can and fortify up for the coming evening. I was able to find a good bit of resources before i was forced inside the house I chose. It was interesting, as soon as night fell you heard the zombies come alive. I think a lot of games fail in audio ambiance, however the rabid noises that i heard outside of my building made me believe all hell was being raised loose. I did find that if i placed a object above a ladder is seemed to bug out the ai slightly but more and more kept pouring into the house blocking off my exit. Due to a slight screw up on my end they managed to make it into the attic and after a brief but hectic fight that only served to draw even more of the buggers, i took the risk and hopped down to the porch overhang and from there went running into the woods with the town behind me. Even though i died shortly after, i can't wait to try again after a little break.			"

Early Access Review
								This game would be like if Left 4 Dead and minecraft had a baby... BAM! Crafting survival game and it's the best of both worlds.  When you start out you just loot the world, kill your own food, and then you desperately find a place to make a shelter or hold up in the abandoned buildings at night hoping no zombies find you. Then you will die, and die, and die... and then you play with your friends and you both die and die and die until you finally level up enough and start crafting good stuff. PROS:-Nice looking 3D environment with physics! No random fort building in the sky for this game it would fall on your head and kill you. Plus there are many different Biomes to explore from snowy mountains to deserts. -Crafting adds so much more value to the game rather than running around just shooting zombies. -They throw everything at you when you least expect it. Hostile animals, hordes of zombies & zombie dogs to randomly attack your base even during the day. It makes for great gameplay because you never know what is going to happen and when. - Leveling up system that improves your crafting and stats. Plus you get hunger and thirty stats adding to the survival aspect. It's fun to see your character evolve into a wasteland bad mofo especially when you start out naked.-You get sick and can break bones adding to the realistic feel of the game. You never think while playing this game ""yeah right that would never happen in real life."" well... minus the zombie apocalypse that is, that might not ever happen in real life. CONS:-A little too difficult for single player alone, it's really only good with co-op.-Hackers. If you forget to set your server to private anyone can join and I've had several hackers who will join my game just to mess things up.-Too challenging to upgrade items, weapons, etc. The game didn't start that way but it keeps getting updated and every time it gets harder and more unbalanced. You run around for days with a crappy bow that can barely kill anything, making it almost impossible to loot the houses where zombies spawn in hoards when you play single player.-The modeling for characters is really weak/ugly and there are few options for things like hair styles. You basically end up looking like your buddy so it would almost be better to scrap it and just give us 5 or so pre-made characters to choose from.-No hints or tutorials. You just get thrown in, figure it out for yourself genuis! A quick “how to craft” tutorial would be really beneficial to the first time player, especially since it’s challenging from the moment you are thrown into the world with almost nothing. -very minimal lag but there is some, especially when you get overwhelmed with the undead. But the bugs in this game impressively non-existent.In short, there is no causal play for this game. It keeps you on edge the entire time and although it’s very difficult to play alone it’s still well worth it. You can easily drop hours on this game and not even know where the time went. Worth $25 bucks? Totally! It feels like a completed game even in just the late Alpha stage and I’m excited to see where it goes from here.			"

								I keep coming back to this game as they as new content and for the most part I like the direction they are taking with it.There have been many great steps forwards from the first version I played.At the moment it is still lacking that little something though: you have built a base gathered a load of resources and it just gets to that point where you are feeling... now what... At the moment that's the point I put the game away and wait for another content update.However the devs have promised that there is content on the way to try and fill that void. Interactions with NPCs, random missions, stuff to make you feel it is worth carrying on. So watch this space, and keep you fingers crossed.			"

Early Access Review
								I noticed there are a quite a few negative reviews added recently about the game so I was a little reluctant to give it a try.  That’s why I decided to write my first review - I do not think the reviews are representative of the game, they nearly put me off buying a game that I am enjoying a lot.First thing I really like is that you can play this game exactly how you want to.  You want creative mode for building, farming and exploring? It’s there.  You're fed up with the zombies? you can remove them or reduce their numbers, want more of a challenge? Make more zombies and give them the ability to run day and night or increase their health.  You can tailor the game exactly to your favourite gameplay.  As well as the menu options, the spawn settings are stored in XML files which you can edit to customise further still.The balance of the whole game IMO is very good.  Everything has been designed in such a way that you have to get out and explore.  To begin you can make a few items/tools/weapons.  To unlock more you have to read schematics or books which you can only find by looting buildings.  The better schematics and weapons are mostly found in the cities which is where you find the most dangerous zombies, forcing you to take risks if you want to progress.A lot of these survival games are all about grinding materials, with 7DTD I never really feel like it’s a grind, especially once you start getting decent tools.  Breaking safes can take a while but you normally get decent rewards for it.  You can very quickly get enough materials to build a basic house.  You can farm some of the plants and most of your materials will come from looting buildings and rubbish.The zombie types have been chosen well to give a good variety.  You are mostly safe to walk around during the day, but there are dogs and bears that still keep you on your toes, at night, everything is dangerous.  Some can climb, some have a ranged attack, some can run faster than others and some crawl around in the grass.The entire world is destructible, so you can dig into the ground and mine anywhere in the map, destroy, rebuild or fortify buildings etc.  The immersion -ambient sounds in the game are brilliant.  The wind, the howling of dogs at night and the footsteps of zombies all add up to a really good experience.  Many times I have been caught out by zombies creeping up on me and made me jump.  The graphics IMO are very good considering the size and detail of the maps.The only negative I have is the zombies seem to be able to see through walls, but the game is still Alpha so this may improve in future.

Early Access Review
								I'm really torn because I've put a lot of hours into this game but unfortuately with the direction the developers seem to be taking the game I just can't really recommend it to a new player. The game is very punishing to new players (and even veteran players). The game is getting better in some regards, but the cons outweigh the pros on this one.The following are things I enjoy about the game. TL;DR at the end.They've gone a long way to make the game look better. Nights feel like nights, forests feel like forests. Textures seem sharper, lighting is better. Over all the game just looks good.I personally like the new mechanic for gathering resources. Now you hit trees / rocks / ore and the items are deposited into your inventory. You get a little bit of wood for hitting a tree (which I attribute to you breaking off branches or something) then a bit payoff at the end. You don't need to mash your E key to pick up wood or stone that sprinkles itself all over the ground.With Alpha 13 they've added new animations and textures for all the zombies. For the most part the animations are good (there are a couple that are over-acted and pretty cheesy) and I think the textures look great. Zombies can now be dismembered and knocking the legs off of one turns it into a crawler. Only head or body shots will kill a zombie, and I think this an improvement.IF you can make it to the point of the game where you can craft guns and ammo, it can be kind of fun rolling through a city gunning down hordes, problem is that's a big IF. Crafting guns and ammo is gated behind skill books and to add another layer, tools for the forge to craft the rounds also require a random drop.Now on to the negatives:Resources are now streamlined to basically ""wood, meat stone"". This wouldn't really be a huge issue for me but the game already had a working system in place. Wood turned to planks and then to sticks with crafting recipes to go with it. Deer, pigs, rabbits already had their own meat and recipes for them in the game. The developers gutted perfectly functional systems for no reason other than to change and over simplify the game.The sheer amount of tedium in the game is overwhelming. Doors take forever to break down early on, cutting down trees, breaking stone, hell even digging dirt takes forever. The main counter point to this complaint is ""well you just need to skill up"" and yes that is correct. Eventually you skill up enough to get to the point where it's not nearly as boring but that leads me to the next, the skill system.Oh the skill system. Currently you have a wide range of skills that level from 0-100 with one perk (3 ranks that increase the quality of items you find). Sounds great, skills and niche roles are needed in a game like this and I'm happy to see it come to light. My problem is the grindy nature of these skills, some level well naturally, like blunt weapons and shotguns. The crafting skills are a chore where you'll spend your nights pooping out stone axes and bows just so you can create tools that do enough damage so you don't spend 30 hits to bust a wooden door down. So why not just level crafting naturally? You'll quit the game long before you accomplish that.Other skills like heavy armor basically become a dump stat for your points when you level up, because it requires you to get hit. However the games encourages you to not get hit so if you had hopes leveling up blunt weapons and heavy armor to tank hordes of zombies keep dreaming. Which reminds me..Combat needs a lot of love in this game. Zombies do a lot of damage and inflict a few different statuses (bleed, stun, infection). The only one I have a problem with is the stun. It lasts like 5 seconds and pretty much spells your death. Zombie dogs are basically infected heat-seeking missiles that most times kill you before you even realize what hit you. A good percentage of players just mod them out because they're so broken and frustrating to play with. So you'll die a lot and you'll basically get into this viscous cycle of losing wellness until you've bottomed out at 60 max HP / stamina.Every 7 days you get hit with a big horde of zombies that immediately rush your position tear down your defenses to get you. Some tweaking is needed here because even actively defending you're doomed to fail unless you either build way up in the air, or build way underground (to basically exploit their pathfinding, lets face it). Personally I think the idea of the 7 day super hordes should go. I'd rather have a more constant but manageable threat, but that's just my opinion, some players prefer the super hordes.All in all I feel like I've got my moneys worth out of the game, but I don't like the direction the game is going in. Instead of doing their own thing, the developers are trying to copy bits from other games but it just doesn't fit. The UI looks like a poor quality Ark UI and I've heard resource gathering is copying RUST (Never played it so I can't really verify that).TL;DR+Game environment is prettier+Resource gathering mechanic is less tedius (my 'E' key is happy).+Zombies look better, react to pain, dismemberment, rag-doll+Gun combat can be fun IF you manage to make it that far into the game.+Skill system on paper is something this game really needs.-Streamlined over-simplified resources-Overall tedium with construction / deconstruction / gathering-Skill system in practice needs a huge amount of re-balancing-Melee combat is not fun or rewarding. Early game you die, late game guns are always better.-Zombie dogs should probably just not exist.Other issues not expanded on:-Zombie spawning is broken and they materialize out of thin air-Weather survival is broken, Core temperature is 90F better cool off, what?

								I've been playing this game on and off since around alpha 6, so I thought it about time to write a review. Although I'm not recommending the game, that may change as development continues. However, the game has been in public alpha for a while now and I've yet to see it progress significantly towards the type of game I thought it could be.Issue I have: Poor quality zombies. The models are shocking, maybe these are just placeholder, but they've been there a while and look terrible. Unimaginative zombie spawn and AI. It's like the developers have used a really basic noise algorithm to desperse the zombie spawns, then quadruple it when near points of interest. If a zombie is chasing a player, another player could stand right next to it and it would just continue to chase the first, zZzZzzzz. Ridiculous zombie health. Getting a head shot on the most basic zombie, with full stamina and a hardly damaged weapon does not equal a kill. This might disapear when skills are introduced and I think it lessens the higher level you get, but really? Zombie appocalyspe rule No 1: Headshot = kill. Maybe there could be some more varied difficulty modes? Skill book to unlock the forge. This is just stupid and frustrating, why would anyone find that fun?I do like the building mechanics, creating frames that can then be upgraded with materials is one of the few innovative things I've found in this game. Pretty much everything else has been taken from other titles. So for a game that is basically a mash-up of Minecraft and DayZ, you will not have fun mining and base building and you will not get immersed in the world due to the awful graphics and the laughable zombies. I'm not entirely sure what they wre trying for tbh, but maybe they'll get there, some day. "

								After having watched some old lets plays from 2013, I was pretty psyched about this game. There's crafting and zombies, two of my favorite elements! I have tried other zombie/craft games that were fairly hyped up when they came, but this looked way cooler. I decided to look it up on steam, and to my surprise my brother whom I have always partnered up with in multiplayer games had it. After asking him if he wanted to do some zombiekilling, I suddenly had something in my inbox. My bro gifted it to me and told me to get my♥♥♥♥♥on his server, where several of his friends were as well. When I entered the world, I was pretty freaked out. I was in my underwear in a desert. All alone. Even though it was sunny and in the middle of the day, the sounds combined with the scenery made me incredibly uneasy. After checking the map I saw that I really couldn't be further away from their base. I freaked and ran towards them, and died about five times. (never claimed to be good) I finally spawned well within range,  and after a few minutes I found their base. Now, this was some next level fortification. After breaking a few bones trying to get in and not really managing to get anyones attention, a massive zombiehorde came towards me. I finally called my brother on the phone and forced him to show me how to get in. Upon entering they handed me full armor, guns, medkits, a place to put out a bed and showed me around. They really outdid themselves. There were common spaces and everything. After some time we moved up to the roof and started killing some zombones while they bolted past our fort. The next ingame day I was sent out on a scavenging mission (bro takes these kinda games really srsly), and it made me freak out. I had to deal with zombones all by my lonesome and be far away from camp, well until night time. And I still hadn't really learned anything useful about the game, seeing as they had provided me with everything before I could start asking questions. Being by yourself at night in this game without a proper base and proper knowledge is downright terrifying. Now, this was right before Alpha 11. The next time we ganged up to play our server was outdated and saves had been deleted. We had to do everything from scratch, and I finally really got to learn how to do crafting because I would die pretty fast if I didn't. I did get infected several times, broke several legs, and got dysentery more than I would like to admit. And I was loving every minute, while simultaneously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ my pants. I mean, I love their swagger but zombies are still terrifying.We are still trying to rebuild what we once had, but sitting at night and actually being scared because you could die at any moment is actually way more fun (and gruesome) than being safe and sound inside a fortress. This also goes for having to actually go out and gather/make every last little thing you need too. I still haven't been able to put in that many hours since I refuse to play it alone, but I love it!And after that long boring story; on to the game itself!As I stated, I have tried other games with the same elements. None of these have lived up to my expectations. I was terrified at the start of every last one of them, but that soon wore off. It just gets worse with 7d2d. The atmosphere created by the amazing sounds, the massive landscape with concealed valleys and mountains blocking your view, and the terrifying night/day shifts is just simply amazing. I wanna♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants when I play these kinda games. And I keep on doing that. There were some complications after Alpha 11 came out, but it is an early access after all. And from what I gather the pimps are pretty involved with their community and active as well, so in time this will probably be one of the greatest zombie mmos out there. Greatest game i've played for a long time, by far.			"

								Not my usual style of game but found it to be very enjoyable.  For me its more the foraging for materials while happening to keep an eye over your shoulder for an incoming zombie.  Also enjoy heading out with a friend and guarding while they run around grabbing loot.   It is a sandbox and suits many styles of play.   I would definitely recomend it to the player who enjoys a good coop but doesnt need directed quests or set goals.  I am not a PVPer so I cant really speak to that aspect of it but I do know the game is set up to support that type of play as well.Edit - 1/29/2016Its been a while so editing this review.  I have to say the comments above still stand.  I see people claiming to have monster systems and claiming game is laggy for them.  I'm playing on a very old system with half the specs usually mentioned and am playing it fine on some good graphic settings.  Seems strange that they would have the issues they are listing.   I see people attacking their programming skills, yet I have found very little wrong in this game as compared to other, full release games.  Should you buy it if you have an interest or hold out?  Personally I would recomend to buy it.  Its a fun game that still catches me off guard and makes me jump.  Is it hard?  Its a survival game.  I dont do survival games and I do ok with this, but yes, its difficult.  And yes, you can start up a game find yourself in some untenable situations.  Either ride it out or start another game.  The game has changed a lot while I've played it.  Most of the changes are strong improvements, creating more depth and a more interesting game.  Changes I've wondererd about when they first came out were refined into things I love about the game and this process is still going on.  At the end of the day this is one of my go to games that I keep coming back to.			"

								With about 45 hours played and several late night sessions with buddies, I am really enjoying myself with this game. As it is still in Alpha, obviously the game isn't perfect. But with that being said this is easily one of the best early access games I have had the oppurtunity to be a part of. The game has an awesome feel to it, from the eerie noises that come randomly, to the distinct sound each set of zombie makes I have no choice but to appreciate the effort that has already been put into this game. One of my favorite things so far is the unique biomes that 7D2D has implemented. From the cool, innocent looking spring setting with green grass and red chrysanthumums, to the winter/snow biome with unique zombies for that enviroment. You'll be looking for an airdrop one day that takes you from the desert to the creepy wasteland into the city and the next thing you know savage dogs will be chasing you and you'll be wishing you stayed back at camp!There's many fun and exciting moments to be had in 7D2D, so if anyone reading this is into zombie survival games I would highly recommend this one. + With frequent updates and patches from the Devs, it's hard not to want to support this up and coming gem.

								I don't usually write reviews, play early access games or really go out of my way to play zombie games, however I gave 7DTD a shot and got completely hooked. The combination of sandbox, crafting, exploration and survival really works well, I have been looking for something like this for a long time and TFP really hit the nail on the head.The devs (TFP) are good, you get some kind of communication pretty much every day on the forums, updates are pretty frequent and they have IMO done a good job with the game so far, though there is still a lot of work ahead.The game is fun single player, but IMO better in MP. One thing I do have to say is that there are a lot of complaints about hackers in multiplayer, this however is only a problem if you play on an open server, personally I play peer to peer or on private servers, so I have not come across a single hacker so far. It is something to look out for though if you like to join random servers.Overall though, the game is great, I would encourage anyone to give it a go, you may well be surprised at how good it really is. Also don't be put of by all the hacker complaints as its not every single multiplayer game that has problems with them and they can be easily avoided for most of us unless you absolutely must play on an open server.

Verdict: 'Its solid, but we're going to need a bit more floss and needles, think the face is starting to fall off a little.'P.S Got this game when it was in early, early alpha, when the dogs were straight outta Resident Evil and the lovely Spider Monkey Men were beginning to roam on the range, and my nightmares.

Early Access Review
								This game is by far the best zombie survival game you will ever play and this isnt even beta. I read reviews about the game being to predictable and that every 7th day is the most dangerous time to survive but I will tell you that is not true. I purchased 2 copies for my son and I to play and for over 150 hours we survived with no cheats. We have built several different types of structures to hold back the zombies including ones that may just be glitchs or exploits and we have found out some interesting things that may or may not change with later builds. Random gen is the only way we like to play. The unknown is what makes the game fun.Wood shack.. Like everyone else the first home we built was a little 10x10 wood shack. No windows, wedge shingled roof with center support with ladder for roof access. This shack only lasted a few days before we needed to seek something stronger.Underground.. We then found a good size neighborhood but was quickly overwhelmed with zombies and knew we wouldnt be able to bed down in the town and it was getting dark so we decided to make a big loop around the town to get the zombies off our trail and we began to dig a hole in the ground.  First night underground was stressful. The zombies become alot more active when the moon comes up and even underground we could be sensed. We didnt move one inch until the sun came up. The next day we decided to dig further underground and make a small cave for storage containers. over the next several days we extended our lair with tunnels under the town. We actually tunneled all the way to a house in the center of town and came up threw the floor only to be welcomed by zombies boarded up in the house. Our underground lair worked well until about day 100 then all hell broke loose. A little after midnight the game ai decided to send a large pack of about 8 dogs our way. We didnt think much of it since weve seen dogs come and go plenty but this time the dogs knew our location and circled around on ground level and starting digging in the dirt. It didnt take to long for them to dig a hole straight down into our cave and with our best efforts we tried to kill them. Didnt work. We had to abandon all our crates only to watch the pack collapse our lair destroying all our loot.Floating lake house.. Some days later we decided to give the floating house a try. It worked extremely well since the zombies acted odd when in the water and cant swim to the surface to attack our home. We lived in this home long enough to get 2k zombie kills and become bored with our home. The lake house is a great concept but the ai isnt able to do anything to you.. yet. Hopefully this will change since the game is all about keeping you on your toes.Cheats activated.. Bedrock spawned in. We now decided to work in creative mode and see what kind of structures can be built with the game physics as of now. We built a mega fortress out of bedrock with 4 floors, a water elevator, and a pitfall 65 blocks down to kill off the zombie horde. Now this sounds like the way you would want to play this game but we found this is not the best way. Because we used 1,000s of tnt and used power tools etc we heated up the map so bad that we had non stop hordes coming from all directions. This was still no problem for our fortress. The build was fun but after learning all the structure physics and just watching zombies come after us for days and never needing to do any repairs or kill anything we found ourselves bored again.So what now? Well the saying keep it simple is the way to go here. We restarted our server and decided to try the wood shack again but with some extra defenses. A 3 block deep trench with log spikes helped but the wood spikes made no difference. Placing the log spikes against the shack also helped alot. One of the biggest things we noticed was that using the crossbow let you be sneaky and kill and hunt without being detected even when close to dogs. For the remainder of our playtime we kept our part of the woods quiet and the only issues we have is the roaming horde every now and then but we just leave them be and stay out of site til morning. You will occasionally get a group of spider zombies scouting the area but we just snipe them off with our crossbows. This may sound boring but with this setup your not cheating the ai simply because you can make a mistake and draw to much attention only to find yourself running for your life in the middle of the night.Bottom line is this. The game is only in alpha so if you like the concept you should give this game a try. Hours of fun and off the edge of your seat madness. You will never feel safe and thats what makes the game fun. Keep it up pimps.			"

Early Access Review
								I wrote a review 2 years ago, and thought maybe I should write a new one now that the game has come so far along.  This game has been in early access for awhile now but trust me The Fun Pimps are still working hard on it!  If you don't believe me follow Madmole on the forums, and follow the dev block on Tumblr.Now as for the Review, I still strongly reccommend this game to anyone who enjoys crafting, zombies, and survival.  Nothing else out there that I have played comes anywhere near this title.  As of Alpha 14 (Current Review) the game has felt a lot more polished than it has sense I first started playing back when the game was still in Alpha 5 or 6 (I can't remember)  Their is still bugs but that is expected as it is a early access games but for the current build there hasn't been any game breaking bugs that I have personally enountered on my Windows Platform.  If you tried this game during the Alpha 13 phase and didn't think it run good, well you were right but Trust me Alpha 14 has addressed many of those issues.  The game is also now out on console which I also own on the PS4 and plays well on it so far.  The game is really easy to learn and get yourself into now that the basic quest system is in.  You now get a tutorial quest upon entering a game for the first time which runs you through crafting the basics of items and blocks.  If you like the look of the game but may not like certain features don't worry cause thats where mods come in.  The game can be reletivaly easily modded using the XML files located in the install folder or you can download other users mods from the forums.  It doesn't support Steam Workshop but The Fun Pimps have confirmed that it will when the game goes Gold (Approx)As of this review I have over 1500 or so hours into this game.  That speaks for itself as there hasn't been a single other game on my steam library that comes anywhere near it.10/10 - Seriously worth your time and money			"

								So.  Where to begin?  First off, I've really, really enjoyed this game so far.  Granted, it's only been four hours of gameplay, but that's from a general lack of free time more than anything else.  I will almost certainly have a different point of view than anyone who started playing earlier in the Alpha, so bear that in mind.  My opinion will not have been infected (no pun intended) by having to have played through any ""broken"" builds.  I'll also try to be concise.- To begin, ""A mix of DayZ and Minecraft"" really is a great way to describe the gameplay, though the zombies are more of a menace than they have been in DayZ for a while.- Next, yes, there is only one world.  It is fairly large, though, so I expect to get another 10-15 hours out of play into it before I might start getting sick of it.  And that's assuming that there's nothing interesting underground.  That being said, there is a random world generation option coming.  If I get bored with this world before it is released, then I'll just shelve the game, and come back to it once it is an option.- More than anything else, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you play with friends.  While playing solo was fun, playing with a friend or two definitely makes the game more enjoyable.- This game is fairly difficult.  I've only been playing on the medium difficulty, and I still have to be very careful to be in a safe place by nightfall.- As for how well it runs.... well, I have a decent rig, with a 2GB video card, and the game on a solid state drive.  With this setup, I can run everything on maximum with no frame loss or lag whatsoever.- The only ""bug"" I've encountered so far is with the zombie dogs.  Their pathing is rough, they're hard to hit when near because they usually spin in circles between attacks, and they occasionally glitch through walls.- Speaking of bugs, the big flying ones are super annoying, and really the only thing I've found thus far that I dislike.In conclusion, if you enjoy zombie themed survival games, enjoy games like Minecraft, and can get a friend or two to play with, you will almost certainly enjoy this game.  I have so far, even when playing alone, and I feel like it was worth every penny even in it's current state.  I look forward to getting to continue playing this game as it is developed.			"

Early Access Review
								Let me begin with a few basic overview marks.The graphics aren't the best, sure. They're not fallout or dying light quality, but they don't need to be and they're still quite good for what the game is, a unity game. Still a great set of assets and a hell of a lot better than minecraft or unturned but with the same or I'd say even more freedom and crafting options.The sound makes up for the graphics when it comes to atmosphere, seriously, they got some of the sounds down really well, the hair raising clicks of a spider zombie, the growling and barks of the zombie dogs (I Hate these things), the nerve jittering sound of a wondering zombie cop, the music's ehish, not sustained and more just used in short bursts to indicate day/night/horde cycle.Now on gameplay!This is where this baby get's most of it's points. If you're into crafting games and survival, this is the game for you, with everything from hunger and thirst, to body temperature, infections and illness. You have to battle these things as well as the zombie hordes. Detailed and awesome, don't think you can just stand around in the rain and you'll be ok, your temperature will start dropping sharply if oyu're not wearing the right clothing. Clothing, just another aspect of the level of depth, so many layers and tiers, the fact that even guns and power tools are made up of individual working components and such, SO much depth and detail to this game it doesn't even need a story, survive and build is all it needs.A first hour or two Experience in 7 days to die:Have spawned on a road in the desert with some basics, a can of stagg err, I mean cragg? (something) chilli, a jar of water (It says it's a bottle but it's a jar god dammit), a flaming stick (torch), a bandage a backpack and underpants. For some reason I remembered my backpack and flaming torch, but only had time to put on underpants before the apocalypse hit.  Game tells me to make a primitive stone axe. Noted. Need wood. Start punching a tree into submission, eventually it yields beneath my mighty fists and coughs up some wood. I see my next victim, a stone. I charge at it, arms flailing and swinging wildly at bits of grass as I go. WHAP! whap whap whap whap whap, 40 punches later the rock still stands beneath my awesome power and has yielded little. I find a few stones on the ground, enough to combine with the wood and grass punchings to make an axe. I craft the axe, AH HA! I hold it aloft, I have evolved, I am man, I have made a tool. First course of action, charge the mighty rock beast with my newly created tool and beat it into submissions. I hit the rock repeatedly, feeling it crumble to my will offering up it's many goodies until CRACK, it becomes dust beneath my mighty tool! I am man, I am unbeatable! (Low grumbled growling) ZOMBIE! Ha, a moment ago I would have been zombie chow, but I have my trusty stone axe, ready to beat down this zombie. CHAAAARRRGGEE!! whack whack whack, Take that zombie I scream as I wildly hack at it, engaging it from behind. The zombie stops and turns, responding to these attacks unfavourably. OH GOD IT'S EATING ME, IT'S EATING ME OH GOD WHY, WHY DID YOU FAIL ME SO TERRIBLY AXE. I perish in an horrific fashion. My soul rises above me, to watch the zombie chow down only to be zapped and snapped back into the body of another survivor! I can only assume my spirit has possessed him because he TOO is wondering the wilderness with little more than a pair of underpants and a backpack. I start to walk back to my old body to see what has become of it. I trudge forward, barely noticing the dimming light of day until the sun has almost set. Night time approaches! I should find somewhere safe to hole up for the night before I can varily trudge to retrieve my stone axe for sentimentality reasons. A town, that should be a good spot to find some gear and hole up til morning, let's try there. OH GOD, NO, NO, ZOMBIE DOGS, WHY OH WHY THEY'RE SO FAST AND ANGRY OH GOD THEY'RE EATING ME annnnnnd death, floating away watching myself become Zomdog food. Well then, back in my underpants in the middle of nowhere wearing nothing but the baseball cap I found near my spawn point. Ok so, time to make a stone axe....11/10 Still addicted almost 200 hours in.			"

								When I first started Playing 7 days to die back in august 2014, it was an awesome and a year later, it still is. 7 days to die is a mixture of DayZ, Minecraft, Unturned, The Forest and Half-Life 3. You could say that it is a postapocalyptic minecraft for a adults, now featuring 100% more gravity.(dont make your house out of dirt, the zombies will f**k you up)You play in a completly destructuble world, where you can build and breakdown anything you want.in the daytime, you can explore, loot, scavenge, build mighty fortresses and then, when night comes you will have to defend yourself from screaming hoards of zombies, bears, hornets, rabbits and dogs. (I really hates those dogs)Actually, dont take notice of the above, because you can fully customize game settings, and make the apocalypse as comfortable or ruthless as you want.One of the best thing about 7 days to day is the constant stream of new content. The fun pimps are awesome at listening to the community, about improvements  in the game.But you know what? instead of reading reviews, just get the damn game and play it. PLAY IT! 10/10 -   "

								Alright, this might be a little biased, but this review is coming from someone who loves the grind in pve survival games.(Ark pve, subnautica, FTB and tppi minecraft, and w/e else i played throughout the years)Got the game a good while ago, developers HAVE been putting constant updates out, which is more that I can say about other alpha/ea survival games.Each update there are new things to build and find. UI has been reworked too and skills have been added as well as zombie variety.I play on my own server with my friends(4 of us) and we are doing it pure PVE, im hosting it off my PC as I play.Here is how it goes:You start out pretty much naked, punch some grass, gather some stones/wood and start crafting tools to gather more things to craft more advanced tools. If you like survival games(doesn't have to be zombie genre) and more PVE than I would say get it while it's on offer.The pros:-Best looking voxel game out there-Grinding skills and exploring is addictive-Early horde nights are intense(before you get a reinforced concrete super base with spike pitfall traps...)-Zombie dogs, ferals and cops are a threat-It's fun to build stuff and survive with friends over voip-Skill levels and luck matter early on, can make a huge difference on quality of life-EVERYTHING is breakable-There are some community mods for the game that improve QoL-You can adjust your own server settings as you see fitNow onto cons...-Zombies do a bit too much damage to blocks....i get it that they should be able to break through wood and scrap metal, but it's not right for them to break through reinforced concrete with their bare hands with relative ease.-Skills need some work, some are better than others and some really shouldn't be in there, but im sure they will fix them-Map generation needs some work, ""random gen"" is HUGE, but you can either get a nice city block or a wasteland with multiple biomes next to each other. ""Navezgane"" is a lot smaller and pre-made but it feels more atmospheric due to the way it was built(street layout, houses, hospitals, survivor camps, factories, prisons.....all feel more real than copypasta randomgen things).-Optimization(or the lack of to some extent). There are some video settings that you should just turn off to get smoother frames. Reflective surface/shadows to OFF, don't max the view distance(huge fps loss), shadows to low/medium as its good enough IMO. Im running 980ti here and im getting ~80-90fps in the city while hosting the server(130+ in empty areas).-Some item balance is poor....even if you specialise in say....blunt weapons(sledge hammer) you will still have to use an axe to break wood and pickaxe to break metal things, it's just more effective. Rifles are a bit too good, compared to every other firearm. -Minibikes are ...rubbish and glitchy.-Some item sounds are horrendously loud when usedIf you do end up buying this and playing privately with your trusted friends then I suggest you set zombies to walk only, up their spawn to ""very high"" and keep everything else the same. Zombie killing will be enjoyable and not feel frustrating. Grind away!			"

								OK this is my first review ever so bear with me please :)7D2D is a highly immersive (& addictive), horror themed, sandbox survival game that is set in fully destructible voxel landscape.You are one of a small number of survivors remaining after a virus left most people mindless, savage and hungry hungry (for flesh ) roaming the landscape of Navezgane looking for their next meal.OK, that’s the general gist of the game now for my thoughts!If you like building things, finding loot, fighting monsters, exploring and enjoying yourself then this game will not disappoint!I have had this game since about Alpha 8 and I can’t rave about it enough. It has incorporated almost everything you could want in this style of game and has done it with a great deal of quality and attention to detail. The devs seems to really listen to suggestions and are very active in the forums as well as regularly putting out bug fixes, version and alpha updates. I have a heap of alpha games and 7D2D is by far the best managed and most inclusive development team I have yet seen. There is an almost touchable excitement when the next Alpha is ready to be released.The one and only down side to the game (apart the hours spent in a 7D2D playing coma :)) is the issue with hackers on the multiplayer servers but as far as I can tell this too is being taken seriously and steps are constantly being taken to safeguard against this (actively).When the game comes to completion it is going to be the Horror Survivalist voxel type sandbox game by which all others are going to be measured by! (IMHO :)) "

								Oh boy where to start.  I am♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at the developers thats for sure.The new patch has rendered a once great game unplayable.  Granted, I like the new gameplay changes, what I don't like is how I can't enjoy online multiplayer anymore.  The latency and frame rate is unbearable.  You will get drops to 1-5 fps anytime more then 3 zombies enter on screen.  More then that?  Forget about it, you'll be dead before your game unfreezes.  It seems they spent more time on their new motion capture zombies that they are so proud of rather then spending time optimizing performance.  This is of course running the game on the lowest settings possible, making the game look like it jumped right out of 2001.  This causes their new HD zombies to stand out even more, since they clash with the low res environment. The lag is unbearable, try as many servers as you might, its all the same deal and everyone has this issue.Its funny because I was playing the game right before a13 dropped.  It was running fine.  Then I try to jump on that same server after the update and it had the framerate of a polaroid camera.  It was unplayable.  Of course I didnt get to enjoy that long as I was now being kicked for ping.  This is of course less then half an hour after I was playing on that same server just fine, no lag, no framerate drops.The best part is the fanbase and official forums.  Having an issue with the game?  Don't bother reporting it.  If it isn't a posted consisting of nothing but praise for the gods that The Fun Pimps, you will be ravenously attacked by the fanboys.   All the resultings posts will insist that their version of the game runs flawlessly and that it must be your fault.  That is if you aren't banned immediately for daring to not get on your knees and pray to the devs.As you can see I actually like this game alot, I have over 300 hours logged.  Its one of, or rather was one of my favorite games.  Now I can't even play it.Save your money.  If after 7 months of waiting for an update they honestly couldn't test this update and see how poorly it ran then they really don't deserve your money.  Even if they delayed the update for another year I would tolerate that so long as I could actually play it.  Instead they kept giving release dates, which they shouldn't have, kept failing to meet said release dates, then rushed out a broken mess.10/10 guys			"

								Absolutely beautiful game. Challanging, fun, and three times better with friends.The recent updates add lots of fun content like character customization, and there's a dev blog for reading up on what's new!http://joelhuenink.tumblr.com/I honestly haven't played this game enough, and I'm sure when it gets out of early access it will be just as popular as other indie crafting games like Terraria.Recently, they have made some small changes, such as only one time of meat, that are not super impactful but can be a little annoying. They've added quality to items that you found, and skills that are badass and tied to the world, so you never feel overpowered. The structual integrety aspects of the game add a level of challange to building, and they make it more fun to construct large fancy buildings.The best part is after Alpha 14, they will have dedicated save protection, so no more world restarts! Their game isn't perfect but it's in Alpha and it's damn good			"

								This game is very good at aims to be. A fairly good looking survival, fps game with plenty of building, pvp/pve, skill points and progression as well as a fairly healthy modding community. Developers should not be receiving the hate they are getting because this game has the potential to be THE best single player zombie, survival and resource gathering game.I guess my only critisim is the bugs (which are to be expected from an Early Access title) and the lack of quality textures and graphics that this game has to offer. I recommend this game to people who may have enjoyed rust or dayz but would like the option of a single-player experience. 7.8/10			"

So Early Access games don't really have such a good repututaion as of late due to horrific failngs on the behalf of selfish devs.The Fun Pimps are not in anyway like the selfish scamming devs we have come to be accustomed to in recent months. The game is constantly updated and the devs are active in supporting and fixing any bugs. This recent update shows the games progress literally. last week I was playing a completly different game to the one I see now in terms of graphics.Pros: Intuitive         Well supportd game         Decent community         Few hackers        Fun game Cons: Early Access          Few bugs         Some ideas are not fully developed yet         Loading is a tad bit to longHeres some standard 7 days To Die Alpha 11 Gameplay

								This is an excellent Early Access Alpha. I've owned a copy since release and I've been nothing but thrilled with the dev team and the progress they have made. Before I move on to the breakdown I'd like to remind everyone that its not uncommon for a game to be in alpha for years, most companies wont even announce a title till its almost complete. before the Early Access thing became popular I had the opportunity to alpha and beta test a few titles as a paid tester. The reason you should be supporting indie developers like this is to hopefully allow talented people to create careers and revolutionize the industry not provide you with a fully polished game for under $30 in a quarter of the time it takes to make a AAA title.Pros:- Active Development team- Solid Concept and good Zombie AI- Wide range of settings allows for completely costume zombie survival experienceCons:- Graphics have a long way to go (But the dev team has made good progress since release)- Mechanics change a lot (But this is potentially a good thing for an Alpha)- Multiplayer is a bit quirky but not unusable.

								Hey fellow gamers its your friend Greed i have about 210 hours invested in this game and it just keeps getting better. There is so much to do that your only really limited by your own imagination. At the end of the world how will you choose to survive as a lone wolf or run in a pack, its intirely up to you. Of course the choice is yours, will you be a farmer or a hunter maybe a gather, but keep in mind no matter what you decide you have to be a surviver. The seventh day is coming and with it a feral hord. The game keeps the player wanting more and the Funpimps dont let you down. The game is still an alpha, but its already so much fun. I feel like writting this review will get more people involved. The bigger and more attived  the game community the better the end game result will be. Unlike some games were you feel like the game designers forgot about the game and the community all together this is something, truely something different. Its up to you to play and voice any and all bugs so they can be addressed. It goes without saying that i am happy with this game and i encourage anyone reading this to give it a try. Feel free to add me because at the end you can never have to many friends.			"

								Having just got this game a few days ago, I find it safe to say I have thoroughly enjoyed it thus far. I have only played it online with friends, so I can't say how the single player experience was (although, I know it would not be as fun as playing it with friends). This game is a refreshing take on the zombie survival genre. Aside from the multiple bugs (it is still in alpha, after all), the game is still enjoyable, with a diverse crafting system and complex building system, there is quite a bit to do in here. I am looking forward to future updates and fixes to this game!			"

								Dont get me wrong guys, the game itself amazing. Therefore I have 1800hours in it.But the ""public relation guy"" called madmole + most of the moderators on steam as well as on their official forum are really really rude. Ive got an example here after I told the developers that they HAVE NOT brought in a single feature(other than ""polishing"" their game) for over a year now(besides small ones that modders could have done within.... 4weeks?).Here is the example of text that you will face when you criticise their game(he is their graphics/public relation guy):213.239.212.234/untitled.png""GTFO out"" is their response to MATURE and POLITE critic! So as long as u dont criticise the game developers for not implementing any new features for about a year and youre fine with it. Buy it. I wont recommend it to ANYONE anymore!			"

								Honestly prefered the version before all the updates. I feel that the whole new crafting system and leveling system complicates the game too much. Also, I prefer the old graphics over this new one. Although it's supposed to be more 'advanced', the old graphics had a much more rustic feel and that paired great along with the whole theme of the game. Therefore I feel that the game now has deproved.			"

Don't get too proud of your creations though..the zombies never stop coming and they WILL find you and try and destroy all those days of hard work you used trying to build a safe location. This is SP review only, well more of a comment than a review.  9/10!EDIT: This game just keeps getting better!!! If you are skeptical..browse reviewers game hours there are tons of people that have hundreds of hours clocked and this is ALPHA! What more proof do you need?Edit again: 2.5 years later and this is still my favorite game. Things have changed much, but all for the better. If you like survival horror games this is the best. If you think your a walking badA then your going to get frustrated. 10/10!3rd Edit The game is currently on sale for 10$. If you miss this game it will be the worst 10 bucks you ever held on to. Buy it. Gaming hours don't lie.			"

It is always about the price, but you were told it was Alpha, and you still bought it, and then when you die all the time cause you think this is COD zombie mode, you whine and get all upset.I foresee plenty of hours of fun for me and my son, we have been playing Alpha 5 this weekend for hours, and we love the freedom there is in this game, and we appreciate the tension that the game brings, when night falls upon us.This is Alpha people, you cant really criticise a game, in alpha.

								7 days to die survival guide.	Civilization has failed, you are one of very few survivors lost & alone in a desolate world.  Equipped with only your head & hands you must survive in a pocket of habitable land surrounded by blasted rubble & irradiated wastelands.   To make matters worse, the radiation has mutated a common flu bug into a terrifying disease capable of raising the dead.  Can you survive?	First & foremost you must become a scavenger, loot every item you see. Pick up every rock, feather, stick, or scrap of metal you find, every item has a use.  You will need tools, if you happen to spawn close to a road carefully check for vehicles to loot.	There are usually also zombies around cars, don’t let your guard down.   If you are lucky you may find a tool or weapon, regardless you should construct a stone axe.  It may be crude, but it is the best multi-purpose tool at the start.  It can be used to dig holes, chop trees, break boulders and in a pinch can also bash in the head of an attacking zombie.  Once you have a home, it can be used to repair blocks. 	How do you survive the menacing zombie horde?  Running away is always the safest option, but sometimes you have to stand and fight. What would Darryl do?  (WWDD?) Darryl would find a crossbow, or better yet MAKE One. This is where all those sticks & stones you've been picking up are going to come in handy. While you can find feathers in rubbish piles, loot  birds nests, AS they often have eggs, which you can eat - preferably cooked.  All the foods you cook can also be eaten raw, if you don’t mind at bit of food poisoning, which is preferable to starving.  If you have full or high health, and a water supply the food poisoning wont kill you, just make life uncomfortable.  Same thing with Diarrhea from drinking murky water.	In later versions of the game these will impact your ""wellness"" which most likely will affect things like movement and loot speed, as well as how long it takes to break blocks and zombie skulls.	Now that you have a silent & deadly weapon, and a crude but effective tool, its time to start thinking about the future.  You can stealth to avoid zombies, and gather materials more efficiently with your stone axe.  Boulders can be broken & trees chopped to provide more sticks and stones, this is safer than wandering around gathering, and the zombies don’t seem to be alerted to the sounds.	If you have a decent melee weapon & full stamina, you can chase down a pig & beat it to death.  This will also alert every zombie in the vicinity to your presence, be prepared to run!   Rabbits are easier to kill, one hit with your crossbow will mean instant death if you can get one to stop moving long enough.  Bucks are the best, from a long distance you can often shoot one 3 or 4 times and it won’t even run.	Once you skin the animal, find a place to store the meat, even if you have to place a box on the ground & mark the location, its better than carrying it around attracting all the walkers in the area.  With few small stones and some sticks, and you can cook the meat & make a quick meal.	To move beyond subsistence level you need two items that can be a challenge to obtain, but once you have them your, future is assured. First thing is a short Iron Pipe, which allows you to build a forge, and clay to make molds for it.  Pipes can often be found in stoves & air conditioners,  if you aren't near a building, a blasted ruins may contain a toilet which you can break it to get a pipe.   Clay is found near rivers & lakes, or you can use corn meal!  If you are nowhere near any building, just keep searching. Some zombies may drop a pipe when killed if you can, loot any that you kill.  Follow any road you find, eventually you will find a gas station.	Before it gets dark, you MUST find shelter.  Wandering in the dark will get you killed.  If you happen to have a light source, it will attract them, and at night zombies are far more feral.  Find & fortify a house, or in a pinch dig a hole * crawl inside.  Night time is best used crafting, forging metals & boiling water.  Try not to make too much noise even if hidden indoors at night, as zombies sense your presence.   In fact they will often try to smash their way into your shelter even if you are completely undetected.  Make sure you have an exit for such an eventuality.	It has been my experience that every SEVEN DAYS there is a massive night raid, if you do not have sturdy walls they will get in.  Reinforced concrete walls, metal reinforced wood, or lots & lots of stone between you and any entry point are your only protection on those nights.   Be prepared to conduct extensive repairs once the sun rises.  	What comes next?  Scout the countryside & gather better supplies, having guns & ammo will make your life much simpler, and make your forays into the urban wilderness much less terminal.  The ultimate survival tool can be found if you locate any abandoned military outposts & loot the munitions boxes that they usually contain.  Having a 44 Magnum and a Sniper rifle make the experience even enjoyable!   With a submachine gun, you can decimate the largest feral horde.			"

								Progressively getting better, but still hard to reccomend.Positives:Permanent price drop from 29.99 to 24.99Constantly being updated and worked onVarious options for your world/server, such as turning off craft timing, changing how long day/nights last, and even turning zombie running off. (Seriously, since when do Zombies run?)Negatives:No randomly generated world. (It's coming.)No character customization. (It's coming.)Characters look kind of ugly.No Story. (It's coming.)No bosses. (It's coming.)Map too barren. (They add stuff though, recently a police station I think.)Much more little things, the overall game feels kind of clunky, but that's a personal opinion.It's getting better though. I actually play it single player sometimes, which before I mentioned wasn't even worth bothering with. All in all, wait for a sale if you really want it. You're not missing much, not yet at least.

								This used to be my favorite game in my Steam library but now it's just getting progressively worse. I started playing in Alpha 9 and it was amazing. As the game went on, it kept getting harder and harder to enjoy it but I kept giving it patience. This however is where my patience runs out; I cannot handle how buggy and complex this game turned out. Buggy and complex are not a winning combination for a game. I'll be honest: some of these aspects seem like good additions if they weren't so buggy. For example: the weather system, the vehicles, new zombie animations and actions, more animals. What I don't like however are things like: the increasingly complex leveling system (which makes the game more equipment based rather than skill based), the quality levels (this goes well for guns but not so much for anything else that can be crafted), the cars not respawning loot. I do hope this game gets better in the future, and if it truthfully can't be fixed then I would literally be fine with The Fun Pimps reverting the game back to Alpha 11 and releasing the full game like that.

Early Access Review
								It got this game a while ago and honestly didn't really like it too much, but that was probably because I was new to the whole craft/survival thing, and the game did not do a great job at making it easy to understand how to survive, but now the game is very friendly to start, and the crafting interface is extremely easy to understand even if you are picking up the game for the first time. With the added skill trees and the natural progression you gain from just doing random things such as using a bow or crafting is a really nice added feature. The game definitely gives you chills, and you can't hide forever, The zombies WILL find you, and one night what ever little shack you decided to stay the night in will be destroyed and you will have to run while a horde of sprinting zombies chase you down. Hope you have good stamina or GGWP. I did come across a nice place located in the middle of a river, (coordinates 580N, 70E) I've been shacking up here and it survived an attack from a horde, if you are having trouble this is definitely a good place to set up campOverall this is a very good game, and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a scary survival game.Pro Tip: Don't fight bears.

								7 Days To Die is certainly a great game. A minecraft like shooter with zombies. What more could someone want? While the game is in alpha stage, it still has a lot to offer. There's a large list of things I could talk about, but I don't want to write a book. Essentially the game is minecraft with zombies. However, compared to some other free roam games out there, you are very limited to what you can explore. Additionally, the things you can find get very boring once you have explored enough. Another thing to keep in mind when looking at this game is the lack of objective. If you are someone who needs a goal, this won't satisfy you very much. Its more of a sandbox as of now. Something else that I consider very important when buying this game is to make sure you have some pals to play it with. You will find yourself bored VERY quickly when playing alone. Also, the online community isnt the greatest, so I would not put your trust into that.TL;DR - The game is pretty good for the money, while it has its flaws, its only in alpha. Before you purchase, make sure you have some friends to play with and watch some gameplay videos.			"

								Forever Early Access.Now, as you can see I have played this game a ton, and I did enjoy my time with it otherwise I would not have played so long!So why don't I recommend it after so much playtime you wonder? Well I'm only doing this because this game does have the potential to be very good, but in it's current state it is not complete, and if you look at the previous year of updates it does not look like it will be for another 2 years.To give some insight into why, you simply have to look at the past updates, the large majority are graphical, or assets, building blocks, perk systems and objects. However they do not aim to improve or fix actual gameplay features. An example would be the minibike, the only mode of faster transport which was introduced nearly 2 years ago, yet still they will fall through the floor and glitch out in multiplayer all the time, an item that does take some time to gather materials for and changes the game, allowing you to range further away. A feature implemented 2 years ago that you still cannot use due to wonky code....Another major flaw is it's combat, which is clunky and unrefined. And the zombies lack in variation and animations, the game often spawning in 5-10 identical zombies that all run, move and attack the same and dropping out of thin air just yards infront of you.Basically they keep adding things without fixing or improving any previous problems.So I recommend not buying this yet, because I think YOU should get a better experience when you play this for the first time than going into it right now.

								I would have felt more satisfied burning the money that I used to pay for this game.  It's been over a year now and still in Alpha stage.  1 update that actually makes the game less enjoyable now.  Game mechanics are terrible and it doesn't feel like you are surviving against a hoard of zombies & enemies.  It feels more like I am surviving putting up with the horrible reminder that I actually paid like $25 for this stupid game.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.			"

								As of 12/31/2015:tl;dr - Good more realistic ""minecraft"" style game. Dev's are active, and the game is still under development and it gets broken periodically. Overall - 6.5/10Long version:Pros: - Very well done apocolypse sim - As of last update, one of the better crafting systems I've seen - Pretty easy to pick up and learn - Graphics are overall pretty good, and improving as development goes on - Dev's are somewhat active in the community, updates are somewhat regular - Motion captured zombies are neat - Minecraft-esque building, but with physics (see other thoughts) - Randomly generated maps - Pretty decent dedicated servers now - Really doesn't need that much PC horsepower to be playable - Weapon selection is broad enough for most to find a good weapon they prefer to useCons: - Minecraft-esque building, but with physics (see other thoughts) - Melee combat is a bit broken - Climate system is currently buggy - Dev's have a nasty habit of half-implementing features (Sorry TFP, but you KNOW you do...) - Frequent server wipes with some updates (see other thoughts) - A lot of new features, not a lot of new content (see other thoughts)Other thoughts:This game has potential to really be fantastic. I've logged over 500 hours playing it since I purchased it shortly after it hit greenlight. I loved it then, I still love it, but I don't play it anywhere near as much these days. The majority of the negativity I feel toward the game is not the game itself, but to some of the way the game has been developed.The minecraft-esque building is really great, except the physics of it can be a bit flaky. There isn't a lot of warning when your house on stilts is going to start collapsing, until  your floor falls apart when you walk on it. I would like to see that fixed somehow, although I don't know what a good way to do that would be. It's a good system, and with the most recent updates, pretty solid.The maps are randomly generated, and have been significantly improved since first introduced. That said, they're still broken too. The caves are cool, but they currently don't always generate properly, or you will see a building which collapses the second you try to walk inside. Overall, still highly playable. What does cause issues though is digging / mining. The terrain does not always recalculate properly, which leads to ""outcroppings"" that you can't walk past, until you place and remove a block there then it recalculates and is fine.The reason I don't play the game much is the developers, The Fun Pimps. Overall, they are great, and doing a good job with the game as a whole. When you take a closer look at the development however, they've done some things that I found and still find annoying. A major example of this is half implementing features. Now a lot of you may read this and say things like ""it's a green light game, what did you expect?"" or ""you're being too critical, back off"" and while to an extent, both are true, but also false. This game is and has been fully playable for quite awhile now, so to me, it's in development in the same sense that Minecraft is still in development, meaning it's a working, playable, functional game, that keeps getting new features and content. What is a bit of a problem with that though, is that in one update, they will ""set up"" for features in the next. A few very specific examples of this come to mind:- Mini bikes (which are sweet!) - but you cut the player movement speed in half in an update that came out about 3 months before the mini bikes did- Constant screwing with the terrain generation / cave generation / etc - but every time you ""fix it"" you have to wipe the server, and quite honestly, the routine is getting old, especially when things are still broken with it.- Skill trees (which are interesting) - now you gain experience for doing stuff. Cool feature, very similar to Ark: Survival Evolved in the sense of how XP is earned, but it currently doesn't much beyond improve crafting quality and loot chance at high level. Important, but apparently a ""class system"" is coming. A prime example of what I am talking about. Wait, do it all, then push it out- Climate / freezing / over-heating - Cool idea, again, works somewhat similar to Ark, but broken. REALLY broken. How am I over-heating when I'm under water, in a lake? It's been acknowledged as broken.- The Rocket Launcher (since fixed) was removed because it didn't work right following a major update...- Tungsten doors were deemed too strong and removed. Took a LONG time for their replacements to show up...- Acknowledging <INSERT FEATURE HERE> is horribly broken and will be fixed - I admit, to an extent I am being hard on TFP here, but I'm also being honest. Between the ""we know it's broken and we'll fix it, but hey look at this other new thing!"" statements, then after major update releases the game is typically broken to varying degrees, which again, I do understand happens, and with a lot of regularity, but I also feel like if the dev's backed off the throttle on the hype-train a little, and took a bit more time in testing and fixing their releases, the player experience would be even better, especially players who have owned the game for a long time.The server wiping updates are a huge reason I don't play much anymore. I've dealt with the stretches where server wiping was a regular monthly or bi-monthly cycle, and right around the time you got back to where you were prior to the last wipe, ""Hey all, new patch. Wipe your servers, loose your stuff again. Sorry!"" then rinse, wash, and repeat, when in reality, I am pretty sure they could iterate through the chunks and regenerate them with a secondary utility, so that server wiping wasn't mandatory, or minimally, give admins a way to preserve player inventory, skills (as of now), etc. because for me, right now, I'm done dealing with it.A lot of the new features which have been added are cool, once they're polished up. The mini bike, the skill system, the new resource collection, zombie stun, UI revamp, have all been overall positive additions, or minimally, look promising. New content however, has been nil for quite awhile. Yes, they've added better graphics, which do look good, they've improved the weather system, finally added some weapons, etc. But the end game is still basically same as it was a year ago. It just takes longer than it did.I understand gating a lot of the crafting, and making things take longer (gasoline and forges are prime examples), but once you build a solid base with enough of a defense (admittedly, the defense requirements have gotten significantly higher), a garden for food, and a forge to make ammo, that's it. You've done everything you need to, now you can go mess with zombies or other players. Now again, you may say ""it's a green light game"" or ""it's still in development"" and again, I get it, and to that I say ""Fair enough, except they aren't developing new content."" The overall end game hasn't changed much since Alpha 10, except for the amount of time it takes to get to that point, which to a lesser extent, I agree with because there was a point where once you had a beaker, an auger, and corn, you could have a fully established base in about 4 real world hours if you knew what you were doing.All of that said, and yes, I know how harsh I was, I still support the game and I do still overall recommend the game. Personally though, I am done until it's done, or minimally, not broken.			"

								This game is so cool! I'm not worthy! I'm not worthy!No seriously, this game is excellent. For being an alpha game still under heavy development, it is fun. Several friends and I have made a few multiplayer servers to play on for days to weeks at a time. The developers are very active in the community with the players. While they do have a planned agenda, they do accept ideas from the players or suggestions and incorporate them into the game. This game will also be open for players to mod. While the graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, they aren't too shabby and they are friendly to low-end PC's. There are still a lot of bugs to be fixed. The content at the moment is a little limited in terms of building materials and the different types of buildings/structures that you encounter. However, they are consistently adding new content. I expect the finished product game to be nothing like the alpha I started playing a few months ago (for better or worse).Gameplay is survival horror rpg. You start with nothing and build your way up to having consistent food, water, weapons, and shelter. Alternatively, you could be a nomad and live off of the buildings and structures you encounter on your journey. Either way, beware of the 7 day night horde. Health, stamina, hunger, thirst, and general wellness are all taken into account while playing. Negative things such as becoming infected by a zombie, broken legs, dysentery, and bleeding out are all things that you will have to deal with during your travels. The zombies in this game are a force to be reckoned with. During the day, they are slow and can be dealt with individually if one is careful. If one becomes alert to your presence, many in the area will soon come to investigate. Fighting one zombie can easily turn into running away from fifteen. When the sun sets, the game becomes a whole new animal. Since the zombies run full speed at night, things can be absolutely terrifying. The sheer suspense of hearing the zombies search for you at night can be unnerving. Or the times where you are looting a house and you accidentally slam the cabinet doors in the kitchen only to realize that they heard you and they are coming.Did you ever wish that a game like Minecraft had formidable enemies that would smell you, hear you, and hunt you?Enemies that will dismantle your base and annihilate you if you didn't take proper precautions to protect yourself? That is this game. "

								This game seems to be getting LESS fun with each update,  It went from being interesting and easy to understand to more complex and a chore just to get started. Not that complexity in a game is a bad thing, but it comes down to just not being FUN to play.I can't recommend this game in it's current state.  Hopefully the devs will remember how the earlier versions played and bring some of that back to future updates.			"

								A zombie Survival crafting game. Crafting like in Minecraft but with superior graphics. Every 7 days, there will be a zombie Horde attacking your hideout/base, making it alittle bit like a tower defense game. You can place traps like wood spikes, log spikes, barbed wire fences that slow the zombies down and or kill them. Its still far from finished though there is enough content to enjoy at the moment. If you like solo survival, its a nice game but there is also multiplayer (which has some flaws at the moment). The melee combat was recently improved, making it pretty dynamic, where you can knock down zombies on occasion, cut off legs to make them crawlers etc. You can also level different skills like mining, scavenging etc. There is still more coming, and when its finished, it will be the best Zombie Survival Game of all Times			"

								From the creators of aclaimed tittles such as ""GORE Ultimate soldier"", ""Patriots: A Nation Under Fire"" and "" Secret Service 2"" here we got 7 days to die.. the ""horde"" ""survival""  ""crafting"" ""zombie"" game (I recommend researching those tittles to understand better what goes on). Lets do this in parts, its such a mental mess i will have to make an effort to keep focus. I used to like this game very much, yeah you read right, about over a year ago the game was good and kinda fun . I was ignorant and everything was promissing . Then, some day, they somehow managed to ruin what made the game ""fun"" and turned it into a massive pointless grind. It was such a pointless grind before, but lets say the grind was optional and was about working your♥♥♥♥♥to build. Now its becoming a refilling gauges simulator. Lets talk about these overlapping grinds, and the ones to be added ""soon for sure"":-Wellness grind. Its basically some mechanic they brough up from their arses to make the game artificially harder and ""longer"". The concept is simple. You start with half the HP and stamina a normal person would have and you have to gain your way to ""being a healthy  person"". Abusing game mechanics will increase it quickly, making it pointless once you abuse them enough, Dying will decrease it. A pointless grind that will just make you go nuts for how crippled your character seems to be at the start and also makes pvp not so desirable, but not only that, once you ""grind it"" its completely out of place and have no meaning. As game mechanic to add ""content"" as it was sold, its value as feature= 1/10.-Level Grind: At this point, you get level in 2 ways. Killing zombies and crafting junk. Yeah, its just that, gaining levels will allow  you to do stuff of higher quality. And this is where the thing becomes complex. They have mixed this level grind with the crafting quality and the chances of getting good stuff from containers aka ""leveled loot"". This is a funny mechanic for a coop/multiplayer game that leads to lame metagaming. So the level's grindl works for both crafting and looting.... but that is today coz in the next patch they will add another super awesome layer of grinding:-Skill leveling grind (the new kid of the block). Yeah, you read right. As it wasnt tiresome enough before, thy come with the nice idea of adding another 20 grinds on top, which isnt bad actually, if they had really added new mechanics or exciting stuff that made you level while just having fun, but that doesnt seem to be the case. You will be doing basically the same stuff you have done in the 12 alphas before but this time trying to fill another 20 more ""gauges"" so you can ""improve"". I really fail to see the ""survival aspect here"". The main diference is, i had to kill 3000 zombies and craft 5000 wodden ladders to reach full ""performance"" doing stuff like tools and armors. Now you need to do it for basically every action you can do it ingame. Meanwhile, at the same time, they are ""streamlining"" it for the next patch, which is basically a cool way to say ""dumbing it down"". Adding health bars , big arrows in front of your screen so you figure out things (that part is kinda insulting). They have reduced many materials to the basics, changed the food to a single generic ""meat"" material etc etc. They are basically making it more like more popular games like ""rust"" or ""ark"" instead of going for their own niche. This is the main flaw i find about this game. The crafting menu for the next update is a cloned version of Rust's one (this got me permabanned from the fun pimp forums, but more about this later). Which isnt bad but its something else, not what this game was at first. Problem is that they have been just ""redoing"" stuff mostly for like forever and having little advances.-The gunplay : It is very basic, Its based in raycast and weapons are very arcade with no aparent recoil and very glitchy when you use ironsights, something that has been happening since i first played this game, about alpha 8. Bullets dont exist, . You dont really enjoy killing the zombies like in other games like lets say killing floor but when its a massive horde of zombies, its exciting seeing them not so much shooting them down, you just kill them coz you need to. This might change a bit in the next patch since they are adding dismembering and some Mocap animations. -The sound: The sound only can be described as ""terrible"". Basically a mess. Distances dont exist and position is complicated. Many sounds are recorded in diferent levels, making you having to manage your volume while playing or just go deaf someday. This is supossed to be better for Alpha 13 where they have recorded new sounds and updated the sound engine.-Graphics: Graphics are ok, even good for a game of this kind. The draw distance is terrible though. It feels like you are in the ""little's prince"" world. Anyway, graphics arent that important for a solid game.-The comunity: If you like feeling like in north korea, this is your game. Worst comunity i ever saw in a videogame. Worst forum moderators i ever meet in a videogame too in my 20 years playing online. Fun pimps cant take critics, not even feedback. Anything they dont like, moderators go wild with editing, threats and bans. Its like that in both their oficial forums and the steam's section for it. You rather just follow the official  line where its all about increasing mod's ego and shoulder patting  or your are tagged as a troll. The amount of shoulder patting, silly post editing and ♥♥♥♥♥licking is so borderline that is embarrassing. Seriously. Amazing. Its not videogames anymore but they are like rock band's fans or something. Censorship is rampant. Anyone with decent feedback, but negative feedback, is tagged as a troll and marginated or even treated by mods depending their mood or how much shoulder patting and♥♥♥♥♥licking they have produced before. Actually, the forums have more survival aspects than the game itself, just not the kind i try to find when playing a videogame. Typical responses there are generic ""you can mod it"" or ""its alpha"" or ""its early acess"". Any smart person can see the irony here. Its sad seeing such egos, A developer team who was basically begging years ago for cash that goes full ego mode and disrespect their fans with stuff like calling half their users ""12 yo cry babys"" after a situation they actually have produced theirselves for the release of this last alpha. its an issue they created theirselves with poor PR.  Then just censoship when the♥♥♥♥♥♥hits teh fan. Very bad. They basically have failed as persons. Not coz the game is bad but coz they have no principles. But this is not new, they had a half developer/forum mod/ troll before called Dochussey before. It was super amusing back then, Super PR. Anyone who read that guy at least once knows what i mean. -The bans: Yes, its not a myth. I got banned there in fun pimps's forums. It was fun. One of the super fanboys was there saying he/she just have played Rust that last weekend and what he though was innovative (remember they are copying Rust craft for next patch) turned to just imitation and was upset about it. Moderator came in claiming that was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and that the guys doing the UI never have played rust after i pointed out that it was a copy, warning me. So i replied him in PM  asking why he had to lie to users(specially since they dont pay him), why not just to admit what is evident. And that was it. Malthis is such a nice guy and he loves all the attention. Sorry man, i pity your ""non paid job"".But even nicer, i also got banned in the steam forus by that guy ""eagle"" who is like a super power tripping mod. just coz I pointed out how shady was the ""link your steam account to the fun pimps' forum account  policy"". Not that i care about the bans really. Its actually good to know what kind of people they are. So. My veredict: Avoid it, not worth the hassle.			"

								As previously stated by many others, this game has tremendous potential, but it's also greatly lacking in content with correlations to its price. The concepts are somewhat new, and this is what makes it enjoyable, but because of the lack of content, the joy rapidly diminishes in the first few hours. The game is too pricy at this point in developement. I believe the price should be around 15$. Here are a few specific reasons why:1. There is only one map, and although its quite big, most of it is just terrain rather than interactive.(unless you consider dirt and trees interactive)2. Not enough crafting. There are an awesome amount of weapons, but the traps, tools and building blocks are lacking in variety. The game features farming, but there are only 3 different plants.3. Bugs and glitches. Sometimes creatures are stil spawning in thoroughly lit areas. When mining, the blocks sometimes fly out, or fall into space occupied by another block, meaning it cannot be accessed directly without removing the other block. When looking for multiplayer servers, it does not correctly display the current number of players in the server.4. Spawn trapping. When you dont have any weapons or beds,  and you die during the night, it is almost impossible to do anything without waiting till daytime. The zombies run at you and deal relatively massive amounts of damage, and they also spawn in waves.5. Lack of instructorial information. The interface is initally difficult to decipher, and the lack of any tips reduces our learning to nothing more than just clicking a button and waiting to see if it does anything.			"

								I like this game becausei would always have trouble finding a game when my progress would be put to the test. The 7th night is so exciting because i get to see if my base and I are ready to take on a horde of zombies. I have played a little single player, but playing with as many friends as possible is the best way to have fun on here. ShamCow is a stupid ♥♥♥♥♥ and hogs all the iron!			"

								This game and the developers seem to be moving in the right direction.The development news and update posts here on Steam have been lacking but on the Official forums the developers have been very active.  It is alpha, and there are bugs, and a lot of features not yet implemented.  Plus as should be expected for an alpha, balance is always being re-evaluated.  Of course I don't expect real balancing until all the features are implemented and much more debugged.That said, the game has been fun so far.  I think a lot of people forget that it is an Alpha because the game does play relatively well and has a reasonable feature set already.  That may be part of the inclination to complain about the balance as they've forgotten as enjoyable as it is to play, it is also still very much in a stage where a lot of testing is required and the balance just should not be expected at this point when most mechanics are not in, anything now should be considered place-holder balance at best.  Also, modding has finally been given the OK with the expected 'not yet officially supported' and 'modders should expect mods to break with new releases and changes which may even make them redundant or impossible to recreate'.  Nothing new for a product in Alpha but given the prior confusion as to if modding was allowed (there was even a chill on modding discussion before) this is a great change.They have even adding a Modding forum on the Official forums:http://7daystodie.com/forums/forum.phpThe future is looking brighter for this zombie apocalypse.The game itself is an absolute blast.  Tweaked to just how you want to play with the options they've given so far.  Nothing like using a crossbow to shoot bolts to draw zombies away from a building you want to loot instead of trying to kill all the zombies in Gravestown.  Make the whole feel of the game more alive and realistic.  So much fun and it keep getting better with every release.The Random World Generation is some of the best I've seen with towns actually linking together across multiple biomes.  The latest version added paths from roads to even the side Points of Interest (example a gravel road leading to the out of the way camp site).Game just keeps getting better and better.  I can't wait for each update.			"

								For some reason, many of the negative reviews seem to have been voted most helpful, but if you look at the gameplay hours on the negatives compared to the hours people have on the positive reviews, it's clear that this game has a very loyal, dedicated fanbase, and oodles of replay value.In a crowded field of zombie survival games, or just plain survival games, this one stands out for several reasons. First off is the fact that the enemies pose so much of a threat, that it really encourages cooperation. This game is a must to play with friends. There's something really satisfying about building up your defenses, setting up traps, and then fighting together to survive the night. It's something that Minecraft hints at, and Fortnite promises (if it ever gets released), but this game delivers.The PvP features are a bit lacking and, being an early access alpha title, there are quite a few missing features, bugs, glitches, and security issues. Cheats and hacks are still a problem on public servers. However, as a co-op base building / tower defense / horde survival type game, this one is tough to beat.7 Days to Die is a genuinely fun game, blending the crafting, building, and destructibility aspects of Minecraft with the over-the-top frenzied action of Serious Sam or Dungeon Defenders, where the enemies come at you in almost overwhelming numbers. It's already a blast to play, and continues to get better and better with each new patch. If this is what they've managed to come up with for an alpha release, I can't wait to find out what the finished product will look like.Don't let the haters fool you, look at how much time the positive reviewers have put into this game. Pick it up, make friends, play it with them, and go nuts building and killing zombies! You won't regret it.			"

								This can be a fun game, but the learning curve is a bit steep and the explanations in-game are awful.  For instance, the game tutorial tells you to upgrade some frames, but neglects to tell you that this is done by right clicking while holding the stone axe.  It started as a themed Minecraft clone (look at some early YouTube videos and it is really obvious), but appears to be well on the way to becoming its own game (though similarities still abound).  If you enjoy building games this one is pretty fun.  There is a lot of replayability due to the random map generator as well as the fact that the developers are still adding content to the game.  The developers appear to be genuinely interested in the game beyon just doing a cash grab which is refreshing.			"

								This game is made for Multiplayer, i've spent 100% of my time playing it, solo. It gets boring and monotonous after the first 21 days. The minibike added a little bit of Excitement, but for some reason the Rendering of the world would keep me from going to fast. Exploring became boring once you were able to craft/repair purple weapons. The only fun part was building a base, which once done, rarely needed improving upon. I recomend this game because i DID enjoy it, for as long as i played it, solo, and would be infinitely more exciting/fun with more players.			"

								WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME (For the time being, at least)This used to be one of the funnest games to play when it was around Alpha 7-10 (as you'll notice many other players have commented in the reviews) but right now, on what I believe is Alpha 13, this game is just horrible. It's overly complex with all kinds of menus and systems for crafting that make it take half an hour just to try to accomplish the simplest of tasks. It's become buggy and laggy as hell, and I know it's not my PC because I can play games like Battlefield 4, Crysis 3, Fallout 4, etc. on near-max settings and they're 10x's smoother than this game is now. Sure, this game was absolutely fantastic once upon a time, but now the devs have completely trashed this game AND up'ed the price (talk about adding insult to injury).I cannot stress this enough: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW (Alpha 13). You WILL regret your purchase, I promise you. The devs need to straighten this game out before anyone else should bother wasting time on it. It's truly sad to see how they completely trashed what was once a gem of a game... :(			"

								This game sounded a lot more fun in the description than it actually plays. There are numerous graphical glitches (stretchy limbs, zombies stuck in walls) along with more frustrating mechanical problems (bushes blocking your melee, zombies hitting through walls, getting stuck on invisible obects) I understand that the game isn't complete but when I look at the plans that the developers have, there doesn't look like there is much to look forward to. The main attraction of the game is already there and now there seems to be only minor improvements on the horrizon. You would better spend your money on Day Z, or Dead Island, both of which are zombie themed and both of which have crafting systems. Maybe this game will pick up when, and if, it comes to completion. As for now, don't waste your money.			"

								If you love creating a la minecraft and love zombies, this is a great concept of a game.  Though I've never played it fully in singleplayer, that's probably the best way to go, or on a secure private server well monitored by mods and admins.I spent weeks building far away from noob spawn in a tungsten base.  Next I set up a base at hub city/noob spawn covered by over 64 claim blocks.  Once a cheater found it would be incredibly hard to break into my base, they just reassigned all claim blocks to themselves, taking ownership of my base.  Thus, weeks of effort are easily wiped out in a matter of seconds by individuals with no integrity. :p  What's the point in keeping interested in a game so exploitable?  Guess I'm forced to stay way out in fringes.  Kind of makes the point moot. (PvP server, btw.)So while I recommend it, in concept, your experience may vary.  We'll see what comes as it matures.			"

								Ignoring the funkilling ""difficulty""(not really a difficulty, more of a pain in the ***) of starting out and surviving without lowering any settings to make the game easier(I personally raised quite a few). The game simply doesn't seem ready to me, granted I only played it for 2 hours so take that with a grain of salt, but overall I really wasn't impressed.*All water is basically a pitch black hole of ""Iainttouchinthat"" I expect it to get fixed at some point, after all, it's Alpha*The one deer I tried to hunt didn't give the slightest **** whatsoever when I shot him in the head with a hunting rifle, 6 times, or when I chased him around and beat him with a stick after said 6x headshot, *I killed a bunny and got 3 skinned bunnies(ok)*Night is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, pitch black, can't see a thing(to be expected) but there's no way to sleep through it and if zombies are out there, they will find you, and they will♥♥♥♥♥♥you, brutally, mercilessly, and without fail. Torches provide ""some"" light but you need to get quite a few for it to be workable, which is difficult at times, depending mostly on luck.*No idea what to do regarding zombies, since they apparentaly have been blessed by Hercules and can fistpunch through stone/wood/iron because rotting flesh appears to be in a strength league of its own, again, expected to be changed/fixed at some point. But I'm skeptical on whether or not I should bother to make and defend a house if some scrub tier zombie is going to punch through iron to eat me. Like.. srsly guise y u do this.*I bought and played this game after checking out the video proclaiming skill trees, when I logged in, no skill trees, looked it up, and no word on them even being implemented at all. Ok, -10 points to Gryffindor.. expected to be fixed at some point.*Despite the game registering things in blocks, it's very difficult to gauge how large a ""block"" actually is, Hopefully an option to display block lines is released at some point.*Food and water are fairly easy to obtain by simply grabbing blueberry bushes, because those appear to be all over the freakin map regardless of biome/animal habits, but other than blueberries, wildlife food source is a serious pain to get ahold of and I'm not sure where else to get water other than looting, because I'm damn sure not touching one of those black hole lakes no doubt spawned by Satan himself.*No ""lock in"" option when making games, allowing you to easily get frusterated, log out, change settings, and go back in, which may be fun for some people but for me, if the temptation to brb and return with a missile launcher overrides my ""punching 40 zombies PITA meter"" well, there goes a good challenge.*This is the biggest pain in the♥♥♥♥♥of them all, and is without a doubt the #1 cause of my ""would not recommend"" attitude. Flying. ♥♥♥♥ing. Zombie. Bees. I **** you not I'm sitting in a tent, with 20 torches everywhere, seeing all zombies coming at me, casually taking them out with guns/fist/knife/stick/w.e I feel like, and I hear this satanic buzzing, my only thought is ""you've gotta be kidding me"" No, the game does not kid, there are giant♥♥♥♥♥hornets the size of my dog flying around being annoying and of course attacking you. Know what the fun part is? Regardless of torches, you can't see them at night unless you have light going UP. Overwhelming zombies? Ok, Zombies eat through metal? wtf? I guess I can do that, Zombies run? Spit? Climb? Take 50 punches to kill? Ok. Flying zombie hornets? Nope **** this goodbye ~-~)pAlot more I'd like to point out but this review feels overly long as it is, the game itself sounds great, but as of the time of posting it's a bit sketchy for me, considering the fact that it's alpha I can look past it, however I feel as though the game is not CURRENTLY in a position that I'd recommend anyone to play. Overall I think it has potential to become an amazing game, but too many disappointments(coughskilltrees), ruined pants(WHY IS IT FLYING), and bugs(I hope that holetosatan water is a bug anyways) and lack of realism(tankdeer, punching through metal/stone with rotting flesh/etc) make it currently unappealing. I will, of course, check back with the game after a few updates and play it some more, maybe forcing a few hours in early(zombies.. o,..,,o) This is a game worth keeping your eyes on, but not currently playing, could easily be one the best games of the century!

								This game is pretty fun, compared to WarZ I mean ""Infestation: Survivor Stories"". Why? You don't have to play with others if you don't want to, you don't have to worry about a hacker killing you and taking all your loot. Glitches/errors/things that got over looked, get fixed pretty fast. WarZ on the other hand, the bugs wouldn't get fixed in the next patch, no they're fool around with something like Loot spawns first... Yes I like WarZ but they waste a lot of time other less important things within the game, like remaking Colorado, when there are more pressing things that need to be fixed.Ever patch, so far has improved the game. 1.1 was you started your game, you had no choice of what you gonna be man or woman, nothing. You had no option of the level of difficulty, the option to make how long the day and night cycles run, or is the Zombies could run (in the dark, all day long, or not at all). You couldn't start a game and make it public, or private, control the number of people allowed in. You could only make so many things, from then, now they've added so much more. It's just getting better and better, because you can do all those things now, and you know there is more to come.My favorite thing in this game is building your base. Do you wanna fight the horded all night and day, or dig so deep and bunker down. The options to be vault people is there, the option to be defender of the castle is there. The choice is yours. You can build die, and learn form your mistakes.			"

								I've been hooked on this game for weeks now. Here's the elevator speech:Is it a Day Z clone?  Yeah, sure.  It's what Day Z could have been if it wasn't abandonwear.  The developers are very active and release updates constantly.  Is it a Minecraft clone?  Sure, you could say that too.  It takes some of the best features of Minecraft and implements them well.  Yes, as others have said, it is a Day Z meets Minecraft love child, in all the right ways.  The crafting system is deep, tons of loot and a vast variety of it.  Lots and lots of building options as well.Now to address some of the ugly stuff a few negative reviewers have said.  Yes, the game is rough around the edges.  It is and ALPHA.  Sometimes things will happen, for better or worse, due to error.  Sometimes it's tragic, sometimes it works to your advantage, sometimes it's just hilarious, but when you play this game, you need to know you're playing an alpha.  Yes, some of the textures are ugly.  Yes, there are balance issues.  Yes, some features are less than reliable.  That all being said, this is the best alpha I've ever played, and it is always getting better.It is also true that there is a learning curve.  Just like any game with deep crafting, building, etc... because there is a lot you CAN do, there are a lot of things to know.  Most of it is pretty intuitive, but you will find yourself reading forums and the wiki alot.  It's just that kind of game.I've been reading about rude moderators in the forums.  I don't know much about that, I jump in to find an answer to a question I have and jump right back out.  That may or may not be true, but at the end of the day, it doesn't make the game any less fun.BOTTOM LINE:  If you like open world survival/crafting games, this is the best one of the lot, and I've played them all.  Better than RUST, better than DAY Z.  WAY better than all the other abandonwear and halfassed rip offs in this genre that polute the Steam store.  Is this a clone?  Yeah, it is.  But it's one of those rare clones that's better than it's own inspiration.			"

								Day 21 AftermathCome nightfall, I lasted for less than an hour before the zombies got me.  They clustered on the north wall until they broke through, climbing over each other's corpses.  At least I could see them better this time with the torches I'd placed.  I picked off some with arrows, but I should've used my meager supply of bullets.  In the end they surrounded me from the inner staircase and the 2nd floor balcony.  They chewed through the wall, the doors, and even halfway into the foundation, though the building's still structurally sound.Goals for next week: forge a pickaxe and start an escape tunnel from my base to the natural cavern I found earlier.  Mine for iron in the process.  Add another layer of spikes around the base and repair/strengthen the walls.  Stretch goal: start a garden with the corn & potatoes I've scavenged.***Here's the thing.  The zombies are coming in 7 days, and every week they get stronger.  So while there's a big world to explore and it may seem downright tranquil now, you'd better be one focused taskmasker if you're going to be prepared in time.You'll go back and forth between nomadic and sedentary life.  You'll start out punching grass, and charring that pig you clubbed to death over a campfire (if you don't have to devour it raw that is).  You'll progress, hopefully, until you're sitting pretty in your reinforced bunker, dining on bear stew and blueberry pie.You'll likely always be desperate for something, be it clean water, medicine, building material, metals, or that one part you need to make a gun.  Missing any one of these for long can be fatal, because everything connects with everything else.  The crafting is intuitive, and makes good use of the materials available.  For instance, when you kill an animal, you can get meat, fat, bone, and hide.  Each of these is useful for something very different, and while you may have an excess of some stuff, you'll be wise to never throw things away if you have the space.The game is forgiving enough without being too forgiving.  By default, when you die you can respawn on or near your bed, and all your stuff is in your backpack where you died.  However, once in a while my backpack disappears and I lose some of my best stuff (bug?).  In multiplayer you'll have to defend yourself from other survivors, who are craftier at getting to you and your stuff.  But land claim blocks and locks are meant to alleviate this.  I've only played single player and with friends, so I can't say how good or bad PvP may be.			"

Kotaku, Rock Paper Shotgun, Polygon, one by one the nearby independent communities slip back into the tumblr fold. tumblr Transliving Deadkin sit in the Rapeland Mountains and the Transethnic Forests, poised to strike to the south and east. The world holds its breath, and waits. For one small group of elite soldiers, the war has already begun. The Patriarchy Special Forces Group, Man Battalion, Ableist Company, deployed on peacekeeping duty to the Republic of Triggering in the Rapelands. This handful of Supreme Gentlemen represents the very tip of the phallus, the first line of defense. Equipped with the latest battlefield technology, and trained in the latest techniques of opressive warfare, they strike swiftly, silently, invisibly. They call themselves ""the Mysogynists.""In this game, ""TOM CLANCY'S 7 DAYS 2 DIE"" you do battle with severely mentally disturbed users of a website known as Tumblr, whom believe themselves to be reanimated corpses with an endless hunger for living/male flesh.  Your only hope for saving the world is to fight your way through the nigh endless hordes of pretend-dead-people, and sever the head of their organization in the Synagogue of Degeneracy, Patricia Hernandez, and thus closing shut the jaws of Oblivion, forever.

								Slightly Addictive gameplay?? with nearly 1200 hours under my belt I'd say yes indeed.The game just keep's getting better but never losing what makes it addictive, the constant work towards something better, with the constant fear of loss.The fully destructable world and the voxel building and crafting put it a step ahead of ARK : Srvival and the like, because you can build whatever you like, trenches, bases, defenses, it's not predefined like it is in games like ARK.It's LEGO, you craft block by block.The new RPG Skills and Perk tree really do a great job in fleshing out your character and brings skill benefits for working together in a small group with specialists, you can still play solo, you just need to be a little more frugal with your skill points spending.Lots of servers out there, hugly active multiplayer, building your own server is pretty easy if yo udont like the way others are set up.AAA+++ for the Fun Pimps, they keep working on this little gem of a game and the love and care shines through.Follow Joel on the dev diary here http://joelhuenink.tumblr.com/ "

								Oh look yet another zombie game.  That being said it's a really really good zombie game.  After 1300+ hours of game play I am still enjoying this game.  I have owned the game since Alpha 6.  We're currently on Alpha 15 and The Fun Pimps continue to make this game better and better.  On the rare occasion they add something that makes the game worse and the community complains, they tweek it and find a way to make the game fun without making it easy.  If you like murdering zombies, building, scavenging, crafting or trading, you'll probably like this game.			"

								A brilliant combination of your favourite voxel crafting game and your favourite zombie game, all in one neat infinite world multiplayer survival package without the abundent bugs and general lousiness of a crafting clone. This game has come a long way and is very well done.			"

								Alpha 13 has taken away and messed up a lot of aspects of this game that I loved, but I still recommend it because it's still fun.But I want the old forges back (where you poured iron/brass/glass/etc into a mold of an object and got that object instead of feeding a forge resources and having it poop back out whatever you want if it has the right tools attached to it). I want different types of meat back, as another reviewer said. Bear stew, venison stew, rabbit stew having different benefit levels? Loved it! I don't like the new UI very much and I feel like crafting has been ruined. The old display of food/water status above health and stamina was great! Why take that out? The server I play on has it modded back in and I'm grateful for that.The skill system is... really kind of ridiculous. Alpha 9 was the most fun I've ever had in a survival/crafting game. It was simple enough yet complex enough. I liked how crap fell on the ground when you cut trees or broke stones instead of just flooding into my inventory. I do like the new zombies but the ""assemble"" crafting system for weapons/power tools irritates me to no end, as does the fact that I can no longer make molds for gun components and make them at my forge. What happened, guys? I'm really holding out hope for A14.			"

								If you like zombie games more sandboxy, if you also liked the idea of minecraft and others like it but hated the oldschool look and feel then you'll like this. I mostly play on scavenger as it suits my laid back attitude, but if your a hardcore nutter then max out the settings and see how long you live for. You can play multiplayer or single (I prefer single mode) and the game has a whole lotta things you can fiddle with to get the type of game you want. Gather supplies, build stuff or just tunnel underground and pray, you play how you like which is epic imo. Even though it's in the early stages and thus changing at times (sometimes needin a good tweek) it's good fun I have have no regrets buying into, it unlike a few other greenlight games I've bought.A14 and all I can say is from epic to more epic, when this game hits release in the future it will set a new standard, even at this early stage it is an awesome blend of survival/crafting/rpg elements. I only play single player and lan with my wife and I have not had a game that has so many options or different ways to play it. You should be warned though, the game has two sides to it, first you must learn to survive the enviroment and then there's the z's, both will try to kill you, good luck.			"

								This is my first review, so i apologise if it is rubbish!I started playing this game a few months back and have to say i really love it, even my partner plays it now, there is always something to do, building to upgrade food to collect etc etc.I see a fair few reviews of people saying that its to hard, you spawn then end up dying to quick, just one little tip for people starting out,  who havnt played the game. get some wood get some grass grab some stone, make your self a crossbow find some birds nests / trash for feathers and make some crossbow bolts, you can do that within the first few minutes of starting the game, makes it a lot easier then to not get murdered and chewed on by zombies.Overall, in my opinion the games is brilliant and there is still more to come! graphics may not be the best, but hey! its Early Access its not going to be top notch just yet, but there is still hours upon hours of fun to be had, whether it be solo or with friends.Huge selection of things to craft, large area to uncover, buildings to search, make a fortress, dig a hole, whatever you want! Just craft a crossbow first! (or aim for the heads).I personally reccomend this game to anyone who likes survival crafting building kill the dam zombies! (games) Dont give up to soon! try again!   10/10			"

								I've played quite a few zombie survival games and even non-zombie survival games, and the one game that rises above them all, alpha stage or not, is 7 Days to Die.  While it does, at times, get a tad on the boring side still traversing the map looking for points of interest and taking several in game hours to find them, and while it does get a tad monotonous finding the same 2-4 houses time and time again, everything else pretty much falls into place.Don't get me wrong, every alpha game has it's glitches and bugs, and that's why it's alpha, but you don't see 7 Days to Die ""starting over"" like some other games out there *cough rust cough*, or being only playable enough to craft about 5 things and that's it.  There are only two alpha games I have ever bought where I did not regret it, and that is this one, and Factorio. (check it out via google. It's not on Steam.)  Now on to specifics.First, environment. More specifically, audio. For me, I always choose to play with music off, so I can't comment on any music, however I do remember the 7 Days to Die menu theme to be prety catchy. I will say that this is the ONLY game I have ever played where I have literally jumped or felt actual fear when playing. Some people have felt that while playing F.E.A.R., Slenderman, or other games, but I really didn't. This one however, when I am looting a house, and I hear snarling, drooling, barking, vomiting, groaing, screaming, breaking wood, breaking glass, breaking concrete, and metal being hit, all at the same time, and I can turn around and not tell where all the sounds are coming from, it gets pretty scary.  And let me tell you, when you can't get inside somewhere safe at night and those zombies and dogs are running at you and you can barely see, that, my friend, is pretty darn terrifying. I don't get scared by much, The Fun Pimps do a good elicting the fear emotion out of me when playing this game.I do love the ""AHA"" moments of the random generaed maps now as well when I DO discover new things. Like the first time I discovered twin factories, I stood in amazement and thought of all the wonderful things to do with it. I tried making a base out of it but discovered it was much too large to defend alone, but it sure was fun trying.  Or the first time I discovered a non-center city on the map, or got my final magnum part. Those were pretty cool moments for me.  Sure, one could turn on creative mode and just give yourself those things, but that takes the fun out of it when you are working together with 4-5 other people and you are the first on your server to craft a magnum, or to find a factory, or something like that. Those moments happen for everyone.  The zombie pathing and A.I. is a bit glitchy, but they are fixing that soon in 9.2, so I won't talk much about that, but it is annoying.  There are little weird things like destroying cement ramps outside of a parking garage and getting wood planks as a result, or being able to plant trees on roads. Nothing major, but still there.Graphically, this game is amazing. I only started playing about 2 days before 9.0, so I never saw the game personally when it was more cubed, but what I saw in videos, the smoothing of the world is a big step up. I never knew this was a voxel game until I read it. Playstyle is great, I wouldn't change a thing, Crafting is also great. There are so many things you can make, but I do feel there should be a few more things, such as the medicine cabinet, wall safe, and wall lights. I think those should be craftable. Maybe they will be in a future patch, I don't know.I don't know much more to say, other than all I really see are improvements from the makers, and they continue to do so. I haven't seen anything about adding fishing to the game, so I hope that is a plan at some point. Maybe it was a future stretch goal that didn't get met.UPDATED REVIEW: Alpha 13.8: I STILL highly recommend this game. It keeps getting better and better. Sure there are new bugs and still some old ones, but the developer team is small so they can only do so much. And it's still Alpha, so you are basically testing the game while playing.The new UI and Crafting system is great in my opinion. I see a lot of people with 1000+ hours say they hate A13, that it ruined the game and would no longer recommend it, but I am of the opposite. A13, IMO, made the game better. And A14 is around the corner and is going to have perks, an introductory quest, and much needed fixes and optimizations. You CANNOT go wrong buying this game, and as of this edit, it is HALF OFF!

								Review for 7 Days to DieI'm going to write this review based on version 10.3 (29'th of december 2014) - 7 Days to Die continues to impress with ever increasing patches and fixes coming from the development team. I must admit i was fearing for this game to turn out like the crappy Day Z or something like that, but the way this game has turned out is truly remarkable. It is so good i even bought a copy for my younger brother just to support the development team. Why is it good you ask? Well, the game contains key features regarding the freeworld, survival, RPG genres, which for example is interactive wellness needs (food, water, medication etc.) and extremely detailed building recipes and such, example: you cut down a tree, create planks, create wooden frame, fortify wooden frame, reinforces = zombie proof. This might sound like a lot of micromanagement but i assure you, it is not. You are always active while playing this game, always looking for ways to get better guns or better resources to fortify your magnificent Fort Knox of Reinforced concrete with a 100 meter deep trench......... With some wooden spikes in the bottom of course. In short, most amazing game ever with the greatest potential i have witnessed. Sorry for the long post steam-community here is a little song to cheer you up:

								if graphics don't matter to you then this game is jewellots of time has been sunk into building my impenetrable bunker deep beneath a lake.Forge your self alies in the world and scavange for that much needed food, metal and ammo.You'll quickly note that this game pays for itself after you have picked it up.However still in early access and as has been showen before that your world and all the hard work could be wiped in the near future. worth picking up and playing still and you'll enjoy every moment of the bad graphics as zombies and dogs chase you down, tear your house appart and rend the flesh from your bones. got a sniper rifle? dont lose it unless you have a mold to create a new one.You will spend a lot of time competeing over supply drops as a lot of weapon crafting can only be done by dismatling and taking molds of the guns in those boxes, procedually generated nonblocky world is a pleasure to run around in, enimies and AI are some what lacking (they are zombies after all) enviromental hazards and hordes are abound, then everything changes at night...9/10 due the server wipes, will increase this after the game is fully released			"

								Holy Crap. This game gives credence to the theory ""any game is more fun with zombies in it."" -- it's basically minecraft in a zombie apocalypse, and it is FUN. You basically use the daytime hours to scrounge, explore, pursue your goals, and find safe haven (while the zombies are slower and less numerous) and use the night hours (when you'll need stealth and luck to survive for even a minute outside) fortifying your position, crafting what you've scavenged into things you need, and monitoring your defenses from the tireless predations of the dead. Complex crafting system that allows you to dismantle/reverse-engineer or build nearly anything you can find in the game. ALL TERRAIN completely deformable, by you, friends/foes, and the undead. I've played NUMEROUS campaigns and they have all ended in one of two ways -- crushed under the unrelenting hordes, or completely organically and spontaneously finding and making an awesome enclave that grew out of the circumstances I happened upon. Crafting, Fighting, Forging, Farming, Terraforming -- it's all there and it's all fun. AND THE GAME IS ONLY IN ALPHA! More content added all the time, (as of this date 3/2/14)			"

								Have 112+ hours in this game 91+ within the last 2 weeks. Look its an alpha. There are glitches, som hiccups but htis game has not only captivated my family and I  ( family now has 4 accounts and growing) its also become a feature on my Twitch stream. I have found much here i like from its crafting to it wide selection of server types. You want a Day Z experience with loss of everything when you die, they got that. Want a PVE server with more time to build amazing stuctures? They got that too.  In fact with so many server side options you can basically find a server type that suits your tastes. Has a result of my streams several viewers have also now purchased the game and I enjpy these adventures we're having. No matter how you like to play 7Days gives you plenty to do.  Once you experience your first encounter with a zombie horde you will be hooked. With Devs hard at work on updates I look forward to seeing what comes next for this game.  Survive, build, create, its all there. An excellent work in progress and worth your time and money.			"

								I wouldnt recommend the game in its current form(Alpha 7.2) because it just has too many gamebreaking bugs still in it. For example if you die on a car you lose all your stuff(backpack doesnt get created) but also other things like not being able to loot something because your inventory is full even tough you could stack the items, you would need to do it manually. If you were looking to buy this or dayz id recommend dayz for the current state of game. The graphics are really bad but since its just the alpha i will let it pass as is. To summerize: Buy it later if possible or if you really want a zombie survival game id choose dayz			"

								Alpha Build Review as of November 2016: It's still awesome.7D has a ton of content especially for an alpha. Compare it to other alphas like back when Minecraft was in alpha, and the quality is also notable. Few crashes in my 100 hours of play, biggest technical issue I have is a greatly variable framerate, on a GTX 970 still dipping to 20fps at times.Overall, people might say it's a Minecraft/DayZ... and it pretty much is, but in the good way. A challenge to scavenge, a variety of changing, persistent PVE as time goes on, and a fairly hefty crafting system that mimics Minecraft's simplicity-crafting-grid type scenario. The voxel system is a neat physics addition compared to most builders, I'd say this plays as a more realistic, harder Minecraft, but with a wide variety of game settings to tailor to your playstyles, a great addition.If you like the builder-survival-crafting type games, I'd say this is one of the best at the moment, with a real reason to team up, especially on a public server, and not a total PVP deathmatch-with-zombies like DayZ or H1Z1. Can't say it's the most amazing of course, but I definitely enjoy my time with it and will hope they keep fleshing out the bugs and PVE side of things.			"

								This's like dayz, you have to survive againt the weather, players and zombies while you hunt and harvest to have your own food. But here you also may construct your own house/base in blocks (relax the game is not in blocks), watchout contruct your base before the 7º day or you will see what is difficulty. The beginning may be a bit hard for beginners so I will give some tips, about the weather, well, don't go to the snow before you have your own clothes specially a good sweater and stay away from water or you will freeze faster in this biome (use stones to make a bonfire and wood to ignite), about the desert use light clothes and if you find water jump into to refresh before you lose health.In the beginning you can make your ""clothes"" using plant fiber or cotton and construct a ""stone axe"" using plant fiber, wood and stone and this is what will help you to take more woods and stones to construct your stuffs, you may also contruct a shovel that you will use to cave some clay (you may recognize it by the orange earth on the ground while you walk or even in the map) and contruct a furnace to make some iron burning some metal and finally progress in your game. There is a lot of thing to learn but I can't write everything here, just discover by yourself, this is the fun, oh and be sure you will die a lot, good luck.I just love survival games and this one impressed me a lot.10/10			"

								I was iffy about buying this game because the last early-access software I bought failed to deliver.  This game, however, is definitely proving worth the cost.  It's only in Alpha 9.3 as of this writing, but it's already better quality than many ""finished"" games I've seen.I think the best way to describe the feel of this game is to walk you through a brief chapter of my most recent game.  I found a building made out of stone, and decided that it would be a good place to try to fortify.  An overhang on the second floor blocked line-of-sight to the front of the door for anyone standing on top of the house.  I knew that was a major weakness; once the zombies get to the door, I would have no way of killing them without losing my last line of defence.  I decide to try to use the cinderblocks that are lying all around to construct another wall around the house, built in such a way that I can shoot down on the zombies trying to break through it.  Less than an eighth of the way through building my wall, I look up and can't even see the end of the line of zombies coming at me.My weapons are limited.  I have a crossbow, but it reloads so slowly that I'll only be able to take down three or so zombies before they get to me.  My sledgehammer can kill a zombie with one well-placed strike, but going into melee range with a horde that side would be suicide.  I've got about 100 rounds for a handgun, it's my only choice.  Taking careful aim to ensure headshots, I take down a half-dozen zombies.  More and more keep coming; I retreat up to the balcony.  I know that once the zombies get under the balcony, I won't be able to stop them from reaching me on the porch, but I reinforced the door, so I should be safe for a minute or two.  I try to pick off as many zombies as I can before they can hide under the balcony.  Once the end of the horde arrived, I knew that about ten have made it to the door.  I go downstairs to see how the door's holding up.  Luckily for me, the zombies aren't organized.  Some are trying to break down the windows, some are going for the door.  None of them have gotten a full breach yet.  I return to the balcony, trying to see if I can take down a few more before the wall is breached.  Some of the zombies notice me up top, and try to destroy a support column for the balcony.    This leaves them in a vulerable position, I take a few more down.  I hear breaking glass.  Trying to line up another shot, I fall off of the balcony.  There's still six zombies left, and they're all headed straight for me.  I open fire on them while backpedaling, hoping that there aren't more undead behind me.With the carnage over, I repair the ground floor.  Night is coming soon, and I won't be able to finish the perimeter walls before sunset.  Time to see if I can cobble together the last part I need to build a shotgun.  If a horde visits me tonight, that Beretta won't save me.			"

Its especially fun as a co-op, I can't wait for the completed version its going to be mind blowing.

								I'm a big zombie survival crafting fan and at this point have close to 700 hours in 7dd. While I still think 7dd is the best game in this genre I can't recommend this game in current state (alpha 15). There are some bugs in game that should have been fixed by now, I can play only 32 bit version and still have problems with EAC. Some people will say this is early access... Don't even get me started on that, if developer has time to work on console version it should certainly have time to  fix major bugs. Crafting is probably the best part of the game I like, but for fighting I would rather go to dead island and zombie army trilogy. Maybe one day 7dd will get better but considering their development cycles that won't be another year or so, and I think I know by know how they work since I've spent countless hours on their website/forums/blog.

								This game is fantastic in many ways and has the ability to be by far the most entertaining survival game made, but a few things hold it back from being perfect. First lets talk about the good parts of the game.Pros-Challenging pve-Great crafting system-Map generation is great-Graphicly getting better with each update-Building mechanics are done right-Plenty of levels of difficulty allowing the game to be as hard or easy as you like-level up system with item quality based on level -Craftable minibikeNow on to the cons of the gameCons-Lots of bugs that can cause items to dupe or dissapear-PVP has hackers (this just happens not much to be done about this)-Takes way too many materials to make the highest end buildings -Sometimes my legs randomly break VERY annoying-Updates come out very slowly for the game has been in early acess for quite some time.Overall this game is a 9.2/10 and extremely time consuming if you get addicted to sandbox games like me. In my opinion its a fantastic game if you can get over some of the bugs and will keep you entertained for a couple hundered hours so it's well worth the money.			"

								I love this game. Ive played alot of servivel games and so far this is my choice for best of all time. I would like to see developers add something to make grouping more benificial for players. I know the new skill system (jobs) in 13 patch will help but you can still make everything in the game just not as the other guy that is skilled at that job. Im talking buffs that help if in group. I get this is a pvp servivel game for most part but need to balance the time people are off line. I know i cant play 24/7 and probly many people cant. So what does that leave kids griefing bases just because they can when empty server. Ive seen my kids search threw servers that look good to them go in server for about 15 mins. and find people that have built above ground bases and raid them off line then go back when people are on and build and search for new bases to raid. My point there is kids they have alot of time to play can make a bad server. ive played since 4.0 i think i have played alot of hours and these 2 thing have been my complaint since start plz put in forms if you aggree with me. I would really like to see something done about it. Thank you.			"

								The game is good, but if you're gonna play on Linux or a Mac then just don't buy it. The dev has not prioriticed the Linux or Mac version, so everything is black/white. I don't think the dev will continue on those versions any time soon.			"

								I was given this game for free, friend bought it for me. Had a lot of fun playing it with friends. We pretty much played it every day, and are still playing it now (with a good MOD). Considering the fact that the game has been charging people money and has been on early access for over 3 years, without mods, the game can feel noticeably incomplete. Animations are buggy, which sucks when you have to land a head shot, zombies can spaz out, spin around like a top, or glitch through the floor or wall. Large parts of terrain can just disappear, you can fall through the world, chests bug out - not allowing you to open them, needing you to exit and reload the world. All in all, it is also very poorly optimized - runs poorlyLook I had fun with the game, that is very important, but I can't recommend buying this. You guys need to respect yourselves. If you buy games like these, and they do well - eventually we will be deluged with promising and perpetually unfinished products. We don't buy hopes and dreams, we should be buying finished games.Buy this game in another 3 years, maybe then. IF you want to give money away to a charity, who am I to stop you? But I really don't like these kinds of practices. I'm going to guess that this game will be in EA forever.EDIT:Processor Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU@3.60GHz 3.60 GHzInstalled memory (RAM) 8.00 GBSystem Type: 64-bit Operating System, x64-based processorNVIDIA GeForce GTX 760			"

								This game is a great, great game I would HIGHLY reccomend, even at it's original alpha price of 35$ Now that it's 25$ if you like the concept of Dayz minecraft just make the jump and get it, you won't be dissapointed.   I have bought Dayz, Rust and this, and while I like them all Dayz has been uninstalled. I like playing Rust a lot right now, but creatively I think this game takes the cake. I have always been entranced with the survival genre, and multiplayer games, especially games that encourage players to collaborate creatively. Rust is a more of a post apocolyptic survival game. Rust isn't a kos nightmare frenzy like Dayz is because you do get the ability to stash things and create bases, but as of right now pvp is the more mid-game/end-game goal as everything else becomes fairly easy once you get to know the mechanics. Rust (like Alpha Dayz) relys on the pvp to define the gaming exerience, and it basically turns into a fps where you want to loot cool pvp gear from other people. Just like Dayz. (Not bashing on it I am loving it right now.)  7 Days to Die however is a different creation and an entirely unique game. It is truly a zombie survival sandbox, that can be enjoyed greatly without even going online. The Zombie AI is great, even in its Alpha phase. Even slow walking zombies have a way of creeping up on you without you knowing until the last second, or filling into a house blocking the exits as you are checking food cabinets, forcing you to jump through a window.  I think the coolest thing about the game is that it is not just one game. You truly create the experience that you want to play. The Default (as you have probably heard) is that during daytime there are slow walking zombies, and at nighttime they turn into fast zombies. Extremely fast frenzied zombies that only slow down in the prescence of enough light (campfires, torches, ect.) The zombies will claw through any material to get to you. How long it takes for them to claw through a material depends on how durable that material is (stone is stronger than wood, which is clearly stronger than dirt.) A mudhut would be taken down in seconds at night time. Just being outside at nighttime in default is terrifying, encouraging a kind of forage and basebuilding during daytime, and fortifying and repairing your base at night time. You can change pages of settings, and even more in depth settings not in the actual game to craft the game that you want, choosing how many zombies spawn, if they are always walkers, or always runners, how much damage they do, or you do and many, many more options. I never really could get into minecraft because while I loved the concept, I felt no immersion. I felt that the game focused more on the creativity, than the survival immersion, but not only am I not good drawing or art, let alone 3D art, but the 3D art that I could create was in my opinion not terribly interesting, or at least not pleasing to look at. This game is all about immersion, and the graphics are incalcuably better than minecraft (and constantly getting better.) Still the physics are solid and sound, and to me incredible. Every piece of the game world is some sort of resource that you can mine and collect. Every inch of dirt is diggable and obtainable. Every stone that you see can be picked up and crafted into stone ""blocks"" (They are starting to replace classic minecraft blocks with ""smooth terrain"" something that ironically in the present state I find less smooth and easy to work with than the original block style, but I am sure that will be refined and corrected.) The reward of simply surviving is one very satisfying, yet incredibly hard goal, but really the sky is the limit. Jump on a friendly server and I am constantly shocked by the imagination these people have. They will have turned a warehouse into a castle surrounded by landmines and trenches with spikes on the bottom of them. Go into the castle and it is just a decoy, and ladders plummet deep, deep down into the earth where there is an entire underground world, with many rooms, undergound rivers, mines, bedrooms, lounges and tunnels. Above ground there are towers that lead to large gardens growing many different vegetables and fruit. There is a sandbox ""God"" or ""Cheat"" mode where you can spawn any item or resource that you want at any time allowing you to create anything you can dream up.  My first online experience was on a new server when the game had just came out, and a bunch of us found a huge town where we intended to stay together. We did the first night and ended up blowing a staircase away as zombies flooded into the house, shooting them as they tried to jump up the destroyed staircase. We somehow survived and looted the town the next day, but I got seperated and nighttime fell before I could find them and I was trapped in a small shack with one other person and no good defensive resources. Needless to say we were destroyed. My next online game we were in the ruins of a town full of large half destroyed buildings, many floors high, but basically trapped with hordes of zombies below us. I could go on forever but I will end this with saying if you are on the fence look at the patch notes. Out of all of the Alphas, these developers seem to be the most dedicated and hardworking developers intent on providing us with amazing gameplay rather than just trying to let the community make our own gameplay. Every month a miriad of changed occur making the systems more complex and in depth and adding new systems. The map gets larger and larger, even though eventually they will let us create our own maps and create random map generators. The graphics got a huge overhaul in the last build. In the last build we have got a working stealth and cooking system, as well as the beginning of an armor system. These developers are dedicated to making a truly great game with great AI, and it really is refreshing. It is to me a really good example of how gameplay is more important than graphics, something that tends to be forgotten in this day and age. And the graphics aren't bad.			"

								As of this writing, I've invested over 1,800 hours into this game since Alpha 5 was released in early 2014, and I haven't regretted it since. The dev team is clearly committed to making improvement after improvement, and the game is vastly superior to where it was a year ago. If you want near-complete control of your world, love building, crafting, and getting slammed with overwhelming zombie hordes in a post-nuclear apolalyptic world, this is your game.			"

								I absolutely love this game. As a creative person I get to build almost everything while surviving in a world with the undead. My two favourite things combined together! 7 Days is a growing game, and the developers are always in touch with the community, only recently are they posting a new patch which excites me beyond relief. 7 Days is a survival crafting game, where you have to survive in a world of the dead. You can build shelter, find food from scraps, learn new skills from stores, and so much more. Best yet is that you can play with your friends and survive together. I have very little criticism due to the key fact that the developers are in touch. Brilliant game, and It's got massive potential.			"

								i actually enjoyed this game up until version 13 at some degree. but after this versions ""fix"" it is clear that the game is not going to be fixing the most dire problems as spawning issues and spawn rate that have been an issue for a long time now. upping the grapics and crafting is not going to get players to enjoy the game, when enemies are ""teleported"" magically 5 to 50 feet from you and they ""know"" your location regardless of you are hidden or visible. my zombie lore may be limited, but i never heard of a ""this way to the living"" compass built in to the zomies head before.

								Spawned in rainy snow biome, made full clothes then got wet. This led to stage 2 hypothermia that drained my stamina until I was mauled by a horde.Spawned in the same biome 3 miles away from where I died and this time I stood on my camp fire. Five real time minutes later, I finally stopped having hypothermia, but was still too cold to go get more fuel. Horde found my camp and chased me off. I soon froze.I was able to escape the snow, but ran into a city where a fat police spit at me. Was getting wet the entire time. Chased into the snow again and had the second situation happen and died.By this time I had so little max health that anything could take me out. Got stunned by a lumberjack horde and died.The run I was able to make a base, the game practically forced one style of building or else your base will crumble and all the above will happen to you over and over again.Also, you need a dedicated server to play on, meaning you need to configure your network settings and spend at least an hour setting things up to have all the above happen to your merry band of survivors. Or you could buy a server from a third party hosting service. Or you could use the game's abyssmal ""Survival MP"" function that breaks every few in game days and forces you to reset your progress.TL;DR This game is another example of wasted potential, While it has good concepts, it's too difficult early on, forcing players to die numerous times before giving up, and looking up how to work around the game's numerous unbalances and glitches. Ask yourself this, how much crap are you willing to look past?(For the record, I was actually able to configure my own network to create an actual private dedicated server, but the program I used apparently was abandoned and no longer works. IMO, it's not worth it to wrestle with my network and the game again to get another server running.)			"

								A year ago, I would have recommended this game highly. I spent hours and hours building bases, crafting weapons, surviving hordes, and the ambiance of the game was so well crafted I found myself having nightmares about getting overrun by zombies.But Alpha 13 was a bad start and Alpha 14 has just made the game downright unplayable. I think they've focused so much on securing deals with Telltale, they've lost focus on delivering a quality experience to their original gamers.Here are my complaints:1) the weather system is ridiculously illogical - I've been in heatstroke during a snowstorm. As a player, you will spend nearly all your time just searching for water and drinking red tea. This is not hyperbole - in a 24 hour day, I spend about 16 hours just trying to keep myself hydrated.2) while the graphics have improved dramatically, the bugs they've introduced are horrible. Zombies randomly clip through walls. Hornets spawn an endless stream of zombies so hordes several days.3) it's become a grinding-based game just trying to accumulate enough materials to build and maintain a base. Exploration isn't all that possible now unless you play the game fully-nomadic, in which case, you desperately need a minibike and loads of gas so you can simply outrun the bugged hordes.4) quests and skills weren't thought out well. They're there just to be there, not because they add any value to the game experience.5) on any difficulty above Scavenger, due to the spawning bugs, the game becomes impossible to survive as the weapon balancing has been readjusted so your guns are virtually useless vs. the literal hundreds of zombies that will come your way.I really, really wish they'd focus less on the aesthetics and understand that gameplay is more than appearance.

								From my first try I was hooked on 7 Days to Die.  I missed the Kickstarter for this game, unfortunately, picking it up on the advice of a trusted Youtube Letsplayer at the stage of Alpha 1, and thought, wow this is for me.    From its very early stage of development this game was fully and excitingly playable, and somehow you could tell it had legs.  This game was exciting, realistic, fully working with my PC spec. and totally absorbing.  Blocky graphics didnt matter;  I loved the  way everything but everything is destructable and craftable.  Many have said this is DayZ meets Minecraft, and that is true in all the good ways.  Building your own base, finding ways to keep hordes out, farming your own crops and killing your food after the post apocalypse world is looted out was a challenge, taxing and deeply satisfying.  Its not enough to dig a hole in the dirt and wait for sunrise; Zombies in this game are worthy opponents.  You will NOT survive if you are out at night, or if your base is weak - these undead are fast, scary, loud and deadly.  Running away is not an option. Then as the long awaited Alpha 2 came out... everything got better and some things got even harder to survive.  Then further updates, more challenges, better graphics, sophisticated crafting tools, this is the gift of a game that keeps on giving.  Just as you thought you had it sussed, new zombie types were introduced, tougher landscapes, zombies that could smell you, hear you, sense you, hunt you.  But its not all in their favour, we now have stealth, smooth terrain, craftable guns, repairable weapons, it just keeps on getting better with each update, and slight (non gamebreaking) bugs are fixed every week and released every friday, so that for a YouTuber like me                                    (  https://www.youtube.com/my_videos?o=U  ) its hard to keep up with the stuff the Fun Pimps roll out.Practically every aspect of the game is adaptable to your level and your enjoyment.  You can play on their default settings or you can make it harder if you like Hard Core, or easier if you want to relax and choose less stress.  Want more loot? fine.  What fewer zombies? fine,  longer days and shorter nights? choose your ratio.  Want Airdrops of supplies? you got it.  Tailor the game just how you like it.  Singleplayer is great, Multiplayer is there if you want company, PvE or PvP, all are available.  The smooth terrain now makes it less like Minecraft or DayZ -  those days of that comparison are over.I believe that any Survivalist (the name we give ourselves in this game) will tell you there have been times when all of us have said ""Darn, thats a bug, but hey - its Alpha, right?""   None of the minor problems along the way to Alpha 8.3 (at time of writing this review) have made the game unplayable,  7 Days to Die in Alpha is better than most games on full and final release, better than I could possibly have expected and worth much more than I paid for it. I fully recommend this game at whatever stage you come on board.  More bang for your buck - definitely.			"

								Why This Alpha Game Is Worth Paying For..Reviewing a Z game nowadays almost seems played out but I feel this one is necessary due to the current amount of them available.Since L4D released in '09 the Z craze has definitely infected the gaming community. Fast forward to now~I've recently played DayZ, Infestation, Dead Linger, Contagion, and now 7D2D...A few noticable difference that stand out:1. 7D2D is very playable in it's current state with a highly interactive Dev team. 2. Everthing in the world is destructable and usually provides resources.3. Your toon can jump!4. The world is persistent offline and online which means your structures and mines stay there until destroyed.5. Crafting System!! <<-- This is one of my favorite aspiects and I cannot  WAIT until they add more recipes!!6. Construction. That's right you can build the zombie survivor base you've always dreamed about.7. Miining.  Mining ores then crafting items. Mining with explosives! +108. High scaleability of server configuration settings which gives complete control of the game environment.9. Hunting and Cooking!! <<--Venison stew anyone? Maybe a blueberry pie..10. Farming. Rooftop Farming FTW!! +1011. Zombies! As many or as few as you like, depending on game settings.      a. Zombies Never Run = 0 or 1     b. Zombies Always Run = 0 or 1     c. Zombies Only Run At Night = 0 or 1     d. Zombie Agression = 1-5     e. Zombie memory time? 60 - 180 seconds     f. Zombies are lootable!12. Character XP/Level system is there but not functional, yet..13. Mod support and toolkit for modeling/worldbuilding and custom scriptingHopefully, this review was helpful for you, I'd like you to spend your money on the right game the first time.I'm sure the others will mature to some great things, but this game is FUN. 7D2D shines amongst the rest in my book and those 13 reasons are why.

								I was truthfully a little sceptical about the asking price for this game, but this game is excellent! I play co-op with my brother on a private server, and we play for hours on end!Pros:* It doesn't feel like Early-access. The game feels largely complete, but there could be improvements* Crafting and gathering is a very fun aspect, and also important to survival* Death isn't just a number, there's a lot to lose from dying, which encourages safer play: something that makes the game more realistic, and more enjoyable* Zombies are a real threat at night-time, and seem to just sneak up on you. There is very little vision (you can obtain forches etc), but I like that this encourages me to stay indoors and safe* Levelling up earns skill points to increase various things* Fun co-operative playCons:* The AI seems a little sloppy* The graphics and animations feel like early 2000's. While better animations and models would be nice, the game is fine as-is* Currently you can't craft everything you see in the game, which is a little frustrating* The game lacks any kind of tutorial, so your first few hours will be largely confusing. This can be offset by just reading a Steam guideI know there appear to be as many cons as there are pros, but the cons are all negligible. Even for the asking price of $25, this game is truly worth it if you're into zombie survival games			"

								Most addictive game I have ever played and it is not even done! It's greatest strength is customization and the ability to make it just the way you want in terms of balance. I am certain this will get even more depth in the future but for now there is a lot of range in what you can do to make the game play just how you like it.The team works hard to give updates and really cares about what fans have to say. A quick visit to their forums will show that these guys have a great grasp on what their followers wish for.			"

								This is my personal opinion,seems theyre trying to capitalize on 7DTD as much as possible as theyve already drained the PC community, theyve rolled only minor patches over several months, seems like theyre focused on something else (porting to consoles).its started to feel like a moneygrab over the late months. hence im giving it a thumbs down.dont buy this till they get their focus back as the game is far from being completed (still alpha).will edit review when i see fit, expecting to see patches rolled out like before this... hiatus we (the community) are getting.

								Speaking as a Linux gamer:Multiplayer is currently a bit buggy (several exploitable glitches and bugs), but that's okay for alpha software. Singleplayer works without issues for me.Overall the game is actually quite fun, especially in Multiplayer (I love PvP). Having to consider other people wanting your stuff (or your life) makes it all the more fun when building your fort and sneaking around in a city or other point of interest to avoid getting seen by players is quite thrilling.If I had to name any, I can think of two downsides:Sometimes, Easy Anti Cheat (a third party tool included to ward off cheaters) is being a pest and causes problems (mostly kicks you from a server). It also didn't solve the cheater problem one bit as far as I can tell. I still see the same amount of cheaters on EAC servers. So you gotta find a server with capable admins that use global banlist and have plenty of staff around to ban cheaters immediately and can restore chunks that have been vandalized by said cheaters.Although not strictly a problem with the game, the developers have an absolutely terrible communication policy. If you're interested in what I mean, you can read up on the whole Linux drama with this game and it will become clear to you what I am getting at. It was bad enough that I felt the need to include it in this review and I still think they should improve this.All things considered, though, I still recommend this game because it's fun.			"

								Surprisingly enough, this is actually a lot of fun to play and is making faster progress than Rust.It's playable, very much so.Think Rust meets minecraft with zombies.Build bases and scavenge during the day, bolt down the hatches and light the fires during the night.With the stealth/sneak system + the dynamic moving hordes, you feel afraid of the night, not like some kind of super soldier.With a full server filled with voice chat and pvp it feels like a day of ""The Walking Dead"" gotta make choices with everyone you meet and take their names, you'll need their help when the night comes to protect yourself.Gone are the days of DayZ where ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rule the world with their ""OneManArmy""♥♥♥♥♥♥ everyone is vulnerable.And if you die, thats it, you lose everything and have to start all over again, thats where the thrill of survival comes in.Everyone you meet, you have to make a choice, do you invite them to help you survive and band together?Or do you shoot them like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and watch the global chat fill with words of your disgrace?I've seen forts where people'v came, been called immigrates as they passed through the litteral gates of success and given a home by those who have already started a camp, usually these poor, friendly folks get stabbed to death, and beds destroyed in their sleep by the dishonest fellows they've accepted as ""friends.""But it's all worth it in the end, you feel like you're in a living breathing world as the zombies flock in great hordes to hunt you down and eat yer brains, if you're playing solo you're obviously doing it wrong, dont be afraid to grab a mic and join the fray online, it's a beautiful thing to experience.Befriend to survive? Or shoot them and take whats theirs.Build, Kill, Survive.Pick 2.			"

Early Access Review
								So. 7 Days to Die. This review is based off of the latest build (infinite world gen)This game started off well, a good first alpha build that showed off the features of the game, but lacked content with a limited map and lacking item explations and crafting options.In this latest build, the game now has an infinitely generated world (which I must say is very well done). After an hour exploring i found a mix of biomes from bombed out, desolated cities (including convincing bomb craters, ruined and intact buildings, ect.)  Goergous forests, stark deserts, lakes flush with wildlife, and frozen hilly forests. One could spend hours just looking for all the nifty features the terrain generator can create, and so far, I have found no real broken generator features.The new crafting menu is vastly improved, eliminating a lot of the guesswork required while still requiring a challenge to find and assemble crafting components for rare recipies. Unlike older versions, the recipe shows all materials needed in the grid, but you need to know what the materials are, and find them before you can build the recipe. The UI overhaul adds modular sets for different crafting recipes, eliminating the one huge recipe list, and also adds color-cordinated backlighting to different items, displaying what catagory of item they are. It also fixed the OCD aggravating clipping between the status bars and hotbar (Thank god).The build still has some problems, sound for one is a huge issue. Zombies are unreasonabley loud at crazy distances, making scavenging overly panic inducing, and often causing injury or death because you can't tell how far away an enemy is. Footsteps and impact sounds also feel too roughshod, and could use an overhaul.Overall, I quite love the game, and i'll probably play around with this build a lot more. Until then, good luck surviving everyone :3 (also. Dysentery. 10/10)			"

								First off I would like to say this is a great game, and hope someday in the future when it is completed this game gets ported to the consoles. There is no game that I know of that has crafting, survival, zombies, multiplayer of this caliber. This game is gorgeous. From the moment the sun sets in game, to the moment the sun rises the game is awesome.When I first tried the game, I was very skeptic, I was like great another zombie shooter game, boy was I wrong. The amount of depth the game has at this early stage is pretty impressive. The Developers are always actively keeping us up-to-date on their progress and constantly showing pics of improvements coming to the game on their blog.I'm currently playing on a public pvp server alpha 9.3. When you first go into the game, it is extremely overwhelming as the learning curve is steep. There is no tutorials so you basically would have to ask people online, or look at some YouTube, wiki, and do some trial and error to learn some of the games mechanics. First person shooter players will feel right at home here, as the controls are basic.When you start your first game, you start out at virtually very little items. You quickly learn that zombies are all around you and you have a limited food supply. You quickly scrounge around in cars, trash bins for food and must collect items to craft basic items to help you with your survival.The crafting menu is straight forward you start out with know recipes such as a stone axe. Crafting an items is simply as just clicking on what you want to craft from the list, drag the components to the grid and click craft. After a short time the item is crafted. As you progress in the game you will find more new books that unlock new recipes. You can create forges that smelt your mining ores such as iron, and you can create a campfire to cook eggs, and raw deer meat (yes you can kill bambi!). Sleeping bags and beds crafted are used to save home locations so when you die you can respawn at them. You can farm food to grow, such as potatoes or coffee beans.The map is huge, plenty of room to roam around and explore or go underground and create secret underground bases by digging. Zombies are slow at day and fast at night, there cute and cuddly but enough to easily overwhelm any player base not properly prepared. You will die a lot in this game, from starvation, diseases and other craziness in the game.So if you’re an explorer or builder type, this game has plenty at its development stage to keep you busy. I recommend playing with friends to enjoy the many ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; moments you’re going to have trying to survive against hordes of zombies.What also makes this game unique is the importance of certain blocks in the game that form the many structures in the game such as buildings and farm houses. For example cement blocks have both a structural integrity that can withstand a lot of damage and has a threshold on the amount of blocks it can hold when used for building. Exceeding these capacities when building and not placing the proper foundation to support buildings can cause the whole building to collapse, pretty impressive from an engineering perspective. You can fortify buildings and upgrade doors windows etc., to withstand more damage.There are many things planned for the game, such as in game vehicles, npc's, and story etc. This game is a good mixture of everything we love in mine craft, left for dead, and fallout games.It is a great game and I highly recommend!

								EDIT Alpha 12.1: Nope, sorry.  Still not enjoying playing this anymore. It is ridiculously dark pretty much all the time. Zombies can be heard almost regardless of distance but, because it is so dark, I can't actually see them until they are almost on top of me. The melee animation looks really stilted now for some reason and even on Adventurer with low spawn settings, zombies are everywhere, all the time. Bears, ditto. Yes, bears are less common since the patch but I still seem to spend half my time running away from either them, or dogs. The Crafting bit of the game has been over run by the Survival Horde part even from Day 1... Maybe I'll come back to it in six months and have another look but, right now, it's on my Can't Be Bothered To Play list.This is really quite disappointing.  I really enjoyed Alpha 11 and clocked up well over 330 hours playing (yes, I know that's not much to many hardcore gamers but it's still my most played EA game on Steam). A12 appears to be rather odd in places and the community discussion boards appear (appear... ) to have a reasonable number of people making legitimate suggestions for improvements and being banned unreasonably quickly. It's definitely very dark, the weather effects are a nice touch but have reduced the visibility substantially and the wet-and-slimey look to the ground is just plain weird.  The bears are an interesting addition but appear far too often in my opinion and the zombie spawn rate appears to have been increased dramatically.I hope the Devs are listening more than some moderators appear (appear...) to be.  This should be an enjoyable game - my last few hours in Alpha12 (Nomad setting) have just been frustrating, dark and stealthing past zombies now seems almost impossible as there's likely to be a dog or bear just around the corner.  The ramping up of the difficulty seems skewed to me.Anyway, I hope those of us who have backed this game in EA (which, after all, is surely the whole point - to obtain player feedback on the game) will be listened to.No, I'm not whining - I'm just looking forward to a patch that resolves a number of the legitimate issues raised by those of us who are supporting the Devs during Alpha in the hope that the final version will be as great as it deserves to be.So, at the moment, I can't recommend this game to new players. I wish it were otherwise as Alpha11 was really good.			"

								7 days to die. WOW. Where do I begin? The game offers so many options in such an early stage, it almost feels complete! However, it is not. Since this is an Early Access review, it will be wrote as such.TL;DR at the bottomGameplay7 Days To Die, in my opinion, is a good cross between what DayZ could have been, with Minecrafts building mechanics and crafting, overhauled. From time to time, the controls can be a bit clunky, swaying around in a direction you hadn't intended. Mocap hasn't been integrated yet so walking, running, and other physical motions are dry.  It is however, very polished, and does not interfere with playability. The game itself handles fine on any well equipped PC.UI & VisualsOptions don't boast too many options in terms of video settings just yet, but offer enough to allow you to tune it to run either performance or quality. It isn't recommended to run it in ultra high settings (unless you can handle it of course), but at a mid point to save yourself from the lag in clustered POI's like cities, neighborhoods, and possible player built settlements.The best part visual wise out of the whole thing is that the entire world is smooth. Everything looks natural and polished, and breaks and modifys just like any other voxel game. It is a learning curve to get used to it if you're just coming in from Minecraft, cause the angles of the ground, cliffs, rocks, etc can be offset looking sometimes, but it looks great and plays fine. The worlds themselves keep getting better and better looking with each update. As of Alpha 10.4, this game already looks wonderful. With the right tweaks, its is a place full of wildlife, and the undead.The UI is nice. It has changed a few times in the course of Alpha 7 through 10, but overall is sleek and very efficient, showing you just your essential meters, belt, and compass. The Day and time count are small enough to be out of the way, and still legible. Nothing sticks out in a manner that would block peripherals, so you get full view of whats in front and next to you.MechanicsThe mechanics to the game in general are fantastic. The crafting is what keeps me coming back time and time again. There are literally hundreds of recipes to choose from, and if that's not enough, you can make your own recipes out of items you couldn't normally craft! The community is good at coming up with unique ways to make the not so useful items useful again, and adding the recipes are as easy and copy and paste.There are some glitches and errors that can be frustrating when crafting. At times, the forge will ""eat"" your materials, so that 534lb of Iron? yeah, it's gone. The same thing happens with the campfire. There have also been times the zombies warp through the walls, and hordes end up inside our fortified prefab house. this doesn't seem to happen with player built bases.Structural integrity is the game changer. There will be no more building massive structures in 15 minutes. You actually have to think about placement. One wrong move, and half, or even all of your building will collapse. It creates ways to make traps, and take down players bases. It's really cool to watch the bricks rain down! It would be nice to see them fall over in a more realistic motion, but that will come in due time.Zombies are pretty terrifying when setup to spawn in large groups. I play the role of a bandit, so my first habit is to try and set up in the wasteland. What might be done quickly in the plains or forest is damn near impossible to do in the wasteland biome. I remember the days of sitting inside the corner of a small 6x8 shack, listening to the hordes whisper and screech in the night as they run by chasing the animals. The fear was real at that point. SoundThe sounds at first can be frightening, which is a good thing. You get that pump of adernaline when hearing the scream of a Spider zombie or a Zombie Cop bubbling up puke. But after a while the sounds become recycled. You might even notice some sounds from other games used. However, Snow zombies will never get old. That sound will haunt you in your sleep.Overall, I rate this game, in its current state, a good 7.5/10. The bugs need to be fixed, cause some of them can cause frustrated players to just quit, and it diminishes the replay value. Pathing is still another thing to consider, but it just tests your FPS skills for the time being :) With my overall hours, I highly recommend this game. With future workshop support, Mods, and a great community follow up, this is one game that is sure to remembered by all Z fans for a long time.TL;DRPros+Good pace of zombie action+dozens of different block styles to design your base with+Lots of loot to find+100's of recipes to craft+Creepy atmosphere (Crying wasteland babies)+Future Workshop and Mod support+Devs are friendly, engaging, and listen to the communityCons-Hackers on mainstream open servers-Random little glitches -Zombies run through prefabs from time to time-unoptimized for low end PC's-Pathfinding on Zombies and Zombie Dogs is poor-Physics are poorOverall: 7.5/10			"

								Was a nice game, had loads of fun due to the server I'm on, but it's become less playable by every patch due to no bugfixes. The game has been out for over one and a half year! The developers haven't listened to the community nor followed the path of the game, such as MP. Many servers have had 30 players or more(both PVP&PVE), but just had to shutdown due to broken netcode. Excuse: Game was designed for 8 players max.Now with A12 it's just garbage they're trying to sell, if you don't belive me, check forums and even buy the game. You'll be asking for refund.			"

DayZ has been out shorter then this and it's already better then most zombie survival games. The physics were♥♥♥♥♥♥ The zombies sounded like a baby mourning. And don't even get me started on the sound effects for eating food. When I got this game I was so excited when I got this game. But my excitemet later turned to dissapointment. I'd have more fun rolling around in a dumpster than playing this game. Overall this game was a huge dissapointment and if you buy this game I am truly sorry that you wasted your money on this insult of a zombie survival game.1.5/10 Would not play agian, P.S stop making people pay $25 for a crappy game.

And the fun part on the side, killing zombies, looting, exploring ( if you like to explore this game have the biggest random generated map, where ever you go will never be the same, and you will find new cool things)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hope they will keep up the good work and make this game even more awesome!I really like the concept of this game, that you are able to craft, build, shoot zombies and other players. Well done!This game is awesome and get many stars in the book from me, i would highly recommend it!			"

								My first impression after an hour of gameplay is extreamly positive. I would say if you like minecraft and dayz you will probably like this... its fun.  I do think the price tag is a bit high. but if you see it on sale for 20 bucks definatly worth it.I start out dropped in a desert like scene with broken down cars and garbage all over the roadway. I can hear the sounds of nearby zombies snarling and begin looking around to see if im being approached. I dont see any zombies so i approach the trash and am able to scavenge a can of food and some scrap metal. Next I approach a broken down vehicle where I am able to salvage more scrap metal. I break some small tree like bushes and get some sticks from them. By this time the zombies have taken notice of me so i take off running down into a canyon. I punch the sandstone and carve a small cave into the canyon side and use the sand to make some glass panes. I hear the zombies approching and get the glass up just in time to seal myself into the cave. i see the zombies outside pressed up against the glass wishing they could eat my brains. Inside the safety of my cavern i craft the scrap metal and sticks i gathered into a hunting knife. I then break the glass out and kill the zombie. By this time it is getting dark and out of almost nowhere i am swarmed by many zombies and killed.Highly enjoyable Sandbox.,,,			"

The graphics are terrible and if you are on linux you can not see the outdoor floor (pretty big part of the game). It does not matter how good your PC is the game will crash, and it will black screen it. I would like to say they do care about thier customers, but i would be liying if i said that, I beleve they are only in it for the money, hence the extorcionet price for what it is.  Do NOT waste your money on this like i did, you will regret it.It is also 3 years over it's release date and is still only in alpha.They are also slowing development on this, so they can put it on consoles, more money for them!

								This is a creative survival game with such a strong emphasis on survival that it leaves no time to create. Play in creative mode and it's clear the survival detraction from creation is intended to mask the numerous lengthy time sinks. It is not possible to balance time sink, survival, and creation with game settings. As such, this game fails to capitalize fully on any of its many features. In single-player. Multiplayer makes it playable, but security issues and concerns about spyware built in make multiplayer an exercise in banning hackers and surrendering personal data to god knows who)			"

								So as i update this review as it was orginally stated as a good game let me update it as the game updated :)This game's world is bigger than when i used to play it. It seems not only big but has more stuff in the world. More houses in different areas, some areas are the same but over all it's quite amazing. I love how the developers still update the game. So as an avid survival player... i have to say this game definitely has a lot to offer. Although it's clunky and a bit slow the game has a lot of promise. As i said before you need to get past the graphics and push through the flaws of the game to truly appreciate the game itself. The game has multiple to nearly endless crafting options along with building options. The game has a server base where you can sort of have a private server to play with your friends or you can join an open server with other players. Along with the update- able to add friends, track them on the map, having so many more health conditions... this game truly gives a survival aspect and the developers are definitely supporting the game as much as possible. You can build gorgeous houses and in zombie attacks have them destroyed... be raided by other players.. dig underground for resources, chop down trees, or even reinforce broken town houses. The game has a lot of promise. I do recommend this game... with it's flaws the game itself is quite fun, especially with friends.			"

								Just because you are unique, does not mean you are useful.7 Days to Die has a problem. It has many problems. Is the Zombie AI awful.....yeah...Are the weapons incredibly stock and unappealing.....Yeah...Is there no risk involved when you can just run back to your house and get your shotgun back after dying.....Yeah...But most of all, 7 Days to Die has one serious problem. It mixes and matches far too many concepts into spots where they do not belong. Base building is slow and unrewarding, when even stone walls can be broken down by the horde, and when breaking the game mechanics is the only way to provide safe shelter. Mining is slow and unrewarding, digging for hours to only come up with coal and nitrite, only to say ♥♥♥♥ it, and use dynamite to blow open caves simply because you can. Combat is slow and unrewarding, when even a huge horde can bring you nothing but some bullets and pieces of paper. Crafting is slow an unrewarding, and in essence, bland, using the usual PICKAXE, AXE, EXPLOSIVE, FENCING objects to build, bringing nothing new or surprising to the table. This game may be an alpha, it may have some quirks, and it may not be perfect yet.But if steam had a return button, I'd be smashing the refund key until Gabe kicked down my door, gripped my wrist ferociously, and lovingly whispered into my ear, ""Cut that♥♥♥♥♥♥out""It's an alpha, and it isn't a fun one, not worth 30 dollars, and certainly not worth a moment of your time.

								Worth to buy and play it now allready; for sure a big YES !!! Of course there need a lot to be done.. and they are working on it.For now: this is a realy great game with a lot more potential for the future! This game is having all a RPG needs: Action, strategie, loots, mining, crafting, building, farming, etc... Start to get building on my self.. building a fortress around a farm-house near water & corn field.  And making a tunnel from the sellar of the house to the grainsilo on the other side of the street. So i can escape or going inside from there to. And set up a lot of wooden spikes to kill the zombies!Everyone can do it the way you like the most.. of course you can build a total new house or fortress everywhere you want on the good balanced map already. The crafting & building system is the most extensive and easy to handle ever seen in games like this!!! Extra hugh thumbs up for this!!! Remember..there are lots of 'zombies' and also wild dogs, giant bees and others to come.. that will try to destroy what you are building... In all the time i played till now (+-50 hrs), i only have 2 little bugs, and no crashes, so that's not so bad for an alpha game i suppose. There is a diversification in the actions from the zombies between day and night.. so better looting, crafting and building in day-time, defending at night is usefull to do. Conclusion: Like i say at the beginning, there is still a lot to do.. but for sure it's already worth to buy and play! For now a lot of hours nice playing-time and we hope it will be more and more in the future.. All by all; Thanks to the makers/developers : nice & good work allready, hope a lot more to come.. To every one; Have lots of fun by playing this exellent RPG xD			"

								Before the A13 update: I loved playing this game, it seemed decently balanced, the wait times to craft or break things didn't seem too slow or too fast.A13 Update: 1st Spawn: I was right next to an irradiated zone so I died seconds after walking into it. 2nd Spawn: Was in a snow biome, I was fully clothed and standing pretty much on top of the fire and I still froze to death. 3rd Spawn: Was in a desert next to wastelands and irradiated zone, almost died of heat stroke a few times, started getting the hang of the new UI (it's terrible) when I came across a resort, I killed the zombles and proceeded to loot the place... it took FOREVER to break into, each door, each baricade takes what seems like years to break, I broke into ONE... yes just ONE room after at least 2 real life minutes of just sitting in one spot staring at the door, I got so bored that I quit right then and there and will not play this game again, at least until a lot of balancing is done.The devs took a fun and what seemed to be (at least ot me) a fairly balanced game and turned it into a grind fest, with lots of just sitting around breaking objects for what seems like an eternity. I used to be addicted to this game but now I can't stand playing it.			"

								The Game:Survival, horror, zombie and crafting game. Think minecraft but better looking, more intricate crafting and faaaaaar scarier.My Thoughts:When I first had a crack at this game it was brilliant, building my first castle and sniping zombies from the top was rewarding as was the scavenging all the materials required for it and fighting zombies with a stone axe. The game was tough but not overly so. You could got to the easiest setting and learn how it all goes then try harder setting knowing how to build the essentials.Then there was a patch that smashed my hard work. So decided to start again, another patch, hard work smashed. I decided to take a break to preserve my sanity (admittedly a small amount).Well I came back for another bash after a while and things changed for the worse I think.For example, while playing this game now my innner geek would ask (or scream and gibber) the following:Why am I dying when cold? After constructing a shelter, clothes and stood next to a fire.Why am I dying when hot? After removing all my clothes, standing in shade, stood still and drinking water till I'm full.Why am I dying at all in easy mode with no zombies???? Anyway, to the review.Pros:Crafting is quite easy, and gettting materials is fun as everything is destructable. Try going into creative mode and laying tnt around the base of a building then detonating it all with a missile.The graphics are quite nice and the atmospherics are excellent. When the zombies come for you it sends the hairs on the back of your neck right up.The base building aspect is really satisfying, if you manage to live past the first few days.I like the physics too, if you do bother to blast the hell out of that building I mentioned you will see it all fall in sequence, very well done to the devs for that.Cons:Feels too hard mode even in the easiest settings. I know this is a survival game but if you set a game to the easiest mode and STILL die if you are spawned in an extreem biome (snow, desert or the blasted lands) then where's the fun? In previous iterations of this game you could build something glorious, turn on the zombies and see what happens. Now I can barely even survive to build a wooden shack unless I'm in creative. On a side note, there is nothing more demoralising as being told by the game to build a shelter, fire and clothes to stop hypothermia only to die, (very slowly) in your shelter in a lovely plant fibre outfit and cloth armour next to a fire, from hypothermia:(I might try this game again in the future, to see if the devs put something in to turn off the dying every 2 seconds because of being too cold or hot. I would have given a thumbs up before finding out some patches don't allow you to carry on with old saves. However, right now I can't it give a thumbs up. "

								This game may only be an alpha but it is already put together very well, yes there are bugs, if you want a flawless game do not purchase this. That being said it is extremely fun, the only downside being that nights can sometimes be very boring after you have solid defenses as you simply have to sit and wait for dawn. The sandbox nature of the game makes it great for people who like minecraft however unlike in minecraft enemies in this game are formidable and will destroy the things you have build if they stand in their way. Combat is basic but not bad, crafting is done very well, and the suspense when a you hear a zombie hoard running in the night is gut wrenching. Highly recommend this game and hope to see it grow and expand even more.			"

								The idea of combining Left4Dead and Minecraft culminates in this open world survival and building game. In comparison to other games of its kind I've found that freedom in building block by block and underground, as opposed to schematics and in existing structures, led to a much more immerse environment and experience.Watching this game evolve through its Early Access stages has been a treat, the development team stays connected to the community and continues to work diligently to make the game that the players want and a game that they also want to play.After almost two hundred hours spent both running a server and playing on others I find myself waiting anxiously for the next patch and a chance to conquer the horde with my friends yet again!

								Feels like the most complete early access game on the market. Has some of the most brutal and gritty atmosphere in any game i have ever played. Crafting is sumblime and has the right amount of difficulty without it becoming repetitative. The zombies are awesome and make the dayz zombies look like a joke. In dayz 15 zombies just teleport through the front door of the building your in and insta kill you. In 7DTD the zombies tear down your house from the foundation!! Huge hordes of zombies destroying your hard build castle peice by peice as you try to defend it with your life. Great building mechanics as well. You can build a huge varioty of houses, a huge skycastle to a normal suborb house. PVP is also brutal and fun at the same time, has an awesome community with many militias to join. Survival is a key part of this game and it is pulled of with flying colors. The newly added level up system is a welcome addition to this epic game!Makes the building in RUST look like some homeless shack city.Makes the Zombies in DAYZ look pitfull in every way (Not as good graphics for zombies in 7DTD but who cares if the DAYZ zombies are this terrible still in 2015 Only thing i would suggest adding is vehicles, to help move around this massive mapUpdate: They actualy added mini bikes soon after i made this review. The better the parts you put into it, the faster and more reilable the mini bike is. It really helps that bad feeling of grinding becuase traveling long distances are no longer a chore. 10/10 100 hours+ and dont plan on stopping soon			"

								So, I was stalking a friend who was doing a little mining. Just minding my own business having a look around the pretty steep and magnificent hole he had dug out. I turn around to go have a look inside and out of no where, six or seven dogs. I run. He's safe in his little mining pit. I'm screaming. Only have a stone axe for melee, as I primarily use a crossbow. Crossbow on six or seven sprinting puppies is not a good idea. I am running in circles, no stamina, bleeding and end up getting rescued by moleman and my bro. Now when I play I am in a perpetual state of dog-pack paranoia.  9/10.  Still like dogs.			"

								You can't play this game if you use 32bit windows os. Thankfully this game kicks me out from the game within a hour. Maybe it means dev team want me to play under 1 hour. And you know what? If you see my gameplay time, you can find out I tried more than 11 times. Dang it, what a deep anger ...But if that problem can be fixed, it must be great game.It was pretty fun EVEN I PLAYED DEMO GAME FOR 11 TIMES!Anyway. if you don't want to play under 1 hour by force, without saving, I recommend you to buy it later.This review will be erased if the problem solved. Oh, is this can be erased?Nevermind. Just play it later.			"

								I went up to a glass shower door and broke it with a stone axe because it's fun breaking glass, then I noticed it dropped glass shards. I examined the item and right clicked. And turns out you can eat it. So I ate it by accident and died seconds later from internal bleeding.Today's life lesson of the day: don't eat glass- you'll die.In all seriousness this game is quite fun, especially for being in Alpha. The character creator, the world generator, weapons, crafting, cooking, survival, all that.Especially the character creator - I created numerous alien freakazoid goblin zombie things on it already, including one that looks like Michael Jackson.The survival is also somewhat of a realistic simulation. For instance, it gets you searching for a place to stay during the night and that's quite a challenge itself because the biomes in the game all have different zombie spawn rates (as far as I know at least) and once you settle down you must search the local area for supplies like books to learn recipes, food, water, clothes and other supplies.So, do I like the game? yes.Should you get it? Maaaayyybe, it's great fun with friends, but can be a bit dull if you are playing by yourself, although when you are playing by yourself things such as mentioned at the very start of a review may happen.

								Survival Horror SandboxingStarting the game I found myself in a scene very reminiscent of Silent Hill. A wrecked car sat in the road beside me surrounded by my worldly belongings and the desert wasteland was entirely unfamiliar to me. Gathering up my few worldly possessions I boldly set forth into the unknown and was immediately set upon and ripped apart by a pack of wild dogs.So exactly like Silent Hill then.My next few attempts fared little better. I tried to break into a house and was snuck up on and stunlocked to death by zombies, I approached a car junkyard and mysteriously died with no apparent cause like in the opening of 13 ghosts, and I had another go at meleeing zombies getting myself stunlocked to death.Part of the problem is that zombie moans barely change in loudness depending on distance or facing, so a zombie could be trying to extract itself from someone's scummy backyard swimming pool 3 blocks away and you will still hear it hissing in your ear, which makes it hard to tell when zombies are actually close since you just stop listening eventually.So I quit for a couple of months and came back in another patch when the sound bug had supposedly been fixed. It's still there but not as bad as before, you can't hear them as far and the sound does somewhat scale by distance, just not very well, and I can at least tell the difference between a zombie 20 metres away and one 5 metres awayNonetheless it seemed like a rather dull survival crafting game. Zombies are easily outrun and can be dispatched with little trouble with an easily crafted bow which fires needlessly slowly and draws out the boredom.Maybe I'll go play something else. Oh look it's dark now. Oh I can see another player run... oh no that's a zombie! I'll just nerd tower onto this sawmill roof and wait for morning. Oh god they're ripping down the walls! The roof is falling down!How I survived that first night I'll never know but with that the true survival horror nature of the game became clear to me. As I told my friend of my experience he replied ""Just wait til night 7 lol"". ""Wait, what's this about night 7?"", I replied. ""You do know why it's called 7 days to die right?""Apparently on the 7th night a massive zombie horde attacks your location. They know where you are and will claw through wood, dirt and even concrete to reach you. If you stand on the roof or take out the stairs they will rip through the walls til the house collapses and brings you to their level. What's more special zombies start to appear including acid spitters, spider zombies, hornets, dogs and things that look like they belong in attack on titan! What's more, the hordes get progressively bigger every 7 days with new specials and more waves.So my next 3 days (as I had reached day 4) were spent in a manic rush to gather supplies and fortify my position. I dug a trench around the house I had taken. I filled it with spikes. I built an extra layer of wall around the first floor with an overhang to keep out spiders. I blocked up the windows and reinforced the doors. I searched for meds, guns, crafting books and crap metals for the defenses. And finally the fated night came around...As the sun set the night was erril quiet. 10pm came, 11pm came, eventually midnight came without any activity. Perhaps my friend was wrong I thought, disappointed and relieved at the same time. Anyway by 6:30am when zombies stop running I was barricaded in my bedroom with 5 zombies clawing at the walls, one of which was crawling in through a gap, with 2 bullets left, 5 arrows and a slither of health!Somehow I managed to survive that and get patched up but it was clear my defenses weren't good enough. And so the cycle continued. 7 days to gather resources and prepare my defenses, 1 night of sheer hell which progressively gets worse each time. I kept thinking I would reach a point where all challenge would end. At one time I had a 4 block deep trench, a 3 block high wall made of metal trussing the second strongest material and one that can be fired through, very high hp, a shotgun, a handgun, hundreds of bullets and a ton of supplies. That was night 42 and saw a ton of acid spitters, I nearly died 3 times that night! I didn't realize they could spit at me through trussing, then they dug under the walls and attacked me from behind, then I retreated into my house and thye somehow made the roof collapse on me by climbing on it!I do think I'm finally at a point where I'm untouchable though, night 70 and 77 saw me emerge without a scratch and my defenses barely scatched but I've now reinforced the sides of the pit with 2 layer thick trussing, and placed another double wall with spikes running under it (so if they break through a bit they continue taking damage and their bodies likely block the hole) before the trench. And I now have a sniper rifle as well. However I was playing on moderate settings and I'm told the last patch dropped the number of zombies to the point where veterans consider the game trivial and even released a patch to restore the zombie numbers!So I think I will wait a few months til more content is added, then try again with max difficulty settings and the community challenge patch for the challenge of my life!In the end I think what distinguishes 7 days from other survival crafters is that it's a true sandbox survival horror. You simply can't waste time on extravagant building projects like in Minecraft, due to building integrity and the very dangerous night hordes you are forced to build for defenses and cannot cheese the game with floating houses. Every minute is precious as you rush for resources or to finish that row of spikes before fun night, and until you become an experienced player you will never feel safe, and even then there are plenty of options for returning the game to the hopeless survival hell we love so much :DSo final verdict is 8/10. The sound bug needs fixing, there needs to be more variety in enemies and the map edge death zone (the junkyard that killed me) needs to be more clearly marked. Can't comment on the multiplayer Reign of Kings put me off that. All in all I'm glad I stuck with it!			"

								Ok i have mixed feelings when it comes to this game.The game it's self is a zombie survival crafting type thing, a bit like minecraft minus the cartoon stuff. When i first got this game it blew away the competition, but really nothing really of value has been added in since then, and i am talking in terms of years/. The crafting got dumbed down and they added in skills that is about it. Oh and minibikes which on any none super server will bug out, lag and more often than not drop your fps to levels you did not think possible, which when looking at games like Hurtworld where they have cars and quadbikes and they run fine makes me wonder why.So when stacked up against other games which are similar in nature like ark which reguarly has massive updates and such, there really isn't a favorable way to compare them.BUT, and big BUT, a sir mixalot type the building is fun, the same way building in minecraft is, you can dig, mine and build structures on the level of sillyness, which is something many other survival games lack, like ark and hurtworld use a type of building system where you have foundations and ceilings and you build bases that all really don't look that different, 7days operates on a block on block system which lets you be far more creative.Now this game is on steam sale atm for 8 quid, and the game is worth that, because sure it isn't the best survival game out there, it is an easy way to throw plenty of hours at something that isn't stressful.Few facts/tips;1). Most the servers are dead atm, however with the steam sale i hope that changes.2). Do you use duel+ GPU's? Well forget about SLI the game runs like a horse with one leg it is waaaay off SLI.3). This game is ment to be played with friends, if you play alone your in for a bad time.4). Avoid pve servers, they already take away from a slightly limited game you will get bored quickly.5). The game rotates on a weekly basis, and at the end of each in game week, a zombie horde will spawn (22:00) and go after a player at random. If you want to avoid this log off before night time.6). The Search function for server sucks, like a lot, be paitent and refresh on a regular basis when looking for a server to play on.7). Build spikes, lots of them, on most servers Zombies run at night and if it is any map other than the standard Navas map, they will lag about like crazy and kill you. Spikes defend your base for you, so you can sit back and ignore them.10). Don't think building below ground will hide your base, opening doors, chests forges etc can be heard from above ground from really far away invest in good blocks.But buy the game, im bored of only like 3 servers having more than ten people on it. I doubt you would have read this far so il say what i want. Buy the game and come suffer with me.			"

								Can be really fun with friends. Why? They can help you break the damn doors around every building you see. I DONT reccomend this game mainly because that every door in the game, (besides the one you built) is literally made out of a material that is resistant to a nuclear blast. +150 hits to break a door down, which means staring at the block your are hitting, for more than 2 minutes. In addition to that, after you break off the first layer, you HAVE to break the second layer in order get any decent loot. Therefore you have to grind for a long time to get any notable loot. Other than the autrocious doors, I think that everything is pretty balanced. Zombies need some tweaking in their hit boxes because if im shooting arrows, aiming right at a zombie's head, it will go right through him.			"

								Alpha 11 to Alpha 14.5+ has felt completely unplayable / un-enjoyable to a lot of us simply because the devs have completely ignored the stutter issues that came with the new Unity engine (completely unrelated to hardware or FPS). Over a year's worth of time in trying to get their attention about it, and yet they still completely ignore the issue and refuse to even comment on the issue, I've decided to give the game a negative review. There's 11 pages in a single thread, not to mention countless other threads which also have several pages worth, all relating to the same stutter issues. This game might be a pig on resources, but that's not at all what this review / issue is about.I've waited long enough!More information on the issues here:  https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?25024-Movement-stutter-frame-lag-while-at-60-fps "

								Picture Minecraft inside an episode of Walking Dead. There is no shortage of zombie games out there, but this indie stands out. At the beginning of the game you basically get dumped into the zombie apocaylpse with next to no supplies. You have to start gathering and building things immediately or you WILL get eaten! Later in the game it has a Last Man on Earth/Omega Man/I Am Legend feel to it as you explore destroyed, zombie infested cities. Build your base well. If the zeds work out where you are (count on it) they will hammer their way through doors, windows, and/or walls.Fair warning; as of right now the game is still in alpha. Every so often the devs bring out updates which require you to wipe your game save and start over. It can be a heartbreaker. Especially since you just found that thing you've been spending the last week looking for! In trade though, the updates are significant and well-worth the trouble of a restart. Last update gave us beer!			"

								hey guys this is my very 1st review on steam for a gamei played over 400 hours of this game and i seen it go from simple minecraft game, to a beautiful looking world.but here my pro and cons to the game pro+weapon and item crafting is very easy to usegets updated a lot e.g monthy for the big updates 6 different types of zombies and they acting different like e.g there is a frost zombie which is harder to killpvp or pve, which is nice change if you want to do coop or pvp, plus pvp can be brutal at times and makes some great fights big sandbox world, where there is lots of player content and everything can be destroyedthe friend lists in game is very easy to use, to find your friends to team up night and day brings different experience's for e.g day time u can walk past zombies and in the night you better runhunting can be fun and there is a reason to kill for e.g to make armor and food cons-lag on servers can be very bad at timespeople do exploit the game at timesbugs like e.g losing items that you have in your backpack and zombies do glitch from time to time and falling though the map and map not loading upyou can not make your own servers unless you have a dedicated server sometimes it can be very hard to connect to a game airdrops dropping in rad zone so that my review and if you have any qustions about the game please let me know and i be happy to tell you all about itand if you got the game and want somewhere friendly to go i own a server for new and old players a like the ip address 37.220.23.186:25090 so i see you guys in the wastelands :)			"

								One of the best ""Zombie Survival"" games out there, if not the best. However, the main downside is that there is a HUGE learning curve when it comes to crafting, and what you should do to survive. Often times this is more irritating than rewarding as a new player your inventory will be filled with ""stuff"" you don't know what to do with, and then you will end up dying and losing everything without actually learning anything. So basically... if you are not willing to watch 2hours+ worth of youtube tutorials on how to progress in 7dtd, than I'd suggest passing this one up. It IS fun for a while with friends, but I feel like the crafting system and lack of hints / information is what is truly holding this game back.			"

This game is an open world with no limits in any direction(east west north south) and everything you see in the world is destructable or constructable. Lets build something together. A house? A castle? A fort? Shoot you can build an entire village or city. Or if you want to be unseen. Build a underground fallout shelter so deep underground that not even the zombies can smell your cooking.

								This game has been on steam/early access for barely over one month and the current newest patch (Alpha build 6) contains more content/fixes/changes than some games that have been on early access for a year+!!!! these guys are serious and are building an amazing game. It does have a rough appearance but there are upgrades to graphics in the works. The core game is just great and these guys claim to be gamers and it shows in their work. so many great ideas and they keep adding to it!  It currently has soooooooo much crafting and content that it beats out pretty much all other games in this genre. the only problem is that it isnt getting the attention it deserves. I urge everyone to checkout this game and make your own decision but in my eyes its a diamond that is being polished continually.key things i want to point out...-FF can be set on or off by server admins. This is great for PVP and Co-oP play!!!-Enemies can be set on or off, again this helps with constructing.-You can host yourself or buy dedicated host.-When you die you only lose items in your quickslot/Belt aka equiped items.-I hosted my own game and was able to change settings next time i loaded up that saved world. So i was able to set FF to off and not worry about players killing me so i could build, then next time i was able to turn it on again. imagine setting server to build mode and then reset and allow people to then attack each others fortified bases. the same goes for enemies, can be turned on or off whenever.-Multiple environments on same map. desert, snow, forest, city all in the same map!-----DIGGING, YES you can dig and build just like in minecraft. construct and deconstruct...Buildings collapse under stress. I was able to digg under a building in key points and cause it to collapse on one side only. made quite a mess too lol- they are planning to upgrade the graphics and overall appearnce so it isnt so blocky. vehicles will be added later around this same time. cant drive a car up a hill made of squares and steps lol. so they plan to make it more smooth/natural while keeping the digging and building system!!

								2000 hours on a record in last 2 years - is this game worth of the money? YES!  I agree with some of my friends that graphic in this game is a bit old style and could be much better, but this is a sandbox game and it is the best sandbox at this time - here are so many ways how to play it, building etc. The game has competitors like Ark and Rust, but they are slightly different in all ways of the gameplay. The game is many years in the Alpha stage - shame, I will agree on this point too , but this is one of those games where Devs still hard working and every couple months comes out new patches, fixes and massive changes - what makes the game  a bit different from every new patch. Plenty of server and players, starting with PVE and ending on PVP.There is a bunch of mods on different servers, different blocks to build with (depends on server), where you can build block by block your dream mansion in massive in sizes world map. You still have doubts about the game? Come and I will show you!:)			"

								7 Days to Die is one of those games that you want to share with friends who have never played before, and let them experience its' awesomeness with you. It's a voxel based survival crafting tower defense game that touches on gameplay similar to Minecraft and Fallout 3. At first I was quite apprehensive about this game, mostly because of it's poor reviews and, at that time, the price. I nabbed it when it was on sale, then learned that the developers had lowered the price indefinitely. As I played, exploring immense landscapes, learning crafting recipies, and adapting nighttime survival strategies, I began to wonder why this game had gotten such poor reviews. I know now that I should have bought this game long ago, even at its high price. I have enjoyed watching 7 Days to Die's progress more than any other early access game I have played up to this point. I've found myself on more than one occasion reading players' conflicting suggestions and complaints, then come next update realize that the developers had actually listened to that constructive criticism and developed a method to try to satisfy everybody. You can adjust different settings to cater to your specific preferences and difficulty, even after you have started your game. If it gets too easy, just bump up the zombie spawn rate, or vice versa. I wouldn't recommend this one to gamers who have no patience for early access bugs. Don't expect glitch free bliss with this one. But the pros highly outweigh the cons. Judging by what I've seen the game progress to, I have a good feeling that for us patient gamers who appreciate meaningful development...the end product will be well worth it!			"

Early Access Review
								I had been following this game for a little while before it came to steam. I was excited to get my hands on it even if it was only in its alpha stage. When this game first came out it is was a huge disappointment. I was crushed. I couldn't tell you how much I didn't like everything about it. I played about 2 hours trying to understand what was going on and I kept telling myself I was missing something; some huge part of the game that would make it what I thought it was supposed to be. I wasn’t missing anything... The game was so early alpha that it was just a concept held up with a bit of scotch tape and some toothpicks. I deleted the game feeling scammed; like I had just wasted my money. Fast forward a month or so later. A friend of mine had been playing religiously every night. I couldn’t understand what he saw in the game. I was bored enough one night to say what the heck and re download it and jump in for some j-j-j-jolly cooperation. I was blown away! Was this even the same game? Everything had been completely re done. The graphics had been significantly increased. HDR, bloom, lighting. The zombies had rag doll physics (Big plus in my books.). The menu, crafting, UI, features, items, weapons. Everything had been made 100x better and re imagined with more content. The way the game played was amazing compared to the day 1 alpha release which was like scraping your eyes on a chalk board and getting the sound from nails. Everything about the game was, surprisingly better. Like a million times better. Like, how could this happen?! I want to believe in magic but at the same time I also want to believe in god. I went from feeling like a kid at Christmas who was good all year but still got coal to feeling like a man who broke open that coal to find a diamond.This game really was bad when it came out. But since it has gotten the updates that have been promised I can't stop playing. It is extremely fun. It is a mix of FPS, survival horror, crafting, mining and so much more. And! Everything is destructible. If you have looked past this game then give it another glance. I know I am glad I did. It is easily one of my all time favorite games for too many reasons to list. It is the best zombie game on steam. A must own for everyone. This game has come a long way and I am excited to see where it goes.			"

								Been playing for a while now. Yes Alpha. But I like the way it is playing right now and where it is heading. I have been building a huge underground home and mining away more and more everyday with explosives. When you start out it will be difficult, but it gets easier as you go along, but you have to keep searching or you will starve, die of thirst, killed by zombies, fall into your own hole you dug and died. I have played rust and got tired of dealing with jerk players who would kill you just for your stuff.			"

Early Access Review
								This is my updated 2nd review. 9/16/14. My first review was premature and I probably made the game sound much better than it is. If my first review made the game sound like a 9/10, my more realistic 140+ hours of gameplay review would have to put it at more like a 6.5 or 7 out of 10.Overall, I would give this game a thumbs up. The game is fun to play, even with all it's problems. If you really enjoy sandbox type games, then 7DTD will appeal to you, despite all it's flaws. It's like Minecraft on steroids with zombies, ruined cities, sniper rifles, rocket launchers and eventually, will have driveable cars. I'll list a few of what I consider to be the most important points. Keep in mind that at the time of this review we are still in alpha. If you are considering buying the game in alpha, you should expect there to be bugs, a lack of content and other problems. If you get mad at bugs and other problems, don't buy the game in alpha. With that in mind, here is a rough picture of the game in it's current state:Pro: Being tossed into a HUGE game map with zombies and discovering ruined cities and surviving and building your first base = fun, though a bit grindy.Con: The map is huge but repetitive. Running for hours and seeing more of the same randomly generated map biomes gets boring pretty fast. On one hand, the technical achievment of a randomly generated maps is impressive. But then you realize it just gives you a huge bland boring map. There is something very important added to gameplay when you design an intelligent, creative, realistic, immersive, interesting, fun map. Just having an algorithim spitting out huge empty boring maps is NOT an improvement to gaming.You could also view this trend of procedurally generated maps as developer laziness. Gone are the days now when maps where intricately designed to lead the player on a grand adventure of discovery. The trend with the current batch of games is have an algorithim do all the map making. Will we one day have entire games that are procedurally generated and devs don't even need to do anything more than change a few textures and repackage the game with a different title? This will not be an improvement people, trust me.Pro: In MP, it's kind of nice that you can go miles away from all the other players, and build your base, and maybe even find your own city that nobody else knows about (at least for a bit!). So the huge infinite map gives you some privacy, and maybe the ability to have your own private city, at least temporarily.Con: MP servers are having major issues with lag, freeze ups, crashes and rollbacks. One server I was on the server owner couldn't even get it to start up anymore, so he had to delete and start over, thus deleting everyone’s bases and loot. There is speculation that these problems are directly related to the infinite maps as it seems the further out people explore on the maps, the more the server lag increases. It hasn't been definitively confirmed yet, but there is suggestive evidence that it is related to the map size / generation. Now considering we don't need infinite maps, I'd much rather have a stable large map then an infinitely unstable map. I've played many MMOs with huge stable game worlds (and thousands of players), and map space was never an issue. Since this game is not an MMO, and is designed for small sized server populations, we really don't need infinite maps....Please devs, just give us a stable comfortably large map.Pro: Compared to Minecraft, the graphics are amazing!Con: Compared to all games made after 2007, the graphics are not very impressive! With that said, I always give much more weight to gameplay and fun, and graphics are just a bonus. I'd rather play a game with great gameplay and low end graphics any day than a game with top tier graphics and crap game play. With that in mind, the graphics for 7DTD are adequate.Pro: Building bases can be fun!Con: At the moment, the building customization is probably lacking compared to say Minecraft. But that will surely change as game gets updated. Another con for me anyways is the complicated integrity, max load system. If you don't like to do a bunch of math (which I don't, when playing games), it is very likely your uber base that you just spent 20 hours building will ...collapse.Ok, now the absolute biggest con for this game atm, is.....multiplayer. Yes, unfortunately the pain will increase dramatically as you begin playing multiplayer, and you will start to realize just how f**** up this game really is! Multiplayer servers are plagued by hackers in god mode, flying around, spawning them selves all the weapons and TNT they want, filling up peoples bases with bedrock (which can't be removed), shooting through the environment (exploit, not really a hack), causing the server to crash, destroying peoples bases that they spent 200 hours building, etc...the list goes on. I actually have NOT been the target of a hacker ...yet...but every server I have been on has had multiple instances of hackers and other players losing everything because of it.On top of the hacker problem, there are other major problems causing servers to lag and freeze up and crash, and many times this results in a rollback --- causing you lose several hours of progress. For example on my current MP server, I got dropped at one point, and for one hour I tried to log back on, and I couldn't, even though the server was still up. At some point they reset the server, and the next morning when I logged on, everything I had collected the previous night (over a period of a few hours) was gone. One of my game neighbors lost his entire base! I had just happened to get lucky on the previous game session and scored a major haul when I found an unprotected player base / farm, and had looted about 600+ food supplies! After starving for a week (realtime), I had finally hit the jack pot and found 600+ food! Then ….all gone. It makes one feel like it's very pointless to even build up an uber base or gather a bunch of loot, when you know you can log in the next day and it's all gone.Despite all these problems, you can easily play for a hundred hours and not have any of these disasters happen to you. The rollback I just talked about was really one of the few major annoyances I have experienced. Well except when my first MP server decided to quit, and I lost 3 (real life) days worth of gathering and building. But I do constantly hear other players on the servers I am on, complaining about their base disappearing, or large stock piles of loot just vanishing! So it is fairly common.In single player I haven't really had any major problems yet, other than just getting bored of the repetitive nature of the game map and the grind of gathering resources, and building up a first base. And then of course a new update comes out...and you lose your SP game save, and then you have to decide if the new features that were implemented are really worth starting all over again, just so you can see them. My biggest complaint of the SP experience is the game runs a bit laggy. I can run a game like Skyrim on ultra smooth as butter, and here is this game with vastly inferior graphics to Skyrim, yet it runs way crappier. It's not unplayable, but the graphics lag is quite noticable and irritating sometimes. This is certainly because the developers are inexperienced at making modern high end games, it really shows. But despite all the negatives, most of my 140+ hours of game play have been entertaining. But also repetitive and grindy! LoL. A tentative thumbs up. Worth playing if your bored. I can guarentee you will have many hours of fun. But far from being a great game in it's current state. You may just want to keep an eye on this game and wait for another year of development to pass.			"

Early Access Review
								Pre-A7.0 I would have recommended this game as a decent builder game (with the zombies off, or occasionally turned on) I spent about 30 hours on this game with the zombies turned off most of the time, building, crafting, and eventually testing out various base designs. But beyond that, I have never felt any real desire to survive beyond the hours spent building this or that. This is Minecraft+zombies. Not open sandbox survival-horror.I just spent about 3 hours trying out the new things added with the 7.0+ patch(es) and am finding myself getting frustrated with how the ground has been smoothed, making it difficult to tell exactly where you're striking with an axe or shovel (which makes mining out an underground base almost impossible now, at least with any sense of orginized structure to it). A couple of pluses are the 'veins' of ore now, instead of just a block here and there of this or that ore you can find streaks of ore through the dirt, gravel, and stone layers.The other additions, such as the wait to loot, noise penalties, stealth, and crafting systems are good window dressing for making the game more 'realistic'. But the big selling point for the game (for me at least) has now been ruined, or at the very least complicated for me, the building. As the game stands at this very minute, I can not recommend it at the rather high price of $25. My suggestion: If you're thinking about getting the game, wait until it is out of Alpha to spend your money.PS: I would also like to add that there are better 'sandbox survival-horror' games out there. State of Decay comes to mind immediately. If you want a 'sandbox builder' stick with Minecraft, it's less expensive and for now, better over all. If the developers don't flub things up too badly, in a years time 7 Days to Die could be one of the best sandbox survival-horror games out there. -IF- they don't flub it up...			"

								I am proud that i bought this game.Being honest certain past alphas, were amazingly bugged, glitched and had to much problems.But the Fun Pimps, still manage to overcome everything negative that the game offers, and still add more playability and entertainment.Alpha 15, for me at least, is one of the best Alphas up-to-date.I'll start to say it isn't perfect, there are still little details that need attention and work, but in due time i believe they will be fixed or improved.But the mechanics of the game are certainly more balanced than ever.It is an amazing game to play with friends, as well as challenging.Highly recommended.Edit. My perspective regarding the game hasn't changed one bit.I have been following the development towards Alpha 16, and I am astonished by their hard work and dedication. But perhaps it is their love for the game, for their own project that i admire the most. Alpha State games aren't easy, even more difficult is to find a game that receives so much love like this one, that is still being updated with new content, challenges and entertainment.You will definitely enjoy it a lot! Play alone, and set your own goals.- ""How long can YOU survive with one life?"" -Or, Play with friends, - Have fun exploring, killing and witnessing the zombies butchering them and you! XD			"

								This game is bad. REALLY bad. I know it's still in alpha but a game this bad should not be this much money. The game is optimized so badly that if you play for too long your pc will overheat and turn off. There are too many glitches to even play the game half the time, cursour disappearance, not rendering anything even after restarting the game, not being able to loot. And the mechanics are just bad. You can't look into the same chest with another person at the same time, it is insanely hard to find materials to craft things, and your character will be cold without clothes and overheating with them.

								Not recommended at this time. Lack of content being produced, little to no optimization has been done between alphas. Devs who say next alpha version will be ready when its ready. Modders who can add things to the game devs seem to not be able too. Overall a good game as seen by my 700 plus hrs in it but lots of potential is being lost on the devs who seem to be trying to bite off more than they can chew at this time. Will adjust if things change but at this time its only worth buying from the bargin bin for pennies.			"

								I have about ten hours right now on this game and I have to say I don't get the haters.  This game is far superior at its current stage of development than most others.  I love the fact that you can change the zombies to the classic George Romero slow walking zombies or even turn them off if you want.  The crafting system is pretty good and fairly easy.  I would only recommend a tutorial on using it.  The addition of more biomes is deffenately a plus now just adding in some weather for rain and snow and your all set.  I have read some bad reviews about this game and I can tell you from my experience with this game, those reviews just don't hold any truth.  They might have had some validity in the begining but those issues have apparently been delt with.  All in all I'm glad I bought this game and would recommend it to any one considering buying it.  If they keep working on it and, I'm sure they will, It will deffinately be worth the price.  As of the writing of this review the game currently has 3 different game modes, single player and multiplayer, adjustable modes for the zombies, many differnt blocks for building and sculpting the environment, a vast crafting system, four different playable characters, and just plain tons of fun.  If you ever wanted a game that combines Minecraft with State of Decay with Tower defense and a whole plethera of other games but done in a more grown up style, this is deffinatele the game for you.

								It's basically Minecraft with slightly better graphics. I personally enjoy scavenging cities, refining materials, building a base and fortifying it - But many aspects of the crafting, shooting, building, farming and scavenging are very flawed.The game could be better made in general - Even for an Alpha.The multiplayer system is very flawed and many people, including myself, are unable to play with friends - which unfortunately was the most appealing part of the game for me - Both playing co-up and being able to establish a complex community with my friends.  Furthermore the game is heavily overpriced and the creators aren't updating very often - Also it doesn't take a genius to see that this game was a part of the whole Zombie-RPG wave that occurred right after the release of the Dayz Alpha.In short, don't buy the game till it's either fully released or the price drops heavily.

								I'd give this game a 3/5. I played this game alot before it went on to steam.  It was Alpha 1 and they were going in such a unique direction where the zombies were a legitimate threat at night and nowhere was safe, so you had to board up your house and hope they dont knock your house down into rubble, however, the very next update removed all of that and went in a fairly standard, well worn, direction of making a completely safe house where the zombies sit idly outside.  It's like minecraft where they sort of sit outside, hopeing for you to open the door.  Once outside, the game turns into a call of duty nazi zombies gun fight minus the difficulty.  It's like playing round three throughout the entire game.  You could always jack up the difficulty, but i'd rather not have poor AI zombies take 2 shots to take me down.  I'd assume the online gameplay may be better and there are promises of a semi return to their original idea in Alpha 1. but even their promises only offer a semi-return to it ""if you make amature mistakes"" which doesnt provide quite the same thrill the original Alpha 1 release did for me.  I'd do my research on whether or not the multiplayer is worth it to you, because the core ideas as of alpha 6 are not worth the 35$ i paid.			"

								I've played this game for a few years, and they have just been adding ""new"" stuff every update, but they still didnt fix the most known issues. It's sad to see a game so supported lacking in the most important ways a game should be good at. I will write another review when they fix the constant lagging and the bugs this game has. Also, don't tell me this has been said a hundred times, because they still havent heard us, or fixed it since i bought this game a year ago.I would also just add that quantity is not better than quality.

Early Access Review
								7 Days to Die is a highly customizable zombie survival crafting game set in an apocolyptic world. It is still in alpha, so take this review with a grain of salt.1) Graphics - (8/10) Stunning. With the settings maxed out, this game is on par with many AAA games of today. The settings can be played with to suit your PC, and there is a fair chance your PC will run this game. It caters to both spectrums of graphical quality, largely settling in the medium-high range. (It runs at approx. 20-30 fps on a laptop with Intel HD 5500 graphics, or 60 fps maxed with a gtx 1060). The lighting is among the best I have ever seen in gaming. 2am inside your small base, completely pitch black, you figure out how to craft a torch (you also start with one if you still have it) then the area illuminates in a way realistically resembling a torch. Two things that could use tweaking - ""Torch Lag"" where on particularly slow PC's using torches to light your base will half (or worse) your framerate. And the instant change of terrain upon going from rain to snow or vise versa (more noticable in snow biomes) make that change more gradual.2) Sounds - (9/10) You will be on the edge of your chair when you hear zombies shuffling through the grass just outside your mediocre base you hastely constructed 2 hours before nightfall. Your finger will also be hovering over the pause button when you hear the terrifying screech from one of the ""things"" scrambling around just outside your abode. You sit there silently, not daring to light a torch, or cook the meat that you foolishly left in your inventory. The screech soon converts itself into a bang as the monsters catch onto the scent of the raw meat. They are at your door. You wonder how long the scrap metal laden boards of the door will hold against the ravaging beasts as one layer of material breaks away, Bringing you one step closer to death. Your attempts to repair the continuous damage are futile, as you are now flanked on both sides. The zombies are now breaking down your walls, and your are completely helpless. The hinges on your door give way, and you are swarmed as if the zombies were angered bees. That is the end of your story. A story named 1 Day to Die. Usually this only happens maybe once. Some sounds, however are too loud, even if they are going for realism.3) Gameplay - (8.5/10) - The menus are easily navigatable, so all of your seemingly trivial supplies are easily accessed. In addition to your inventory, you have easy access to your character panel (you can create and customize your own character in MANY different ways. Don't like your nose? Feel free to give yourself a nosejob!). You can craft armor that provides various protection against diffent types of damage, be it a zombie smacking you across the face, or the warm unforgiving sun of the desert. There are many different biomes, and you better hope you came equip with weather appropriate clothing or your goose may be cooked. Or frozen depending on where you are at. Be wary of stepping into a lake as the wetness will amplifify your loss of body heat. There is armor ranging from plant fiber to a suit of iron, that even zombies would have difficulty penetrating. Speaking of iron, you can mine that in caves or your own manmade mine. The mines differ GREATLY from the likes of Minecraft, and they are infinitely more realistic looking. You could build your manmade mine inside your base. Base building is definitely one of the most innovative features of this game. You place frames, and can use materials you've collected to upgrade the durablity of those blocks. Each upgrade has different models, and you are likely to feel more safe behind a wall of scrap metal reinforced wood walls, or even concrete or rubar walls. But always keep in mind... You are NEVER completely safe in 7 Days to Die. You will always have to leave your base to search for food and water, and your own bases defenses may just be your demise. If you manage to be successful in your adventures, you will level up, and earn skill points to spend that will make your continued survival just a little bit easier. If you don't go wandering in the wee hours of the night without heavy artillery... Even WITH heavy artillery, you might just find yourself on the correct side of the wellness bar.4) Animations (8/10) - This is the section, that the developer could touch up a bit. The deer running animation is still rather silly, even after many ALPHA updates, but the zombies animations (Especially running) exceed expections. There is even an death animation that you get to see the zombies feasting on your body! Cutting down trees also has a neat (TIMBER!) animation, which is far better than the previous ""collapse"" animation. OVERALL - (8.5-10) - This awesome game is still in alpha, even though it feels past needing that label, as this game is more than complete. There is TONS of content to enjoy and to be terrified about.  If you are in the market for a survival game, even if you believe zombies are cliche, give this game a try. Be a walking cheeseburger for a hungry zombie today!			"

								It is kinda like Fallout it may not be pretty but it gets the job done.They are making improvements and updates on a regular basis,and stay in touch with the community.This is Alpha but so far i like where most of it is going and how things are being handled.The random maps are a welcome and there is plenty of loot to be had but use it wisely.It is first person view and the zombies are varied and for the most part not to over whelming if your careful and quiet,They do walk slower at daylight so you will want to do most your scavenging during the day.They can charge at night and do gather in hordes with specials and other infected so stealth is the most important.They can also dig and climb to get at you and they can tear down your building to get at you unlike most others games where your home is safe here it is always at risk.You can also set traps like spike strips,dig holes with spike strips which is my favorite way to watch them die.You will have to repair or replace damage done to your buildings or traps so make sure to keep up on that so they do not get to you.You can dig under ground and build just about anything you can think of underground which keeps you safe from zombies but makes getting supplies a little more work and takes longer to build.There also are dogs which can be a big threat early on if not prepared for them,so when you first start your best to try and craft a decent weapon and find a building the first night.I think for now i have said enough i will post the Pros and Cons now Pros Grow Crops for foodNice crafting and buildingDecent Zombies Lots of things to lootHuge mapsConsNeeds more crafting like candles and oil lanternsCould use a map to mark locations or points of interest like water or good looting areas,towns ect. Note: it does have a map just no way to mark things it just shows where you been when you walkTrapped doors to hide your entrances better and maybe make traps for zombiesBetter starting gear at least give basic first aid and some kind of weaponNeeds a real offline mode for single player so you can still play if you have no internet. If you wish to play alone as of now you need to be logged into steam before it will launch the game and let you play.Suicide option to be put back in for single player as it stands now if you fall through something or get stuck the only way to get out is to either wait to starve/die of thirst or reload the game to reset yourself.Finally Alpha 10 is coming with a lot of changes and as the games changes i may change my review and update it.In short if you like building,crafting,zombies,co-op this is a good game to get and out of the survivalist games this is one of the better ones in my opinion and worth the purchase .8/10 "

								I dont know how to feel about this game. I see it gets constant updates but every time i play it lags to no end on a evga 980. The game's textures,charachter models,etc..just look and feel aweful. I haven't played this in a year and i see no big improvement's. I see new UI. New menu  and some other things, nothing that amkes me want to play this game at all though. I like all that it has to offer. The survival, the crafting,building,zombies. Are all things i like in a game. It's just exicuted poorly IMO. I'm gonna keep coming back every so often to see it's progress, but for now. I can't recommend it. i can't even really play the FPS drops are insane.UPDATE: 7/1/2016 Game runs much much better stable 60 fps at max settings in single player. I don't know about MP. Game still looks awful. Really bad, no joke. I can look past that but what i can't look past is the worls being so empty and boring. Zombies can still hit you from 20 feet away which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when you just have a club. Then one hit from them you're stun locked in place. I don't have time for half♥♥♥♥♥games like this. It's been 3 years and the basics still haven't changed. They made it way easier to build and craft thing which i really like. I love the UI is easy to use and nice to look at. No lag issues as of playing SP but everything else is crap. My opinion don't like take a hike!			"

								7DTD is a Single/Multiplayer Zombie Survival game that even if it's still in its Alpha phase, allready worth Buying.When I first Bought this game it was in Alpha 4 or so, and looked a lot like Minecraft.That, to be honest was one of the Reasons why I Bought it in the First place, but i stayed because it is one of the most Fun Zombie Games plus it is a Game with the ""Build-your-own-Base-and-defend-it"" aspect that is really Enjoyable to Play.The Fun only really begins when you Start playing Online with one or more Friends, because the Building and Fighting off Zombies gets more Fun (and Hilarious) when done with Friends even though the Singleplayer is Fun too.About the Gameplay, Graphics and what not:The Controls are Simple, nothing too fancy that you would Loose yourself in.Movement is smoothly, but looses Precision when your FPS are fairly Low.The Textures are Surprisingly High-Res, the Water shader is really good too.When I first Jumped into the Game and checked out what it was about, I was Surprised at how the Game looks Graphic-wise.Soundwise this Game is pure Genius too, the Zombies sound Scary (even though they're not, more about that later), the sounds of everything else is Okay too.The Reason I'm only saying Good things about this Game is because  they Paid me for it and told me they'd Kill my Family if I say something bad it is still in early Alpha, which suggests that you shouldn't be so Harsh on it, and also the Game is simply Amazing as said before!The Game is getting Frequent updates, and the Communication between Developers and Community is Very open.But if anyone wants some Critisism on this Game:Right now as it is, the A.I Pathing is quite Glitchy and seeing Zombies Poledancing on a Lantern post isn't something Rare.What i really do not Enjoy one bit is that there is a Timer for opening Cars and other Loot Containers such as Crates, Duffle Bags and Desks.The Timer IS a good idea, but it just takes so long to open Containers. (about 1 Minute if i'm correct)You can deactivate that setting when Joining a World though, so that is not that Big of an issue.If the Developers would change the Time it takes to Open a Container I would propably even use that Feature, since it Stops you from Rushing through a City, opening all the Things to never be seen again.This is a good Transition to coming over to the Next Downside:Its really Easy to just Run through a whole City in less than 10 Minutes or so since the Zombies are rarely an Issue and finding Weapons is way too easy, but the Night takes this Back down because its rather Difficult to Survive if you haven't build a good Base.I am looking forward to the Full Release of this Game, and Proud to say that I Supported it since almost from the Start.I'd Recommend this to everyone that likes Zombie games with a nice Atmosphere, and Enjoys Fighting off said Zombies in a Self-Made Base.I think even Minecraftians will Enjoy this Game.TL;DR: Its a Zombie Tower Defense game with Crafting elements.Buy it.This was my First Real Review of a Game on Steam, let me know if I did good.

								Seven Days to Die...seven? Really? I've been trying so many times! I even tried to play without zobies....and guess what...I died anyway! And thats wonderful!...This game is really fun to play, it has a true post-apocalyptic atmospere you can feel on your every single step. The slightest unusual sound during your scavenge for any useful piece of scrap causing you nerve-wrecking anxiety. The perception of rapidly shortening daylight goes hand to hand with desperate need for shelter and at least an illusion of safety...""Can I get back to my provisional base in that wooden cabin I found yesterday or shall i prefer to scavenge a little bit longer in this ruined tenement on the city outskirts...maybe I will finally find some ammo to my half-broken hunting rifle, maybe some can of dog food....I am so SO hungry! Ok, lets search few more rooms and stay overnight. This bulding is pretty tall. I bet they wont find me on the roof...""And then the nigh comes.""...That was really BAD idea...""CONS:- It's an aplha game, there is a lot of mistakes and glitches....and imagine that, it is not even finished yet! (sarcasm tag)PROS:- Well-made survival simulator- Zombie-apocalypse atmosphere- Random open world generator- Crafting and building system- ONE OF VERY FEW EARLY ACCESS GAMES, WHICH IS CONSTANTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND YOU CAN ACTUALY SEE THE PROGRESS ALMOST EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS!!!Yeah I like it - 8/10 - (with a potential to get much more better when it's finished)			"

No crashes or major bugs, MP support functions, and the game itself...it is genuinely more than a little scary at times, getting important resources is not easy, but loot drops are also plentiful. you are rewarded for exploring thusly, if you can keep yourself alive.on the last note, it's also very hard. i thought that blocking the doors and windows up in a house i was hiding in would give me time to craft some things, and then they started breaking through the walls in three places. no rest for the wicked.

								Alone, in an abandoned gun store, I barricaded myself into a dark corner in the hopes that I would not be sensed by the creatures that lurked about outside. I had been struck earlier, and was suffering the early stages of the infection. I hadn't eaten in days, and all I had were some eggs that I had found in a birds nest this morning. Expecting the cold grip of death at any moment, as I hear the deathly screams of the undead outside, and my body beginning to eat itself, I quietly slip a raw egg into my hand from my backpack. I lay hunkered down, crying silently, as I eat the raw egg to stop the hunger pains, knowing full well it was a gamble; that the raw eggs would most likely cause me some sort of illness. Although I knew the risks, I wasn't prepared for the sh*t stormof blood that erupted from my♥♥♥♥♥♥ I began losing consciousness, but remained alive by popping painkillers. Finally, daybreak came about, and as I emerged from my hiding place, I lost the battle with my bloody diarrhea, and slipped into a coma. This has been the 8th time that I have come so close to death, only to be rescued by some mysterious stranger. I awoke on my bed fully refreshed, no longer starving, thirsty, or infected. Thank you mysterious protector. You are the batman of the apocalypse.			"

								Review for version A13I had to change my recommendation since the game became a major overhaul and goes now in such a bad direction that I don't enjoy to play it anymore. You can find my first review further down.In short, 7d2d stole a lot of ideas from games like ARK or Rust and implemented it. Also implemented it pretty bad. I'm not even talking about the tons of bugs, they will get fixed eventually.Not sure what exactly happened, but I would say that someone else now has the creative lead. One of the strong sides of the game was so far the easy gameplay with a lot of depth.This clearly is getting completly changed and complex systems replace the easy one. Systems that add not so much depth, but mechanics that constantly force you to do things. It also prevents you from easy starting anew again. Instead of making the endgame more interesting/rewarding they made the beginning painful (not in terms of difficulty, but in terms of achieving anything). IT's A GRINDING GAME NOW!!!!A few examples:> Characters got gimped and a skill system was implemented that adds nothing except to bring your char back to where he once was without the skill system.> There is now poop in toilets> There is now a heat system in place that forces you to change your clothing constantly> There is just one sort of meat in the game instead of a different one from every animal, in general there are less recipes available> The hud got simplified which took a ton of immersion away (you need now to go trough different menus to see for example how hungry or thirsty you are> Fighting mechanics took a blow for the worse. Graphics will prevent you from making clear shots, also the way zombies move now make every shot unpredictable> You can literally be safe now with just tons of wood spikes around you, building anything more is not fun now but just a pain in the ♥♥♥ that needs tons of ressources to keep it repaired (repairs were free before)> Less interaction with objects, less materials, less recipes, takes a lot of immersion away> Random terrain generator is completely ♥♥♥♥ed up now - you basically need to build in the desert, because you won't find anywhere else water. And water will now disappear in time.I could go on for hours like that. The games has issues that would need attention (implement NPCs, make a better random generator, more prefabs, better security against hacks, implement electricity or similar system with logic operators, etc...) but the devs ignore those completly and invest instead only time into changing systems that were fine. As it stands I can only recommend the game to play the older A12 version. That one is a lot of fun. Other than that I'd recommend to buy something else.------------------------------------------------Review for up to version A12Yes, I recommend it. It's an awesome game and you would miss out a lot by not playing it if you like zombies and/or base building, crafting, survival games.Grab one or a few good friends, open a server and try to survive against waves and waves of zombies during the night while you scavenge for food, supplies and weapons during the day and fortify your base as good as you can.Always in a race against the clock. The game get's harder the longer you play it. Building on a spot generates heat and this attracts zombies. Also every night until the final 7th night the zombies get harder.If you survived a week and manage to rebuild the damage you got on the 7th night it cools down. But make no mistake, because week 2 will be harder than week 1.Only when you managed to survive around 7 or 8 weeks you will be pretty safe. That's also the time to quit and play on harder difficulty as there is not much else to do after.Multiplayer Servers work different and would in theory give a longer incentive to play, but be aware, that the not whitelisted multiplayer servers are completly flooded with hackers.The game uses the unity engine (big mistake for any serious multiplayer game nowadays) and you will loose all your stuff and well built base because they take it over with hacks. So multiplayer is a complete NO-GO! with this game.Be VERY AWARE of that before buying it.			"

								I enjoy the game, however, there is currently a memory leak for 32 bit systems that causes the game to crash every 10-15 minutes depending on how far you are traveling (longer travel, faster crash). Of course, when this crash happens nothing is saved. You are essentially replaying the same bit of the game over and over again unless you logout for it to save every 10 minutes, anticipating the inevitable crash.I can't really recommend it in it's current state to 32 bit users. Just wait a few months for them to figure it out.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game on sale for 10€ since it's PvE style offers a different take on the well saturated open world survival genre. The review is based on Alpha 15.Pros:+PvE approach offers the comfort of playing on a sandbox server at day and handing you big scale fights at night (especially on the 7th night a week).+Landscaping/Mining. This is something that a lot of the other survival games are missing.+Characterleveling and skillsystem.+Randomly generated maps and a static map.+Quests.Cons:-Bad optimization. I get 40fps and below (GTX970/FX8370/16gb@1080p) next to big buildings and hordes of zombies which doesn't change when lowering graphics settings.-Graphics can't compete with other games of the genre.-Controls aren't fully customizable.-Very few special infected.-Somewhat clunky and unfinished UI.-No PvP due to small servers and the way the game works.-Bad and easy to abuse AI.-You will reach the point of ""What now? Why am I doing this?"" fairly early in this game if you aren't into straight up sandboxing.Conclusion:While playing this game I couldn't stop thinking about how Rust does everything (apart from the Zombies obviously) better - whether it's looks, optimization, controls, interface or the actual gameplay. It's not DayZ-bad but there's still a whole lot to be done for a game that has already spent more than 3 years in Early Access.The real buzzkill to me is what is supposed to make this game different: PvE base defending. Having 50 generic zombies literally pile up on your doorstep and slaughtering them 1 by 1 through holes in the walls just isn't my understanding of a fun and well thought out game concept. Also there are obstacles zombies can't get accross and if you feel like you won't be able to hold your base you can just hop out and kite them all away until the night is over since zombies won't attack empty bases if there are players around.I recommend to not buy this game at this stage although this stage could mean never as many other EA survival games have shown.

								I whole-heartedly recommend this game. If you have been sitting on the fence wondering whether this is just like all the other sandbox survival games out there just stop it and purchase this game right now.This game plays great solo, co-op, or pvp depending on your tastes.This game delivers a real challenge and you will die a lot at first until you become familiar with what you must do to survive. There is no tutorial but there are lots of videos on youtube and helpful people on the forums to answer questions.Crafting, building, exploring, survival.....all are done exceptionally well especially for a game at this stage of development.I have owned this game for 1.5 years as of this writing and can attest that the developers are active and passionate about this game. There is very little risk of abandonment that I can see and even if it were to happen the current game is worth the price all by itself so you just can't lose.There are a lot of exploration and survival sandboxes out there but this one stands apart due to its voxel based world and the sheer fun of playing.Now the negative.... Like all of the sandbox survival games in early access there comes a point where all the threats have been overcome and then the game is boring. The good news is that tougher enemies are planned for this stage of the game and quests and NPCs that you can gather as followers will extend gameplay beyond the initial survival scope. But that isn't in yet.Also like all early access games you must be patient and forgiving as bugs and wipes will cause you  pain. But if you enjoy experiencing games as they develop and are interested in the survival sandbox genre you will absolutely love this game.			"

Began the epic stutter walking tried multiple resolutions all the way down to 640x480 not to mention disable everything play around with the settings edit config file, Really shouldn't need to do all this just to have a little fun.System Specs: I7-6700k CPU 3Gig Nvidia Gpu 16gigs of ram pretty much more then adequate. Conclusion take this trash off early access and this game can blow me it needs way to much performance polishing before id even take another look at it. Which quiet literally is all you can do, stutter and look at your surroundings.-10 / 10 Would rather eat glass and razers followed by pouring salt and acid on my eyes before attempting to play this again.Don't like my review feel free to waste your money and file for a refund after.

								There are dogs everywhere, zombies are way more hit points to kill, it's glitchy as hell and this update is terrible. When one zombie sees you they all instantly come after you, but they do it in waves so you can never escape if you don't have the stamina to outrun them. Even plant fibers can apparently fall and kill you. I got to where I can fresh spawn and surive just fine before the update, and now I'm already up to 21 deaths on day 1. I like a hard game but this is unrealistic and not fun. Whether I'm in some freak unlucky area to start or the whole game went to♥♥♥♥♥♥they need to fix it ASAP.			"

7 Days to Die is an Open-World Sandbox Zombie Survival Crafting Game set in a voxel-based world. You are thrown into the world with nothing but the clothes on your back and from there on it's up to you to survive. Looting, building and exploring during the day and most likely hiding in the basement biting on your fingernails hoping to survive during the night.""If Minecraft and DayZ had a baby,  7 Days to Die would be it.""I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game, and will continue to put hours into it. Remembering the game is in Alpha is exciting as there is plenty of more new content to be added. I love the freedom in building and exploration, as well as the difficulty and rush to get stuff done before the night settles in. If you are a fan of DayZ or RUST, 7 Days to Die is something you cannot miss.7 Days to Die : 82/100 "

								7 Days to Die is not necessarily unique in what it offers : Survival, Zombies, Guns and playing with others, but it combines elements from games like Minecraft, too. You need to allocate resources in order to make things yourself, or trade for better items. Need iron armor? Have fun acquiring it. You'll need not only someone friendly to trade it from, or you can hunt for the schematics, items for a forge and recipes, then gather the materials and do it yourself ( my preferred method, I'm only a bit anti-social ).  So, about the 'Like' or 'Similar To' Minecraft bit : I've never played the game, or seen its cubey appeal, but that doesn't matter too much to me. The main pull from it seems to be the open world mining and building system, and I think its quite fun. In 7 Days to Die, you actually need to think about things like load bearing mechanics, and structural integrity.. though that doesn't mean you can't build some very impressive structures.  Another nice thing? The Developers update the game with either larger patches, or hotfixes rather frequently. So, if you find a problem or issue regardless of what hardware combo your PC features, there's probably someone else that has either the same or similar issue, and the Dev's know.  So, here's the end of a review, one of many for the game. Yes, it's an alpha, and it might have the occasional glitch or FPS drop. Thing is far as I'm aware, it's what an Alpha is for : Adding items and fixing bugs, at least a friend tells me so. I believe him. Been playing this myself in single player, or on servers with or amongst others since late Alpha 8 or so, it comes reccomended from me.. -if- you like these sorts of game elements, listed above. Sure I missed something.			"

Early Access Review
								I have been playing and following this game since kickstart and it has been an interesting ride. There have been times the updates didn't do what we wanted or, more often enough broke the gameplay. But we have to remember that this is an EARLY ACCESS game currently and it is still in Alpha. The developers are usually quick to fix the game breakers and are making regular progress towards their listed goals. As a singleplayer game, it is fun for a while and definitely worth sinking some hours into. As a multiplayer game, it is fantastic. There are many different interactions in MP with some people being friendly and willing to trade items and there are some who would rather take by force. I was dissapointed most in the map. In a multiplayer environment it was easy to just run around and find people, but now with random world generation, it has become an entirely new game. Perhaps the best feature of this game are the consequences. Every little thing you do has an effect. Drinking unboiled water might fix your thirst for a time, but you stand a good chance of contracting a disease. Eating certain food types boosts energy but drains hydration. Choice of builing location is critical. If you build next to a road or city, someone may find you. Too far away from loot spawns and you're going to tooless. TL:DRThis game is great and offers a lot of features and performance especially in alpha/early access. It can be buggy and there are things that need to be tweaked/fixed but it is worth it to play nonetheless. I highly recommend the game and suggest you pick up a copy to support the developers as they improve this game.			"

								7 days seems to be alone on a hill amid the slurry of zombie survival fps's. Standing alone or very nearly as the best put togerther overall. For real though, its a really great game with a strong community and devs that actually seem to give a damn about what their playerbase wants (weird right?). Started in Alpha 9, almost 200 hours later still going strong waiting on A12 to hit. This is imo the only Zambie survival game you will ever need. Pros:SIngle player great crafting and building system in placecombat feels great and rather intuitivecan make the game as hard or simple as you like depenging on your playstyle or that of your group.endless possiblities of maps on randomgennot a pvp zergfestthe devs actually give a damn about this game and listen to us.Cons:Bugs such as jump off a 4 story roof onto car, just fine. Jump off said car 3ft to pavement, leg is shattered.Zombies somtimes seem to have superhuman hearing and smell to find youheatmap is a little wonkynot a pvp zergfest, if your looking for that go try H1 or Day Z.Or to put it another way, best broken leg sim NA, 10/10 would buy again.

								One of the few zombie survival games that has an emphasis on the survival part. By this I mean the scavenging for supplies,  building up defenses, learning to hate zomdogs, and other things to last the night, especially the 7th day horde. As opposed to just run and gunning to a safe room or simply devolving into a deathmatch once someone finds a gun.My primary complaint (as of writing this) besides the expected bugs and a need for a bit of optimization. Is the underground/mining part could use a bit of work. While they (the devs) have done things to not make it quite a necessity, it is useful but still tedious, boring, and mostly safe (no underground enemies and zombies don't really dig).Overall 8/10			"

								7 Days to Die is the best survival crafting game I have played.  It's crafting is similar to minecraft, yet physics/structural integrity matters.  The survival aspect is actually challenging and fun.  The game is routinely updated and improved upon.  Having played the game in several different builds, it's had many great changes/improvements throughout it's development.  For being in early access it's surprisingly well polished.  Not a ton of bugs, and very playable at this time.  In my opinion this is the best survival crafting open world game available if you like PvE.  I honestly haven't even tried PvP, I have a few friends who also have the game and it's a blast building a base, surviving hordes and then venturing into cities to make another base and try holding off the zombies as long as possible.

Going on raids at local, deserted towns for those Antibiotics you need. Stripping a local town of all resources you can then moving on to do it all again.The promised additions due in the game will no doubt make things more varied but there is a whole lot of fun to be had in the Zombie infected wasteland, even this early on.Brilliant, brilliant fun.

Overall, the game is pretty good for what it is and if you want to play with friends, you have the option to do that also.			"

Zombies now practacly o shot you if your on anything but super easy because of the mere fact that the devs reduced your life to a miniscule amount and good luck running for your life, they nerfed stamina too. the crafting screen seems the same though didn't enjoy it as much as i used to. maybe was just because everytime i opened it i was slaugtered by zombies before i could make anything but i could just be biased to the way the game used to play.

								I remember when I first started playing this game, the first hour of frustration trying to figure it out before it finally clicked and it was suddenly so much fun. It was literally my favorite game, I remember calling my cousin just to tell him he needs to buy it so we could play together. He doesn't even play games, I was just so excited I wanted someone to♥♥♥♥♥♥around with on this crazy new game I found, it was so fun.That was back in A9 or so, though, and I hate to say it's gone downhill from there. While the game improves visually (it's honestly damn sexy for a voxel game especially if you get to play it on max) the fun just slowly disappears. I'm not getting bored of it, it's just getting not fun. Crafting is being dumbed down while survival is getting harder, the interface has been so simplified that it's become complicated (it makes sense if you've played it) and the scavenging/foraging has turned into literally nothing more than ""hold click until the tree/rock/dirt's healthbar reaches nil"" which takes absolutely forever on everything now and just makes it feel even more repetitive than it already was.I've tried a few times to play it during A13 and now it's finally reached the point where I just can't. I'll try again in A14 but for the time being I can't even reach the point where I can craft a forge (literally the point where the game actually starts) without giving up out of boredom. It's just grinding now, except instead of killing zombies you're killing foliage. It's much less suspenseful.If they can stop trying to complexify and simplify at the same time I think the game's still got a chance, but right now the game's developers seem more confused than I do and that's never a good sign.

With said time, I've been building the ""best fort ever"", mining, crafting, getting a handle on the zombie horde times and how to survive them, and playing each and every game mode. All have a great way of balancing the fixes of the other mode. For example, survivor leaves you with a map that will eventually be looted out of all objects left around for you without going into folder files and changing things. When you switch to the zombie horde mode, you get care packages filled with a bunch of random weapons, tools, accessories to survive the upcoming battle. The only problem I've seen so far are the glitches like in zombie horde where the zombies just stop appearing. This could likely be due to not overtaking my strong fort on the first wave and giving up. When you finally feel burnt out of the crafting, scavenging, etc, you do have the ""cheat mode"" option for your survival game where you can place just about (if not) everything in the game. This fixes your loot problem as you can simply go into cheat mode, fill up bags with these items while on a password basis, and then switch it back to public playing and no cheats. It's great for the server host to keep things fresh, fair, or even down-right crazy. I highly recommend you buy this game if youre a fan of the sandbox/crafter games. It's a huge step up from other said games with a zombie mode- counting graphics, AI, and everything else in the mix.			"

								as much as I LOVED this game I cant recomend it right now for a few reasons(sp issue)-single player is boring as hell no npcs aside from the trader and its just looting houses and camps(shared issue)-just a lot of crafting stuff and throwing it away/scraping it just to get items that are ok(shared issue)-GUNS ARE WORTHLESS (20 headshots with a 300 blunderbuss does nothing but a 200 bow kills em dead in about 10 headshots)(mp issue)- no form of offline raid protection(mp issue)- dropping earth (this is a way to lag/crash entire servers all you need to do is just cause a HUGE landmass to fall and it will lag the server to hell)(mp issue)- community is loaded with toxic kids who will spam chat and throw there land claim block as close to you as they can(mp issue)- ANYONE CAN RAID YOU as i said earlier offline raiding is REALLY bad but to make things worse anyone can raid your base no mater how thick since anyone can just stand at your base punching the walls until they break (this will take hours but it works)and to top this all off the game has been in EA for a long♥♥♥♥♥time			"

								Well, I don't know if it's too early to write a review, but I must say this is a really good game.Probably best survival crafting game I ever played. Fairly good graphic for my low spec laptop, so it's quite sastisfying.But maybe it will be better if the dev improve the (easy) anti cheat system, because I find cheaters in 2 servers i've been playing. Like I built everything with hard work and spent so much time in building my base and some guy just fly in to my base and destroy everything, that really make me sad. Sad enough to quit playing the game. If the problem is fixed then I would to play again. I miss some good people I met in game.Still, it's a good game. Really really good game,			"

								Even though this game is just in alpha, it's quite amazing and the sheer amount of content for an alpha is through the roof. It doesn't require an expensive computer and runs very smoothly. As with every game, there are bugs that need to be worked out, but hey, it's an alpha, there's still plenty of time for that stuff. The progression is very good, you can basically go from being an outsider in an apocalypse to the king of the world in this game. Difficulty is highly customizable, which means every player can tailor their game to theri own liking, including how long a day lasts, or how much of that will be night. I'm definitely recommending this game, it's by far the best zombie survival game on the market today. Can't wait to see what it'll turn into.			"

								2600 hours on the clock.Like:- Great gameplay, if you like zombies,crafting things,survival, build your own base and explore an open world, this might be the game you want.- Loads of customizable settings and modding options in case vanilla starts to bore you or if you simply just don't agree how certain vanilla settings are.You can also edit zombies their speed, health, etc, edit weapons, biomes, add recipes, create custom quests, create new zombies and so much more to create just the zombie survival world that you want.- Updates are getting better and better,Lot's of cool features being implemented each update. the latest updates took longer to get there, but at least the fun pimps make sure the updates are stable and don't come with game breakable bugs. - The community of the game is also involved with the development of the game.The developers show progress as well on youtube (Joel Huenink) and on forums players can ask questions or suggest ideas which are answered in a Q&A session.Dislike:- There are sometimes these weird bugs and you have to relog your game which can be annoying at times, but remember it is still in Alpha. At least they got rid of the bugs that can seriously mess up your game.- Some people would say the graphics don't look that great and I guess they are right, for a game in this time it could be better. They are improving the graphics each update though and landscapes are getting very nice by now, but if great graphics are a requirement for you then maybe this isn't the game for you.			"

								I am not recommending this game at this point not because of the gameplay. But off of the fact that if you want to play this game with a friend in a co-op game that is private is almost impossible without spending more money on a server or joining someone else's server. I preferably love this game, great potential, but it is the most aggrevating thing when a friend works his hind end off to get enough money to buy the game, and quickly come to find out that it takes nothing short of money or a miracle to join his friends game. If anyone has found a way to do a private co-op match then let me know. At this point if you have hopes for you and your buddies to survive this apocalypse in a unpenetrable fortress that all of you created, it is not worth it.			"

								The Survival Horde Crafting Game!So… if you have tried a game like Minecraft - you will understand some of the gameplay here. Just add a few things to your vision of Minecraft: 1. Remember the paranoia from Left4Dead when you encountered the witch first time? That feeling will be there much                 more… almost all the time… Especially at night!2. Add the lack of Gravity from Minecraft into this game and add some better looking graphics.3. Add zombies… a lot of zombies… daylight is as in the movie “Night of the Living Dead” and the nights are more like “World War Z”4. Add a lot of guns! To boil it all down it’s a mixture of the best from Minecraft added with the best from games like Left4Dead or Rust or DayZ.If you’re into paranoia, zombies and survival games – then this is it!Haven’t tried a game that after 30 minutes play forced me to crawl into a corner with my torch inside a small church for another 30 minutes of play time… just staring at the entrance and waiting for daylight to come!

								This review also includes having played the A15 Experimental.Temperature system is still incredibly broken despite being added at the start of the year, you overheat for no reason, for example i was overheating in a hills biome while my character was wearing zero clothing because i was trying to cut down a tree, you still overheat in snow biomes and you still overheat in deserts at night.Spawning is still horrible, enemies still spawn behind you a meter away and your first clue that one has spawned so close is when they hit you.Minibike is still incredibly broken, disappears, falls through the world, very choppy and glitchy to use.Trader system added, which sounds great, until you find out that they are not a 100% spawn at the rare trader POI's, came across 7 trader POI's with zero traders.Resource gathering is still super grindy, takes forever to get resources so even a small shack can take hours of farming to upgrade.The already rare ore deposits have now been nerfed even more, yet to find a single deposit anywhere, if i wanted to mine for 7 hours in a row i would play minecraft or a spelunking game.Wellness system still sucks, even eating the best food and drinking the best drinks takes forever to raise it by a few, which taken into account by zombie spawning behind you and if you die you lose 10 is a horrible system.The A15 update adds almost no content compared to A14, there is a few new additions but they are minor and while i note there is a lot of rebalancing and bug fixing, there is no content or substance to hold you if you have already played a lot in A14.

Day Z and 7 days have been in bearly access for about the same time. No way a game not being tested/played as much could be as good. It's reality, nothing against Hello. Anyways, I shopped around and settled on 7 Days to die. I read a review for this that called it Minecraft for adults. That's pretty much what it is. It's very much like minecraft but there is more things to do and those things are definitly adult in nature. Anyways 20 hours so far and i'm loving it. Play this Sh!T!!!			"

								The Survival Horde Crafting Game!So… if you have tried a game like Minecraft - you will understand some of the gameplay here. Just add a few things to your vision of Minecraft: 1. Remember the paranoia from Left4Dead when you encountered the witch first time? That feeling will be there much                 more… almost all the time… Especially at night!2. Add the lack of Gravity from Minecraft into this game and add some better looking graphics.3. Add zombies… a lot of zombies… daylight is as in the movie “Night of the Living Dead” and the nights are more like “World War Z”4. Add a lot of guns! To boil it all down it’s a mixture of the best from Minecraft added with the best from games like Left4Dead or Rust or DayZ.If you’re into paranoia, zombies and survival games – then this is it!Haven’t tried a game that after 30 minutes play forced me to crawl into a corner with my torch inside a small church for another 30 minutes of play time… just staring at the entrance and waiting for daylight to come!

								i've been absolutely loving this game.  The first 9 hours of it i played all in first sitting. Everything was going unusually peacefully. no real dog packs, or hordes at all. that is until the night of the 16th day -_-  Up until now they never sensed or bothered me, until i had too many campfires going i guess then bam, dude climbs a wall without warning, i start pushing every button, including esc which on multi apparently does nothing but prevent you from doing anything lol. scrambled for a weapon, for whatever reason grabbed the pistol and put one in his head. then everyone and their mom must have heard it because by morning there was a horde about 40+ strong waiting for me all around the building.  had to wrangle them like cattle and pick them off quietly one by one....now to finish up my goldenrod tea....

								7 Days to die, a game where the community comes together to fight in ""groups"" to keep the zombie hoard from killing them all, teamwork is a key to success. You make friends along the way and probably some foes also. There are 2 types right now, PVE (Player vs. Enemy) or PVP (Player vs. Player). Server admins and the moderators are always out there to make sure you have a wonderful gaming experience that will last.			"

It is one of the few games that actually became what the producers advertised.Don't complain that it came out early, they did that to get feedback from the people, to build an audience and to find bugs.Nothing compares to this game right now, and dont dare to say DAYZ or MinecraftI played probably ~75 to ~150 hours when it wasnt on steam and i enjoyed just about every minute of it.If you are thinking about buying this game, ask your wallet.

								I used to tout this game to all my friends and family gamers, I cant encourage anyone buying this game anymore. The devs are taking leisurely time to produce the game, stringing all fans along for far too long, the finished game will take another year or two minimal. They are on high horses since they have made millions and think its ok to drag♥♥♥♥♥even longer. They are losing fans, and myself and my group are among them. Dont buy for another year or two. Seriously take a look at how much they have plundered from PC/Consoles and kickstarter......Its an atrocity that the game isnt finished or even near completion with that type of funding. They are millionaires, and they let releases out as fast as a glacier moves..... heres a news update from june 11th.Hey Survivalist, We know your wanting Alpha 15 but it’s still some weeks out so in the meantime here is a great new alpha 14.7 stable build with many highly requested bug fixes and a new launcher which could help folks with 32 bit problems. Some weeks? Some months or maybe half a year....Nuff said, thats the state of the game.Nuff said.			"

								It's an alpha. A very playable alpha but it has a way to. By buying it now your supporting what it might become. And as such I would hope no opinions would be censored or removed.  Do I recomend this game right now? If $24 (usd) is something you can justify spending to try somethign you might like. Otherwise wait for Ver 1.0. I enjoy playiinng it and seeing what the updates bring. It's not a finished game the dogs glitch out and other problems Can't find a way to sleep etc.. But Over all I enjoy it and am looking for where this title goes. Now on alpha 12.5 and WOW what a diffrent game. Love the way this game is progressing. Still a few bugs and some big new updates coming in a week when alpha 13 hits. I may be buying a server once it does the wife, kids, friends, and I are having a blast.			"

								In the long line of survival games mushrooming up nowadays, this one really gets it right!There is nothing that makes a zombie game more stupid than stupid zombies.....   DayZ?  => Nobody is even looking at the zombiesRust?  => They removed them... and not too soonMinecraft?  => Known for the almighty Creeper.But with 7d2d you'll find the definition of Zombies that you are looking for.  Scary monsters banging on your house, and you'll be there, crouched with your crossbow, ready to shoot out of any hole that will appear in your shabby, wooden house.Besides this, you'll also have a long list of items to craft, different areas to explore, and to build your own.  This is an alpha, and it shows.  They have some tweaking to do on their game so it's more efficient for FPS & smoothness (particulary for multiplayer) , as well as add more content.  Still, even in its current state it is already a game that will hook you to your pc for days and have you looking forward to every future update.If you like this genre, this is definetly worth your time to check out.

								Having used to being a heavy gamer in my younger years before growing up like we all have to do eventually and taking on the responsibilities of a working life i wanted to still be able to have a lil gaming session from time to time but finding an appropriate game that could be played here and there and picked up from where i left off was hard to come by. I wasnt very knowledgable with sandbox games and how much fun they can be. If you are the type of person like myself with a busy personal life but seeking a game that is challenging/easy going (subject to your game set up options) alot of fun and prefer to enjoy coop with friends than online inc pvp then look no further. Having the freedom of doing whatever you want to the environment and building bases to survive, looting, crafting, messing around with friends for giggles and having to look over your shoulder from zombies especially during the night then this comes highly recommended. We all seek different needs from a game and i am easily satisfied with one. With the randomly generated worlds coming in one of the next updates this game is always going to be fun for me personally and others who enjoy this sort of thing. You can make the game as hard as you want or as easy as you want with the ingame options but may have to do a little bit of trial and error to find the most enjoyble setup. If anyone is considering this game but not sure then feel free to message me for any advice or want to know more before buying it in the Alpha stage.  Happy gaming ladies and gents.			"

								Best game I have played in a very long time.  It is still in developement, but is better then anything most major game studios have put out in years.  Easily.  - If you at all have interest in killing zombies then this is for you.  - If you at all enjoy immerisive survival(ie splinting your leg when you take a fall, drinking boiled water instead of water straight from a pond) this is for you. - If you like exploration this game is VERY MUCH for you.  - If you like crafting/building games (ie minecraft) this game is right up your alley. -Please note, this game will take you more then a half hour to understand.  It is hard, you will die, a lot.  Once you get your feet under you, and start procceding along the learning curve, the game opens up and is quite exciting. I have been playing avidly for over a week now and I am still being amazed by the content I am discovering and starting to incorporate into my play style.  (ie farming coffee so I can go caffine crazy and sprint like a track star.  etc)Furthermore, it should be mentioned that when creating custom worlds to play in the user can extinsivly customize the game settings, tailoring the game to whatever is more entertaining for their particular play style and interests.  (ie I have a friend who doesn't enjoy survial games, he plays it as just a FPS zombie horde slaying, exploration game.)In conclusion, this game brings together aspects of a lot of games, in one package that functions quite well and provides a challenging, immersive, custimizable, and extremely fun experience.  Expect to find your self playing this game significantly more then you may of anticipated. I sure have!   "

Hard facts after 770 hours of gameplayI gotta say that this game is not what i payed for and changed a lot mostly to the worse. It used to be fun but it becomes more and more of a ridiculous grindfest and if u have a job or you study but want to get far in the game then forget it... (i played in a group of 4 and it was still just lots of grinding with no end)The developers try to force you to spent more time in game by making simple things more complicated with every so rare patch instead of actaully adding new content to the game that would keep u busy on advanced stages. On advanced stages its exactly as boring as it was, now it will just take you longer to get there.. trough lots boring and time consuming endless grinding...Terrible , lazy solution if you ask me.PROS:Great Building aspect.CONS:- Object/Weapons textures could be way better i mean even the original not HD Skyrim was better and that game is like what 3-4 years old now?The landscape textures are just bad, but they added HD light effects? set your priorities straight...Sound quality is super cheap. Game performance is poorly optimized if you can talk about optimization at all.-Glitchy graphics like see trough ground textures. You may eventualy fall trough such a glitch into a endless fall.Glitching terrain textures which will form some awkward shapes and block your path so you could even get stuck in them.-Glitchy zombie animations (which can get you killed)-Lags ,many lags, even if your machine fits the optimal requirments or is above.- Finding a decent community is very hard. - Too many hackers and no decent protection to keep them out.- Leveling... Well this is the worst level/upgrade system you ever saw besides of the fact that it kills immersion and dances on its grave, It just feels not realistic and annoying as if it was pushed in just to exist because hey all other games have that so lets kinda have one too.All the drops are now level adjusted says you have no chance of getting any even partly decent weapon/tool. It sells it self as a realistic survival game right, says it depends on scavenging and looting for things which will help you to keep the fight and stay alive... those are things which depend on luck , you should be able to find something great or trash... here you will find only trash till you get to a higher level no exception.	 Where is the thrill of what is in the next house im going to loot? What keeps me motivated to go on? 20 more levels of trash and no hope? probably not. -Extreme time consuming farming for resources. I get it here they wanted to make it suddnly more realistic on this part right? And they did it, exactly on the spot where no one would like it to be.I mean did i buy a mining or wood chopping simulator and didnt know it?If i would love to spent hours and hours on braking stone and chopping wood i could as well just go outside now and do it in real life.Immersion is great but not in everything.- Bugs spawn endless stream of hordes for several days which will ♥♥♥♥ your base.At this moment kiss your ammo good bey (which is hard to get) not only because the hords will really not end but also because now you will miss your target even if you aim dead on.Why? Because you dont have the skill points spent on this type of a weapon.... and that is supposed to be a ego shooter? a game where your true aim doesnt count for sh*t? -You will spent most of the day just eating and drinking or searching for food and drink. There is no end to your thirst and hunger.- Now the furnace takes like two hours or so (real life time) just to let you use the resources u grinded hours for already.And that is only for you to be able to start crafting and that doesnt include the long crafting times yet.- The weapons and tool crafting system is insanely bad, back in time you would have to advance from wood to iron to steel as far as you would get those... now u have to level up tool smithing to insanity just to get a dam pickaxe which will not break after some couple of hits. I dont start on the guns. - Devs dont listen to the community and seem only to fix things which are ultimatly game breaking while closing eyes on other known bugs.- Fixes take too long or dont happen in some cases, even though they tend to releas some hot fixes after every patch there are too many bugs which survived over a very long period of time.- I see no new content for almost a year and god this game lacks on that.And when they do add some little new thing to the game, that thing is going to be bugged!like those mini bikes,that took you hours maybe days to put together and would glitch trough the ground on your first ride saying bey bey. just one of many examples.-PvP is crap. Besides the hackers that will destroy your base no one can raid anyone! Because of the land-claim block which makes buildings indestructible.Again one point where they need more immersion but hey stone chopping realism was top priority i guess so they had to leave the less important game aspects out.I could go on for a longer list but i think this is enough info to form a opinion on the product. Its very sad how they keep ruining this game. And by now the game it self looks like a dead end. Sadly i see no future for this project, I would be happy if they would prove me wrong though. Do i recommend this game? No, definitly not anymore!I would strongly recommend to not buy it at the current stage.			"

								This has to be the best survival zombie game that i have ever played.  there is so much to do in this game and the crafting is quite impressive.  the zombies really are scary as hell because you have to watch your back every second.  this is such a great sandbox game. you really can do anything you want and create a base that suites you.  really if you are tired of playing the other games where people just kill you then you need to play this because really the zombies are a much bigger threat. This game is so completely addicting.  it is worth every penny.  ive payed twice as much for games that have not delivered even half as much as this game has. easily a 10/10. and i cant wait to see where this game goes next in development.

								I love this game. It's still in Alpha, but playable with a few bugs (sniper rifle).I would compare this to a L4D2/Minecraft combination. With that being said, the game can get frustrating at the begining, but once you have a system down it becomes less frustrating and more resource stockpiling. In that it is a combination of those games, you will see alot of enemies that are very simular to L4D2 enemies. Cops are almost identical to the Spitter in the series. A few enemies are quite unique and can be a headache while trying to gather equipment. The idea you have to build everything is quite simular to Minecraft, except the list of available items to create and thier plans are all right there, removing the need to go wiki to look up ingredents.  The game does last longer than 7 days as a contridiction to the title, which is nice. There are many different options when starting a game. From single player to multiplayer, random map or Storyline map. The options of what happens to your gear when you die, how often items reset, how often airdrops happen, and even the legth of each day (way awesome). Some very interesting ideas that the game does offer is the ability to become infected, suffer from injury and disease, and attract zombies with some of the items you can have in your inventory. The ability to go into ""sneak"" is almost exactly like Skyrim, to include the HUD icon.The multiplayer portion of this game is what seals it down as a great game. When set up right it makes things interesting for a 4v4 multiplayer map as teams can fight over resources in an area, all while also trying to keep from being killed by zombies.  The down side to this game is that the crafting time can be really long and some resources aren't easily available as fast as you will go though them (brass and gas). If you don't have a good balance of difficulty you can find yourself spending your time just grinding with little to no challange. Tips: Leave your zombie run to Default, set your bag to ""delete"" when you die, and set your day/night ratio to 50%.			"

The progress of the game is VERY good, the developers always listen to their community. This game is a big hope for me, still waiting for the full release. I love Minecraft and games like that. For now i can give 7.8/10 score. By the way, i got a graphical issue here.

But if those things dont appeal to you, then maybe wait for it to be finished.

								I LOVE IT!!! It's totally minecraft meets The Walking Dead... there are a few things that still need some work and things, but for a game that is still in its Alpha stage its amazingUpdate: 06/26/2016  Alpha 14.7(b6)It's been about 1 yr sense I did my last updated review and I have to say.. I am impressed with the improvements to the game as a whole. They added a lot of new HD graphic overlays and skins, improved the AI and movement of the zombies, impoved the crafting and looting system, added skill points and some new recipes as well as some new building options and such. over all The game has come a LONG way sense I started playing back in A5.A few things I would personally LOVE to see added would be: NON-zombie NPCs, Traps, Electricity / Generators / Powered Traps, Spears.. and the ability to throw / retrieve them. Siege / Base Defense Weapons (ie: Medieval Scorpion, Rock Drops, Fuel Drops) just for a few.**PLEASE NOTE**These are MY personal views and opinions of the product I have spent quite some time playing and enjoying... And I would ABSOLUTELY Recommend this game to anyone and everyone.  Thank You			"

								Let me get this out of the way and say, yes this is an alpha build, but it's far from unpolished. That being said it's coming a long way. Scalable difficulty is a plus so you can tune how hard it is for you. The crafting is very good, you get a template where stuff should go, you have to figure where it goes. Survival is where the rubber meets the road. How well you survive depends on how well you manage resources, as well as how you manage the clock.The one gripe I have is multiplayer.  Unless you have the money to drop on a server, I've had a VERY hard time setting up a multiplayer game. It's not enough to kill the expierence for me, but it something that really needs work.

								I LOVE IT!!! It's totally minecraft meets The Walking Dead... there are a few things that still need some work and things, but for a game that is still in its Alpha stage its amazingUpdate: 06/26/2016  Alpha 14.7(b6)It's been about 1 yr sense I did my last updated review and I have to say.. I am impressed with the improvements to the game as a whole. They added a lot of new HD graphic overlays and skins, improved the AI and movement of the zombies, impoved the crafting and looting system, added skill points and some new recipes as well as some new building options and such. over all The game has come a LONG way sense I started playing back in A5.A few things I would personally LOVE to see added would be: NON-zombie NPCs, Traps, Electricity / Generators / Powered Traps, Spears.. and the ability to throw / retrieve them. Siege / Base Defense Weapons (ie: Medieval Scorpion, Rock Drops, Fuel Drops) just for a few.**PLEASE NOTE**These are MY personal views and opinions of the product I have spent quite some time playing and enjoying... And I would ABSOLUTELY Recommend this game to anyone and everyone.  Thank You			"

								Let me get this out of the way and say, yes this is an alpha build, but it's far from unpolished. That being said it's coming a long way. Scalable difficulty is a plus so you can tune how hard it is for you. The crafting is very good, you get a template where stuff should go, you have to figure where it goes. Survival is where the rubber meets the road. How well you survive depends on how well you manage resources, as well as how you manage the clock.The one gripe I have is multiplayer.  Unless you have the money to drop on a server, I've had a VERY hard time setting up a multiplayer game. It's not enough to kill the expierence for me, but it something that really needs work. I'm going to give it a pass however because it's still in alpha.If you like your survival games the are actually about surviving this game is great, and it makes good use of craft and build. I can't wait for more from this game.			"

								Live in an Apocolyptic Landscape in which the dead roam the Earth.7 Days to Die is a Survival Horror in which you must survive by scavenging for food, water, supplies and weapons as well as fending yourself off against the undead by yourself or with other people. The world is fully interactable being that you can not only build new creations but you can destroy the landscape or go mining in the middle of nowhere. The Game also features a Creative Mode where you can build creations without it being overrun by zombies so you can build to your hearts content as well as use any item in the game.This is very fun to play with if you like to play these types of games or just want a fun sort of realistic zombie game, i definitely recommend getting some friends as it can allow for some fun that is depending if other people in the game will cooperate or become bandits and becomes a game of every man for himself in this apocolyptic world.Since this game is in early access there are alot of bugs, visual fixes and many things need to be added to make the game be more fleshed out but for what it is now is greatly fun.8.5/10			"

								This game is quickly forming up to be one of my favorite zombie apocalypse/survival/crafting games. Earlier I was put off bit by the blocky terrain a'la Minecraft, while other graphics were aiming to some sort of ""realism""(as realistic a zombie apoc can be) and now that the terrain is smoothed out, the game seems visually more in balance and it's easier to focus in crafting and everything else that happens in game.As a survival game, you are pretty dependant of your own skills - ability to create, build, defend and fix. You can head out scavenging for supplies and weapons, making a home base in existing buildings or start fresh, pick your own spot and start creating your own new base, just the way you like it.Majority of the game's items can already be crafted yourself and I believe eventually everything will be craftable. Every item and building block has it's own mass and durability. That determines how easily a zombie can bash through different types of wall materials and defences. It also determines how many building blocks you can stack or build in air without proper support before it crashes down. For example, a concrete roof will keep it's form under a heady load, while a scrap metal roof is likely to fall down if you walk on it.The zombies in 7 Days To Die have a short memory span and can follow you for a moment, even if they don't see you. If they can't see you, they will eventually forget you and you can try sneaking away. The Zeds also have great hearing and sense of smell, so carrying raw meat (or eating dog/cat food that causes gas!!) can cause problems if surrounded by living dead. And no, mining a new basement floor on urban areas isn't a smart idea.Currently it feels like the game has more than enough to keep me and my friends occupied for a long time, though I can't wait for the next major patch (alpha 9) that will include some AI tweaks, randomly generated worlds etc.For an early access game, 7 Days To Die offers a lot to do and has pretty good options to fine tune the game more into your liking. You can adjust the speed of time, the amount of zeds, AI skill, moving speed and threat, how often you get air drop supplies and so on.So yes, I do recommend this game. It's fun alone, fun with friends. I get huge satisfaction of locating the perfect base site, setting up defences and being able to survive night after night.			"

								Bearing in mind that (at the time of writing) this is in alpha, I have to say that this has good potential.I play at home, multiplayer with other members of my family. We have it set up on a private server on our home LAN.The first thing you want do do once entering the game is locate somewhere to build a safe haven. And as night falls the urgency becomes apparent. During the daytime, the zombies are ok to deal with, but at night they move twice as fast.You can craft your own weapons and ammo - I personally like the crosbow (must have watched too much of The Walking Dead!) I know there are plenty of critics of this game, good and bad. My two pence worth is that it is better to play with someone else rather than on your own, due to gathering/building before night.It does occasionally have it's moments than can effect the cleanliness of your underpants - especially if you play it in the dark.Worth a punt!

So yea i really enjoy it at the moment , kinda like minecraft with full physics which the physics and the loot drops being even and crap make it hella lota fun with friends , easy to set up a server and doesnt lag out on us at all...

It won't disappoint.			"

Early Access Review
								Friday 7 March 2014First off, I would like to say that this game was not always fun or playable for me. When I got it in Alpha 6 for $25 bucks, it took forever to load and initialize, the game lagged badly and frequently, and there were definitely some features, such as the random map generation mechanism, that simply were not there. My laptop is running Windows 8 with a 2.7 GHz AMD processor and 4GB of RAM, so lag should not have been a problem according to the posted game requirements. It made me upset, and I was very unhappy that I was unable to play the game I had just dropped $25 on. And then along came Alpha 7.The developers ""crunched hard"" on making Alpha 7 significantly better, and they kept their word to release it by the end of February. I logged onto Steam on February 28, and ---BAM-- there was an update for 7 Days to Die. It was about damn time for something to be done about the games' various bugs and alpha shortcomings.When I opened this game after the update, I was overjoyed to see that the lag problem had almost completely vanished, new items, patches, and options were in place, and that I could finally start enjoying the game. So far, I am loving every aspect of this game, especially the realistic strategy and tactics. One of my favorites is putting hub cap land mines in various clusters around a Survival Horde map. When they explode, they both kill the zombie that activated it, and draw all the other walkers toward the noise, away from me.I would say that 7 Days to Die is definitely worth the $25 I paid for it, although you might want to wait for a sale to pick this one up. Can't wait for Official Release!P.S.-If a developer is reading this:I would really like to see the random map generation feature released soon, so that by Alpha 8, we can all make unique maps to play on. That is the biggest thing that I absolutely can't stand about this game currently. Great game! Thanks for working hard to improve it.Update:Thursday 10 April 2014After the 7.9 update, I have to say I am rather unhappy with the current Co-op and Multiplayer abilities, but very hopeful for their future. Something this game seems to never be able to shake off entirely is its lag problem. If one update makes the game run smooth, the next may bring it back down to, make it worse than, or make it better than where it was originally. I know that the devs are working hard, as is evidenced in their persistent updates.I will still recommend you wait for a sale (perhaps the Spring Sale in a week or two?) to buy this game, as $25.00 is kind of a lot for the game in its present state.Update:Saturday 24 May 2014It has been two days since the release of Alpha 8.2, and I am very impressed with the way that this game is maturing. It has certainly come a long way since I got it back in Alpha 6, and I believe it is safe to say that it will only continue to get better. Ever since Alpha 8, I haven't experienced any major lag, frozen screens, and glitching (except when I set off ~100 barrels of oil- then there's a few second's delay), and with the addition of land claim blocks to go along with improved co-op and multiplayer options, my private server is all ready to go for my friends and I. I really like how you can get a potentially deadly 4-stage infection now if you are attacked by the undead, and require appropriate medicine (antibiotics) to save yourself, as well as the newly implemented clothing and armor system. Although I am getting a little anxious waiting for the random world generation option, I have to remind myself that I haven't quite explored all of Navezgane yet due to being occupied with building my reinforced-concrete-and-iron-bars bunker.Also just trying to survive in general now requires some effort, as I refuse to play on Beginner and Adventurer difficulty anymore---I am not saying that you are somehow a wimp or noob if you currently play with or prefer to play with these settings for whatever reason, but I have enough experience that I can now turn up the difficulty and have tons of fun, rather than die of starvation, zombies, radiation poisoning, thirst, etc., every 15 minutes, like I did for the first 5 hours of playing this game. Give it time, you'll get there, and then you'll have many hours of exciting and challenging gameplay ahead of you.			"

And about realism, how the  F Uc K   a person maded only by flesh and bones have so much power to destroy concrete and some iron door... I understand they are very angry (zombies), but they are only flesh and bones    f f s . There is no middle dificulty in this game, only too easy and too hard.  And in winter zone...you can't wear clothes after you die...so you die again, trying to reach a warm zone (up to 700 times, depends how much pedobears are around you).  This game is for sado-maso (Yes , I am undercover too) ,sometimes gives you pain in the big fat zone (all people have one).  11 bucks is not a big deal , but sometimes is better to drink something with friends, instead of playing sado-maso games.

								Here is the problem with the 7 days to die. Hit boxes r broken zombie can hit u even if u away from him and we all know that is not going to be fix anytime soon or even ever. Developer r adding Weather system to the game for god sake instead fixing hit boxes in the game. I'm not sure is it the code or the engine that give the limitations. Since this problem was from launch 2013. If u just looking for the game where u can build things then maybe I guess the game is for u.If like me u r looking for game that is zombie survival game with base building then keep looking. Zombies here r just a gimmick. One more thing to mention is that game it self is very badly optimized as of right now. I get more fps on Ultra setting in rome 2 or arma 3 then on medium in 7 days and I know im comparing AAA titles with Indie but I'm just saying that game that is no graphical marble should be able to run better.

								This game is by far the best in its genre.7 Days to Die is the perfect mix between crafting / survival and building / sandbox. The multiplayer is very similar to that of RUST or Day Z on public servers, with a much more intricate crafting and building system.7DTD is like a combination of everything good about Minecraft and RUST. It has a voxel based, infinitely generated world and block based building system similar to Minecraft, and a crafting system that far exceeds that of RUST. There are randomly generated points of interest, including many shops and stores filled with valuable loot. Three types of animals can be found (pigs, deer, and rabbits) and the zombies are plentiful and varied.The gameplay is multi-staged as you build and grow a base. Scavanging is essential to find food and water in order to survive another day, until you are able to start a farm for food. There are many different types of edible items, some of which give positive or negative buffs.The buff system is a masterpiece. Eating rotten food will lower your stamina temporarily, coffee can increase your stamina for a period of time, and zombies will infect you with enough damage. Antibiotics will cure your infection, but they are rare to find and hard to craft. Luckily it takes days for your infection to progress, up to three stages before you will die from it giving plenty of time to find that essential cure. Painkillers increase health over time as well as medical bandages, and a hit from an enemy can cause you to bleed out if you aren't careful.The penalty for death is extreme. Every time you die, your wellness is lowered by 10 points, meaning your maximum stamina and health goes down 10%. Wellness starts at 100 and goes up to 200, but for a new player this is a crippling handicap. Increasing your wellness is very hard to do, as the only thing that really helps is the very uncommon antibiotics. You can cook several types of items together into a pie that will increase your wellness, but during the early game without a farm this is an impossible feat, and the benefit is very small. If you are experienced enough to survive, increasing your wellness will double your health and prevent you from dying nearly as much.Every 7 days a super horde spawns, with many powerful zombies that will see you nomatter where you are. You can not hide, you can not run. As zombies run at night, having a base strong enough to survive their assault is required. Scavanging for and building guns and bullets to fight the horde is an intermediate skill, as you need to mine for coal and potassium nitrate in order to create gunpowder.Now that the positive things are out of the way, here are the negative things. As I'm writing this review during early access, please note that some of these things might change. First off, the wellness system needs some work. Once you die a few times it is nearly impossible to get back to full health. They have attempted to fix this by making it scale to your health, so the lower your health the more wellness you will get but at it's current stage it is still very flawed, and detracts from the game experience. This is especially important for new players, who will find themselves unable to damage zombies or sprint for more than 10 seconds at a time.There are still many glitches present, most notably the fireplace glitch. Sometimes when cooking large amounts of food or water you will lose everything. Occasionally you will duplicate an item. This is a serious glitch that I hope gets addressed soon. I have wanted to quit many times after hording enough food and water to survive, just to see it dissapear before my very eyes. If you have a full inventory, harvesting your crops will result in losing your crops, as harvested plants don't drop but instead dissapear. If you are crafting an item and log out, you will lose everything in your crafting area. This is very bad because certain items, such as TNT, take a long time to craft and you can forget that you are crafting them and log out, leading to a large waste of very precious resources. There are a few other glitches but none of them are noteable here.Another gripe I have is the lack of tutorial or information, similar to Minecraft. Almost everything in this game can be found by playing, but certain things like food recipes and controls aren't very obvious such as the RUST-like opening of doors and fireplaces. It would be nice if they added readable books in the environment to at least address this issue.Also the ingame voice chat could use some work as it does not seem to function well or at all, and communication in a game like this is absolutely essential.My final verdict is to BUY THIS GAME IMMEDIATELY. The develeopers The Fun Pimps are constantly updating this game with bug fixes and new features, but in it's current state it is well worth 30$. I Kickstarted this game because the quality was immediately visible, and it has now become the gold standard of early access in my opinion. I would strongly recommend that you play this with others as the difficulty is rather high, and building / defending a base with friends exponentially increases the fun. If you have ever enjoyed Minecraft, RUST, Day Z, or other similar games like The Forest, this game is a must buy.			"

								After over 1000 hours (on multiple servers) in this game let me point out a few things:Pros:1) Game is fantastic on graphics and building mechanics.  Custom crafting recipes are great. This game has extreme potential to down other survival games. I add the con's in ONLY to let you know what to expect. And some issues my friends and I have seen over the course of playing the game.Cons:1) Privately hosted servers have  kids (the owners of the servers) who it cheat, farm and troll (this is the mass majority).  Friends that have access to the creative menu / console. duping is still possible, even after the A13 B update. Most by our foreign f@gg0t friends dupe, hack, or whatever  (China - see note below).2) A13 update, stll has lots of light leaks, they made it so that if you have to wipe your a$$ you need a schematic for it.  Future plans for ""professions"" (this will probably ruin the game).  Lag is pretty much on every server been on many since the A13 update.- the state of gamers have turned into a bunch of pu$$ies that can't handle the brain power of true PVP. The game itself can't be blame for morons.  UPDATE: they fixed the ability to see through the ground (somewhat).  the chinese f@gg0ts run rapid with cheating which will destroy a server's population.			"

								In depth crafting system with lots of schematics to find and craft. Great graphics! Zombies scare me every time I play. Building things is just as fun as killing Zs, scavenging and blowing stuff up. I am looking forward to questing, NPCs and skill trees. Lots to keep a long time player involved or a new player excited!			"

								Decided to give a little more of an indepth review since there doesn't seem to be many of them.1. Crafting:      - Building: You can craft pretty much whatever you want to build out of. Cobblestone, brick, prick paver for a pool, stone, whatever.      - Traps: You can also craft pipe bombs, sharpened sticks, land mines, use spider webs, anything to help fortify your hold.     - Food: Yes you can make multiple kinds of food though a cooking and items like gas cans through the chemistry system.      - Aestetics: What fun is the zombie apocolypse if you can't have pretty things in your house? You can now craft items (or steal them, and tv's/paintings from rich people), to decorate your house!2. Fighting:     - Players: ALWAYS fun     - Zombies: The way the game is set up the person who hosts (if they choose to host) gets to set the ""difficulty"" This is an actually impressive customized system. The host is able to set anything from zombies: How many zombies, how hard they hit, if there will be zombies at all (thats right you can turn off zombies and other enemies COMPLETLY if you just want a  pvp game) and if the zombies will run or not. It also lets the host decide how the day/night cycle is handled, if there will be more light than dark, etc. Also how many hits blocks take to break, and more. It lets you and your friends (or just you) have a customized experience. For added fun turn down the damage you do, increase the zombie health, make night predominent and turn on running. Oh and increase the spawn rate of  zombies by 200%, really, trust me,  it's so fun.     - Weapons: Many different types of weapons including guns (snipers rifle, shotgun, piston, machine gun), crossbows, melee weapons, or if you're feeling like just plowing through people, pull out a chainsaw or auger.3. Ambience: The background noise for this game is ridiculous. It actually has made me jump a few times. Nothing like being in the middle of a ruined city, hearing the wind blow around you and then..a baby's scream.This game updates VERY often, and really does listen to the community. The developers really seem to care about this game, and i've been very impressed with it so far. One of the biggest concerns I had with this game before I bought it though was the ability to play on a server with JUST my friends. This game lets one of your friends ""host"" a game and load up a server just for your friends, so have no fear! Also an added bonus is the fact you can CHANGE GAME settings whenever you load it back up. All your progress is saved AND you can change it. Finding zombies to much? Easy log out, reload and change it.			"

								THIS REVIEW IS A REPLY TO ANOTHER REVIEW OF THIS GAME. WHICH I TOUGHT WAS UNFAIR. http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197999172691/recommended/251570/""Alpha 9 was the zenith""You mean back when you could rush in the city, get an auger and a sniper rifle (effectively ending the game) and be out before night fall? Not that nightfall mattered back then zombies were so slow and stupid it was too easy to kill them with any melee weapon.A9 was way too easy and became tedious much faster, now you at least have a sense of progression. You can't have everything you need in the first hours of the first day.Dog hordes on the 6th day: why not? Any half-competent player can deal with them with spikes or with a bow. I welcome those dog hordes it added a sense of urgency to what you did prior to day 6/7.Item quality was a GREAT addition, maybe you didnt read the dev's plan for this game but they always mentionned they wanted more RPG features. It prevents you from running into town day 1 and getting every weapon/tool you'll ever need. Gives a sense of progression. Only thing I agree with you here is the ""forge ahead"" book. But they removed that and made the recipe harder, which was a nice move.""In my first few spawns on literally THE easiest, most bludgy settings that still involved zombies I died in under 2 minutes."" Sorry but that's a l2p issue, dogs can easily be outrun and bears can be heard from miles away and give up very fast. No reason you should ever die to them.This review sounds like a lot of complaining for the sake of complaining, a lot of players have adapted their play style and love the new difficulty much more then before. Alpha 9 was the easiest alpha they ever released, it was a cakewalk and you were done with the game by day 7.P.S for all potential buyers, give it this game a try. It's only getting better and better despite what some players, who refuse to adapt, are saying.			"

								Rewriting my review since things have changed.Overall the game is very fun. Very poorly optimized though which is bearable with some tweaking on the graphics settings.The new leveling system they added is nice. Neat little perks to choose from, very similar to Fallout 3s leveling system.Melee has been improved since I last reviewed. Stunning zombies and decaping them is a huge improvement.Gun loot balance is horrible. I hate how every gun is in parts except the rare instance you find a completed gun. Why did everyone decide to take apart their firearms during the apocalypse exactly?The balance would be much better if completed guns were more common with rarer gun parts that are higher quality.

								I have played since alpha 8 and a friend and I rent a server.This game is amazing! Devs are hard working and fix bugs/patch regularly. Easily 10/10 and worth $25. I am convinced that when this game is finished it will be THE STANDARD that other zombie survival horror games are measured against!My friends and I have seen plenty of bugs come and go (glass legs, no 7 day horde, zombies clipping through doors) they have not made us stop playing. when our legs broke every 3 secs we carried splints and coffee. The game is too good to stop. An inconveinient bug is far outweighed by the terror felt when YOU and 2 others are boarded up in a 5'x5' bathroom, crouched with guns loaded and pointed at the door praying the zombies don't break through. If this sounds like fun to you don't hesitate JUST GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY!!!!! You will not regret it (and if you do steam has some new return policy so check that out).o7   Good Luck Survivors!			"

								I bought this game a few days ago and before that i thought it will turn out to be pretty good, and it really is!A zombie survival-sandbox that has a lot of features on alpha stage and is just about to get better.I have found just some minor bugs in my playtime and one of them is the server sometimes just throwing you out, but that's not really a big deal and can be fixed easily. One thing i'm waiting very much is the drivable vehicles and more craftables that surely will come.I don't really have any negative thoughts about the game and i have been playing a lots of games from survival to sandbox and this one is surely on the top-3 on those categories + Playing with friends makes it at least 10 times better than playing single. The other gamemodes are pretty fun too.P.S. I'm at the time playing this game with an average laptop and I haven't come across with almost any lag.30$ Price is totally fine and you should definetly buy it if you are a fan of survival, sandbox and zombie games.

								This game has so much potential. The can't seem to decide what they want to do with the game still so it constantly changes. That is not a problem if the game was not so bug filled. It would be okay if it was minor changes and bug fixes, but they can't seem to decide on the crafting system. I know it is early access but I would recommend staying away until it is finished. I think this game will be awesome if they finish it and fix all the bugs. I can't wait to try a finished version of this game. Until then I can't recommend it.I can't wait till this game is completed. I'm pretty sure my review will change once the game is finished.			"

								Firstly, great concept for a game. Love the mix of crafting with first person shooter aspects, along with the building physics which add a nice touch. Generally I feel a sense of desperation while I play it as zombies whittle away at my defences during the night and I have been scared ****less as those flying hornets that fly straight at my face. I find this game gives me a decent amount of enjoyment and is a good time killer.Unfortunately, these experiences are somewhat dulled down due to a clunky interface and fractured gameplay. This can be mostly forgiven due to it being in alpha stage of development so nothing is going to be perfect, however the price tag is misleading and gives the impression of a far more polished game. £22 is ALOT to be spending on an unfinished early access game, and does not match the experience and features that you will get. I understand that the developers may be looking to boost their funds to continue polishing this game, but £22 is a long shot for a game that has this many issues. I have to admit that if I hadn't seen youtubers play this game I would not have paid as much as I did, and if I had the opportunity now I would rather wait until later on when the game is more complete until I commit myself to buying it.So would I recommend this game? In the future, maybe. In its current state? Probably not. Although it is guaranteed to give you a few laughs and some enjoyment, I would recommend waiting to see how this game unfolds before you part with your cash.			"

								I've been playing this game since the terrain was still blocks and ""scrap metal"" was a thing. That's why it pains me to say I don't think I can really recommend the game anymore. There have been a series of design choices that I just do not see as benefitial, and taken altogether, have been detrimental to the experience.Before I got to the biggest issue, first I should go into combat. I am not sure when it started, but combat has become annoying. Not for the fact it exists, but for the fact it often feels like zombies have a longer reach than you do, or that melee attacks you make against them that should hit do not. It feels like you must get much closer to them than they do to you. That on its own would be a fairly minor issue, however it does not exist in a vaccuum.All too often, you will be suddenly attacked from behind by a zombie that had silently crept up behind you from the surrounding area while fighting others. You are essentially expected to swing around mid-combat and scan behind you and your flanks to see if any other are encroaching. That is, quite frankly, ridiculous, nor from what I recall did it used to be that way. From what I recall, zombies used to make much more noise before, thus making it easier to notice them behind you.Again, on its own, too bad of an issue. So what is it that makes these problems such a big problem? Well, it's two-fold. Stunlock and ""Wellness."" When you are hit by a zombie, too frequently you are stunned. While you can still attack, it reduces more movement almost to nothing. While it may not sound bad to say ""it only lasts two seconds,"" but that is two seconds where you are easily ravaged, quite possibly stunned again right after. That together with zombies that seem to have overly-long reach and can sneak up behind you without a sound, makes for a very frustrating encounter. And god forbid you die.If you did die, you encounter another major design choice that I cannot justify. The ""Wellness"" system. Your max health and stamina are tied to your Wellness, with a base Wellness of 100. A positive trend gives your more health and stamina, and likewise, a negative trend has a negative effect. And, apparently since Alpha 15, a new update at the time of writing this, experience gain is also tied to Wellness.Simply put, it is a semi-permanent punishment (there are ways to increase wellness) for not only dying, but for being attacked, or for being hungry or thirsty. To use a slight exagguration, you are punished for not playing optimally, by making it even more difficult to survive. You died? Then the game will make it easier for you to die again. Quite simply, that is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t considering, again, everything else I have said about the combat.With that out of the way, we come to what I think is the biggest problem with the game. The ""7 Day Horde."" Every seven days, a special horde will spawn nearby your location, or on top of you, and it always detects where you are at. The reason I consider this among the game's biggest issues is it essentially shuts down a nomadic style of gameplay, and it forces the game to be specifically revolved around this particular event, requiring you to establish yourself well enough to settle down and build enough defenses to stand against this horde. And that is all you are ""allowed"" to do. Any time you're spending not preparing for this horde is a waste, and in early game, could get you killed, which you are then punished for. This goes back to what I said earlier, where the game not only wants, but makes you, try to play ""optimally,"" at least in the early game.Just take this recent example. I had a small house built, upgraded the lower portions to metal-enforced wood, and had my door upgraded. These zombies broke through the door within seconds, the zombie who actually broke it down took several headshots from a pistol, only for about four or five zombies barging in through the now-open doorway. Not to mention how totally useless my wood spikes were in that scenario, considering zombies, in general, seem to be attracted to breaking doors. How am I expected to defend against such aggression in so early of the game, only to be punished for dying? Especially considering you have to explore the map for resources, which takes away time that can be spent working on your base. The simple answer is there is no balance to these hordes oncesoever.And unfortunately, the developers have expressed refusal to make an in-game option for this 7 Day Horde, expressing that it is easy to to alter an XML file to turn them off. Frankly, it should be an option, and their unwillingness to do so under an excuse of how easy it is to edit a file, or as some people have argued, ""people want options for everything,"" are just that; excuses. It is a foundational core element to the gameplay now, one that did not used to exist. Thus it is most certainly justifiable to have it as an option.There are other problems with the game that, while small, make for an overall inconvenient experience. The removal of the minimap and hunger and thirst bars on the player's UI, in spite of the fact that the map can be accessed at any time through a hotkey, and hunger and thirst can be seen on the character's inventory screen. Why these are not easily visible on the UI any longer, as they once were, I just cannot see a good argument for.The means of crafting was changed, from a Minecraft-like item-patterns on a crafting grid, to a more generic ""select from a list."" This change in itself isn't an issue, as even before,  you could select from a list and have items auto-placed, however with this update, the menu UI was changed. This is a visual matter, as the earlier inventory screen had a fitting design and aesthetic, while the newer one is bland and without any real asthetic, simply being a very basic menu over a grey background. Even the health and stamina bars look like they'd belong more at home on Microsoft Excel.Overall, while the game isn't terrible, it's presence isn't exactly strong, either. You might find it entertaining enough to justify its costs and compensation over its issues. If you have the money easily available to spend, and you think you may like it, then I suppose try it. However, I personally cannot recommend the game anymore; it simply has too much wrong with it, too many inconveniences, and that is really such a shame.			"

The following is my thoughts on the game after 80.2 hours of playing, current version alpha 11.3 (April 26, 2015)I haven't been playing the game that much nowadays but still enjoy starting a new game whenever I marathon a bunch of podcasts. It's a great game to mindlessly play at low difficultly settings while listening to some crap. ;)The game has been updated frequently and now has some real good looking graphics after updating to Unity 5. Along with the updated graphics comes optimizations. I never get low frames that much anymore even with maxed settings.Still a great game to play.The following is my thoughts and experiences of the game after 48.7 hours of playing alpha 8 through 10.4 hotfix.  (December 21, 2014)My experience has been a little less enjoyable after playing for so many hours straight. Hordes spawn too fast with as much as only 2 minutes between horde attacks even when the game is set to low spawn rates. It's only day 3 on this new world, I don't think they should be coming this fast. But I guess that just adds to the challenge that many say is the proper way to play the game. The game's unoptimized state has never really bothered me that much as I was always able to maintain a good 60 in nearly all parts of the map with settings turned to low or off. The city was where it'd some times drop to 50 and below. But with how fast these hordes are spawning my fps frequently dips to <30fps while they're around making the game stutter and hard to defend against attacks.Even with these issues I'm still going back to the game multiple times a week. It's great watching the game slowly take shape with each update from the dev team!The following is my thoughts and experiences of the game after 22.8 hours of playing alpha 8 through 10.1.  (November 30, 2014)I like it.The reason I had any interest to pick up this game was because of the Game Society Pimps and their videos. If not for them I might of just passed on this game.This is a very fun open world sandbox zombie survival game. It's fun playing with your friends.There are bugs and it's not optimized but as it's still in alpha and these problems should be resolve by the time the game is done.PS - I had a pretty sweet underground base.

								This game used to work, many, many versions ago. After update 14, everything went to hell. Update 14 was the mocap update, adding realistic zombie movements etc. Something about shadows was totally borked, and -NOBODY- could play.So, they fix the update, band-aid it up and everything seemed to be okay, for the moment. I'll be honest I'm not sure what happened between U14-16, but somewhere in there, it was broken again.Unplayable for a LARGE percentage of players now, it just crashes as soon as you load into a world. Doesn't matter if it's SP, MP, or any configuration tweak, it all just crashes. Originally, they were blaming it on out of date drivers, and the cry across the forums was ""just update your GPU drivers"". Sorry, did that, still crashing.NOW, they're taking it a bit more seriously, maybe? I don't know, it's the same bull in a different package, as far as I can tell. They want you to jump through hoops, only to maybe-possibly-probablynot fix your game and jerry-rig it so it can work in single player.This mess is a total joke, and not worth anyone's time and money in its current state. Fix your game, Fun Pimps.			"

								Owned this game about a year now and come to realize.. the game is a waste of money and time.#1 The dogs just keep coming and coming and coming. They spawn out of thin air at same spot for a long♥♥♥♥♥♥♥time over and over again. Highly unrealistic and highly agravating.#2 The server version keeps reseeting its time to 22 days once it hits around 45 days. Its done this twice so far in a row... pointless to keep a server up.. especially when two chinese can coe in and blow up my bass in seconds.. literally, flattened gone.. kaput. Cheatprotection, my♥♥♥♥♥#3. It's just plain boring. Once your base is built.. its mostly game over. No more fun to be had. Not enoughd ifferent creatures. Not enough different pre-built structures to explore. LOD distance on max settins is unrealistic. I shouldnt be able to see ground splat textures abruptly stop from atop a tower. Endge of map is jus an empty space like far cry custom maps. WTF is this? 1999? Use a proper skybox that blends your terrain to be percievably never-ending, fool.#4. Placement of objects is annoying. Ever try repairing wooden spikes ? Yeah.. good luck repairing them all. Most will need destroyed then new ones placed. The colision is way way off on the repair tools for the spikes.I fear these earlt access fames are all mostly the same... boring... buggy and will NEVER ever become a final release.Good money-making scheme though.. dont ever have to make the game fully entertaining.

								Edit :  For those who crack up laughing everytime they  see a negative review from someone with 1800+ hours sunk into the thing, please read the entire review :)Back in the days, before they lost it hard in the last couple patches, i would have recommended this game to anyone, but now, in its current state , i wouldnt recommend it to my  worst ennemy.First of all, this game as THE WORST pvp of all the survival games out there. There are SOOOO many glitches and broken stuff that you can do to enter someone elses base .For example, You can jump 13 blocks away ( yes 13 blocks) if you build wood frames up  to the sky limit  and jump down 200 feet , and you only get a broken leg and lose around 40 hp , dumbest thing i have ever seen in a survival game. You can also dig a hole in the dirt, place a ladder and then see everything underground, all the bases, the players and you can even shoot them :/. You can also dupe stuff, and trust me, every ♥♥♥♥ing noobs out there dupe a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of ammo and guns without working at all. those bugs have been here for a while now, and the devs dont do anything to correct it, so if you want a pvp survival experience, go look somewhere else, realy.Multiplayer lags alot, no matter the rig you have or your internet connexion, its just bad, if your ping is higher than 50 or 60, and theres more than 8 players on the server , expect lag. And the map is so huge that if you play pvp with 8 players or less you will probably never see anyone.The worst part tho is that there is  a stutering problem since alpha 11 ( around a year now), alot of people are complaining on the forums about this problem, the devs  aknowledged it, but even tho this is the most anoying and fun breaking bug i have ever seen they didnt do anything about it so far, even after a year of people complaining (most of us actualy stoped playing since its annoying as hell). i have a gtx 970, an i7 950 3,07hz which is old but still decent, 12 gb of ram and an ssd, and i still spike every 3 or 4 seconds when i run around, which is horrible, and other players with a  better rig then me lag too so its not computer related its in the game itself, go check out the forums to learn more.This game could be amazing, it used to be, but now its simply broken imo and yes this is alpha, but its been alpha since 2014...THis game still has alot of good sides, the cons just outweight it right now The building and crafting system is great, it might be a bit overwhelming at the begining but you have ALOT of choices. Graphics are much better and much more realistic than minecraft, and theres gravity, so you need to place pillars, doors, windows and stuff strategicaly, you can make some pretty complex stuff.It can be realy challenging if you max out the difficulty and theres some servers who made it even harder. Every 7 days there is a red moon during which zombies come at you all night long, wherever you are, they find you ( except if your deep underground maybe). Alot of people leave and rejoin during the day cause they cant handle it lol.The skill system is great too, if you play with friends you can each specialise in something in particular (tool smithing, weapon smithing, mining tools, guns, quicker crafting, workbench, concrete mixing, and much more)The game itself is awsome, i love it and as soon as they fix the stuttering problem i will play it again.But right now, even tho im a huge fan of this game, the stuttering makes it unplayable for me no matter the graphics settings i choose ,even when i put it at its lowest i stutter, and it looks like a god damn nintendo 64 game, i mean WTF, i can play any finished game on ultra settings ( shadow warrior 2, fallout 4, skyrim, and more) and even tho you cant compare an alpha release game and a polished game, if its not playable on the lowest settings even with a decent rig, then its ♥♥♥♥ing broken IMO.

								This game is trash, even if it was free to play you'd feel like you've been ripped off. It's hard to believe that a game with graphics this bad can run so poorly. Even if the terrible looking enviorment and zombies don't bother you, the unstable framerate is ridiculous.The combat system is garbage, probably the worst hit detection I've ever seen in a first person game. A zombie can strike you from 2-3x their arm length. You'd swear it's a latency problem but then you realize you're playing single player. Escaping from zombies doesn't seem possible anymore, they can spawn a few feet in front of you right out in the open.I didn't mind the incredible amount of time between updates when it was actually improving the game. The latest build however seems to have only added garbage that inconveniences you. It feels like 13 was thrown together at the last minute, not something that's been carefully planned out for months.Listening to the positive reviews for this game was a mistake I made. I understand that different people like different things, but some of the praise I've seen this game get makes me think these people have never played a basic survival game in their entire lives.I can't believe this game's price is near other EA games like Killing Floor 2 or Ark: Survival Evolved. This is likely the worst game in EA, it should never have made it through Greenlight.			"

								It saddens me greatly to have to do this. I have been around this game since the days of alpha 8. However I cannot recommend this game in its present form. Alpha 13 broke so many things that didn't need tweaking in the first place. The crafting system is gone (it’s still there but is a former shell of itself) right clicking is gone to search is gone. The whole new interface practically slaps you in the face to break immersion it simply doesn’t fit. It looks like a computer interface it’s too clean almost if that makes any sense. the inventory interface doesn't feel like it belongs in a survival game rather then a down and gritty crafting aspect we are left with something that has all the recipes listed that you can just click on and it auto crafts them for you what did this need fixing ?. Zeds take forever to kill now, and can still hit you from 10ft away. The rate at which you get cold or hot is way off balance. Basically if you spawn in a snow biome or a desert biome you’re hosed. now on to my next gripe.

So why on earth am I having lag spikes and frame rate drops from 60 down to 15 in some areas for no given reasons what so ever. Tried with both video cards then tried with just one still the same thing. I understand this is alpha but hells so is ark and I still manage a solid 40-50 on that on ultra. I love this game i really do I like the concept and up until alpha 13 I loved where it was going. However in its present state I cannot suggest anyone buy it. "

								I played this game quite a bit in alpha 12.5, and while the game still has potential in A13 it is going in a direction I really don't like.Right now, the game is playable, but not intuitive and definitely not new-player friendly.Granted, it was hard for newbs before, but that was due to the hostile environment and enemies ambushing you.Now, in addition to that (and bugged enemies) they also have to fight the interface and system to get anything done. And that is AFTER they've manged to SLOWLY grind their way to the same action speeds new characters had when starting in A12.5! Front loading the tedium to make you EARN to have fun later is not the way to go.Yet one of the more prominent people in the  developer team for this game is very rude, and constantly acts dismissive of many complaints the community has with the game. His fanboys are even worse, and it's frankly sickening to watch.So, why do I?Because the game, at its core, is really good. It is, and it has so much potential to get even better. If this was still A12.5 I'd recommend the game in a heartbeat. But right now it's just not fun to play anymore.I advice you to stay away until the game is completed and judge then if you find it interesting. You seriously don't want to participate in this particular development cycle.			"

Early Access Review
								I am not often inclined to take the time to write reviews, but this game has shaken my apathy. I was intrigued by the trailer and when the game went on sale I bought it. I don't have a true dedicated gaming computer and I can't run the game on the high setting like you see on some of the YouTube videos of this game and I've never gotten my FPS past 30. That being said I love this game.       The up and down side of this game is that it does not hold your hand and tell you how to do anything. The first three days I played I spent in an adrenaline soaked fearfest. After spending the night crouching and doing nothing in my fortified prefab I made some sort of noise and within moments dozens of wicked fast zombie ripped the walls down and tore me to shreds. After logging off in a panic I went to various wiki pages and YouTube to educate myself. After learning the massive crafting system and the all important first day order of operations (check out Oak's Game Room 7 Days to Die tips and playthroughs) I have since been able to make it 7 days without dying consistantly. I have not played much multiplay and no PvP (for me the zombies are enough to think about, thank you) but I can see the draw, especially because once you've had a chance to make a base, mine ore, find and read the books, craft guns and ammo and stockpile food you become a stand alone army. You will go from hiding from the undead to carrying meat around to attract more, allowing you to further cull Zach's population. That chilling fear of ever present death will be replaced by the rush of power as you look down in complete safety as the undead rush toward your stronghold and kill themselves on your redundant defences, leaving you to tend your garden in peace.       Since the game is in Alpha (I started in 10.4) there are still some major changes coming down the road and a few bugs (very rarely crafted items will disappear from the crafting window if you search for something else), but the game is very playable and quite fun. There are plans to make a story with missions and so on, but there is none of that now and it is still crazy addictive. I would recommend checking this game out and helping the developers flesh out this game.			"

								This game was already fantastic in the past, but after the a!! update it has surpassed all of my expectations, and put any doubts to bed!Not only does it now look absolutely incredible, it has become a bit harder to survive the zombie attacks, and the atmosphere has gone stratospheric!There are some early issues with a few bugs since the big update - for me, they have not been game-breaking or much of a problem at all - in fact the opposite, they are barely noticable and do not negatively impact the gameplay.I highly recommend this game - after 642 hours and becoming totally addicted to the early alphas, Alpha v11 has just made it even more unmissable! If you have the balls, get the game! You'll be so glad that you did!On top of that - the devs listen to, and communicate with, their customers.			"

								After putting in better half of 10 hours into this game I will say, it is an all around great game. Everything in this game is either breakable, searchable, or killable (even if the dead is already died). Me and a buddy of mine were walking across a bridge on our way back from scavanging a whole town one day. As we were talking about how excited we were to have gotten all the loot that we found, the bridge started collapsing right out from under us. So much for all that loot. The moral of the story never trust a bridge in the middle of a zambie apocalypse. 9.5/10			"

								So.... I might have put some time into this game so far. Almost entirely on random generated worlds- each start being a unique experience and extremely rewarding. I started with the basics and now I've modded just about every xml file to personalize the gameplay experience even more than the very thorough options they give you in the menu.My wife and I play on a custom server together (that was easily made in about 5 minutes) and we are honestly excited about every update and often check the dev blogs to see what is coming down the pipe. This is not a perfect game. Hell, this is not even close to the finished product they have promised. This is a game that is still in Alpha. But the thing about this game... it's so good and addictive despite the state that it's in and the updates ARE coming, and the development team IS  keeping an eye on the community's ideas and  complaints- that I have faith that when the finished product arrives it will be exactly what was promised. And more importantly, I'll be happily playing while we wait for that day. You may not want to put the money in on it today- I totally get that. But you damn sure want to follow this game so you don't miss the release and what looks to be one of gaming's finest moments.			"

								(See below for Update to review)Ok, I bought this game a while back and have been playing it off and on, almost with each update.  I have to say, that I am very happy with the latest update which provides random world gen instead of the default map. I have about 4 friends that make this game very fun to play since we can work and explore together. I think this game is worth every penny. I consider it like this. Look how much it costs to go to a movie..... Or even buy a good blu-ray.  Now consider how many hours that keeps you entertained.  Then consider that this game can keep you happy for even just a 25 hours (I believe it will be almost 200.) You can see that it is quite a bargain. Then on top of it, you can restart it with another random generation map and play again. How can you beat that?UpdateSo, now that I have almost 400 hours, I feel I need to update this review.I now believe that this is one of my favorite games of all times and I will list the reasons why.Positive reasons.1. This game provides a well balanced survival experience.  Food and water, shelter and defense.2. The graphics while not spectacular, are on par for a game of this much content in my opinion.3. This game does not force you to join a server with other players.4. This game can provide a single player, local LAN or even public server experience.5. The game has a wide variety of difficulty.  From almost too easy, to insanely impossible.6. Regular updates and news from the developers, as well as screen shots of upcoming content.7. Structural physics, no floating blocks or seemingly impossible constructions.8. New atmospheric conditions and weather system. I love it, adds a whole new level of ""creepy"" to the game.Wants.1. More animals - Deer, rabbit, pig, and bears.  I hope they put more into the game.2. More diversity in weapons - The guns are plenty diverse, but maybe a few more melee weapons.3. Travel options - Motorized bike coming soon, but maybe a car or truck too.4. More trap options, or possibly mechanized or spring loaded traps.5. Power - Electricity for lights, cooking, maybe an electrified fence.6. Objective oriented goals - Not necessarily quests, but some sort of goals other than survival would be nice.7. Leveling perks and possibly attribute points that affect combat, crafting, survival traits.Other thoughts.This game is well worth the price asked by the devs.  I believe that I have never had as much fun in any triple A titles.  I was lucky and got the game during a sale and to be honest, the sale discount they give is substantial unlike some other big name titles that only offer a 5 to 10 % discount and only that because it's been out for 2 years.Hope this helps make the decision for you.(Update November 2016)So, I have been playing this game so long now it should be obvious by now that I find the game worth it just by the amount of hours I have put into it. If that doesn't convince you, the just read my review above. I am a little disappointed that the Devs seem to be slowing down on developement here but I understand that it's not always easy to put in all the things you want to put in. It's still worth it's price in my view.			"

								I've really been enjoying this game. For an early access game it's extremely entertaining, and has a lot of features, and constantly gets updated. As with early access games, it's lacking features or has certain gameplay issues. It falls under the zombie survival genre, with added aspects of crafting and building, and does all of those much better than similar games.The zombie aspect is very well done so far. The early game is very enjoyable and challenging. The hoards every 7 nights, as well as wandering hoards, keep more passive players challenged. High value areas with higher risk make the difficulty enjoyable. Different types of zombies make a much better zombie gameplay, though I really do hate the way dogs are. I find the current issue is being able to finalize a base and move into the late game. Going into the late game means there is very little challenge, as you've set up a fantastic base with access to many resources, and very low risk of ever being overrun, basically the zombie aspect becomes weaker. Leaving a crafting and building experience as the focus. As an alpha, that could very well be changed and would make this game even better than it already is. The crafting and building aspect of the game are decent so far. There are a good amount of block types for different stages of the game, and different types of buildings. Making a decent progression for base building. Crafting is done well so far, but I feel there is a lot of room for improvement. The RNG of needing certain books to unlock things can be very fustrating. Progressing with techology of tools and items progresses a little too fast, and slow, depending on the stage of the game. More depth would be very nice. Overall crafting and building are solid, but have lots of options and room to grow as alpha goes on.The issues it currently has are the very basic form of random generated maps, though it's a newer feature. There is a low number of Points of Interests / unique buildings. Though they are adding them regularly, and currently the core buildings are all great. I would really like to see a ton of new buildings combined with a better random generated system to make a better game. Regardless there has been good progression regarding this, and I have high hopes for the outcome.The game is not the most stable and plenty of people complain about fps drops around certain things, or with too many zombies. Though personally my pc is very good and handles it well enough. Overall this game is good with lots of room to become really amazing.			"

								As someone who has never played Minecraft and still has no interest in it, it's strange that I have taken so quickly to 7 Days to Die. Perhaps it's because I enjoyed playing games like Left 4 Dead, but found the linear approach to the game boring. In 7 Days to Die you can survive the zombie apocalyse in the way you want to! You can be a nomad roaming from town to town, baracading yourself in buildings on the 7th night and not worrying about the place getting trashed. Or build a fortress-like base that you never leave, except to explore. Or build a nice little house to live in, but a bastion somewhere nearby to retreat to.However, I think it's the multiplayer co-op that makes the game for me. There's nothing better than raiding a town with your friends, hoping to find something special. It's going to get dark soon? Well there's one last house to raid, I've got this feeling there's an SMG schematic in there.Definitely worth getting when on sale. Probably not worth it on full price if you're going to play solo.

								I do recommend this game.  ----First id like to start with the negative things though (i know its a bit backwards)The dev team can be kind of finicky at times, they tend to break things in attempts to fix it, only making things more frustrating. For example they took out the viability of melee combat in comparison to ranged, i dont know why because it was in no way overpowered as you still needed tons of meds and bandages. They do realize the issue ... but wont fix it for a very long time from now(alpha 13 to be exact). i dont know about you but melee combat not working in a zed survival game is really bad. HACKING it is real... and it is alive, i dont know what the devs are trying to do to stop people from hacking but it is bruuutal, your house, everything you worked for can be gone in the blink of an eye to a hacker so beware. An easy fix to stop hackers is to disable creative mode, i know a lot of creative people would be upset and all but us online players dont like getting hacked on(i speak for us all) .Other than that of course there are the usual alpha complaints, be ready to deal with constant wipes and at times stability issues, they are easy to overlook unless you are some architect that likes spending all their time on building something pretty. --- As for the positive, The game is pretty and is getting even better over time, the environments and the textures, variety of weapons and crafting. Its super fun especially when played with a good community or even just 1 friend. the variety is just so huge you never know what you are going to find. i do recommend playing it on hard or feral though or else the game is kind of too easy. The sheer potential of this game is enormous and with every large update you find yourself in a somewhat brand new game.           HAPPY HUNTING!!!PS. They added this thing called gore blocks recently and its god aweful and i hope they fix it, at first it made sense that zombies dead bodies could pile up causing others to use them as a +1 elevation platform, but the way the devs implemented it is poorly executed in my opinion.

								After about 30 hrs. of play I can say this is my favorite zombie survival game. I have seen some reviews compairing it to Minecraft, they must have been a bit of time ago because the game has come a long way since then. The land and items are no longer blocky. Hills are a nice and smooth incline and you don't have to jump constantly to navigate it. The crafting system is great. Some things, like the stone axe (whice normally is the first thing / weapon / tool that you make) can be crafted from the onset of the game. Other items you have to find the recipie and learn it to be able to craft the item. There is also a time element in the crafting, depending on how complex the item depends on how long it takes to make it. The good thing is that if you need to craft a lot of something, like say arrows, once put the items in the grid and start the crafting you can close your inventory (which is where the general crafting grid is, there isn't a crafting table) and the items will keep crafting. It's great especially when you have a group of zombies on your tail and you run out of crossbow bolts. There are several forms of crafting in the game but I will let you figure those out.The zombies, in my opinion, look and act pretty darn good. There is a nice amount of zombie models and they look good. What might put some off is that even though there are a good amount of different models of zombies, each specific zombie looks the same. The big fat zombies look all the same, no variations. That is no big deal to me, the rest of the game more then makes up for it. The zombie animations are good as well. Sometimes they might act a bit wonkey when traversing an obstical, like when they are stuck in a spike trap they have a tendency to hop and hop. They are creepy as hell when you have a bunch of them shambling towards you and completely terrifying when they are running straight to you (if you have them set to run) with arms out stretched. If you do have them set to run at certain times of the day, the game gives you a great sense of urgency. You know you better be inside somewhere before they start running because you will be dead if you don't, unless you are armed to the teeth.The devs are great. If the community askes for something, they try to put it in. If the community then decides they really don't like the change they take it out. I have never had the oppretunity to talk with the devs, but everything I have seen on the fourms shows that they listen to what the community.This is my first review and I hope that it has helped some. If you are still on the fence check out some reviews or let's plays on your favorite video site. But if you like zombies, get this game. If you like crafting, get this game. If you like getting the ever lovin crap scared out of you when you are holed up in the attic of a house and the zombies are outside tearing the house to pieces and you know any second the house is going to collapse, then GET THIS GAME!!!!

								Pretty fun game overall. It really likes to go for that mildly extremely unsettling feeling with the new sounds. Also seems to like a low polycount, but that makes it slightly more unique. Apparently there's no 5.1 or 7.1 surround, so I never know if a zombie is behind me or not. Also, cleavage. Lots of it, the devs like it I guess.			"

								In most survival / building games the building is lackluster.Not so here.There are building physics. (this ain't Minecraft)You actually have to use your brain when putting your Awesome House Of Blocks together!Also there are many block shapes. Wedges, corner wedges, inside corners, plates, poles, pillars...You can build something that isn't square and design elaborate death traps for zombie hordes.You can play SP and play by whatever rules and at whatever difficulty you want and there are many servers, often with mods and custom rule sets, to choose from. Mine is modded quite heavily because the vanilla game is a bit... alpha. But it's getting there.			"

								After playing this game I have decided that it's tons of fun, basically minecraft with gravity and similar graphics to the RUST game Facepunch made, its pretty great. Of course since its still in the alpha stages of the game there are several bugs that need to be worked out before it's finished, but that doesn't mean that the game isn't worth getting. Make sure you have someone to play with though or else you may die of a heart attack >:DEDIT 1/26/2015The devs seem really absent, as in not much has been updated in the last year or so that I haven't played. Its fun, and it's a great idea, but there are tons of things that need fixing.Zombies are OP - given enough time they will punch through any material, Even reinforced concrete. They also have a habit of chopping down entire buildings and burrowing under your base. Every 7 days there is a feral horde, which is impossible to survive on your own. It will also destroy any and all progress that you have made with your base if you aren't ready.The price should be lowered - Its still an expensive game, rarely ever goes on sale. It hasn't even left alpha yet even though its been out for a couple years.It can be fun, but I'd hold off on getting the game until a bunch of things are fixed.			"

								I have had this game for a couple of weeks, and have played nothing else since getting it, and am likely to play nothing else for a long time. This is everything I ever wanted in a game, maps that just keep going, fully destructible environment, zombies, and girls with bikinis. The crafting is a million times better than anything in Rust, the atmosphere is amazing. I think the Rust Dev' team should just walk away quietly, and bow politely to the Fun Pimps team.  8 members of my team have this game, and we are playing PVE, on a Random Gen' map, and everyone is loving it. Get this game. I will give you one tip for this game. If you find something made of Brass, keep it, even from the very beginning of the game. You will find out why.			"

								Love this game ever since the alpha 11 update, game got very boring quickly prior to this update, now that things have quailty, it has replayability now, and you cant cheat end game stuff unless you have had it at one point (creative mode, I mean). From what I have read, its kinda sad that they will be doing away with singleplayer, but I understand what they mean by that. If I had to complain about one thing: Please, fix invisible planes/airdrops! I take it upon myself to spawn in a airdrop on me via console commands because of this, every time I hear a invisible plane fly by at noon.			"

								I've struggled a lot with my opinion of this game because there are some *really* good things about it.  There are also some *really* bad things about it.At this exact moment in time, the good outweighs the bad.Pros:+ Crafting system is really polished.+ Progression from nomad to established base owner is fun, natural, and works really well with the game mechanics.+ Multiplayer with friends feels like a totally different game.  It can be an incredible experience with the right friends.+ Zombies are smart enough to pose a risk to the uninitiated, but dumb enough that you can fend off huge groups of them if you plan ahead.Cons:- Very poorly optimized.  I have an i7-4770k and a GTX 980 and running on max settings gives me 20-30 FPS with regular dips into the low teens.  I can get display-capped 144 FPS consistently on much more graphically-demanding games.- Bugs.  Dear lord, the bugs.  Expect things to randomly go missing.  Expect to die without any apparent cause.- The developers (and fans) seem openly hostile to bug reports or any kind of legitimate criticism of the game.  Its early access state is routinely used as a blanket apologetic for the game's problems.  Stay away from the game's official forums and subreddit.  They are both cancerous echo chambers.In summary: play it -- but go in with the knowledge that your experience will be far from perfect.			"

								(See below for Update to review)Ok, I bought this game a while back and have been playing it off and on, almost with each update.  I have to say, that I am very happy with the latest update which provides random world gen instead of the default map. I have about 4 friends that make this game very fun to play since we can work and explore together. I think this game is worth every penny. I consider it like this. Look how much it costs to go to a movie..... Or even buy a good blu-ray.  Now consider how many hours that keeps you entertained.  Then consider that this game can keep you happy for even just a 25 hours (I believe it will be almost 200.) You can see that it is quite a bargain. Then on top of it, you can restart it with another random generation map and play again. How can you beat that?UpdateSo, now that I have almost 400 hours, I feel I need to update this review.I now believe that this is one of my favorite games of all times and I will list the reasons why.Positive reasons.1. This game provides a well balanced survival experience.  Food and water, shelter and defense.2. The graphics while not spectacular, are on par for a game of this much content in my opinion.3. This game does not force you to join a server with other players.4. This game can provide a single player, local LAN or even public server experience.5. The game has a wide variety of difficulty.  From almost too easy, to insanely impossible.6. Regular updates and news from the developers, as well as screen shots of upcoming content.7. Structural physics, no floating blocks or seemingly impossible constructions.8. New atmospheric conditions and weather system. I love it, adds a whole new level of ""creepy"" to the game.Wants.1. More animals - Deer, rabbit, pig, and bears.  I hope they put more into the game.2. More diversity in weapons - The guns are plenty diverse, but maybe a few more melee weapons.3. Travel options - Motorized bike coming soon, but maybe a car or truck too.4. More trap options, or possibly mechanized or spring loaded traps.5. Power - Electricity for lights, cooking, maybe an electrified fence.6. Objective oriented goals - Not necessarily quests, but some sort of goals other than survival would be nice.7. Leveling perks and possibly attribute points that affect combat, crafting, survival traits.Other thoughts.This game is well worth the price asked by the devs.  I believe that I have never had as much fun in any triple A titles.  I was lucky and got the game during a sale and to be honest, the sale discount they give is substantial unlike some other big name titles that only offer a 5 to 10 % discount and only that because it's been out for 2 years.Hope this helps make the decision for you.(Update November 2016)So, I have been playing this game so long now it should be obvious by now that I find the game worth it just by the amount of hours I have put into it. If that doesn't convince you, the just read my review above. I am a little disappointed that the Devs seem to be slowing down on developement here but I understand that it's not always easy to put in all the things you want to put in. It's still worth it's price in my view.			"

								I do recommend this game.  ----First id like to start with the negative things though (i know its a bit backwards)The dev team can be kind of finicky at times, they tend to break things in attempts to fix it, only making things more frustrating. For example they took out the viability of melee combat in comparison to ranged, i dont know why because it was in no way overpowered as you still needed tons of meds and bandages. They do realize the issue ... but wont fix it for a very long time from now(alpha 13 to be exact). i dont know about you but melee combat not working in a zed survival game is really bad. HACKING it is real... and it is alive, i dont know what the devs are trying to do to stop people from hacking but it is bruuutal, your house, everything you worked for can be gone in the blink of an eye to a hacker so beware. An easy fix to stop hackers is to disable creative mode, i know a lot of creative people would be upset and all but us online players dont like getting hacked on(i speak for us all) .Other than that of course there are the usual alpha complaints, be ready to deal with constant wipes and at times stability issues, they are easy to overlook unless you are some architect that likes spending all their time on building something pretty. --- As for the positive, The game is pretty and is getting even better over time, the environments and the textures, variety of weapons and crafting. Its super fun especially when played with a good community or even just 1 friend. the variety is just so huge you never know what you are going to find. i do recommend playing it on hard or feral though or else the game is kind of too easy. The sheer potential of this game is enormous and with every large update you find yourself in a somewhat brand new game.           HAPPY HUNTING!!!PS. They added this thing called gore blocks recently and its god aweful and i hope they fix it, at first it made sense that zombies dead bodies could pile up causing others to use them as a +1 elevation platform, but the way the devs implemented it is poorly executed in my opinion.

7 DAYS TO DIEFirst off, this game runs like a Zombie. It's in early access and you will see odd things. I'm not talking about seeing Walking Dead, rotting corpse, dismembered body parts. I'm talking about early access bug issues and glitches. Nothing atrocious, although they are there and this leads to the graphics. The graphics are almost as bad as zombies themselfs. Graphics comparable to around 10 - 15 years ago.So what is the massive appeal with the masses?Gameplay.7 Days To Die has the most outrageous gameplay. You are thrown into a Zombie Apocalypse with nothing except boxer briefs and you must survive. By any means, SURVIVE.Basicly you begin as a Neanderthal and carry youself to modern technology by scavenging, hunting, crafting, building, etc, etc. All the while Zombies want to crash your party and eat your brains and THAT is what throws your game off.No matter what you are doing, you will be looking over you shoulder. You will be listening for that familiar Zombie moan. You will be watching the clock. (Don't stay out after sundown.) This all adds up to some intense surviving.How many days will you survive, before you die? "

Early Access Review
								I've really been enjoying this game. For an early access game it's extremely entertaining, and has a lot of features, and constantly gets updated. As with early access games, it's lacking features or has certain gameplay issues. It falls under the zombie survival genre, with added aspects of crafting and building, and does all of those much better than similar games.The zombie aspect is very well done so far. The early game is very enjoyable and challenging. The hoards every 7 nights, as well as wandering hoards, keep more passive players challenged. High value areas with higher risk make the difficulty enjoyable. Different types of zombies make a much better zombie gameplay, though I really do hate the way dogs are. I find the current issue is being able to finalize a base and move into the late game. Going into the late game means there is very little challenge, as you've set up a fantastic base with access to many resources, and very low risk of ever being overrun, basically the zombie aspect becomes weaker. Leaving a crafting and building experience as the focus. As an alpha, that could very well be changed and would make this game even better than it already is. The crafting and building aspect of the game are decent so far. There are a good amount of block types for different stages of the game, and different types of buildings. Making a decent progression for base building. Crafting is done well so far, but I feel there is a lot of room for improvement. The RNG of needing certain books to unlock things can be very fustrating. Progressing with techology of tools and items progresses a little too fast, and slow, depending on the stage of the game. More depth would be very nice. Overall crafting and building are solid, but have lots of options and room to grow as alpha goes on.The issues it currently has are the very basic form of random generated maps, though it's a newer feature. There is a low number of Points of Interests / unique buildings. Though they are adding them regularly, and currently the core buildings are all great. I would really like to see a ton of new buildings combined with a better random generated system to make a better game. Regardless there has been good progression regarding this, and I have high hopes for the outcome.The game is not the most stable and plenty of people complain about fps drops around certain things, or with too many zombies. Though personally my pc is very good and handles it well enough. Overall this game is good with lots of room to become really amazing.			"

Having fairly minor experience with free world survival games, playing Rust previously, I had a fun time... but it was missing something, you could get your bases all nice and zombie proof, and essentially player proof within a few days, it became a sniping fest after a little while.Early access 7DTD however had me screw up fairly quickly, found some unboiled water, promptly drank it while dehydrated and began vomiting everywhere. Found some meat, and had some walkers on my butt within moments. Soon after, I noticed a giant Wasp, which cottoned on to my existence and stung me to death.Now, after that whole death spam, I made it into a derelict metropolis, noticed a lovely building with plenty of easily exploited areas for drop pits, pungees, and all round safety for my scaredy-cat self. I went out after the first night had finished, hearing sounds of a plethora of walkers that wanted my tasty flesh and took axe to skull... got overwhelmed, and died. Nobody looted my corpse, so that's a bonus. I then began constructing my ultra-secure, 4 story building repairs. Not a soul made it into my place alive. I began making high powered weapons, and had a very great secondary and tertiary base, all nice and cosy, away from dogs and wasps. The downside being: your bases only have 1 mattress over all bases, so, essentially your respawn may not actually be anywhere near your homebase (really, I'm just an idiot and didn't realise soon enough).PROS:Super duper easy to kill yourself from things like - water, food, rancid food. Get drunk.So. Much. Space. I literally ran for DAYS attempting to reach end borders, or other signs of civilization. I found a few rebar drop fortresses but that was few and far between.Zombies are smarter than the average bear - they can sniff you, they can hear you.When night comes, an immense sense of oh shi~ begins. When you get weeks into survival, you can still get mobbed by ever increasing intelligence.Respawning gun safes, cabinets, book shelves; which all allow recipes and blueprint discoveries - so fun collecting whole sets!Playing with friends, especially new friends on vent, TS, Skype etc. is hilarious when they're trying to find you and hilariously get mobbed to death before you arrive.CONS:While the Zombie design is cool, there's a lot of rehashed skins, there's little variety to actual Zombies - essentially bruisers, fast walkers, slow walkers, and occasionally a bloat type... Dogs suck balls.Wasps suck even more balls, especially without some kind of Crossbow/ Gun on hand.Underestimating falls and leaps; easily gib yourself...Sometimes dogs and wasps can warp into your shoeboxes (if you're out on the hunt and need a safe area to die if you're too encumbered).Climbing Zombies, which I guess is technically a pro, because they also show you your base flaws.Overall, I really enjoy this game, it's too bad I don't get to play it more, really. P.S. While there are a dime-a-dozen free world Alpha Zombie Survival games, this one does have a certain, I don't know what that really tickles my fancy. "

I can't wait and really looking forward to seeing where this game goes in the future. Plus I will be buying any DLC that comes out for this game as well and one day would love to see it get to that point. And much love to all the people the helped this game get to the point at where it is now. I will be telling my Payday 2 crew about this game as well and there are a good lot of us, lol.

								As someone who has never played Minecraft and still has no interest in it, it's strange that I have taken so quickly to 7 Days to Die. Perhaps it's because I enjoyed playing games like Left 4 Dead, but found the linear approach to the game boring. In 7 Days to Die you can survive the zombie apocalyse in the way you want to! You can be a nomad roaming from town to town, baracading yourself in buildings on the 7th night and not worrying about the place getting trashed. Or build a fortress-like base that you never leave, except to explore. Or build a nice little house to live in, but a bastion somewhere nearby to retreat to.However, I think it's the multiplayer co-op that makes the game for me. There's nothing better than raiding a town with your friends, hoping to find something special. It's going to get dark soon? Well there's one last house to raid, I've got this feeling there's an SMG schematic in there.Definitely worth getting when on sale. Probably not worth it on full price if you're going to play solo.

								I didn't have high expectations for this game, but decided to buy it based on some reviews I saw. I must stay that I'm very happy with the purchase, because the game is awesome. I haven't played other games like this one, so I don't have anything to compare it to. Pros:The game is intense, yet the building aspect gives a nice contrast.The building system is really coolSingle player is fun, and I can't speak much into multi player but if you know people who play it I imagine it's a blast.lots to learn, and challenging. You can customize the game to the difficulty level that you enjoy.Devs keep coming out with updatesCons:There are a few glitches. A couple times my leg broke for no apparent reason, but it didn't happen enough to be a real problem.The ladders could use a graphics updateUpdate on 10/23/16They fixed the broken leg glitch, so that hasn't been an issue. This is easily one of my fav games. I just enjoy the challenge of holding off zombies from breaking my base, building cool structures, and under ground tunnels.			"

								After playing this game I have decided that it's tons of fun, basically minecraft with gravity and similar graphics to the RUST game Facepunch made, its pretty great. Of course since its still in the alpha stages of the game there are several bugs that need to be worked out before it's finished, but that doesn't mean that the game isn't worth getting. Make sure you have someone to play with though or else you may die of a heart attack >:DEDIT 1/26/2015The devs seem really absent, as in not much has been updated in the last year or so that I haven't played. Its fun, and it's a great idea, but there are tons of things that need fixing.Zombies are OP - given enough time they will punch through any material, Even reinforced concrete. They also have a habit of chopping down entire buildings and burrowing under your base. Every 7 days there is a feral horde, which is impossible to survive on your own. It will also destroy any and all progress that you have made with your base if you aren't ready.The price should be lowered - Its still an expensive game, rarely ever goes on sale. It hasn't even left alpha yet even though its been out for a couple years.It can be fun, but I'd hold off on getting the game until a bunch of things are fixed.			"

Totaled station.This game is amazing and is updateing very often, I got it back afew versions ago and I can say there is no regret on getting the game. The combat is nice, slightly repetitive but is addicting with the way the world is so dynamic and has plenty of things to do. When you go scavanging in high value places such as a gun store or a market of some kind, bring guns, and tools that can break locked doors, if you dont, You will be cornored, waiting for dead. Everything is manipulatable and I dont see why you wouldn't want this game. I met a actaul community once and they literaly had walls, houses that were all well built, and even jobs to ""earn your keep"". One last thing, Make a axe, Conserve ammo, aim for the head, and when night comes... DONT look back...			"

								This game, although still in early access has too many positives for an early access game. It is one of the best games I have ever played.Pros-Very simple crafting system-Very good frame rate-Good base building mechanics and good physics system-Hard to survive, which is good for a survival game-Tutorial at the start of the game which sets you up perfectly and gets you familiar with the game-Good variation of zombies and biomes-Wide variety of weapons and defenses-Every 7 days there is a massive zombie horde which is a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of funCons-Takes a long time to craft certain things-Takes a long time to gather materials-Water. You are boned if you want to swimThis is honestly one of the few early access games which is actually worth a buy. If you have the cash and the time, I would buy 7 Days to Die as 9 times out of 10 you will enjoy it until you die.			"

								Right now, I have over 50 hours put in so far, which about 60% of that time spent in Single-player, and about 40% of that time spent in Multi-player. Long story short? I recommend 7 Days to Die in its current state (Alpha 15).To be fair, starting basically naked, alone, and in unfamiliar territory, is not a new concept. Yes, there are other games that start this way, set in a post apocalyptic world overrun by zombies. Yes, there is food and water needs. Then there is the crafting, and base building, etc we have all seen before.So what does 7 Days to Die exactly bring to the table to set it apart? I generally hate tower defense games if that is all they are. However, when it is coupled with other genres in the right way, it adds much more to depth to some games. I like playing survival games, as I prefer the added challenge, but rarely do they present a challenge. Most of the time the challenge is dealing with the people that are being ""raiders"" more because they are just bored with the game from lack of a challenge. Then 7 Days to Die comes along and says, ""what if the game was actually a challenge and we try to kill the player?"", and try to kill you it will.Sight, sound, smell, and in some cases just existing are enough for a zombie to want to kill you. Some can climb walls, others can call more zombies, and some that sense you through walls simply because you have a pulse. Add in disease, climate, food, thirst, killer bears, zombie dogs, and collapsing structures for a touch of fear. Oh, and the zombies during the day are Walking Dead speed, but at night go full on 28 Days Later Usain Bolt chasing you fast.To top it all off, every 7th night a ""Blood Moon"" occures where a ""Blood Horde"" spawns at night intent on killing you. Yes, they are still fast, and no you cannot hide (well you can, but it's not that simple).After my first night, I was intrigued because I've never died on the first night in a survival game. Yes, I even survived Don't Starve for several days the first try. Then I hopped into a co-op game with the friend that gifted me the game, and we barely managed to survive our first ""Blood Horde"". By that time I was really getting into the game, and after passing Day 14 in both single-player and multi-player I was positively hooked.System Specs CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790K Processor @ 4.40GHz CPU Cooler: Corsair H100i GPU: GeForce GTX 970 G1 Gaming Memory: Corsair Vengeance 32GB OS: Windows 10 Pro "

								Bought this as a bit of a gamble as I very rarely buy early access games and it was on sale.Best £7 I've ever spent. The game is hard to describe but it's like a cross between Minecraft, Left 4 Dead, Skyrim and State of Decay. You can craft weapons, armour, tools, clothes, ammo, medicine, food, water in fact practically anything in fact as long as you have the ingredients and the knowledge to craft the item. Some items you already know how to craft right from the start like a bow and arrows, boiled water and charred meat, others like steel you need to learn during gameplay.You'll start off in a ""safe zone"" where no zombies have spawned and it will stay that way for 5 in game hours (as of alpha 15). Use that time wisely to craft your starting gear which you'll find the ingredients for in your starting area, stuff like stone axes and plant finer clothes, a wooden club and a bow and arrows. This stuff is absolutely  vital to have before the zombies start spawning at 12 midday in your starting area and everywhere else once you leave the starting area.The game map is vast. It's made up of different areas know as biomes, they are pine forest, oak tree forest,  burnt forest, wasteland, desert and snow. The best ones for a noob are the pine and oak tree forest biomes. Avoid burnt forest and desert until you're more experienced apart from passing through or if you want some yucca fruit and aloe Vera plants which are in the desert biome. Avoid snow biomes due to the cold weather and lumberjack zombies who are very powerful when you first start.  Avoid wasteland biomes like the plague, this is the hardest area on the entire map, expect very harsh conditions,  very little plant life and a lot more zombies as well as the ""special"" zombies that spawn in the wasteland, you'll also have to deal with zombie dogs that can kill even an experienced player if you're not paying attention. You'll have until 10pm if you set the game to 18 hours of daylight before nightfall (highly recommended). During the nighttime you'll want to be inside a prefabricated building, on at least the first floor up and destroy the bottom part of the stairs. This is because at nighttime the zombies start running like in left4dead and can be hard to spot if you happen to outside at night. You can also make your own base but for your first night or two a prefabricated building is fine, just make secure it's secure. From day 2 or 3 though you'll need to start making your own base or fortify the prefabricated building you're in.So you're probably wondering why it's called 7 Days to Die? Well, on day 7 and every 7 days after that at nightfall (so 10pm on day 7 and so on) there will be a blood moon. You'll know it when you see it. You need to be in your base by 9pm at the latest otherwise you may get caught out by the lack of light or what comes next - a zombie horde. They will be running (unless you've set them to walk) and they can sense you no matter how well you hide (with a few noteable exceptions) so you'll have to fight them. They will also keep coming until dawn. Be prepared with plenty of arrows for your bow and prepare yourself by drinking and eating just before the horde arrives.Overall I highly recommend this game.

								Best survival game I have played! So many possibilities, so much items! I love the crafting system, love the unlimited base building, you can even build under ground! I love that part so much, Alpha 15 just landed and I like the direction they are going! it keeps getting better, more items are introduced, content wise this game is perfect, BUT performance wise it is awful. It is sad that I can't enjoy the game due to poor frame rates... from 60 (v-sync on) it often drops to as low as 10.. In the cities I have stable 60 but in the forest only 10? where nothing is happening? That greatly impacts the enjoyment..6/10 those -4 points goes to performance.. content and gameplay are absolutely great.			"

								Surprisingly good... I was really sceptical at first, but as one of my friends gifted the game to me I would loose nothing by trying the game. After seeing trailers and screenshots, my expectations were incredibly low, but after the first 5 minutes the game grew on me. the Atmosphere reminds me of Fallout 3 and the game world is incredible. This game is more akin to Minecraft than anything else. The vast amount of content and the satisfying gunplay keeps me going, and I LOVE the RPG elements... I am a sucker for exp and leveling. There are servers online which you can join for PVP but the most fun I've had is playing solo or co-op with friends. Your character, which you can make any way you wish, is saved as a profile to be loaded in different worlds (no items and levels transfer, only appearance). Crafting and building is extensive. Mining far into the ground and exploring underground caves is just as much fun as exploring the huge cities. There are many blueprints and schematics to find, and there are tonnes of ways to play. If you like survival games but want to stay away from all the hectic PVP, and just loose yourself in a postapocalyptic world, building bases and min-maxing supplies... then this game is for you. I give it an 8/10.			"

								Bought this as a bit of a gamble as I very rarely buy early access games and it was on sale.Best £7 I've ever spent. The game is hard to describe but it's like a cross between Minecraft, Left 4 Dead, Skyrim and State of Decay. You can craft weapons, armour, tools, clothes, ammo, medicine, food, water in fact practically anything in fact as long as you have the ingredients and the knowledge to craft the item. Some items you already know how to craft right from the start like a bow and arrows, boiled water and charred meat, others like steel you need to learn during gameplay.You'll start off in a ""safe zone"" where no zombies have spawned and it will stay that way for 5 in game hours (as of alpha 15). Use that time wisely to craft your starting gear which you'll find the ingredients for in your starting area, stuff like stone axes and plant finer clothes, a wooden club and a bow and arrows. This stuff is absolutely  vital to have before the zombies start spawning at 12 midday in your starting area and everywhere else once you leave the starting area.The game map is vast. It's made up of different areas know as biomes, they are pine forest, oak tree forest,  burnt forest, wasteland, desert and snow. The best ones for a noob are the pine and oak tree forest biomes. Avoid burnt forest and desert until you're more experienced apart from passing through or if you want some yucca fruit and aloe Vera plants which are in the desert biome. Avoid snow biomes due to the cold weather and lumberjack zombies who are very powerful when you first start.  Avoid wasteland biomes like the plague, this is the hardest area on the entire map, expect very harsh conditions,  very little plant life and a lot more zombies as well as the ""special"" zombies that spawn in the wasteland, you'll also have to deal with zombie dogs that can kill even an experienced player if you're not paying attention. You'll have until 10pm if you set the game to 18 hours of daylight before nightfall (highly recommended). During the nighttime you'll want to be inside a prefabricated building, on at least the first floor up and destroy the bottom part of the stairs. This is because at nighttime the zombies start running like in left4dead and can be hard to spot if you happen to outside at night. You can also make your own base but for your first night or two a prefabricated building is fine, just make secure it's secure. From day 2 or 3 though you'll need to start making your own base or fortify the prefabricated building you're in.So you're probably wondering why it's called 7 Days to Die? Well, on day 7 and every 7 days after that at nightfall (so 10pm on day 7 and so on) there will be a blood moon. You'll know it when you see it.

They will also keep coming until dawn. Be prepared with plenty of arrows for your bow and prepare yourself by drinking and eating just before the horde arrives.Overall I highly recommend this game.

								=HEADS UP=I had a review before this one about the game being good. This stays of course but i had to clarify some points and fix this old messy review that i made before.=INFO ABOUT THE REVIEW=1. This review might be a bit longer.2. This review is about my point of view and opinion. [If you disagree on a certain point or want to correct me: Be reasonable or i will ignore your comment.]=REVIEW=This game is just amazing. Lets start with that and go right to the first point. Most of the Zombiesurvival games promise you so many things. They promise you a great Craftingsystem. They promise you that you can build your own base. They promise you intense gameplay and that you have to stay on your toes all the time.And most of the time we do not get what we pay for. We do not get the great Craftingsystem. We do not get the cool buildings. We dont have to watch out or get killed in one second because the game is so unbalanced that you literally cant stay alive long enough to even get some kind of weapon.This game is different. Before the actual danger begins you have a full day, that you can configure (more of that later) of getting supplies up to build or just barricade you. You might be even able to find something really usefull in a nearby house or little village. And you might even be able to find a higher tier tool. And that is important. With A11 we got a new system for the tools. The longer you play the better you can craft your tools. The better you can craft the better the tools get. More damage to a block or enemy. More durability and such. But you can also find them. That will help you greatly in some cases. If you are at the beginning the pickaxe and the axe in good quality can help you greatly. Without you will have to go on just like normaly and take what the game gives you.But you have to be fast about what you are doing since there are Zombies everywhere and it is slowly turning to nighttime. But what happens when the night hits? Well lets just call it literally Hell. The Zombies begin to run and with that i mean every Zombie. On the hardest settings they are even able to sense you in your base through the walls and begin to break down the blocks you have placed or the blocks that are naturally in place.You have survived your first night? Congratulations. But this isnt over. Because now you have 6 more days. 6 more days to die on the 7nth day. And why? Well you remember that this is a horde survival? Well make sure that you are ready to face the horde. Not to speak of the infamous ""Day 14"" horde. That was a nice time when i suddenly heard... Oh wait i shouldnt tell you more. Heh Heh.But now we should head to the performance of the game. For my personal prefference the performance could be better but it still isnt bad. My PC is decent and so are the parts and i get a good 40 up to 50 fps with higher settings. The newer Unity engine makes the game even more beautiful than it was before. But what about the settings?Well of course you can change everything you would need. There are some things that i would love to have implemented but the game is not finished yet so we will see what comes in the future. But lets go over to the main settings that you have to set up your game.First you have a selection of which world you want to use. You can choose between the handcrafted world they present with the game and a world that is randomly generated. With both worlds you can configure everything else about it though. Like if you want a longer day or night. Or if Zombies should run at all. How hard the game should be for the world and so on and so forth. You can change everything that is important about the gameplay.			"

								Right now, I have over 50 hours put in so far, which about 60% of that time spent in Single-player, and about 40% of that time spent in Multi-player. Long story short? I recommend 7 Days to Die in its current state (Alpha 15).To be fair, starting basically naked, alone, and in unfamiliar territory, is not a new concept. Yes, there are other games that start this way, set in a post apocalyptic world overrun by zombies. Yes, there is food and water needs. Then there is the crafting, and base building, etc we have all seen before.So what does 7 Days to Die exactly bring to the table to set it apart? I generally hate tower defense games if that is all they are. However, when it is coupled with other genres in the right way, it adds much more to depth to some games. I like playing survival games, as I prefer the added challenge, but rarely do they present a challenge. Most of the time the challenge is dealing with the people that are being ""raiders"" more because they are just bored with the game from lack of a challenge. Then 7 Days to Die comes along and says, ""what if the game was actually a challenge and we try to kill the player?"", and try to kill you it will.Sight, sound, smell, and in some cases just existing are enough for a zombie to want to kill you. Some can climb walls, others can call more zombies, and some that sense you through walls simply because you have a pulse. Add in disease, climate, food, thirst, killer bears, zombie dogs, and collapsing structures for a touch of fear. Oh, and the zombies during the day are Walking Dead speed, but at night go full on 28 Days Later Usain Bolt chasing you fast.To top it all off, every 7th night a ""Blood Moon"" occures where a ""Blood Horde"" spawns at night intent on killing you. Yes, they are still fast, and no you cannot hide (well you can, but it's not that simple).After my first night, I was intrigued because I've never died on the first night in a survival game. Yes, I even survived Don't Starve for several days the first try. Then I hopped into a co-op game with the friend that gifted me the game, and we barely managed to survive our first ""Blood Horde"". By that time I was really getting into the game, and after passing Day 14 in both single-player and multi-player I was positively hooked.System Specs CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790K Processor @ 4.40GHz CPU Cooler: Corsair H100i GPU: GeForce GTX 970 G1 Gaming Memory: Corsair Vengeance 32GB OS: Windows 10 Pro "

								I have been in this from the beta.This game started off as a typical Voxel game and over time has molded into a very luscious game. Regardless of some gamers reviews cause they fill they didn't get the game they wanted I'm reminding people this is the developer's game not ours, altho we do have some influence on some things that get added and done.The Fun Pimps have taken and made a Zombie game that is customizable to many play styles.There version is mutant zombies and such where as us gamers are allowed to remove them or turn off certain things and change things to suit our own Zombie Apocalypse by simply changing info in some XML files.I've opt in almost every Zombie game out but 2d zombie games an this 7 Days to Die is the only one I've personally didn't feel like I got ripped off or burnt on.What to look forward to that makes it different than any other zombie game. It is solely based on the Zombies and you and not making the Zombies a static object. Most all Zombie games start out making a Zombie game but shortly in they all focus way to much of the game on player interaction with each other turning them in a player verse Player survival game and the zombies are like grass and trees cause people fear the player more than they do the zombie. The brain then stops thinking of the Zombie as a threat and looks out for the player instead. You become to busy looking for charlie to jump out you ignore the real focus of a zombie game and just dodge the reason you started to play the game.With 7 Days to Die this is not the issue. TheFunPimps have focused the game on player survival and the Zombies. This has drawn some tension in the community of pvp players being vocal saying pvp is broken but what is pvp? Player Vs Player anything outside of the player hunting player becomes static it's all about kill and don't be killed. You don't see people play a pvp game to stand around and talk.If you play solo or coop with friends it is the best Zombie game out that has stuck to it's focus on making the Zombie the threat and survival.I recently saw a post talking about how ugly the graphics was. If you go back in kickstarter days at the very beginning you saw a minecraft clone with better assets. As this game developed the voxel minecraft look and feel started to vanish. The polishing of the game has just made it better and better. A lot of people still live in the 32 bit world and when you dealing with voxels you can not be there. TFP have tried hard to not do like AAA games and other Voxel developers have done and stopped trying to make it work on 32 bit systems and told their fan base 64 bit or nothing. They still try to bring it to the 32 bit world so they haven't forsaken them.Some of the developers are very active and even have started to do let's play showing off game footage of upcoming updates we will see. They put up with some really hateful remarks and people asking for everything under the sun yet maintain their cool. It is a amazing group of guys and a amazing Zombie game you shouldn't miss out on. Alpha 15 Experemental was put up today and I can tell you it is Gorgeous just Gorgeous.All the op stuff tweaked to be right on track now, Zombies screamers working better than ever to point they had me on my roof for 4 game hours till I starved to death lol. This game just gets better and better every alpha phase not understanding why some give it a bad review.This Game has replay value over and over and over and when with friends it has the same replay value. This is a game that is not only fun to play with other but solo as well. Can't wait to see the rest of it done and it going gold by 2017 spring time which is the final goal cause it is almost at the end of it's alpha.What are you waiting for? If you like sandbox and fun with self freinds or kids this is the game for you.			"

								So yes, the graphics are pretty meh. Considering games like Ark which have some of the same abilities (chopping trees, rocks, etc) but feature MUCH better graphics, it does feel pretty behind the times in that regard.And the sound design/mixing is some of the worst I've ever had to endure in a game. Is that a zombie chewing directly on my skull? Or at least the wall? No, it was my friend on the other side of the lot opening a box. WOA was that the ENTIRE TOWN EXPLODING or no, nevermind, just a tree falling down, ok. Also I'm not sure why picking up rocks or hitting trees with an axe sounds like someone getting funky with a leather suitcase. Devs, I would definitely recommend hiring someone professional to spruce up the sound design...it's an incredibly powerful, relatively easy way to make a sub-par game feel AMAZING.Anyway, moving on.All that aside, the core of this game and why it's amazing is having the ability to build whatever you like, and having real genuine purpose for it. You NEED to develop a proper home base with regular food and water supply. You HAVE to fortify against attack. You MUST devise better traps and defenses to survive the 7th nights. It's extremely satisfying to have a construction game with actual purpose! The only other game I've played like this was Terraria with its blood moons.So, all in all, highly recommended. Having at least two or three people in a game makes it much easier, since you can watch each others backs while you work. :)			"

								First game I know of, where you can interact with the whole enviropment you see, plant crops, make corn bread, and do all the other things needed to survive. It's the first game that I have ever been so much interested in. You can dig down, build up in the sky and explore unlimitedly huge random generated world with hundreads of places to see. And all the time while being hunted by ever increasing hordes of zombies.  It is huge. This game has its own genre. It's not FPS, FPS is just very small part of it. Its real time strategy in part.Building game - if you choose to build. Its as much sandbox as possibly anything can be. You have total freedom , world to explore and new adventures every time. Its still alpha, but I know no other alfa so completed already from the start. There are people with more than thousand hours of playing time already.			"

								I should start by mentioning that this is extreme early access and is buggy as hell. So if you're not cool with that, better bugger off.If you wanted a game set in ""The Walking Dead"" universe, minus the people. This is it.You clear out a house, it's perfect. There's a gunsafe, beds, food, a fridge, multiple exits, the works. Then it gets over run and you're back on the road.Find another house, clear it out. Same deal, suits your needs. You see a far off explosion. ""Oh boy"" you say as you go to investigate, could be anything really. Then you see it, a huge camp surrounded by Barbed wire and Landmines.Loot the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the joint, set up the defences around your own house, live out your 7 days sitting on the balcony watching zombies get blown to♥♥♥♥♥♥Day 1I've set up camp in a large 2 story house. It's fantastic. I have 5 guns :DDay 2House got overrun, 1 of my guns is broken and i'm out of ammo for the rest.I've found another building, it looks like an old garage (Y'know, like a repair shop)It's quiet in here but it's filthy and dark.Day 3I don't know how to craft a damn thing, i've sacrificed 2 of my remaining guns for scrap iron so i can make myself a pickaxe.I went scavenging today, raided 3 houses and a campsite. Nothing much was found, mostly food.I have too much food.Day 4God damnit. Today sucked, i'll start with the morning.Mined for a bit, killed some zombies, survived a horde, started farming blueberries, normal stuff this morning. Then I found a gas pump out the back, because I'm a god damned fool, I shot it. It exploded, blew up half the building and destroyed my gunsafe which had everything in it :/All I have is 1 hunting rifle, my pickaxe, some boiled rabbit and a torch.I'm moving.Day 5I've been searching for a house all day. All I can find are tents. Tents suck. I finally settled on a little tent next to a huge building. I wanted the building but jesus christ the place is crawling with zombies.It's a decent tent, i made a door and blocked up the windows, it will have to do until i find a real place.The last 2 days were awful, man :(Day 6GOD DAMNIT. It's the middle of the night. I just wrote the diary for day 5 and went back to playing.Y'know how I mentioned that I was a damned fool? I PUNCHED THE WINDOW IN MY TENT (Yes it had glass pane windows)This may not seem bad to you but the game has gravity. The entire roof fell down.I've had this tent for 5 minutes.Went hunting, killed a few rabbits and a pig. Cut down some trees, started melting down some iron to make a gun safe. I want one because I need storage and gun safes are the biggest kind.I started building a little shelter across the road  from my campsite. I hope I can build a huge base eventually. I'll start a fence tomorrow/So it's about to tick over to Day 7 and a giant bee thing flew up to me. It was obviously an enemy because it was marked on the map. I shot it down with my hunting rifle. It didn't drop anything or even leave a body. I'll look it up on the wiki because I've never seen one before and i'm tripping out right now.Edit: Hornets. It doesn't say anything about them being rare so I don't know why I only saw my first one on Day 6Day 7I hope this game isn't literal and I actually suvive today.So I went for a walk, found some guns in a building down the road. Nothing much else.Today was very uneventful until I got attacked by a zombie and got infected. Of course, I didn't know I was infected until I did some research.Thankfully you can craft antibiotics and fix it.Unfortunately that's not easy.I needed to scavenge some moldy bread, some potassium nitrate powder and a beaker then cook it on a camp fire.I had no beaker or bread. Crap. I've got the camp fire and the potassium nitrate from cracking open some rocks though.So I bolted to the nearest building I hadn't touched and bang! 2 beakers and 3 guns. Nice!On the way out the door I accidently pressed 'E' to search some garbage and you'll never guess what's in the garbage. Mouldy bread.I couldn't beleive my luck. I cooked it up right then and there, took my meds and went on my way with some left over. Today was a good day.I logged off before the sun went down so I'll edit later.Edit: Nothing major, cooked a bunch of meat and some more antibiotics, which was lucky because I got infected again :/Day 8This morning was boring as hell, I just cooked and stuff. Still haven't built a new place for myself. Tent's just fine. In the middle of the day a huge♥♥♥♥♥horde moved through my camp. Like 40 zombies man. I have screenshots to show for it. I killed them all and was looking for anything useful on their bodies when I heard a plane fly over. I looked around and saw it drop 2 crates! I bolted to the first one, nothing major, bandages, food, 2 antibiotics. Then I went over to the second crate. Medical supplies for days: 50 antibiotic pills and 20 bandages. I'm in heaven.Night's coming as I write this. I'll keep you posted.So another horde attacked. On the same day. It as even bigger this time, I think. I took another screenshot but I had killed most of them beforehand.Day 9Another horde attack in the morning, nothing major today. Made some leather clothing, collected heaps of water because I didn't have any. Planning on starting a farm.The tent is pretty much wrecked.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is the game I have been asking for since I first started playing zombie games, back when Left 4 Dead 2 was still new.At first I was skeptical, thinking it looked like just another Minecraft-like clone. However, after watching Markiplier and LordMinion777 play it, I decided to give it a shot.Within minutes of playing, I already became addicted and wanted to play more.My two best friends also recently bought the game and we decided to try it out together. At first it was a little rough, all of us were spawned so far from one another and it took us a while to meet up. We did have to start over a few times until we got a hang of the game. But once we were able to group up and figure out a plan, we were able to get a grip on the basics farily quickly.This game is alot of fun and well put together. The zombies are actually scary (esapecially at night), the different biomes are amazing and well put together and the survival is a bit of a challenge but fun.One of my favorite things is the consequences for your actions. Most zombie games you just charge it, weapon firing and if a zombie got too close you would just lose a bit of health that could be replenished with a health kit then you carry on. But in 7 Days, zombies are more of a threat for you not only lose health but can get infected, bleed or even break bones, each of which require something different to heal you. I also like that you to be weary of what you are carrying and what you are doing as some smells and noises will attract more zombies.Overall, this is a great game so far and I can't wait to see what the next update will bring.A few things we are looking forward to:1. Possibilty of cars- cars would be helpful for scavenging far from camp or if one person has a broken leg and can't run.2. Weather effects- this could make the game more of a challenge3. Zombie bears- I'm not looking forward to this one but my friends are...A few suggestions we have:1. Add more wildlife that may be huntable, such as birds, fish, etc.2. Clans, groups or tribes that you can create and join3. Silencers for weapons 4. Tripwires, trapdoors, etc for setting traps  "

								A really well-constructive zombie game, giving you the option of playing solo or going to PVE/PVP. This game goes from crafting out of any way possible to get the item you desire; while still trying to maintain hidden from the zombies lurking around (which have special abilities as night emerges). I really enjoyed exploring the map even though i died almost 11 times to finally understand how almost everything works. The crafting is great, the experience is great, but just like every other game, there are some flaws. Here are some pros and cons:Pros:- The lot of changing settings is enormous, you can literally change things on how you want it as far as how gruesome the zombies are and etc.- Endless possibilities of random maps.- Great crafting and building system (able to construct and reconstruct anything)- Loot respawn ( Searching around for items can sometimes give you pieces for a nice weapon such as a shotgun)- Hunt/Plant ( Animals sometimes lurk around which you can kill for food or crafting materials, also plantation is available)- Unique zombie experience ( Zombies are able to sense; either from you making noise or having food that attracts them. Also the zombies are able to run fast when night hits)- Great developers and feedbackCons:-Dated graphics ( This is still on alpha)-Zombies are a bit gruesome at night, you can't outrun them as their stamina exceeds yours 3x as much =-=.-Bad community ( Just like in Rust and Dayz, You will always find a phsychopath trying to kill you)-Map design ( Just talking about the map showing you the world, hard to find houses and such with a map like that)-Lag? ( Seen people complain about this. This game runs fine to me though)- Reset ( As the game goes through updates you will find your saved game wiped out, need to start fresh)- Bugs ( Still in alpha so expect it). This are some bugs to look out for though:Breaking a leg when falling/jumping 4ftObstacles sometimes standing in your wayUnable to look at inventory or map for a few minutes. ( Happens to me not too often but still does)I haven't played much so this review will be updated as i go along exploring the game and looking for bad or good things about it. It's a really fun game overall, i had fun playing it. You will die alot as you learn about the game but it will be worth it. Went from living on a self-dugged hole to a house that i'm at recently, secured with a wooden door and a couch for extra protection, i say that's an improvement lol.			"

								This is my favorite game in my library.  Hours upon hours exploration. Tons of things you can craft. Zombies can either be a challenge or non threatening, depending on how many you encounter. If you take on a horde, make sure you are geared and full of ammo. Even if you are geared to the top, a zombie horde could still tear you apart. Apart from the occasional hackers, admins of the servers usually take care of the problem pretty well. This game is a must own. If you like survival, crafting, zombies, horror, friends, sunlight, guns, crossbows, dogs you don't want to pet, exploration, sand, snow, trees, water, caves, rabbits, the sky, grass, a stick, etc. You'll find it in this game.

								I'm not sure what everyone is complaining about bugs so much in what is released as Alpha.  This game runs fine for me and my friends who play on a private server.Yeah A12 removed all the exploits that made the game easy.  It made it so you can't loot epic gear at level 1.  It made the game harder.  This should be percieved as a positive.  It's a survival game, not minecraft.  If you want the minecraft experience I hear Microsoft paid several billion dollars to provide that for you.I recommend this game.  It's enjoyable and VERY playable even for an alpha.  I'm afraid of what will come in final release....and I'm looking forward to confronting that fear =)			"

								I deliberated long and hard about which early access survival game I wanted to buy. It was a choice between H1Z1, DayZ, Rust, The Forest, Stranded Deep, 7 Days to Die and Miscreated. I watched nearly a hundred Let's Play videos and read countless reviews before settling on 7 Days To Die. At first I thought it would be a tacky Minecraft+Zombies combo, but 7 Days to Die truly captures the spirit of zombie apocalypse fiction and survival gaming. The primary selling point for 7DtD is the ability for players to construct their own narratives based on their actions and experiences within the world. After 18 hours, the folks in my server have been building and scavenging and forming a community together while having to deal with zombie hordes and the environment. If I were to record everything that happened and write a script for a television series based on the events in our server, I dare say it'd be better than anything the writers of The Walking Dead could come up with.Also, the anti-cheating system and the PvE servers give players space to play the game without getting trolled, camped or hacked by other players. In short, the experience is complete and immersive without unnecessary or fun-killing interruptions.Is it worth $25? Indeed it is. In less than 24 hours 7 Days to Die has become my favourite zombie survival game of all time. Looking forward to years of continued developments and added content from The Fun Pimps!			"

								Worth the price. Its a better version of Minecraft and a better optimized version of DayZ. So 2 games in 1 for 23 euros! Buy it now until it leaves Alpha.It's a good game with good mechanics, the crafting system is awesome and it feels like a complete game, even if it's Alpha.TFP is one of those developers that actually PUT time in an EA, and aren't lazy fatties like the DayZ team or The Stomping Land(a great concept, but poorly executed. The dev just got the money and left). Even Rust went into a downhill now. The only good survival EA in my opinion. Yea, you heard it. 7DtD still remains one of the best survival games out there. Oh, and The Reign of Kings is cool as well, but it's poorly optimized at the moment.Go rekk some Triple A scrubz, TFP !(BTW: It's kinda sad to see that 7DTD got more players than Advanced Warfare xD)			"

								I have been playing 7 Days to Die since update 1.5- just after Kickstarter and before Steam. Through this time the developers have been busy keeping the game updated, fresh, and in a constant forward motion.There have been tons of changes over this last year- not all of them were successful or well received- but through it all the devs have constantly listed to the community and kept true to what they, and more importantly, what we want.As update 10 is fast approaching I wanted to just write a little review and express my thoughts on this excellent title and to recommend this to anyone that has been hesitant, or has put this off. If you have not gotten this yet- what are you waiting for? Do yourself a favour and grab this up and move forward to a better game and let yourself be heard.**UPDATE**With update 16 fast approching it is time for another update- The devs have been super busy since update 10 and the game feels like a new game. With update 16 there comes a slew of new content including electricity and more building functionality. With December almost upon us it is time for the Steam sales again- this is a must have and will make a great stocking stuffer!Akiic ToDaHead "

								I was looking for a zombie themed survival game that I could delve into with my brother for a long time. I've played some other games with similar thematics but none come close to what this game has. If you tweak your settings a bit, you can have the gameplay most suited to your style and every new playthrough feels exciting. I've played since alpha 7 or so, and I'm very pleased with what alpha 9 (and just now 9.1) has brought us. All in all - buying this game for me and my bro was money well spent cause it just keeps getting better, thanks to dedicated developers.EDIT: 2 years later, the game is even more amazing and I now run a server for 10 people. So much new stuff with alpha 15, we're probably going to be playing this for a while :)			"

								I don't really get all the hate this game is getting in these reviews.  Are their bugs?  Sure?  Are their issues that need attention: yes.  Overall though my experience has been a positive one playing this game.  I love the environments, exploring and building are very satisifying in general.  Night time does get a bit berserk but I suppose you could just put torches everywhere.  If you keep the area lit up zombies are weaker and only walk.  Anyway if you like zombies, and you like building stuff like in Terraria or Minecraft, then you will probably like this game. They just lowered the price point as well so you can get it for 25 instead of 35 which is kinda nice.			"

I have also never seen such an active developer, posting weekly updates on the game development.Enjoy hours of zombie slaying, exploring, crafting, building and trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world in a game that continues to deliver. I have tried most of the zombie survival games on steam like DayZ, Miscreated, H1Z1, but 7 Days to Die is a clear winner for me.			"

								Having played 339 hrs of 7 days to die. I am totally in awe of what the fun pimps have produced. Ever since watching The walking Dead I have been totally into Zombie games. & when a good mate showed me this game I felt personally the search was over for what I was looking for. It has everything I was searching for. Building, killing walkers, Destroying things (blokes best friend) I totally can not wait for the final product to be released.As I see it the fun pimps & the developers & all those involved deserve a great big ty &  hats off for the brilliance they have created. Yes it is still Alpha & early access but the play & all bout the game & play are totally worth it. Not to mention your say is heard loud & clear by the team at fun pimps. Issues & problems are dealt with instantly & everyone is very helpful in finding a solution.I do emphasise this game is still being developed & there are bugs & wil be bugs from time to time. But that is what early access is about. The chance to be involved with something amazing does not come around alot. & I believe 7 days to die will be just that amazing. the final product will show the hard work & great listening from the team at the fun pimps. If you only by one game in your life I would def recommend it be 7 days to die. PS: The Fun Pimps thank you :)			"

The game has a real factor that especially appeals to me, those “feral hordes” that arrive every 7 days are terrifying. I’ll sum it up simply, buy this game, and you will be beyond satisfied.

								I am reviewing this game based on the Early Access version as of 5/27/14 - My playtime on this account is not representative of my actual time with this game - I like 7 Days to Die. The game works as advertised and has a great track record of consistent and substantial updates. Personally, I find the zombies to be a little tough to kill and the zombie dogs to be a bit overkill but if you like your survival zombie games more on the challenging side then this should appeal to you. Lots of things to craft, building a fort and surrounding it with defenses is a good time. You can even mine for ore like that one game (you know which one). Playing with friends is fun as well and I have not had any large issues with lag or network connectivity. The only negative thing I can say about this game, which isn't so much the game itself but the Early Access aspect of many games, is that you will play it and get tired of it long before the game is completed. Again, this is my opinion. This is a solid game as is right now and it is good. But that just makes me want to wait to play it until I can get the full experience.  So while I have spent a significant time with the game and it's systems, I have not tried to dig deep into the games meaty bits.Overall, I would strongly recommend a purchase; especially if you have a buddy or two to survive with.

								I got this game thinking of how nice it is and i thought it was fully relesed. When i heard it was just in alpha I said,""It gets better!"" 10/10 best zombie survival crafting game out there. There are a few bugs like getting your legs broke for no reason but it is still a great game. I like that there are different biomes and everything is breakable. Single player sucks; I would recommend playing pve with friends on multiplayer.			"

								I'll start with the negative since that seems to be what most people read reviews for, but stick with me because following that rather short woe, I'll do my best to convince you to buy and play this game.Firstly, the bad: The Single Player Experience. The game, being an early access game, is going to toss you the occassional bug. A zombie that spawns far too close (see, ""Right on top of you"", p. 46), terrain that doesn't generate, a building that decides to collapse while you're in it, etc... If all you ever experience of this game is the single player aspect, these bugs might be considered game-breaking. After all, you're your only hope for survival - so getting screwed over by something that seemed unnecessarily random and cruel might be a touch rage inducing, and even if you do survive long enough to do something decent in regards to food, shelter, and resources; you're only ever one update away from being forced to roll a whole new world and start fresh. On the whole, the game is still worth playing, but single player does it a large disservice in it's current condition.The Great: Multiplayer. Maybe not ""Hop on a random server"" multiplayer -- but find a couple friends and take on the world together. With more people to share in the work necessary to not only survive but thrive, you'll do better than you could have ever hoped to in single player, and much faster. This takes the edge off when you're eventually forced to roll a new world - and, in fact, allows you to look past the initial bitterness of losing that awesome fortress you and your friends spent the past few weeks on because, ""Hey, this new alpha build has more building types, merchants, and drawbridges!"" When starting over isn't such a burdensom task, you can actually step back and appreciate WHY you're being made to start over and recognize that this game keeps expanding; bringing you more and more content all at no additional cost. The Awesome: The devs run youtube channels, post on their forums, and interact with players all the time - so if you're interested in staying in the loop about what changes are coming in the future, you actually have that ability, unlike most other game studios out there (you know who you are)... By being active in the forums, you may even be able to test drive alpha builds before their released to the public. The devs also seem genuinely interested to latching on to good ideas they receive from the community and, if it is at all within the realm of their capabilities, implementing those ideas into the game.In short: Good game, Good Community, Good Devs, Free Updates that would probably be sold as DLC if made by someone else = Recommended Game.

								I only had this game for 2 days and i have played it 15 hours already. The ammount of detail for a Alpha is really great, ther is alot to do in the world as it is. (Alpha 9)In the video it looks cheesy like some old game from 2k, but its not, it is really smoth and the melee and gun physics are pretty good. The crafting system is really great, it needs some tweeking but even as it is its very useable and easy to understand.Only thing i dont like about it is that the zomies can break into your home even if you line it with coblestone. and thats just stupid, they would be punching with there wrist bones untill they break or they bleed out and die if it weas real. Oh and also the Zombie dogs should attack everything including zombies not just the player, they would be feral afterall.This is one of the VERY FEW games i have paied full price and not regreted. and i own more then 500 games on staem so thats saying something.Oh also it is Very stable. i have had NO crashes or even glitches execpt for things that would happen in a alpha, like clipping through the odd wall. and i run Windows 8.1 x64 and my wife runs Vista x64 and it works on both great. 100FPS+ (25FPS if alot is going on)Also CO-OP works... So many other games even after there launch dont work like dead island, but this game works in Alpha, to me that says these developers are better them alot of AAA companies.PS whoever dont like this review is just a negative nancy.

								7 Days to die is a zombie horror survival sandbox roleplaying game that has a amazing gameplay for your common zombie player. Personally i think 7 Days to Die has a perfect landscape and format and considering in minecraft like survival tactics it can be a real good time. The match of zombies and sandbox make a good mix in this sort and this looks like the NEW Dayz towards me or at least an inhanced Unturned. I would give 7 Days to Die around 8\10 Good Job			"

								There are a slew of sandbox, zombie survival, and crafting games available these days and out of all those I would have to say that this game stands near the pinnacle of them all. Although still in Alpha, as of 06/13/15, this game easily could be in Beta and in most other cases I believe any other dev probably classify it as such. The game runs fluently, even on a crappy laptop if set to easily adjustable lower settings and a large majority of the gameplay is functional. With this in mind there are obvious bugs present and lots of things that need work but it is still in development and the vigilance of these devs more then compensate for continuing bugs as well as new ones that arise when each update occurs. Overall, it's exactly what it says in the title, it is ""The Survival Horde Crafting Game"". And with devs that back the game and take some pride in their work I would definitely recommend it for those who want to have a quality game with guaranteed improvements in the future.			"

								This is the game all of us zombie fans have been waiting for.  Even now, as the game is still in its alpha stages, it feels a lot like a completed project.  It picked up where Minecraft left off and focuses on what's important for the pure zombie enthusiast:  survival in an open post-apocalyptic world... plus the ability to create and craft your own defensive structures and weapons.  Clearly more advanced than Minecraft, it incorporates construction physics and a next-generation voxel-based system which is a joy to play with.And of course it is multiplayer! One thing my friends and I enjoy doing is taking a few days to build up our fort.  Then, when we feel satisfied with our defenses, we'll turn the zombies on full throttle to test our barricaded abodes against the raging hordes.The amount of customization of settings in this game is quite phenomenal and it shows the development team is passionate about creating an experience which everyone can enjoy.  This also extends the replayability of this game into the hundreds or thousands of hours.  And with mod support coming down the pipe apparently, I can only imagine how this game might be transformed into the future.  Thank you Fun Pimps for a glorious game that will leave a long-lasting impression on the zombie survival genre for years to come.  This is a must buy for every hardcore zombie fan.			"

								7 Days to Die is a very good sandbox/zombie game especially when played with friends. I play this most days with my partner (she loves the game and plays very little else). The feel of the game is very good and the night times can be truly intense if you caught out in the open, and even in your base when a full horde comes it can get very intense.Things I like:- Building is pretty solid at the moment, especially if you install one of the modded recipe packs- Defence is a lot of fun and you can be very inventive- Cities are great fun to raid provided you don’t go in guns blazing- Graphics are not bad for an indie though with alpha 11 it looks like they will get a major update- Combat is straight forward and feels about right in my own eyes.- Crafting system is good again is event better with the modded recipe packs I Have not played on public server's so can’t give a review of them as we play on our own private serverThings that could do with a bit of an update:- Building variety/biomes feel a little repetitive in random generated maps, a modded prefab pack improves the buildings but the zones still feel a bit cut and paste at times. Alpha 11 will be changing the random gen so this may well change very soon.- Need to add some prolonged goals other than getting the Sniper Rifle/Magnum, yes this is a sand box but still needs some long term things to work for - skill system may fix this to some extent but they need to add some areas that are a lot harder to loot/get in to until your better skilled/equipped or something.- Mining/chopping feels a bit slow but this is probably to stop people destroying your base to fast on PvP servers.Overall for an alpha this is a very good game that I would recommend to people as a must buy, I know there are probably better looking games but the feel of this game just sits well with me. It is so much better with friends than solo this I cannot stress enough.			"

								as far as zombie apocalypse games go, this is by far the best one out there, i have 250+ hours of gameplay in it, been following this game for years and it is awesome, i prefer playing with friends on a server, but even in solo play its a great game, might need a bit of wiki to figure everything out at first but if you played minecraft the building part is easyone of the later updates added(one of many things this is) a bow to replace the crossbow as your first weapon, i love the fact that the projectile aint flying straight forever, in logic and reality there is something called gravity, even thou it took me ages to learn to hit with this i love how they keep it realistic, the crossbow got more expensive to make, and in all fairness it should be since it is truly a great weapon, i go for it really early and i keep it to the end-game :D silent and deadly it is a must have for any scavenger of towns.Allso the new quality system works great, it gives a hole new challenge in finding proper equiptment and makes it so much more important to not go out and die with your gear on, unless ofc your server lets you keep everything when you die :D :D :D depends a lot on server sittings^^Speaking of server sittings, while i prefer to keep it simple when it comes to these things becouse people allways ask ""what sittings are you playing at"" and no im not gonna list it, couse the settings list here is really big, there is options for everything and more, so every player can have a challenge without hitting a brick wall^^Speaking of Challenges, i have tryed a sh*tload of zombie apocalypse survival games, and 9/10 ends out being about pvp becouse the zombies are to easy and boring, well if you feel the zombies are to easy, just raise the setting to make them harder, i garantie you can get a challenge, and i garantie if your settings it made to give a challenge, you will hide or die when the night comes^^Cons/Downsides?well... theres a lot of running... but next patch should take care of that... bikes or whatever they come up with :)while there are a lot of different human zombies, and dogs, and some sort of giant bee freakish things, i do sort of miss a bit more, but then again... next major patch should bring bear and other creatures in zombie editions.... im gonna stay out of the forest from now on haha...graphics... yes they could use a loving hand, but hey, minecraft does fine and 7D2D looks a lot better than minecraft :D :D :D however its all about gameplay, not about graphics ;)my conclusion is that the only true downside is that its a Early Acces, i prefer games that are finished, if you play a while, and then cross a patch, your savegame might be broken... but its a rarely happening thing, so not that big of a problem if you truly like the game^^ the upside is that new things keep coming, so when you grow tired of the game, you can put it away for 3 month, and then bring it back for another round with lots of new stuff^^I recommend this game for anyone who likes to kill zombies, build shelters, search for treasure and so on and so on.... auctually just buy it allready... get 2 while your at it :D :D :D			"

								First half of the first week : I sneak my whole way through houses, town halls, grocery stores and I try to avoid zombies as much as I can.Second half of the first week : I sneak around town like the first half, but I have a crossbow now! I kill every zombie I see.Second week : I made myself guns and made the zombies feel sorry for ever stepping on ma lawn. Shooting rounds at imaginary birds to get the zombies to come my way.10/10 would shout ""Get off ma lawn!"" again.I highly recommend this game. Even though 7 Days to Die is still in alpha stage development whenever I was playing it felt like if it was further than alpha stage development. The gameplay feels really complete. Of course there are some bugs/glitches but players have to understand that the game isn't over, not even close to being over. I really enjoyed my experience and look forward to playing with friends even more.			"

								This game has all the core features I have come to think of as desirable in a game.- co op lan and online- can build stuff- can destroy stuff, fully destructable is great- has tough enemies, but lots of control of difficulty settings- is challenging and rewards creative thinking- 3d world, fps and looks good for alpha- extensive content, with more to come (story missions etc)How does this game differ from say minecraft, well it's not blocky, the enemies are tougher, more varied and make more sense, (things dont teleport), the atmosphere (post apocolytic) feels more visceral.It can often feel intense and demands that you work out what to do and prioritize what to do to survive.Of the cons - there are some minor bugs and some things that don't look or work quite right, which it appears the developers actively work on whilst also refining and expanding the game. I recommend the game if you like this style of game. "

Early Access Review
								In alpha, releases are slow and buggy. Each release fixes some bugs while creating new ones. The game lacks direction as the devs keep redesigning major parts of the crafting system, not necessarily for the better. Multiplayer is limited because of major performance issues. Servers keep crashing. Considering the success the kickstarter I would expect better development in the alpha stage.I would not recommend it until out of alpha stage.Edit: I wanted to add this, a couple of months after writing this review, what I said still stands but on top of that, Joel from TFP has started making videos of himself playing the game he is apparently designing, or pretending to. If you watch the videos you can tell he rarely plays his own game because he doesn't know how to actually do some of the most basic things. This is cearly an indication that he doesn't really like his own game. So how can we expect a designer that hates his own product to make good decisions about what they put in the game? Hence my review above, stating strange things are added in the game and major parts redesigned not necessarily for the better.As a sidenote Joel also has an attitude problem with his fans (you know, the people that went out on a limb and paid him money for something that isn't done yet). Have you fixed the disappearing minibike bug yet, Joel? You seem to have swept that under the rug as if it's ""not reproducible"". Well, try harder! Maybe if you actually played your game you would know what people are talking about.			"

								I've played all the survival games out right now. DayZ (mod and standalone), War Z (now called Infestation: Survivor Stories), Rust, Unturned, etc. This is the one I stuck with hardcore, and it's not even done yet. I've played since Alpha 1, when everything was blocky and there was no stealth system. That game was terrible, yet still held its own compared to most other survival games. Looking at it now, with a complex crafting system, stealth, hordes, random gen, and so much more that's been added since those first weeks... This is THE game. If you buy one survival game, make it this one. I guarantee ya, you won't regret it.Edit: After reading a few of the negative reviews, I have to add that this game is IN ALPHA. There WILL be gamebreaking bugs, in fact they released an update (A3 I think) that crashed my buddy's computer. This was before they released on Steam, ofc. Ever since, there have been no problems as far as corruption goes, but these things CAN happen when you buy a game that isn't finished yet. Not specifically talking about anyone in particular, just sayin'. As for the forum moderators, I suggest sending a pm to Joel on the 7dtd forums. He's a great moderator, fair and funny, but he's not paid to be a babysitter. He's an actual dev who is doing his part to create this game. Still, if you have a valid complaint, I'm sure he'll listen. He helped me link the game to my Steam account when he could've just sent me a link to Google and told me to figure it out lol. Point is, this is a great game with a great dev team, and though there WILL BE BUGS, they're doing the best they can with what they've got. This isn't Bohemia Interactive, this is a group of guys making a badass game. At 900+ hours, I've gotten my $25 out of this game many times over. Best game I've ever paid for.			"

There will be and already is quite a bit you can do and once they add all the elements they're coming out with it will be quite exciting!  Def a must for zombie/minecraft/fps/rpg players :D			"

								When I first bought this game early in its alpha phase I had some regrets. The early blocky look just did not do it for me but I always would come back every month or two and check on this game because I saw some depth that could be interesting later on. Fast forward now to version alpha8.6 and this game is quite fun, has dumped the blocky look and has me quite excited for the future. They have borrowed some of the better elements from games like Rust, Minecraft and DayZ and combined them into a quite complex crafting/building game with sizeable numbers of zombies that can be a real menace to you at times. If you have some friends to play with online and you enjoyed the building and base raiding of Rust but wished it were more complex in the crafting area, you should get this game. Or even if you like a solitary open world game it is still worth getting.			"

								Good game.Devs pull through.Devs are activly working on the game.[joelhuenink.tumblr.com]Devs play the game.Devs may take awhile to update, but when they do its a big update.Its worth the money.The only thing that kinda sucks is there may be some bugs after an update, but if you give the devs a few days they'll hotfix it.One more thing that might suck is the game is constantly evolving, meaning you might need to relearn how to play the game after an update. And you don't need a server to play. But if your internet sucks there are always big servers you can find. (Last I checked.)If your looking for a zombie game to play with your friends, look no further! "

Early Access Review
								First, let me start this long review by saying this:  Don't let the EXTREMELY outdated video they have uploaded here in steam be your first impression of the game or the deciding factor for you.  The game looks much different and things have been changed and upgraded/updated many times over since that video was made.  That video appears to have been in a very early alpha and is missing a butt load of features and graphical upgrades.Moving on...I've played a lot of sandbox survival games (Rust, DayZ, Unturned, etc.) and this is by far the best one I've played.  The original alphas were very fast and the game progressed so quickly it felt like there was no point - you would have end game items in a few hours which really ruined the difficulty and challenge of the game.  But the last few updates (and there are many of them and they come quite often in the form of sub-releases or new alpha versions), have really revolutionized gameplay for me.You start off with basically nothing:  a torch, a can of food, water, and a decent (upgraded) bandage.  You then have the majority of the day to get some basic gear set up - find cotton to make cloth, use that to make some clothing, plant fibers, stones and sticks can be gathered to make a stone axe and a bow and arrows for basic protection.  Then you need to find some place safe to stay the night - the zombies shamble slowly during the day, but run when the sun goes down.Seems simple enough?  Well that's just the start of it, you then have 6 more days to find better gear, hunt for food, gather recipe books to learn to craft new items, level up to craft higher quality gear and weapons, scrounge for gun parts to make some guns (if you have the recipe - if not, theres always the single shot blunderbuss...not recommended against a horde).  Zombies can see you, hear you, smell you if you're carrying raw/cooked food, and feral hordes can sense you through walls...but they only come on the 7th day unless you set all zombies to feral mode.   And you REALLY don't want to be outside with no defenses when that happens...though nothing is more terrifying than hiding in an abandoned house and hearing a feral horde beating at your walls and doors...the dogs growling and howling...and the giant wasps circling your base - all waiting for a chance to get at you.And the game world is completely interactable and everything you do has an impact.  You let those zombies beat at your base long enough, they will tear holes in the walls.  Those walls will eventually lose structural integrity and sections of the floor/walls or even the whole building will collapse - with you inside.  And if you survive the collapse, you still have the zombies to contend with.  There are status effects:  bleeding, burning, broken/sprained/mending leg, dysentery, infected, scent, stunned, etc. and stealth mechanics (including throwing rocks to lure zombies by the sound they make).  You can tunnel deep into the ground, or try to modify an existing structure and build onto it, or build an entire base from scratch using wood (basic), scrap metal, concrete, reinforced concrete, iron, etc (with more to come) and almost everything is upgradeable or reinforceable.  You can (and should) board up your windows and doors, block entry ways with plywood, and for 7th day hoards, even consider taking down stairs with an axe and rebuilding them the next day.  Just be careful with whatever you build, as if the structure is not supported, or you dig too deep and wide, the possibility of a cave in or structure collapse can result in an untimely death.Definitely worth the cash and time spent.  The sense of gritty realism, amazing graphics and ambient effects and sounds, procedurally generated sounds/skies/terrain make every map feel like a new experience.  And it's only going to get more awesome when Alpha 12 comes out...minibikes and upgraded physics and new random gen algorithms.  What this game doesn't have, the developers are likely already working on adding.Awesome game, survival/sandbox/tower defense with RPG and crafting elements, well supported and balanced pvp, challenging pve, steady releases, consistently patched to fix whatever bugs are found, and pretty much the best early access game I've ever played.  I would give it a 10/10, but it's still in development and there are the occasional bugs, and the servers are kind of small (largest I've seen is a 40 man server and it can be laggy at times) so I will rate as 9/10.

								Great gameWon't go into to much detail as to why, it's just really fun and addictive; ""Especially"" if you like this genre of game.Played the usual competitors of this genre like Rust, Dayz another game called the Dead Linger and none come close to this game in playability, content, fun factor and care and attention from the DEV team.Of course the game is in ALPHA but patches come constantly and improve the game. I won't lie to you with patches come more bugs as the game is constantly being developed but I still recommend this game as ""the best"" or at the least ""one of the best"" of it's genre which is openworld, apocoliptical survival with zombies.Over 700 hours played ans still love the game. That is pretty good for a game that isn't even BETA yet, it's still ALPHA and has a long ways to go to even get better still.EDIT: Updated review, still one of if not my favorite game. Progress is slower than would be liked but the game geets better and better. As of today, having played the game for 2yrs I'm going to load it up again and play for a few more hours. Allready logged over 3200 hours....eh? Great game, you'll love it.			"

								This game is really cool, and the sandbox aspect brings a lot of customization to the game (which, for control freaks like myself is an amazing thing). Or, if you like it simple, you can just find a point of interest that's already built and hang out there. The server I've been playing on is more like co-op, we don't run around looting each other which makes the game play much more peaceful. It's rather cool seeing what other people are building/doing and getting ideas. We trade with each other and talk to each other about bugs or ideas. There are a couple of downsides, however. One is that certain items don't regenerate in the map (meaning you have to go further and further away to find them), and another is that you can't build everything that you see spawn in the world (for example a bookshelf is uncraftable). This could potentially change, however as it is in Alpha. But so far I'm very impressed with how enthralled you can get in this game, and how much you can do. I can never stop expanding and killing zombers!			"

								Loved the game until A14 hit. Tried again yesterday for the first time since the game was ruined by that update all that time ago. And given it enough time to improve again, sadly though, its still not improved much. Id give it a neutral review if i could because of all the great time we used to have on it. Sadly though, those times are long gone. Perhaps when its released the modders will make a good game of it, but, i doubt they will get the numbers of zombies out that it would of been capable of, if they had not of changed them to those black smudges of ""HD"", and sacrificed so much upon their alter of black smudginess. Random hordes are no longer, random dog packs are no longer. Which is a shame since a great moment on this game (before A14 hit) was a dog pack disturbing us from grave robbing, they came over a hill, hearing them before seeing them, we rushed to get up on a rock to fight all 6 to 8 of them off. Guess that wont be a thing anymore though, thanks fun pimps. The ""temperature system"" (OMFG) is STILL a joke, so you spend most your time wandering around in your underwear, with a cowboy hat on and a bandana around your mouth to.... ""keep cool""... Making you look like an extra from the YMCA music video alot of the time. Which also leads you to be without armor/protective clothing on, while being followed about by black smudges shaped like people meaning to be zombies, and dogs that spend more time circling on the spot than actually chasing you. Could go on but wont bother. And ill end with RIP Hawian shirt guy, RIP Random hordes, RIP dog packs, RIP decent sounds, RIP retina's when looking at cotton, at night with a torch in your hand. RIP decent looking box textures and DMG textures. All for those shambling black smudges of ""HD""..... Really??.... And far fewer in numbers to boot..... This has become Dayz's little brother of equal failure. And (imo) yet another failed zombie survival alpha game on steam as it stands now. Thanks for destroying the fun.... Rename yourselves ""the not so fun imps"" devs. Will install again in another 6 month and see if its still as bad.			"

								As a major fan of Voxel Games, probably going so far as saying I go No-Lyfe when It comes to them. I have to say this is probably one of the best, I cannot say it is /THE/ best, Becuase that would mean it was fact and theres no possible way for something to be the best without a stastic backing it up, Besides... the concept of best is a matter of opinion.Eitherway, I for one enjoy this game very much, Playing since A1, I've seen as Navesgane changed over time. I've seen whole castles built and cumble because the smallest error. I've seen wars fought over land and food, and seen teamwork come to fruition, This game has had many, many memorable events. I've seen people laugh it up at a rather odd looking zombie, and I've seen people lose everything because of a misfire.This game is in no way, shape, or form perfect, it has it's bugs, it has its annoying people, and yes... it's not done... I'm not using it as an excuse, if you dont like it, To each his own, I'm just pointing that out, Somethings just need patience, You can't take every word as truth, and every image as plausible. Things are going to change, for better or worse, I for one intend to see it through, one way or another.I love this game, It is my S***, I mean-.. yes there are times when I do have to take a break, But any game you play, you'll have to eventually set it down for a day or two. But I'm always searching the forums for cool ideas, Making some form of impregnable fortress, or just chilling with friends.The multiplayer is kinda wonky, not unbearable, it has it's issues, but for most part is fun, Co-ordinating a group of 20 people on a 60 man server can be kinda hectic if your ill prepared, but it is definitly an expirence, Especially if it turns into an arms race and a war...I would like to see more from admin controls, but thats for a different time, and weapon mods.... Workshop mayhaps?Eitherway I'm happy to kill things, and have things to kill those things. Heres to A7 and beyond.Long Live the New Navesgane Militia "

It has a lot of bugs, whackiness with physics, weird graphical issues, and a plethora of other problems, but the core gameplay is fun enough despite the flaws.

								Below this is the current review. I opted to leave the original as well for reference.------ORIGINAL REVIEW: VERSION 7.11----------I played this game for a little bit when I first purchased it, just before alpha 6 was released. I was impressed. I played again later, around version 7.11, and I can say without a doubt that I enjoy this game. Having to take structural integrity into account to make sure your buildings and mining tunnels don't collapse on you rather then just as eye candy is a very welcomed plus. While there is equipment degredation and normal needs (food, hydration, stamina,)  I have never felt that these were too prevalent, yet it's just taxing enough to make you actively think about it.  In the end, it will be very interesting to see how this game turns out, but from what I'm seeing right now... We're all in for a very good game.---------NEW REVIEW: VERSION 12.4---------   Ok, I've put a good amount of time in the game between each patch. So far I am greatly impressed with the changes that the team has made. The game is starting to take shape and it leaves so much potential for mods when it's done!  But, this isn't much a review without actually reviewing it, so here we go.   Graphics: As I said in the opening, they have upgraded the engine and it now supports better graphics as well as weather effects such as rain, fog and snow. Unfortunately, for one reason or another, there seems to be some kind of issue with high end video cards and the game. That, however, will be patched out soon enough. The night sky looks great; first thing a friend of mine said when he saw it was ""Woah, check out that blue nebula!""    Sound: The ambience is much, much better then it was before. Not saying it's the greatest in the world, mind you, but it's much better none-the-less. Before, it would just repeat the same one or two ambient noises. While they aren't 100% ""there"" yet, the new ones at least make sense and fit the time and area. Game sounds, such as shooting, could use a touchup, but it still sounds good enough and I believe there are plans to improve upon that. In fact, I think they recently updated the reloading sounds as well gunfire.    Replayability: A lot. There have been quite a few world clears (due to patches) over the time I've played this and I generally have at least 1 SP game and 1 MP game going on in tandum. Even now, with so many of the promised mechanics not yet in the game, there is still many ways you can change up the playstyle to keep it interesting. Things like: ""This time I'm going melee only!"", ""I can only use a crossbow! That means I can't actually kill a zombie until I get one!"" and ""I cannot eat canned food or drink purified water. I must eat only cooked food and tea.""I don't like to give numerical ratings due to the misconception that ""7/10 = crap"" that reviewers such as Game Informer do. However, if I absolutely had to I'd give 7 Days to Die (in its current state) a ... 7/10 (5 = average, so 6 = slightly above average and 7 = above average)Can't wait until it's finished.			"

								I have waisted my weekend on this game.... Is it worth it? Hell Yeah. now dont get me wrong i play alot of minecraft but eventuly it gets boring i cant sit down and play that for 24 hours straight without getting board. Now this game, i spent litterally all day playing and was able to not get bored. This game implements Minecraft and DayZ Together to make one amazing game. I was impressed that unlike both of those games i could host a free private server without having to port forward or any of that junk i just set up a new game and changed the settings so my  freinds could join.This game is in early stages and its amazing i just cant wait til it fully comes out. And you can tell some of the things they will add such as cars, and cars that need gas, and more weapons, more maps and i just cant wait! Glad i bought it this early! I Highly reccomend this game for ALL Ages There is no Cursing just a little bit of blood but i can see this game being bigger than minecraft and if you want a better understanding of this game watch the video about that steam offers. I Hope you will buy this game because if you do it will be money VERY well spent.			"

								Fun game...nice to build what ya can and see if you can survive the night.  Has similarities to minecraft, but not the open ended construction or procedurally generated worlds.  I cant wait to see how else they develop the world			"

								7 Days to Die is 1 of my personal few games I'm REALLY looking forward to and went on to buy it in Alpha. It looks very promising and things that they're planning to do and goals are quite interesting and unique combinations from different genres. Semi-Block system from minecraft with better graphics and visuals.. add survivability with not only food and health but also water. Able to play it in Co-Op? YES! Crafting system? Yes!Lots of guns and weapons? Yes!UPDATE:::: 26/07/2015Personal feeling: I haven't played a long-while until 11 & 12- builds, the game became SIGNIFICANTLY more responsive and polished compared to what it was. The textures can still use some improvements here and there, but the apocalyptic set-up saves it slightly... I just find that in some cases (i.e character ) it still hurts to see low quality textures/graphics. But normally nothing distracting me from playing the game... after first few days you'll be wearing clothes anyways. The gameplay itself got significantly better to and as it stands is actually fun to play, run around and loot, kill zombies and so on. Improvement speed: Game is developing and taking shape in big leaps, something to be expected for an Alpha, I am ""slightly"" concerned about them stopping ""before it's baked"" because for me, so far I see almost infinite potential... Small Feature Wish-list:* More different kind of zombies, maybe even ""boss"" varieties? As much as I understand this game's desire to strive towards realism + zombies, but I would love some other hazards, like maybe some dangerous mutated plant-life or something. * More biome-specifics, like deserts need cactuses that are useful for something ect.* More ""metals"" ... Cloth/Wood -> Iron -> Steel is nice, but adding a few more ""tiers"" would be amazing. If they want to stay ""realistic"" they could do:  1) Low-grade Steel -> Regular-Steel -> Damascus or Stainless/High-Grade Steel* Copper deposits/ore or some way to ""mine"" it.* More pre-made mapsOverall there's plenty of great ideas people are giving to them in the forums already, and I think they're seriously considering the good ideas.Game-modes & variety:* You can play it solo undisturbed.* You can play solo and at some point have some friend(s) joining and ""help"" them out a bit. (if they want)* You can play on a server or a lan and start with friends working in coop or racing them in zombie kills count or ""recipies learned"" or some other metric.* You can play on a server and even have some sort of PvP. ( not sure how good that is yet )* You can edit the xml-file for custom random gens, alter zombie behavior, items spawn rates or quantity ect.* You can ( or will be able to ) download some player-created content or balances to adjust the game, once it's released or even already now.* You can enter cheat-mode and just be building a base, or a town, or castles... There's 1 concern as of right now... Building underground is very time consuming/difficult. Only thing I DO regret is that I got the game ( 2 copies actually ) for 30 Damn € a piece , when it is now 20€ and I feel ""ripped off"" in a way. Because not only did they reduce the price to 20 € a piece they also made a "" 2-game bundle"" that costs nearly as much as I paid for 1 game back in the days. =/ But well.. you win some, you loose some.

								As a major fan of Voxel Games, probably going so far as saying I go No-Lyfe when It comes to them. I have to say this is probably one of the best, I cannot say it is /THE/ best, Becuase that would mean it was fact and theres no possible way for something to be the best without a stastic backing it up, Besides... the concept of best is a matter of opinion.Eitherway, I for one enjoy this game very much, Playing since A1, I've seen as Navesgane changed over time. I've seen whole castles built and cumble because the smallest error. I've seen wars fought over land and food, and seen teamwork come to fruition, This game has had many, many memorable events. I've seen people laugh it up at a rather odd looking zombie, and I've seen people lose everything because of a misfire.This game is in no way, shape, or form perfect, it has it's bugs, it has its annoying people, and yes... it's not done... I'm not using it as an excuse, if you dont like it, To each his own, I'm just pointing that out, Somethings just need patience, You can't take every word as truth, and every image as plausible. Things are going to change, for better or worse, I for one intend to see it through, one way or another.I love this game, It is my S***, I mean-.. yes there are times when I do have to take a break, But any game you play, you'll have to eventually set it down for a day or two. But I'm always searching the forums for cool ideas, Making some form of impregnable fortress, or just chilling with friends.The multiplayer is kinda wonky, not unbearable, it has it's issues, but for most part is fun, Co-ordinating a group of 20 people on a 60 man server can be kinda hectic if your ill prepared, but it is definitly an expirence, Especially if it turns into an arms race and a war...I would like to see more from admin controls, but thats for a different time, and weapon mods.... Workshop mayhaps?Eitherway I'm happy to kill things, and have things to kill those things. Heres to A7 and beyond.Long Live the New Navesgane Militia "

								This is one of those (currenlty) bad games that is still tremendous fun. It has a lot of bugs, whackiness with physics, weird graphical issues, and a plethora of other problems, but the core gameplay is fun enough despite the flaws. Hunting for junk with your friends and all dying to a puking zombie cop is one of those special highlights. Also everyone will have constant diarrhea. Be prepared.			"

								Below this is the current review. I opted to leave the original as well for reference.------ORIGINAL REVIEW: VERSION 7.11----------I played this game for a little bit when I first purchased it, just before alpha 6 was released. I was impressed. I played again later, around version 7.11, and I can say without a doubt that I enjoy this game. Having to take structural integrity into account to make sure your buildings and mining tunnels don't collapse on you rather then just as eye candy is a very welcomed plus. While there is equipment degredation and normal needs (food, hydration, stamina,)  I have never felt that these were too prevalent, yet it's just taxing enough to make you actively think about it.  In the end, it will be very interesting to see how this game turns out, but from what I'm seeing right now... We're all in for a very good game.---------NEW REVIEW: VERSION 12.4---------   Ok, I've put a good amount of time in the game between each patch. So far I am greatly impressed with the changes that the team has made. The game is starting to take shape and it leaves so much potential for mods when it's done!  But, this isn't much a review without actually reviewing it, so here we go.   Graphics: As I said in the opening, they have upgraded the engine and it now supports better graphics as well as weather effects such as rain, fog and snow. Unfortunately, for one reason or another, there seems to be some kind of issue with high end video cards and the game. That, however, will be patched out soon enough. The night sky looks great; first thing a friend of mine said when he saw it was ""Woah, check out that blue nebula!""    Sound: The ambience is much, much better then it was before. Not saying it's the greatest in the world, mind you, but it's much better none-the-less. Before, it would just repeat the same one or two ambient noises. While they aren't 100% ""there"" yet, the new ones at least make sense and fit the time and area. Game sounds, such as shooting, could use a touchup, but it still sounds good enough and I believe there are plans to improve upon that. In fact, I think they recently updated the reloading sounds as well gunfire.    Replayability: A lot. There have been quite a few world clears (due to patches) over the time I've played this and I generally have at least 1 SP game and 1 MP game going on in tandum. Even now, with so many of the promised mechanics not yet in the game, there is still many ways you can change up the playstyle to keep it interesting. Things like: ""This time I'm going melee only!"", ""I can only use a crossbow! That means I can't actually kill a zombie until I get one!"" and ""I cannot eat canned food or drink purified water. I must eat only cooked food and tea.""I don't like to give numerical ratings due to the misconception that ""7/10 = crap"" that reviewers such as Game Informer do. However, if I absolutely had to I'd give 7 Days to Die (in its current state) a ... 7/10 (5 = average, so 6 = slightly above average and 7 = above average)Can't wait until it's finished.			"

								7 Days to Die is a fun Voxel Zombie-Survival game. As an Alpha it still has a long way to go in terms of being ready for production, however, what is there currently makes for a charming game that you can get lost playing for hours in. if you want to catch a preview of what is involved in the game, check out my YouTube series!www.youtube.com/officialfarem "

								First, let me start this long review by saying this:  Don't let the EXTREMELY outdated video they have uploaded here in steam be your first impression of the game or the deciding factor for you.  The game looks much different and things have been changed and upgraded/updated many times over since that video was made.  That video appears to have been in a very early alpha and is missing a butt load of features and graphical upgrades.Moving on...I've played a lot of sandbox survival games (Rust, DayZ, Unturned, etc.) and this is by far the best one I've played.  The original alphas were very fast and the game progressed so quickly it felt like there was no point - you would have end game items in a few hours which really ruined the difficulty and challenge of the game.  But the last few updates (and there are many of them and they come quite often in the form of sub-releases or new alpha versions), have really revolutionized gameplay for me.You start off with basically nothing:  a torch, a can of food, water, and a decent (upgraded) bandage.  You then have the majority of the day to get some basic gear set up - find cotton to make cloth, use that to make some clothing, plant fibers, stones and sticks can be gathered to make a stone axe and a bow and arrows for basic protection.  Then you need to find some place safe to stay the night - the zombies shamble slowly during the day, but run when the sun goes down.Seems simple enough?  Well that's just the start of it, you then have 6 more days to find better gear, hunt for food, gather recipe books to learn to craft new items, level up to craft higher quality gear and weapons, scrounge for gun parts to make some guns (if you have the recipe - if not, theres always the single shot blunderbuss...not recommended against a horde).  Zombies can see you, hear you, smell you if you're carrying raw/cooked food, and feral hordes can sense you through walls...but they only come on the 7th day unless you set all zombies to feral mode.   And you REALLY don't want to be outside with no defenses when that happens...though nothing is more terrifying than hiding in an abandoned house and hearing a feral horde beating at your walls and doors...the dogs growling and howling...and the giant wasps circling your base - all waiting for a chance to get at you.And the game world is completely interactable and everything you do has an impact.  You let those zombies beat at your base long enough, they will tear holes in the walls.  Those walls will eventually lose structural integrity and sections of the floor/walls or even the whole building will collapse - with you inside.  And if you survive the collapse, you still have the zombies to contend with.  There are status effects:  bleeding, burning, broken/sprained/mending leg, dysentery, infected, scent, stunned, etc. and stealth mechanics (including throwing rocks to lure zombies by the sound they make).  You can tunnel deep into the ground, or try to modify an existing structure and build onto it, or build an entire base from scratch using wood (basic), scrap metal, concrete, reinforced concrete, iron, etc (with more to come) and almost everything is upgradeable or reinforceable.  You can (and should) board up your windows and doors, block entry ways with plywood, and for 7th day hoards, even consider taking down stairs with an axe and rebuilding them the next day.  Just be careful with whatever you build, as if the structure is not supported, or you dig too deep and wide, the possibility of a cave in or structure collapse can result in an untimely death.Definitely worth the cash and time spent.  The sense of gritty realism, amazing graphics and ambient effects and sounds, procedurally generated sounds/skies/terrain make every map feel like a new experience.  And it's only going to get more awesome when Alpha 12 comes out...minibikes and upgraded physics and new random gen algorithms.  What this game doesn't have, the developers are likely already working on adding.Awesome game, survival/sandbox/tower defense with RPG and crafting elements, well supported and balanced pvp, challenging pve, steady releases, consistently patched to fix whatever bugs are found, and pretty much the best early access game I've ever played.  I would give it a 10/10, but it's still in development and there are the occasional bugs, and the servers are kind of small (largest I've seen is a 40 man server and it can be laggy at times) so I will rate as 9/10.

								As far as zombie survival goes this has to be one of the best I've played especially in early access. Most game developers make a ton of excuses, promises, and plans that never deliver, while this game seems to be developing smoothly while also remaining PLAYABLE. Most of the glitches seem to be fairly negligible from my experience so far.Pros+ Building Capability   Way better than rust or any of the prefabricated excuses for building that most survival games have at the moment, infact on par with what you would find in minecraft with a better look and feel to it.+ Scavenging   No more Chuck Norris vs. tree immersion killers like they have in minecraft, rust, and other games like it. Make tools based off of materials you can gather from smaller sources before tackling the big projects.+ Zombies & AI   They can smell you, see you, and sometimes simply sense you. This is way better than the husks of DayZ, or the rabid bunny rabbits of Minecraft.+ Updates and Content   Never expected when I originally bought this for the devs to be so loyal in their updates but wow they have been progressing this game like it actually means something to them, crazy right? Devs that don't abandon their community.Cons- Hard Start   I'll admit it's a bit hard to get started in with little explaination on how to get your first tools. I personally started out scavenging till I found a pickaxe and shovel only to find out later in the game that a stone axe can work however slowly and can be made from gathered materials.- Players Per Server   Unfortunately the only huge thing is the amount of people that can play before it takes a massive dive in server sync which can ultimately drop everyone from the server or just make the few people experiencing it rubber band like crazy. Watch your server population and limit who plays or else it will happen.			"

								7 Days To Die has been around for quite some time now. I recently purchased it off a discounted price and I have to say its quite fun. At the start it was really frustrating, you will die from lots of reasons. Running into radiated zones, getting shot by bandits, dying from zombies and even dying from lack of food/water. Your basic stats include stamina,food,hunger and health.Stamina affects your physical activites that range from running to felling a tree with an axe. The lower your stamina, the slower you interact.Food/Water are your basic survival stats. There is a constant challenge to build a decent food/water supply and foraging for food in the wild is also difficult. The more stamina you drain, the faster your food/water stats will go down.Health is the usual. You would require medicinal items like bandages or first aid kits to heal.The game crafting is quite developed but theres still room for more. When I first started, i was totally lost and i needed to wiki/google search how to do things. Although the recipes are provided, you are missing some and you have to learn these by reading skill books that can be found in various loot drops around the world. Combat is moderate. There are a couple of guns, ranging from pistols to hunting rifles or shotguns. Crossbows are also available. You can even make a bone shiv from large bones that you may come across. However, fighting with zombies is rather dull. You just need to avoid their swipes. A huge horde can become a big problem. Typical zombie swarm problems.There are a couple of zombie types. Crawler zombies crawl towards you slowly and they can sneak up on you in thick vegetation. Normal Walkers have a few variations, infected women, nurses, cheerleaders and fat walkers. Naturally the fat ones would have more health and it would take more effort to bring 1 done. There are also cop zombies that hurl acidic vomit at you. Zombies will drop loot according to their variation.I managed to group up with a couple of people and setup a huge base. Normally if you're on your own, raiders tend to pick on you more. And when i mean raiders, those are other players that attack other people for resources or for the fun of it. You will die and you will be annoyed. But thats the fun. Picking up from where you lost and rebuild.I got raided by a pair of bandits and they jeered at me. Infuriating as it is but i teamed up with other survivors and continued playing.---------------tl:dr,YOU WILL DIE. ALOT.But you learn from those mistakes and pick yourself up again.Have fun out there!			"

								Great game considering IT IS IN IT'S ALPHA STAGE. I've put a fair few hours into this game and yes, there is a lot of room for improvement however what do you expect, IT'S ALPHA. One thing i would like to see improved would be searching for specific servers. The search command rarely works, which at times can be very frustrating. I see people saying 'save your money, get it when its playable', but it if you buy it now you're actually saving money as you get free updates for life. I have faith that The Fun Pimps will stick to there word and complete this game, however the release is drawing near and if The Fun Pimps really want to make this game all it can be they will probably extened the release date, why release something thats half done? I'd much rather wait longer and play something thats awesome/ all it can be. The Fun Pimps have the money and the know how, all it takes is time. I am hoping for a major game update to come out ASAP, i am also hoping for new weapons and traps. Maybe even include fueled generators that supply electricity to circuits such as lighting, traps (electric fence, automated turrets), solar pannels even elevators. I also  hope for means of transport such as motor bikes, cars and zip lines.			"

I'm not one to like micromanagement,  but this game has just the right amount of crafting, not too tedious, not too easy.  All this and its only in Alpha!

So I started up the game, and I was impressed.The game evolved from what I thought was a huge waste of money to one of my favorite games on steam! Its lots of fun building settlements with friends and trying to defend them. The game still needs some work, but it is coming along very well.Alot of people think what I first thought about 7 Days, and they really need to play the recent updates and considor changing their minds because they are missing out on one of the most fun zombie games available. Also the price went down from $35 to $25 so be happy that u get to pay less than when I bought it.			"

Think Minecraft meets a zombie shooter.I have a server set up for myself an a handful of friends, and the sense of community in building and 'surviving' in a post apocalyptic world is strong.I recommend this game, though if bugs bother you, if having to start over after major updates bother you I suggest waiting.

So I started up the game, and I was impressed.The game evolved from what I thought was a huge waste of money to one of my favorite games on steam! Its lots of fun building settlements with friends and trying to defend them. The game still needs some work, but it is coming along very well.Alot of people think what I first thought about 7 Days, and they really need to play the recent updates and considor changing their minds because they are missing out on one of the most fun zombie games available. Also the price went down from $35 to $25 so be happy that u get to pay less than when I bought it.			"

								Very fun game. Sort of a mix between mincecraft and dayz but also realistic. Carfting is difficult to get used to at first but it makes more sence than other games. Even in the alpha this game is awesome and if they do what they say there going to do with the future updates then this game would be off the charts in popularity. And the devs are also amazing and keep updating constantly. BUY THIS GAME.			"

								Absolutely love this game. It IS rough. It IS early still. Lots of bugs, lots of rough edges, but under it all is a gem. If the devs keep up the development as they have lately I have high hopes for this thing. Think Minecraft meets a zombie shooter.I have a server set up for myself an a handful of friends, and the sense of community in building and 'surviving' in a post apocalyptic world is strong.I recommend this game, though if bugs bother you, if having to start over after major updates bother you I suggest waiting.

Building, crafting, looting houses, tunneling, farming and the whole while keeping those pesky zombies at bay.  If you like creative building games, zombies and crafting till your hearts content do not hesitate to pick this up.  Easily worth the $25 they are charging.			"

Granted it may take awhile for the devs but it looks like they are heading in a proper direction!- The endless possiblity of a sandbox game.- Zombie killing fun. There are times where I sweated/panicked from being overwhelmed- Co-op! Not a fan of PvP so the co-op is much more appealing to meCons:- Bugs/Glitches. Something I would expect from an alpha game.Looking forward to the improvements and advancements to the game! Great job and keep up the great work devs!			"

								This one along with Ark Survival are the best survival games out there right now (at the time of writing). The game is in a very playable state and has a great crafting system and the building part is the best part of this game. You can make crazy creations above and underground, it won't affect performance like in other games (Space Engineers...).But sadly drains a LOT of performance in multiplayer due to bad optimization. Therefor finding a decent server is hard. Bad servers are plagued by hackers, cheating admins or simply have no zombies at all or when they spawn they don't move because the server has no CPU left for that... Basically world-objects like supply drops, enemies, physics, etc. no longer update on poor servers with more players than they can handle.But luckily there are some good servers out there. You just gotta find 'em.The game has sadly a lot of nasty bugs that can eventually become pretty annoying. But for a casual gamer this game is just awesome. And there is in my opinion no better zombie survival game out there right now. Singleplayer is very stable, multiplayer is not.The game supports both online PVE and PVP.			"

								I've enjoyed this game for so long, and actually I am changing my POSITIVE review to a negative. I've enjoyed this game for so long and put many hours (like most of the negative reviews here) to have it get worse over time. This game was brilliant and by far one of my favorite games on my STEAM  library. I'm writing this review because I bought this game as soon as it came out on STEAM and I have waited YEARS for a full release. However, we the community have gotten nothing but bad updates, and round about bug fixes that usually don't do much. When they revamped the game in 13-14 I played a little more and enjoyed the game. Then I saw they wanted to make this game a CONSOLE game when this game is DEEP into Alpha and they don't want to finisht the game until they finish their console game. Ya'know this isn't a bad game, this is one of the best zombie survival crafting games I have ever played but because they don't wanna finish this, I feel like I have been abandoned by the devlopers.

								Still in Alpha Highly enjoyable. If you like Minecraft, Left 4 Dead, Project Zomboid or DayZ this game might be for you!There is still alot to be added but as of Alpha 5 you can mine, (like minecraft) craft items, build a fortress to survive the night. You'll need to eat and drink water which will force you to raid houses and town full of zombies and eventually lead you to farm.Dont get caught out after dark (in normal settings) zombies run at nightime and will tear down your walls, tunnel down through the soil to break into your bunkers and do all they can to get to you. The AI is still reasonably dumb but its still fun for zombies!If you like the games i listed or are just keen on zombies and dont mind a few bugs grab this game. Ive been playing co-op for days with my friends supports up to 20! player games its worth the $30 early access fee which means you paid $30 to play now and get the full finished game when its out for only $30!If your still on the fence as with ALL early access games youtube lets play videos and watch a couple.

Don't waste a dime on this totaly incomplete, worthless game. I spent $7 and I feel totaly ripped off. The sound sucks, really really bad. The combat sucks. The landscape is the same enviroment with the same wrecked building scattered throughout with the same few objects that you can search through.

								GENRE:Post-apocalyptic zombie survival game.CONTROLS:Standard mouse and WASD unless you are on a gay consolePOINT OF THE GAME:You build up your character, scavenge items, build bases and kill zombies.  There are always zombies to kill but every 7 days there is a blood moon that brings a zombie horde that will make you♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants.  You will soon discover that what you thought was an impenetrable base is play dough to rabid zombies on horde night.  There are also other players that you can align with or fight against; animals to hunt; and foul-mouthed NPC bandits that try to murder you.GOOD POINTS:- Voxel based terrain means you can terraform (dig and build) and, unlike Minecraft, the graphics are quite realistic.  The building mechanic in this game is great - much more user-friendly than other survival games like 'Ark Evolved'.- Decent character creator with the ability to play as a female- RPG element means your character starts out like a spaz and you can build up their specs as you level up to be pretty competent. Some skills are bought with points while others increase naturally as you perform specific tasks.- Lots of loot and scavenging.  Unwanted items can be scrapped down to their base elements.  Items of the same kind can be improved by combining them in the work bench.  Also since Alpha 15, there are now NPC traders.  - Lots of killing to do (different kinds of zombies, wild animals, bandits and other players).  There are a variety of weapons (guns you can assemble, crossbows, knives, clubs, etc) and as you become proficient with them, the more fun they are to use because of an increased chance of dismemberment. - Different biomes that are randomly generated- Minibikes to get around the massive map.BAD POINTS:- A lot of the hairstyles in the character creator make it look like your character has undergone chemo and is now wearing a cheap wig.- Currently no auto-run toggle means pinkie-cramps- The minibikes glitch into the terrain All.The.Time.  This is a 'known bug' which I'm sure is on the priority fix list though.- No third person (except when you are on the minibike).  I don't really mind this but some people prefer third person.  I read somewhere that they will eventually have it, but it is not quite ready yet.  - The game still needs some optimisation to improve frame rate but it has come a long way already so I expect more improvements will come along in time.MY THOUGHTS:As I write this review, the game is still 'early access' (Alpha 15.1), but even in its unfinished state it has become my favourite game ever, overtaking games like 'Return to Krondor', 'The Witcher' and 'The Elderscrolls' franchise.  I really hope that when the developers have finished this game, they will use the same engine to make a post-apocalyptic alien themed game. "

								I'm not quite sure why I bought this to be perfectly honest. It's been sitting in my library for 18 months now and I just cannot get into the game. I do not have a particularly powerful computer but it can handle most games pretty well, and yet with this game even on low-settings it feels laggy, slow and my computer quickly heats up like an oven. I'm wondering whether this game is just poorly optimised. Either way, it makes the game almost unplayable for me.As for the graphics, I tested the 'ultra' settings and they just seem very poor to be honest - and not the sort of low-resolution style that is acceptable (e.g. Minecraft). It just feels like playing a game from 10+ years ago, and feels miles behind the standards of today's survival game graphics. I particularly don't like how the game just 'fades' into black in the distance.Furthermore, from the short time I have played the game, the sound quality isn't great either. Zombies for instance, will sound as if they are a metre or two behind you with loud footsteps, and yet are barely visible when I turn around.The combined poor sound and visual quality doesn't make the game particularly immersive.Although, perhaps I'm being a little unfair. After all, graphics and sound aren't everything. Game mechanics are also important - and possibly something I haven't played enough to truly appreciate. Either way, for a survival game, I am impressed (and a little bewildered) at the character's ability to pick up countless cinder blocks without any help and yet take 100's of punches to kill a zombie.18 months and I haven't seen a huge amount of progression to address the above issues. At this rate, I feel I'll be waiting years for a playable game to be produced out of this. Sorry, but life is too short for that.£18.99 is far too expensive for a game of this quality.			"

								Thankfully I purchased this game after ignoring some of the previous negative reviews (including one top-ranked review that listed screenshots and all this back and forth) because it turned out to be one of the best survival sim games that I have recently purchased. . I can't speak for the previous state of the game, but as of right now it is a great survival game. Let me start at the top, with the gameplay. It's FUN! There is plenty to learn, see, and do. Scavenging around there are various weapons and items, all used for something. On the default settings, it is nearly impossible to survive a night by yourself - you need friends! This is not a single player game, it's meant for multiplayer/at least one friend with you. The game has plenty of different buildings around the world, all unique. It has a lot of different building materials, all can be reproduced or placed by the player. You can dig up carpet, take paintings and tvs, then take them back to your own base to place them. Weapons can be dissasembled into parts, all weapons and tools have durability that can be repaired. Once you spend the time to learn the game, it is not difficult to maintain your weapons or tools. There are plenty of different foods, some foraged or cooked. You have health, hunger, thirst, and stamina to maintain. The variety of places and things to scavenge means it is not too difficult to maintain these basic stats. When I say 'varied', I mean it has at least multiple items of that type, unlike several other games that only have a few of each type. Even though items like food tend to be the same (they have different stats but they are similar) it is nice that they have several different ones of each type, it keeps the game interesting to find new things.Update: They released a dedicated server component that you can download via Steam by clicking on Library and selecting Tools. If you scroll through the list of games in Tools, you will find 7 days to die dedicated server. Downloading it puts all the files you need in your Steam\steamapps\common folder.The multiplayer server component is included with the game and it works similar to minecraft or terraria. You host a world on your local machine, and you can create new worlds to host. It has the ability to create new worlds or continue previous worlds. Once you select to create or continue a world, it asks you to press enter before entering - but by that time the world is already hosted. In this way, you can start a server/host a game without actually joining - the server is not a separate executable like some games but that doesn't diminish the ability to host a server. There is a list of settings you can change, and that are changed for many servers. The number of zombies spawned, whether they can run in darkness, how hard they hit, increasing the loot, etc. Right now there are around two thousand servers when you browse for a game, some labelled PVE and others PVP. You can see each server's various settings when browsing for a server to join.The map is reasonably large for current survival sim games and it looks and feels like a recently inhabited world. Doors are blocked by chairs and windows are boarded up. I can't compare it to DayZ because I haven't played much of that game, but compared to Rust the world is much larger and much more varied. The game is easy to learn and get into and the building system is easy like Rust or minecraft.One unique feature this game has, is that the world is destructible and structures require support. If you are building a bridge and destroy the support beams, it collapses. Trees fall after you chop them. Parts of houses will collapse if you destroy enough of the walls. It's not very complex, but you can only build blocks that have reasonable support and you can not build over thin air very far.As much as I can tell, everything can be mined or destroyed. Interestingly the axe works much better than a pickaxe on wood, and pickaxes work much better than an axe on metals and minerals. The game has a shovel and an auger, which work very easily on the earth. It's really nice that you can find/create different mining tools that work better or worse on different materials. Guns, knives, clubs, they all do some damage to break materials down just not all equally well on all types. Metal is not difficult to come by, many items can be broken down into scrap metal. You can smelt scrap metal into iron ingots. The forge has a ""mold"" system, you need to build and place the proper mold into it to produce the output you desire (iron, lead, copper molds, bullet molds etc). Scrap metal can be used to build metal siding that can be applied to wood (or anything), which make them much stronger against the hordes trying to break them down when you are inside your home. Once you learn how to craft the different items you need, it is easier to survive a night and it is a casual learning curve.The game is easily accessible, the controls are intuitive and the same as many first person games. The crafting system is easy to understand and use, and supports queued/multiples crafting. You can find most of the materials you need close by, whatever your spawn point into the world is. Destroying parts of houses usually yields materials also.The graphics are on par with modern games (as shown in the screenshots in the game store). I am using an older generation graphics card and not the latest CPU, and as long as I turn off Anti-aliasing the game runs fine. The game has settings for visible distance, view angle, anti-aliasing, etc to allow adjusting performance.The sound and music fit very well with the theme. Sound effects work well, you can tell if a sound is far away or close up and in which direction it came from.Overall it is worth the current price, and it is better developed than other zombie survival games recently released at the same (or more) price...Please thumbs up this review if it was helpful!

								I waited for a sale since it's Early Access and given my caution to most games I expected something a little rough but so far I've been really surprised by 7 Days.  Part Minecraft, and part Zombie Apocalypse it puts you in a hostile environment and sets you to crafting for your survival.    Sure the animations could be a little better and the UI could do with some polish, but the sheer area to explore, the number of recipes, and the availability of both single and multiplayer made this worth my time.  I'm interested to see what they add next.			"

								Awesome Game! & its still in alpha! I own them all: DayZ, Infestation, How To Survive... The list can go on. This game brings all the best feautures from the survivalist/zombie apocalypse type genre and adds to it with a VOXEL world building system. Build what you like where you like... Ive currently built a spiraling tower of wood concrete and steel surrounded by blackened spires in within a darkened forest... Its the place where zombies come to meet their end... If you have spent any money at all on any other Survivalist/Zombie Apocalypse Games then you owe it to yourself to get this game.

Early Access Review
								7DTD ay only yet be at alpha 5.1 but has lots to do already and is pretty playable long term even without all the systems coming in place yet.  It can be nerve wracking and an adreniline rush strying to stay alive during the day when the zombies are calm and you need to gather supplies and then try and survive the night when they are very fast and aggressive.  The game has a lot coming to it still but has a huge amount now.  The price might seem high, but your buying the final release and getting early access now.  Good video of what is coming on the 7daystodie.com site and on their forums.  The Fun Punks (developers) are extremely responsvie and pay a lot of attention to feedback and what palyers are looking for.  The games has different levels of survivor mode (if you can you can survive well past 7 days) and also horde modes which let you try and survive 7 days without scavenging but just getting air drops of supplies.  More game modes coming.  Its great to play solo or multiplayer and its popular so has many servers available to play on.  Zombies come in many forms from just teh walking dead to acid spitting zombies, crawling zombies that grab ankles, wall crawling zombies that can reach you on second and third and higer stories, aggressive (day and night) zombie dogs and mutated hornets!  The game has a expansive crafting system where you can use items scavengered to make other items, mine and farm and forage for crafting supplies.  Guns and ammo, food and water and other necessities can be found or made.  The game can really keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time you play.			"

								'Another zombie survival game' - you.7 days to die is a zombie survival game. Maybe it isn't fair to review this game seeing as (at the time of writing) it is in 9.2 Alpha version. But seeing as this review is mostly positive, it should be alright.There's a few things about this game I'd like to talk about:GameplayGraphicsCraftingZombiesMultiplayerPros and Cons overall.Gameplay:7DTD is a sandbox game. At the start of the game, you get dropped at a random place in the world. This can be one of four locations:Snowy mountainsForestDeserted cityDesertFrom there it is totally up to the player to decide what they want to do. To keep survivng the player will need atleast food and water. Shelter is optional but highly recommanded, seeing as zombies get stronger at night.As player you need food and water to survive. You can also get infected, or get diseases like diarrhea. Ofcourse those things can be cured by things you find while scavenging.Graphics:In my personal opinions, the graphics aren't terrible, but they could be better. To be honest, for the graphics it has, it should be easier to run. Even on a high end pc it sometimes has lagspikes or crashes, wether this is because it's still in Alpha or not I don't know. Either way, don't excpect anything fancy.Crafting:Crafting is pretty big, most things you see outside can be destroyed and used for crafting. You can chop down trees, or chop down entire buildings and make them collapse. The remains can be picked up en used again for crafting. Bushes, rocks, and grass are things that are mostly used in crafting, espescially at first, when the player is getting started. Later wood and stone become very important, for building a base.Later, guns and armour can be crafted, But those require molds and blueprintsThere's also a farming system, but I'm not a big fan of that. Just like real life the plants need time and sunlight to grow, but it just takes too long.Zombies:There's multiple version of zombies. Zombies are both called 'zombies' or 'walkers' A few examples that you're going to see a lot are:Bloated zombie: A fat zombie, does more damage, and takes more damage. Drops better loot as well.Nurse zombie: A normal zombie, except she has more chance to drop medical items.Zombie dog: Probably the most annoying type of zombie. Fast and does a lot of damage.Snow zombies: Zombies that live in the snowy mountains. They are all a tougher than normal zombies.Police officer zombies: They're like blaoted walkers, except they also have a ranged puke attack.Multiplayer:Unfortunatly, multiplayer doesn't really offer anything new. It's just a second you running around in the world, except he isn't controlled by you. You can track other players. Also unfortunate is that you have to rent a server to play with others, but if you know how to 'port forward' you can host a server without charges. More info for that go here:http://7daystodie.gamepedia.com/Server#Port_forwardingPros and cons:Pro:- Fun to play- Multiplayer- Good crafting system- Building is well doneCons:- More fun to play with others- Once you've set up a stable base, which includes food, water, and protection, the game can get stale.- Have to rent servers- Game has lagspikes and sometimes randomly crashesOveral I'd rate this game a 7.5/10, and it's still in Alpha mode.

								I got this game as a gift from a friend, but still I tried to give it a chance to surprice me, being in alpha state and all, is not what I usually enjoy, being biased about playing games at that state, usually prone to have issues.Well, I can say that the first time it crashed a lot, and after some patches, not so much. Still flashing polygons, some times without textures especially on characters, choppy animation on animals and zombies when running, hopping and attacking is offensive to my eyesight, and the performance even with medium quality settings mocks my intelligence or rather my computer's ability to show complex scenes, since I know what is capable of, and the same does injustice on its skills.In conclusion, I do NOT recommend this game, unless you like to die often by poor physics, slow responces of your camera turning and while it tries to be realistic, it needs a lot of work to be convincing at that aspect, since it fails utterly with all this gliltches that after years and months of patches is inadequently fixed.

								UPDATE June 2016: I gave this game a second try and it would not even load into a single player game. It crashed every time. Still a crazy piece of trash game.What an absolute piece of trash game. I mean seriously, utter garbage. How do these awful games keep getting good reviews? Don't waste a dime on this totaly incomplete, worthless game. I spent $7 and I feel totaly ripped off. The sound sucks, really really bad. The combat sucks. The landscape is the same enviroment with the same wrecked building scattered throughout with the same few objects that you can search through. I am all about supporting the indie, but this game is not worth supporting.			"

Early Access Review
								GENRE:Post-apocalyptic zombie survival game.CONTROLS:Standard mouse and WASD unless you are on a gay consolePOINT OF THE GAME:You build up your character, scavenge items, build bases and kill zombies.  There are always zombies to kill but every 7 days there is a blood moon that brings a zombie horde that will make you♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants.  You will soon discover that what you thought was an impenetrable base is play dough to rabid zombies on horde night.  There are also other players that you can align with or fight against; animals to hunt; and foul-mouthed NPC bandits that try to murder you.GOOD POINTS:- Voxel based terrain means you can terraform (dig and build) and, unlike Minecraft, the graphics are quite realistic.  The building mechanic in this game is great - much more user-friendly than other survival games like 'Ark Evolved'.- Decent character creator with the ability to play as a female- RPG element means your character starts out like a spaz and you can build up their specs as you level up to be pretty competent. Some skills are bought with points while others increase naturally as you perform specific tasks.- Lots of loot and scavenging.  Unwanted items can be scrapped down to their base elements.  Items of the same kind can be improved by combining them in the work bench.  Also since Alpha 15, there are now NPC traders.  - Lots of killing to do (different kinds of zombies, wild animals, bandits and other players).  There are a variety of weapons (guns you can assemble, crossbows, knives, clubs, etc) and as you become proficient with them, the more fun they are to use because of an increased chance of dismemberment. - Different biomes that are randomly generated- Minibikes to get around the massive map.BAD POINTS:- A lot of the hairstyles in the character creator make it look like your character has undergone chemo and is now wearing a cheap wig.- Currently no auto-run toggle means pinkie-cramps- The minibikes glitch into the terrain All.The.Time.  This is a 'known bug' which I'm sure is on the priority fix list though.- No third person (except when you are on the minibike).  I don't really mind this but some people prefer third person.  I read somewhere that they will eventually have it, but it is not quite ready yet.  - The game still needs some optimisation to improve frame rate but it has come a long way already so I expect more improvements will come along in time.MY THOUGHTS:As I write this review, the game is still 'early access' (Alpha 15.1), but even in its unfinished state it has become my favourite game ever, overtaking games like 'Return to Krondor', 'The Witcher' and 'The Elderscrolls' franchise.  I really hope that when the developers have finished this game, they will use the same engine to make a post-apocalyptic alien themed game. "

Early Access Review
								Thankfully I purchased this game after ignoring some of the previous negative reviews (including one top-ranked review that listed screenshots and all this back and forth) because it turned out to be one of the best survival sim games that I have recently purchased. . I can't speak for the previous state of the game, but as of right now it is a great survival game. Let me start at the top, with the gameplay. It's FUN! There is plenty to learn, see, and do. Scavenging around there are various weapons and items, all used for something. On the default settings, it is nearly impossible to survive a night by yourself - you need friends! This is not a single player game, it's meant for multiplayer/at least one friend with you. The game has plenty of different buildings around the world, all unique. It has a lot of different building materials, all can be reproduced or placed by the player. You can dig up carpet, take paintings and tvs, then take them back to your own base to place them. Weapons can be dissasembled into parts, all weapons and tools have durability that can be repaired. Once you spend the time to learn the game, it is not difficult to maintain your weapons or tools. There are plenty of different foods, some foraged or cooked. You have health, hunger, thirst, and stamina to maintain. The variety of places and things to scavenge means it is not too difficult to maintain these basic stats. When I say 'varied', I mean it has at least multiple items of that type, unlike several other games that only have a few of each type. Even though items like food tend to be the same (they have different stats but they are similar) it is nice that they have several different ones of each type, it keeps the game interesting to find new things.Update: They released a dedicated server component that you can download via Steam by clicking on Library and selecting Tools. If you scroll through the list of games in Tools, you will find 7 days to die dedicated server. Downloading it puts all the files you need in your Steam\steamapps\common folder.The multiplayer server component is included with the game and it works similar to minecraft or terraria. You host a world on your local machine, and you can create new worlds to host. It has the ability to create new worlds or continue previous worlds. Once you select to create or continue a world, it asks you to press enter before entering - but by that time the world is already hosted. In this way, you can start a server/host a game without actually joining - the server is not a separate executable like some games but that doesn't diminish the ability to host a server. There is a list of settings you can change, and that are changed for many servers. The number of zombies spawned, whether they can run in darkness, how hard they hit, increasing the loot, etc. Right now there are around two thousand servers when you browse for a game, some labelled PVE and others PVP. You can see each server's various settings when browsing for a server to join.The map is reasonably large for current survival sim games and it looks and feels like a recently inhabited world. Doors are blocked by chairs and windows are boarded up. I can't compare it to DayZ because I haven't played much of that game, but compared to Rust the world is much larger and much more varied. The game is easy to learn and get into and the building system is easy like Rust or minecraft.One unique feature this game has, is that the world is destructible and structures require support. If you are building a bridge and destroy the support beams, it collapses. Trees fall after you chop them. Parts of houses will collapse if you destroy enough of the walls. It's not very complex, but you can only build blocks that have reasonable support and you can not build over thin air very far.As much as I can tell, everything can be mined or destroyed. Interestingly the axe works much better than a pickaxe on wood, and pickaxes work much better than an axe on metals and minerals. The game has a shovel and an auger, which work very easily on the earth. It's really nice that you can find/create different mining tools that work better or worse on different materials. Guns, knives, clubs, they all do some damage to break materials down just not all equally well on all types. Metal is not difficult to come by, many items can be broken down into scrap metal. You can smelt scrap metal into iron ingots. The forge has a ""mold"" system, you need to build and place the proper mold into it to produce the output you desire (iron, lead, copper molds, bullet molds etc). Scrap metal can be used to build metal siding that can be applied to wood (or anything), which make them much stronger against the hordes trying to break them down when you are inside your home. Once you learn how to craft the different items you need, it is easier to survive a night and it is a casual learning curve.The game is easily accessible, the controls are intuitive and the same as many first person games. The crafting system is easy to understand and use, and supports queued/multiples crafting. You can find most of the materials you need close by, whatever your spawn point into the world is. Destroying parts of houses usually yields materials also.The graphics are on par with modern games (as shown in the screenshots in the game store). I am using an older generation graphics card and not the latest CPU, and as long as I turn off Anti-aliasing the game runs fine. The game has settings for visible distance, view angle, anti-aliasing, etc to allow adjusting performance.The sound and music fit very well with the theme. Sound effects work well, you can tell if a sound is far away or close up and in which direction it came from.Overall it is worth the current price, and it is better developed than other zombie survival games recently released at the same (or more) price...Please thumbs up this review if it was helpful!

								I'm not quite sure why I bought this to be perfectly honest. It's been sitting in my library for 18 months now and I just cannot get into the game. I do not have a particularly powerful computer but it can handle most games pretty well, and yet with this game even on low-settings it feels laggy, slow and my computer quickly heats up like an oven. I'm wondering whether this game is just poorly optimised. Either way, it makes the game almost unplayable for me.As for the graphics, I tested the 'ultra' settings and they just seem very poor to be honest - and not the sort of low-resolution style that is acceptable (e.g. Minecraft). It just feels like playing a game from 10+ years ago, and feels miles behind the standards of today's survival game graphics. I particularly don't like how the game just 'fades' into black in the distance.Furthermore, from the short time I have played the game, the sound quality isn't great either. Zombies for instance, will sound as if they are a metre or two behind you with loud footsteps, and yet are barely visible when I turn around.The combined poor sound and visual quality doesn't make the game particularly immersive.Although, perhaps I'm being a little unfair. After all, graphics and sound aren't everything. Game mechanics are also important - and possibly something I haven't played enough to truly appreciate. Either way, for a survival game, I am impressed (and a little bewildered) at the character's ability to pick up countless cinder blocks without any help and yet take 100's of punches to kill a zombie.18 months and I haven't seen a huge amount of progression to address the above issues. At this rate, I feel I'll be waiting years for a playable game to be produced out of this. Sorry, but life is too short for that.£18.99 is far too expensive for a game of this quality.			"

								This game, no matter the version or update released, is PATHETICALLY RIDDLED WITH BUGS. Is it ""alpha?"" Well, that's what the tag says but... really? I mean, you're paying 25$ and they're at ""alpha 15.1?"" I'm sorry to say, sticking ""alpha"" on the front doesn't absolve you of your sh*tty programming when you're taking people's money. This isn't an ""alpha"" or even a ""beta,"" it's their final product. Period. They just happen to keep making minor content updates that address NONE of the long-standing issues.Do you like running around, doing your thing, and then your character starts magically floating into the air after which you plummet to your death? How about building a character for weeks only to log on one day and have your character magically reset to lvl 1 (no, the server wasn't reset)? How about gathering gear, storing it in your minibike, and then <poof> it's all gone moments later (no, it wasn't taken by another player)? If you enjoy feeling like a hamster running on a wheel, are happy with constant setbacks for no reason, and are contented by devs responding to your frustration with statements like: ""This is a known issue and we're sorry for your lost character,"" then you'll absolutely love this game.EDIT: NO WHERE IN MY REVIEW DOES IT SAY I WANT *MY* MONEY BACK. I'M MERELY SUGGESTING YOU SAVE *YOUR* TIME AND MONEY.EDIT: Why 500+ hours? Because this game is 3.5 YEARS old. I revisit it twice a year with friends from home and EACH TIME we're disappointed. EACH TIME we think: surely they've fixed it. Yes, this game is from 2013 and somehow this is still an ""Early Access Review.""			"

Early Access Review
								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThis game is a mess; and there's a great many things wrong with it from many in game bugs to a massive memory leak that will lock up your system if you play for too long (for me it locks up after about 14 hours). In fact I could probably write several pages listing everything wrong and/or missing from it....BUT... it's early access. The game is still in development; so I'm going to let all that slide and review it based on what it does right:This is a true sandbox; ""do what you want"". Aside from the 10 minutes worth of introduction ""missions"" to get you vaguely pointed at how to craft and where to trade you are pretty much left on your own to do what you want.That is, if you can survive. The ""7 days to die"" in the title refers to the Blood Moon mechanic where every 7 days a horde spawns and knows exactly where you are (there's no hiding on blood moon night). The rest of your week you can kill the zombies if you want to or simply hide from them (in many numerous ways). But that 7th night (every week) you'd better have your defenses built and be ready to face the horde.Where the game shines is really only in the world building mechanics. You can dig massive tunnels and caves, build towers to the sky and come up with any number of intriticate defensive setups. Or simply scavenge constantly and hope for the best.It should also be noted that the game is far more fun with friends. Going it alone can feel very lonesome and grindy (or you can use the creative menu to cheat and go faster), but to play legit without cheats you will want to consider finding some friends to coop with. There's not much else to say. The actual combat mechanics are a bit janky, during the day it's not too bad. But at night, especially blood moons the zombies are bullet sponges (and crafting bullets/arrows is a full time job). The current best (or at least easiest) method for killing them on blood moon is to glitch them so they run in circles where they can't hit anything (while you're up in a tower that they can't reach). While this method works; it feels cheap, and unfortunately unless you have friends it's sometimes the best you can manage solo with limited time to farm ammo/arrows.Anyway, I don't want to complain too much as the game is still in development with a lot of potential.I'll put it this way: I paid $10 for it on sale, it's easily worth $10 in it's current state just for the crafting/building aspects. Some day if they ever complete it and make the combat more satisfying it may even be worth full price. Just realize: it's been in early access for 3 years already, and it still feels like it needs another year or two at the rate they are going (which is kind of slow).Anyway, if you are looking for zombie survival meets minecraft with coop options, this is a neat little game with potential to be even better as they keep adding to it.

								This game is incredible. Before I got this I was playing Rust. Turns out this game has everything I was hoping Rust would have and even more. Rust took two weeks to put out an update that fixed the sky. This developer does more in 1 week than Facepunch Studios can evidently do in two. I highly recommend this game if you like survival games. Survival is a challenge even without the zombies. he zombies are relentless and force you to get very creative as far as having a shelter. The crafting system is extremely diverse and surprisingly realistic. his game gets two thumbs up from me. Well done!			"

								Fantastic hybrid of Minecraft, tower defense and a FPS zombie game. Here are some observations:- More physics based than minecraft- Fun killing zombies- Getting a base organised before the horde comes is fun- Gameplay is a bit limited in alpha, but more is added regularly- Can be frustrating when you can't find certain things for crafting- Current controller support is lame- Occasional glitches but Devs are very proactiveOverall, highly recomended for a more mature version of minecraft survival mode "

								I really liked this game, seriously, it used to run smoothly for me, it was fun to build, and graphics looked like they were improving (even thought I dont care how it looks, but was a nice improvment), and all around was a good game if you wanted to play zombie survival minecraft. I wish that I could say the same now. When I left the game about 2-3 months ago (I was burned out playing it, moved to another game), the game ran perfectly, the loot system was great, and all around a solid game. Now if I try and play it, it lags like f***ing crazy, not network lag, LOW FPS LAG, on a computer with 16 gigs of ram and a 4gb graphics card and 6 core processor. This game should be running perfectly, but now it sucks. Not only that, somehow, the graphics are WORSE. So, worse graphics and a low FPS, when before, improved graphics and high FPS.....DOESNT MAKE SENSE TO ME.Also, the loot system is now RUST. You hit a tree with an axe, you get wood EVERY TIME YOU HIT IT. Before, you had to chop down trees for logs which can then be crafted into planks and other things....Now you get wood every time you hit trees, dirt, rocks, god knows what else. This game is now an abomonation that needs to roll back these latest updates to fix what shouldnt have been messed with, cause now, Im playing 7 days to die, and now I feel like Im playing RUST.UPDATE: Even now the graphics in the game are somehow worse than they were before, and UI is worse, and it has a pointless leveling system now. This game has become RUST in a nutshell. ANYONE WHO BUYS THIS GAME, try it in Alpha 12.5, then the current one, and TELL ME IM WRONG. This game has gone down hill sense they released Alpha 13.			"

								7DTD had a very cool start. Simple minecraft inspired zombie survival. Unfortunately the developers quickly showed that they are completely out of their league. With every patch the game took 1 step forwards and 2 steps backwards.I played the heck out of it in the early alphas, but now the game is a complete mess.The simplicity of it is gone, its insanely poor optimized and full of half implemented idears that the developers will doubtfully ever get fully working.With every patch this game just gets worse and worse.Ultimately its just been out too long, that the developers can continue to hide behinds the Early Access tag.

								Alpha 11.6 offered a pretty good start for new exciting features, then comes the ALpha 12 ....The ""upgrade"" completely kills the fun in game.All the recipes from books are splited in tonnes off ****ing schematics... It's just frustrating to begin a party and not beeing able to craft anything...zombies are way more resistant, and the 'headshot' with bow is completly useless...Tools like chainsaw or auger need to be repared way too offen, because having a good tool used to help you and now its just a noisy fragile junk.Raising the difficulty is good, however when even hardcore players are bored by the lenght of every little action....Fun pimps seems to forget the GAME ISN'T REALITY!! And by making the game more real it becomes uninteresting			"

								The game has potential, and can certainly be fun at times, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone right now mainly because of the attitude of its developers. Never mind that the game has been in Early Access for two years now and there's still no end in sight. What bugs me is that there seems to be no formal testing procedures in place. For example, recently the A12.2 patch introduced a bug where items couldn't be scrapped or repaired; a bug that took me all of five minutes to find after I installed it. Sure there was a workaround, and to their credit it was fixed after a few days; but the fact that the bug was released to begin with spoke volumes about how lacking their test procedures are. It doesn't help either when you're snootily told that you're not playing the game the way it was meant to be played; i.e. if you're not using default settings then you're considered to be ""just a casual gamer"" (and therefore deserve the issues you get).It's like TFP sold you a cow, and they've been taking care of that cow for the last two years. Each time you inspect the cow it seems to get sicker and sicker. Rather than get a vet to look at it, they hire a beautician to put lipstick and make-up on the cow. When you point out that the cow is sick, you are then told that ""The cow was fine when we had it. You're just not using your cow right. You must not be a good farmer.""			"

								tl;dr: 5 years of alpha, cash-grab on console version, no news on PC development been for almost 5 months now. Bug-ridden with melt-your-hardware levels of terrible performance. Yet still genuinely a very fun game.Progress has been painfully slow (5 years or thereabouts, and not even in Beta). After the console release (seriously, releasing an alpha version as a finished game?), this has only gotten worse.""Hey Survivalist, We know your wanting Alpha 15 but it’s still some weeks out so in the meantime here is a great new alpha 14.7 stable build with many highly requested bug fixes and a new launcher which could help folks with 32 bit problems.""Posted 20th June. It's now the end of September. There was a time when news updates were posted every couple of weeks, which, again, is something that happened _before_ the console release.I love this game, I really do. It's a super-fun game, even taking the _vast_ number of game-breaking bugs, crashes, awful performance, and questionable graphics into account. And don't even get me started on attempting to play private multiplayer on anything under a 100mbps connection / dedicated server (I kid you not: you will end up getting LITERALLY several in-game days of lag). But releasing a console version and then magically the PC development crawls to an absolute standstill? Come on, guys. You used to be better than that.			"

								This game used to be good, before the zombie apocalypse of Alpha-12 hit. Now it is definitely the worst game I have installed. Here's a list of what A12 made worse/ failed to improve upon. (Also the screenshots on the steam store look WAY BETTER than the actual game. False advertising.)-Game optomization. I have a fairly good computer, game used to run on Ultra settings smooth as butter. Now I'm having FPS dips, stutters and lag even on middling settings. Weather effects make the game run like garbage.-Game stability. It crashes too much, especially on snow biome.-Other players teleport/ skip around A LOT despite less than 50 ping.-Audio desync when other players do things, I.E. he hits something then I hear it 2 seconds later. Also happens with voice chat.-Draw distance is absurdly low, terrain visibly fades into fog even with draw distance turned up. -Not enough contrast. Night is too bright, day is too dark.-Weather changes waaay too quickly.-Parts of zombies clip through the ground when killed.-Trees pop into existance when you approach them.-Flowers/ shrubs shift and ""dance"" as you approach them, very jarring.-Strange black ""screen"" over some distant tree models.-Character/ weapon models don't line up properly. Try aiming a crossbow when you can't look down the sight, its not easy.-Character model/ texture glitches. My friend was wearing armor, parts of his body were pitch black/ flickering.-Everything looks slimy when it rains, even indoors. Looks very weird.-Trees don't fall realistically, easy to get injured even when chopping down small trees.-Zombie AI is just terrible, especially pathfinding. They won't be able to follow you up a gentle slope 1/2 the time. They will sometimes forget they are chasing you as well, or just run off in the opposite direction.-No more rivers-Bears, too many bears. They also kill unarmored players in 1-2 hits-Bows are useless, ingredients for arrows are too hard to find.-Points of interest are just too far apart, with no good way of finding them save by chance.-Unworkably huge maps, I asked a friend where his base was and he said ""4000 degrees NE"" I spawned at about 500 degrees NE, and it took a long, long time to even meet him halfway there.-Combat is very clunky, and no combat mechanics to speak of. Once you enter melee range its all a silly gamble.So yeah. I probably left out a lot; this is just what I encountered in less than 1/2 hour of play. I cannot recommend the game in this state. If the Fun Pimps address these problems in the future then I may change my review.			"

								This is my updated review for 7 Days to Die (alpha 13)7 Days to Die is an excellently maintained game, recieving updates based on user requests. This is a great way to develop a game.The new GUI is excellent and I can finally craft items without the infuriating need to remember where to place resources in some silly grid. All you have to do is search for the recipe and click craft. This is very simple and very effective. Interacting with items is easy and quick. All you have to do is click on an item and you can see every action which can be done with that item. (By action, I mean eat it, drink it, drop it, etc.) The new GUI is also clean and non-obtrusive. There are no silly bars of ambiguity; it's all done with numbers, overlaying a horizontal bar. Genius!Zombies in this game are truly marvelous. Thanks to the recently added motion capture technology incorporated into the game, they now move how a real life zombie would move. They limp around in the day and still pose a threat in whatever activity you are doing. What makes these zombies so excellently designed is that they repsond ""well"" to damage. Something that some zombie games lack. If you hit a zombie, they may become stunned. The zombies will also be knocked back slightly and won't hit you the instant you strike at them. Their growls are scary and this makes for a tense experience at night.At times, the zombie hits will be inconsistent, which can be quite annoying. However, this is an early access game in aplpha, so you shouldn't expect everything to be polished.Just a little footnote, the zombies look excellent too :-)The random world generation is (in alpha 13.2) average. Biomes have no transition between them. By this, I mean that you may have plains (Savannah-like biome) suddenly boarder a deciduous forest. I hope that the developers will add ""transition biomes"" to make for a realistic experience. However, the biomes do not negatively affect gameplay, so therefore, there is nothing wrong with them. I just would prefer something a bit more realistic. I have noticed that caves are generated with very, very, very low gradients. I have seen multiple caves stretch for a good 3/4 of a mile not even submerging beneath the desert plains. This is a recent issue and I'm sure it will be fixed. (Once again, this does not affect gameplay, so nothing is wrong here either)Body temperature works well for the most part, but admittedly, it needs some tweaking. The wetness  system works well though.I have a few issues with the game, though. My first is with the hydration and hunger systems. I think that there should be an option (because not everyone likes hyper-realistic games) to follow the 3 3s, or whatever Bear Grylls once said. ""3 weeks without food, 3 days without water and 3 minutes without oxygen."" I'd love this to be either a permenant gameplay feature or at least an option. I think it's a bit silly how you can die after 2 days without food.The final issue, if not the most important issue, is the performance. This game runs atrociously. My laptop isn't bad. I can run Killing Floor 2 at 60fps on just about everything set to max, (apart from AA of course. Who would want that on?!) which I am quite proud of, since the GPU is only a GTX 850M. Anyway, the game runs at about 20-30fps. The only time I've ever got 60fps is when I stare into space. I would recommend waiting for the game to eventually become optimised, or to buy two Titain Xs and run them SLI or whatever it's called. Then, you'll probably get a solid 32 fps. :-DIn all seriousness now, this game is fantastic. The new update is very good and lots of people negatively reviewing alpha 13, just hate change.I am positive that 7 Days to Die will continue to grow and develop and reach the pinnacle of ""survival horde crafting""ness.

								7 Days to Die. I like to compare it as: DayZ meets Minecraft. It's literally just that. You have to survive day and night by finding items, such as food, water and weapons. Not only with that you can survive, you also need to build a safehome, where you are safe from zombies and hostile-players. Both compared you have an excellent chance of survival.You can craft your own stuff too, weapons, blocks, doors, windows, stairs, etc. etc.Working together with friends and other players is not neccesary, but needed for better survival, especially versus other people.Some settings you can change in the game are handy. You can start off easy and disable the zombie-spawn. You can also put the spawn-time on normal and even on fast.Daytime is safest, that's my first tip for you. Now go try it yourself!I recommend this game. It's fun and you really put your instincts to the test. With friends it's even more fun, on a LAN-party it would be funniest. I can play this all day long, not alone though. Just like in Minecraft: you can play it for hours, but with friends you can play it a couple hours more.For a decent price you can buy it in the Steamstore.Rating:8.5/10No 9 or 10 because the game is still in it's Early Access, it's nothing near finished. That doesn't mean it isn't fun. The game is already this fun, can't wait for the fun I'll have when the game is fully released.			"

								This is a really great game of its kind and it's always been right from the 1st of my runs in it more than a year ago. Maybe even unmatched in things it's focused on. No storyline or directly given quests(update - it has some optional quests now), it's just about surviving under harsh conditions in the post apocalypse world full of walking dead (Or running dead, depending on which settings you prefere). Kind of a fine quality surviving, which feels like a perfect subsitute to the storyline and quests as trying to make it as far as you can becomes a storyline and quests by itself.Which ever stage of this game's developement  in eary access i've tried so far, they all were a damn great survival experience. Even at times when some other people were not content with any bugs, lags or just changes brought by an update. The only issue worth mentioning i had myself was that it can't be normally  played on full hard difficulty with always running zombies from the start, there's just no chance to survive with such settings (doubtful that i just failed to find the way to do this) long enough to call it surviving. Since i've picked warrior(4th of 6) difficulty with Zs running at nights and walking at days and feral as my  regular one, there's been nothing to complain about, except my own mistakes.The game is about being spawned on the map naked and bare-handed, and then collecting resources, making yourself some basic tools, weapons and clothes, building your base, hunting, growing plants and fighting zombies.There are quite branchy crafting and building menus there and lots of recipes of advanced staff you will eventually find looting different containers and dead bodies.Recrafting things brings you some slightly better staff each time you do this. No sleeping option, but there's always a lot of things to do at night, except maybe first 2 or 3 nights when you don't have enough resources in your inventory to craft or build something. I just punch a would frame or smth else then to get some additional exp. points to the athletics skill before Zs show up and provide some entertainment (good time to explore the crafting menu, too) . Otherwise the length of night may be adjusted to end at 02.00 e.g., never done it myself  though, it's 06.00 by default.The number of Zs in your vicinity eventually grows bigger, starting from the 7th night you have to deal with an attack of a whole big horde of them once a week, which gets stronger every time, so you need to constantly improve your equipment and fortifications. The game can be played solo or in PVE or PVP multiplayer. There's a good default map of a reasonable size or you can choose playing on a randomly generated endless map.Food and water gauge and environmentally triggered effects like cold, heat, being set on fire, a couple of deseases, bleeding, being stunned by a slap from a zombie or getting your leg sprained or broken or whatever else, are all of crucial meaning, each brings you special trouble and requires special treament or action.In fact, there's too many good things to tell about this game, but that would soon degrade down to unnecessary spoilers or epic episodes from author's own in-game experience. You better try it yourself, that's a must have if you're into fighting Zs and surviving. PS Just remember to find a safe place to hide or convenient to defend, a bow and several dozens of arrows before it's 22.00 if you set Zs as running at nights:)), 3 block long 3 high wall of  wood frames upgraded with wood and  a little scrap iron if you have some, with a row or two of spikes on the ground around it was enough for first couple of nights until the last update but now it seems to be 4 high, optionally with unupgraded frames or ramp frames(to be able to remove one to shoot down through the gap) around the top, and you will need 4 or 5 high, 3 or 4 thick and 3 long upgraded(as much as you can) wall with frames around the top to survive the first couple of hordes(days 7 and 14). A friend of mine says Zs can't dig down, so another option for spending nights is having an underground shelter with level(not a slope e.g) and as hard as possible terrain above it. Best of all if it's 2 block thick at least, fortified with a layer of upgraded wood frames and with support pillars (avoid flights longer then 3-4 blocks, to prevent the ceiling from falling down on your head). The entrance should be stopped up and levelled with the surface and you shoudn't be close to it when Zs show up..PPS English isn't my native, my apologies for any inadvertent errors i could have made.

								Don't listen to anyone saying this game is broken or full of glitches. I was one of the skeptical ones reading mostly the negatives over the postives of getting this game. But the urge to play every time I watched the video was too much. So I bought it. Best decision I ever made, I played 6.5hrs straight into the early AM. Only problem I have seen so far is when you try to break something, your marker SOMETIMES isn't always correct and you end up breaking a torch behind you instead of the wall infront of you.""♥♥♥♥ this game zombies are still GPS'd"" ♥♥♥♥ YOU! Have you not watched the gameplay video? Zombies hear, see and smell. Think about it for a second then say you were wrong. Zombies are meant to be that way.Also to make this game more realistic I turned off running zombies on the settings. Giving you a more 'The Walking Dead' kind of zombies, which is what I believe to be the ""real"" zombies. This game is beautiful, and what is still to come is so exciting. GET-THE-GAME!			"

								Destroyed, Cold, Hot everything you could think of to Snowy hills to warm deserts this open world sandbox filled with rather 'exciting but scary zombies' makes the game more intense and a more viscous terrain, So what is 7 Days to Die you ask?Well, 7 Days to Die or the acronym 7DTD what most people know it as is a zombie sandbox which has not only zombies but zombie dogs! which is rather scary if you ask me, I was once looting and completing reansacking a building then all I heard was a growl and it wasn't a normal growl it sounded alot more angrier and scarier so I looked out the window and all I can see is a dog circling the building and I was like ""Oh lord."" it wasn't what I expected to see so early but I infact did so I just had to leg it out the building and try to run as fast as I can into the wilderness of tree and grass. after a long run of getting out of there and excluding myself from the infected and building I found more building but in the distance I saw a desert with building nearby and this was on a randomly generated world, (You have two choices at the moment to choose to have a randomly generated world or choose a map call 'Navezgane') I continued you my journey and I found myself a weapon and a little bit of food to keep me going for the meantime and I think this is a really fun game to play, It's alot more fun with friends and I managed to get some friends to play with me on my server a while back and I played this when a bit later it came out and I miss some of the old thngs they had back in the day.I like the fact that you can now have vehicles, I have a bike and a underground bunker with on the surface a large wall excluding the dead and on top a small house to store misc and other items in case I am lazy to go all the way down, I didn't ofcourse make it all me and my friend did and it was ages from completion, We still have not finished the base what we have come to this day and still it's a work in progress. I recommend this game to everyone if you like first person zombie survival horror. It's quite atmospheric in some places where it can turn really quiet and audio of wind and whistles to loud screeching and infected crawling up on you. Be warned it can be a scary game but rather fun one aswellI recommend this to everyone who likes this sort of game remember to look at the trailer so you can have a basic idea what you are stumbling upon.Thank you and I like this game alot!

								I played this quite alot before it came to steam and i would reccomend it. It is a hoot with friends and it combines alot of the games i enjoy.Heres why i would and why i wouldnt...-------------------------------------------PROS:-You can build fortifications to hold off the zombies (zombies will try to bust their way in)-You can craft a load of stuff like pipebombs, clubs and many other things-Exploring the world theres alot to see and theres always risks to checking out new places-Hunger, Thirst and stamina haunts you all the time so you really cant just smack your way through Stone or zombies alike-VERY VERY fun with friendsPROS Side Notes: Its a bit daunting when you can hear all the zombies outside at night clawing their way through your walls so you do have to check for blocks that are beginning to break and you will have to thin them out every now and then or they will cut through your walls like a hot knife through butter. The map is interesting to explore and theres plently to see and do. The crafting is confusing at first but i got the hang of it in 10 or so minutes.-------------------------------------------CONS:A few things i did find though is zombie dogs are... well like the tazzie devil off loony toons they spin around everywhere making them impossible to hit. I think its funny when your mates being chassed by a glitchy dog but i dont think many people share my sense of humour.Sometimes stacks of items dont stack correctly which takes up inventory space which can become a pain when you have to drop things you worked hard to find or create.Bloated zombies sometimes activate self-destruct mode and blow up when nothing is around which is funny sometimes.I cant be to harsh in the cons for its IS an alpha... We didnt crush minecraft when it was a little sprout now did we?			"

								Right now, 4th October 2014, this game has been improved a lot since I bought it, I guess a year ago. Here's what's happened since then: bees are not so noisy nor numerous nor everywhere, world is bigger, there's snow, glitches and bugs fixed of course, a little performance improvement, graphics improvement, smooth terrain, new weapons like crossbow and bolts, better crafting system (this one's a big thing), you can wear armor, forge system for metalworks, and improved multiplayer. I've not checked the quests nor randomly generated world that are supposed to be there yet.What's still missing: a better movement of enemies, cause they still move in 8 directions instead of having a free range of movement. Makes then harder to hit, worse combat. I'd assume they work out that one. NPC:s, dont know if there's any nor if they gonna add any, but hope so. Weather, there might be some, haven't noticed yet, but I'll change this if I notice it.Overall, I feel it's very good. They could work a bit more on the mood but I guess that's more a last line polish thing, it's pretty good as it is now. Very realistic for a game, different animals, lot of different things to craft etc. Many options on what kinda game you wanna play, like in zomboid: how much enemies, how strong and alert they'll be, how much loot, how long days, airdrop frequency... great customisation of gameplay. I really enjoy the long 240 minute day, gives you a lot of time to get used to the game without having to rush and you can adjust the difficulty as you like then.Works best in my opinion when you put a bit too much of a challenge for yourself and play with a friend and mess around a bit and go daredevil.

								You need to buy this game, i know the price is a little high for a PC game. The reason it is high priced is because it is in alpha and needs the money to develop and update the game. there is so much stuff you do in this game. you dont need to buy or port foward the servers or anything. when i first played multiplayer i found the experience good. you would have about 4 people following you around and finding stuff and killing with you. The repair system is a very good feature. there is a wide range of weapons, traps, defensive blocks, and explosives. i wouldn't say you would be build a base all of the time, but if you want to build one next to one of the many lakes or ponds. Also don't go outside of the map, this leads you to the radiation zone which will kill you. The graphics arn't the best but everything else works. the sound affects and pretty good, but what i really like about this game is that one day you can be building up your house and making defensives and the next day your farming potatoes and corn. Theres alot of things to explore as well and theres the mining aspect of the game, there isnt many ores and i dont think this game needs much of that. I would recommend this game for anyone that likes building games, fps, and multiplayer...			"

								Game was fun at start but with all the changes that have occurred it pretty much a generic game where wondering how to level your character best is more important than playing the actual game. Put in over 2,500 hours on this game but they have changed it to the point where I have no further interest in it. Perhaps when the game is officially out I can find a modded version I would enjoy.So on a scale on 1 to 10, I would give this game a 4, If I still have to kill 5 rabbits with a nail gun then I'll drop that to a 2 out of 10. Just for lack of imagination.IF I could sell my copy I would.			"

								The majority of my time spent in this game was during the alpha 10-11 patches. For a while it was one of my favorite games to play, the mix of PvE, PvP, and base building was exactly what I was looking for in a survival game. Unfortunately, the devs of this game don't seem to have any direction and I doubt if the game will even be a fully functional and finished title before 2020. They constantly reinvent the core mechanics of the game, while leaving bugs that have existed for at least 2-3 patches and some even longer. Recently they decided to add an extremely grindy skill system, while discontinuing active support for multiplayer, and you can see that since those decisions the player base has plummeted. So if you want to play a grindy single player zombie survival RPG full of bugs that will ruin your save every time the devs decide to ""patch"" the game, go for it.			"

								I was gifted this before it hit steam, I was pleasantly surprised. Scavanging for food, water and supplies can be hard seeing as so many things have been picked over. The zombies are laughable at times. I would not be able to get into this game if it werent for my friends. Playing solo is incredibly dull for me. So if you have a group of friends playing who like to craft tools, dig bunkers and protect your bases, i suggest this game.			"

Everything from Looting towns, crafting items, building a base, mining ect.. I have a game with a few buddies we've probably each put 50+ hours into and keep exploring/ making new Forward Operating Bases. There's something new around every corner to keep you entertained.			"

								OUTDATED AT THE MOMENTReview updated/rewritten on 2014-03-15This game had some serious performance issues at its alpha launch and I considered the game unplayable. I fell in love with the idea of the game - a minecrafty zombie survaval, where you're never safe. You would have to survive endless hordes of zombies, charging your defenses, breaking it down, piece by piece.My biggest downsite uppon launche was that the game was poorly optimized and basically completley unplayable with a computor that's within their system requirements. The game simply wern't playable at that state on those specs and that really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off - i felt as if they tricked me into buying a game that i couldn't play, even though the system requirements ""promised"" that it would be playable. Sure, the game was (and still is) in alpha, but i felt ripped of at that moment, but is till loved the idea of the game and kept waiting for this to be fixed.I redownloaded the game earlier yesterday, to give it another chance, to see if it performed any better.I am happy to say that things have improved, it runs better now (though still far from perfect), but the game has seen so manny other improvements that i really loved. The ""blocks"" had changed, making the game different from minecraft - the blocks are no longer squared and it makes everything look and feel so much better. I've spent hours digging tunnels and it really feels like i'm digging a tunnel, not a perfect rectangle, they have added new zombies and also a stealth system, etc etc. The list goes on and I really like what's happened.My old verdict was that the game wasn't playable in its former state, and I told people to wait for a few patches before buying it. I told people that this game needed to be optimized and was bareley playable in it's state, but that the basic idea of the game was wonderful. My current verdict:I am now happy to say that so much has improved that I now accually will recomend this game to people who are interested in a more ""hardcore"" minecrafty survivalgame. This game is great fun and I see a huge potential in it, though it still could use some more optimization. If you are playing the multiplayer you notice that the server can't really handle bigger ammounts of zombies - if your friends allerts a horde in an area far away from you - suddenly there are almost no zombies at where you are. This game still has some work left untill it's complete, but it's getting there and I now consider it much enjoyable.			"

								It being in Alpha I expected bugs and problems.I played it and enjoyed it.As the patches came and went my game started to stutter and lag.The more patches the worst the game got untill 14.4 when it gave upafter 5 secs in game. The Pimps are adding new hair or hats but the core gameis unplayable at least for me.Don't think if you have high specs and it runs at the moment you'll be playingmuch longer. It's only a matter of time.I wish the Pimps well sticking it on consoles but they are already turning theirback on the PC players by not sorting the fundementals out.As time passes and I review my review more and more people are having basicto run problems,To avoid frustration please put off your purchase of this game.The Fun Pimps may have been carried away by the success of their title.I fear greed is now motivating the way ahead.More experimental builds being pushed out and still no help for those peoplewho paid to help the pimps develop their game.Have they changed the minimum specs?At least with Nvidia with the new cards coming out their Titan x card will becoming down in price so for a few months at least we'll be able to help withdevelopment.

								For all the content this game has, it is amazing!  A bit buggy at times however no bug ruins the game even if you get launched to space and die falling down on impact for no reason at all.However, the game has completely failed me on unfair hackers.  Every server I am on I get hacked.   If its PvP and I kill someone, they hack me and kill me back unfairly.  If you see Mandarin (Chinese) name tags, They'll fly around and hit you once to kill you and take your stuff.  The game has a lot of content however does not provide a successful revenue to report Hacking which completely ruins the game.  Since I have no revenue to report players I'll post the name and server of one player who inspired me to write this review:   Server: Naked and Afraid. Player: RazorThreader.Players believe its just Chinese people that hack the game, however, if you simply google how to hack 7dtd you'll find endless sources.  Any player on this game can hack you if they feel like it.  Wreck your base. Kill you and take your backpack.  The overall idea of the game is great but has been completely ruined by imcompetance with dealing with hackers.  The only way to stop players from cheating is to buy your own server and password protect it. That basically ensures you have no multiplayer experience whatsoever.   I'm moving on to Day Z and Miscreated.  Hopefully the Developers will actually care about their player base and disallow hackers to take advantage of players that grind for good games.			"

								7 days to die had a lot of appeal when it released and part of that appeal was the constant evolution brought by frequent updates. Then a horrible thing happened. Horde Mode was removed and with that a lot of the appeal to some players. Some people don't like to play online but still love to dwell on this great open world, killing zombies and crafting their way to a huge fortress. The A.I. is bugged from the begginning although it has slowly improved. Graphics are middle of the road and have massively improved from what they were. Crafting is by far the greatest strenght of 7DTD and has also improved greatly.Now the worst that could happen to the PC version of this game: The consoles version. The updates to the PC have almost grind to a halt, and it's hard to not notice the console's influence in that matter.FINAL VERDICT: If you are a zombie, crafting and sandbox fan you have to buy it. You just have to remember that the final product is subject to changes that you might not like and is going to be in alpha state for years.			"

								First of all I bought this game on sale with a few friends. That being said, it is extremely hard to get started, come nightfall you will find yourself being murdered by zombies and unable to see, you will be dehydrated with no way to drink clean water thus suffering from diareaha from drinking murky water, or you poison yourself with snowberries because you have run out of food to eat. Regardless of the difficulty of the game I have not played it enough to be an expert by no means or know much about getting a proper start but this game does have lots of potential.For me - this game is a bit too early in development for my liking but others may really enjoy it.I will definitely come back to playing this game maybe in a month or two when the game is further along in its development. That being said, I would buy it again but only while it is on sale - you may or may not like it but its only 11$ and is still an enjoyable game to mess around with.			"

								2 Hours into the game and here is my review.Overall: I like the concept and I found the atmosphere truly frightening, the sounds the zombies make, the difficulty seeing them and ambient music is quite terrifying at times. I would recommend this game if you like the concept and you are willing to support the developers financially. However the games is alpha, and quite early alpha it seems. Therefore below is a list of things I think the developers should work on as a priority.1) Movement and combat mechanics: the way you move and fight is very reminisent of games like fallout 3, it is clumsy and slow, this is bad with mouse and keyboard and terrible with a controller. I think they should improve this first as it will massively improve the enjoyability of the game.2) The inventory and crafting UI and management system: This again is tedious and slow to use and as it is necessary to use it alot it becomes a little tiresome.3)The game textures: They are pretty low resolution even on ultra setting, I think that this game could do with some major update to the quality of the textures.Final Remarks: I think developers get a little hung up on adding new content when they should focus on the game mechanics and how fluid the movement and combat feels.This game certainly requires attention in this area. If I were to score the game from 0 - 10 I would give it a 7 at this stage in development.			"

								Best survival game I've played.  A survival simulator with zombies. I like to call it 'Minecraft for adults'.  It is amazingly fun to be hiding out on top of an old building when a horde comes through and tries to bring the building down.  If you're unlucky and only have a small wooden building to excape to the zombies really will collapse the building out from under you.  Then run or die!			"

								About 80 hours in I'm still nowhere near done playing this game. If you love making forts then you will love this game. Making a fort takes a labor of love and doesn't happen over night like most voxel-based games. Having a good fort means something and is all the more rewarding.I feel a very stron emphasis on the importance of forts in this game which is something I love. The foraging and crafting is pretty complex and fun to work with and will suprise you in little ways.Stuff like making reinforced concrete isn't as simple as a craft menu but takes seperate actions and resouces to make. You first make rebar frame in the craft menu, then you use tools to add a wooden frame around that and then you pour concrete into it. It's much more involved and interesting compared to most crafting/survival games.And this game perfectly encapsulates the surival aspect. There is just so much to this game that I love and the upcomign graphics update will make it even more immersive.			"

Early Access Review
								Although I haven't played it recently I have enough game time on the ""very"" early access to say I thoroughly enjoyed it.           I'll start with game machanics; the crafting system is vast with usefull items pretty much all the way through, you wont want to leave anything behind because pretty much everything has a use some where along the way. The challenge of making molds for certain parts is clever aswell, adding a nice feel to the craffting system. It makes making the more complicated items all the more worth it. To follow on from this, buildings and construction are done very well. Searching buildings is standered, but the buildings them selves look very good for the enviorment they are in. For example the destryed city with it's half destryed buildings look dangerous and with the meterial strengh machanic (talk about that in a second) the buildings look like they are about to fall on your head, be careful. While other buildings like one found on its own in a foggy area look very creepy and mysterious. Construction is fun and simple while feeling really cool and characteristic to real construction. The fact you have to put a wood frame down first that can be destryed easily makes home building effecient and easy. Then using your tools add meterial to the frame, I also had to make frame scafolds around my house to get to certain reaches, very cool. This along side the meterial strengh system where some meterials can reach out further without support than others made building a home with the correct supports very imptortant. This just had a really nice feel to making my house and made it worth the effort.          The zombies! Like I said i haven't played it recently but when I did this was something that kinda spoiled the game for me. I'm happy to fend off zombies attracted by the smell of my raw meat, or empty a house of the masses because there might be vaulable loot inside. But when the game turns into a wave survival game, it gets pretty annoying. At random points the game will throw a hord of zombies to the posistion you where standing when they spawned util they see you. Now, when the position they are heading for is the center of your home, and maybe I'll sneak out the back to avoid confilct, they will happily tear a hole in your walls, look for you, and then tear a new hole out of your home again. So if you dont kill them with guns, 5 rows of spikes (not very asthetically pleasing) or lead them away your home will be trashed. I had 3 hords come attack one straight after another and frankly I was getting bored of it. This is probably the main reason I stopped playing.           The multiplayer is fun so long as you are with friends. The textures do well to make it look nice. And they are always adding new content, they seem dedicated.           Overall I did enjoy this game with the building and scavenging, killing zombies and finding new equipment, crafting tea (too English for words haha) and making molds, along with a very neat mining system that i love. Tis game is all round fun to play, gets some friends on, build a safe house and beat the crap out of any zombies that come near. Enjoy o7			"

								Many years ago, someone gave me a trial disc for World of Warcraft. I was given this verbal warning - ""Call your friends and family, and tell them if they don't hear from you for the next 6 months, don't worry, you're not dead, you're just in another world.""If you buy this game, Call your friends and family, and tell them if they don't hear from you for the next year, don't worry, you're not dead, you'll respawn on your bedroll. There are still some pretty severe glitches. On a multiplayer server, if you face the direction that most of the other players online are, you'll lag if your machine isn't top notch. Frequently the campfire and forge will glitch, and not consume fuel, or allow you to cook, frequently everything you're trying to cook or forge will vanish into the ether. Rarely when repairing a tool, the tool will vanish into the ether. The Easy Anti-Cheat is apparently a joke, a friend recently had his base destroyed by someone flying around with a rocket launcher, we're starting our own server because the game really is about surviving, and helping your fellow man.The zombie hordes will teach you what it means to be afraid to be outside after dark. The crafting system is amazing, you can craft all kinds of things, and even though you may know what you want to do, it could take you a week of real time to accomplish it. In the base Navezgane map, there are so many places to explore, things to find, zombies to slay. It will keep you on your toes, and you'll keep coming back for more, and more and more. I won't give you a pros list, I'm only taking a break from playing it because of item #1 on the cons list.Cons:#1 People are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. #2 if Friendly Fire is on, people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.#3 People are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.#4 Crafting in Forges or Campfires frequently makes you lose all your mats.#5 Sometimes when underground, the world will glitch and you're on the surface.#6 You haven't bought this game yet.In closing, buy the game, play the game, and don't be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ just because you can. Most people are pretty helpful and will happily share what they have to help you.			"

								Based on single player game.This game has improved no end since the early versions. With a new engine and smoother look to the world and a much improved game performance that came with it makes this now a very playable survival zombie mash. Still no real game direction, but there is so much to craft and build and dig and loot that it doesn't really need one yet.The mining aspect is deep and realistic with physics cave-ins without support and one of the largest crafting menus ive seen in a sandbox survival. The terrain is massive with different biomes, desert,forest,snow etc and is constantly spawning zombies, and if you hear a lot of footsteps in the distance, then you got yourself a hoard coming your way.Large towns with large buildings to explore and loot (there is a lot of loot) gives the game a feeling that your always doing something.I've seen some negative reviews about the new look and feel since recent updates and I can only think this is a multiplayer issue because I think the game has never played so good.Not so regular but meaningfull updates fill me with hope that this project will make it through EA to a final release.8/10----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE 16/4/16Outstanding updates have polished the whole look and feel of the game with brilliant new UI and crafting and a very realistic look to the world now.News is it is coming to consoles which does not surprise me as it really is polished now.Good job. This EA title came through.10/10			"

								At first it kind of plays like ""ZOMBIE MINECRAFT WITH GUNZ"" but it's like 20% more complicated than that. There are upgradeable blocks, random giant hordes, weapon repairing, and a lot of frustratingly strong zombies. The only fault this game has right now are some ridiculous bugs and the fact that it doesn't look the best, but it's still in Early Access and is consistently updated. All in all it's one of the better Early Access games out there, and it's a ton of fun.			"

Early Access Review
								i have played this game thoroughly fronta'back, and ill be completly honest. There is almost nothing wrong with this game. Except theres not enough game. now you see i have 209 hours there. what i didint know going in is that i would end up seeing most of the items, and weapons in the game, by the 7th hour. Some of handful of weapons i think in total including all melle theres not even 20, 4 blunt, 2 slash, a pistol, a revolver, 2 shottys, a bolt rifle, and ak, and 1 military grade sniper, along with a bow, and crossbow make up all the weapons that i can think of off the top of my head, besides the rocket launched but you will almost never be using that as i will discuss later.To be direct with this review is to say the game needs lots of updates, theres stuff to do, but as i said in the first 10 hours you will see everything the game has to offer, and the other 190 hours will be spent leveling the skills the game has, that although it has many skills, only a handful of them actually unlock anything. For example leveling the shotguns skill from 1 to 100 just increases shotun damage by around 28%, theres no reload boost, no spread tighting, no aiming speed boost, nothing like that at all.No to go to why im recommending this game. This game is litteratly 1 of the only, if not thee ONLY zombie survival game that isint in a self induced meltdown of bugs glitchs, hacking, and bad design. The guys that run this game do weekly casts of upcoming content, and look to the community for future updates. However.many of the updates never seem to add enough to the game. For a close example the upcoming giant update to the game at this moment would be alpha 15, whitch is going to up the graphics for the game greatly, increase render distance options greatly, add several new basic zombie types, and a few advanced zombies, no new special infected, but essentially zombies in military garb so you have to pop them in the face, some tree house stairs, along with a few new building items, and 1 new trap, now this might sound like a lot, except that 85% of there work time was spent on the graphics and render distance part of the update. The part essentialy no one really cares about. Ending: The game horribly needs at the very least half a dozen new traps, 20 or more new guns of varying types, and class's, several new skills, and update to existing skills to make them more worth leveling. plent of new wearable gear, not neccesarily craftable, but something that doesent conflict with the pain in the♥♥♥♥♥temperature controls, and above all else. The game needs more zombies. not just any zombies very dangerous ones, even the deadlist feral zombies in the game can be brought down quickly, there needs to be many new special infected, and slight detensed movement and feel to the existing guns to make them feel less clunky, or useless. ~jake			"

								UPDATE: Out of all the Alpha/Open beta games i have player - This is the most promising by far.I sort of hate that im playing it so much as it will take all the challenges out of the final release.If you buy an Alpha release game - I HIGHLY recommend this.Over the past few years we have seen a lot of games try and re-create minecraft. Once DayZ came about, we then had games try and recreate that. 7 Days to Die gives me a feeling that these two met nicely. When I first played this. I was not overly impressed. I spawned in a barron land, which made the game look very empty upon first glance. I walked around to find a few cinder blocks and scrap metal on the floor, before having a dog just appear out of nowhere and kill me... Right! *Looks at the wiki, gets a friend, hosts a server*Okay, so as I started playing until now, I feel as ive seen more then just a barron wasteland, the graphics aren't that bad. Similar to minecraft, the game still works on a block system, however, the benefits are the fact walls can go N, E, S, W as well as NE SE SW NW. meaning the fandation work can be a lot more fun the minecraft.I did enjoy the fact the ground was not all as blocky as minecraft either. When you dug a hole, it blended well with the environment, often making trench and spikes fun to play with with friends, as you could make them discrete.I would like to see a lot more pluggins and addons for this game, user content. Possible reskins and remodels on this game could make it very good.My only downside to this game is the random gen world. Each one I have tried has been VERY spaced out, and I am running a couple of km before I find prefabs/towns together. I think if the random Gen world was touched up, this would be very good, as on the main map, I always see myself running to the same location and fortifying it.Overall I give this game a good rating and would like to see a lot more content added over time such as items like gates to be used with spikes or barbed wire to make trap usage better and more efficient.

								So, regretfully I have to post this honest update to 7 days. I've played this game for a long time now since the early versions, but hackers are now ruining this game in multiplayer, just as they did with rust previously.  This is extremely unfortunate because in the early days almost no hackers were encountered in PVP but now it seems like every server has some chinese guy with wierd symbols for a name just killing everyone from the sky, using teleporting, having unlimited inventory, can open and close your own base doors, and all manor of other impossible hacker behaviour.Until the hacking situation is improved in this game I can no longer endorse it as a multiplayer experience. As it stands now, it is not fun to spend 48+ hours accumulating resources and building a base to have it repeatedly either destroyed or emptied by cheats in a matter of seconds.I still recommend if for the single player experience, or you can play on a shared map with friends for example, but it will quickly become stale playing on your own.

I won't give you a pros list, I'm only taking a break from playing it because of item #1 on the cons list.Cons:#1 People are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. #2 if Friendly Fire is on, people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.#3 People are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.#4 Crafting in Forges or Campfires frequently makes you lose all your mats.#5 Sometimes when underground, the world will glitch and you're on the surface.#6 You haven't bought this game yet.In closing, buy the game, play the game, and don't be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ just because you can. Most people are pretty helpful and will happily share what they have to help you.			"

								Based on single player game.This game has improved no end since the early versions. With a new engine and smoother look to the world and a much improved game performance that came with it makes this now a very playable survival zombie mash. Still no real game direction, but there is so much to craft and build and dig and loot that it doesn't really need one yet.The mining aspect is deep and realistic with physics cave-ins without support and one of the largest crafting menus ive seen in a sandbox survival. The terrain is massive with different biomes, desert,forest,snow etc and is constantly spawning zombies, and if you hear a lot of footsteps in the distance, then you got yourself a hoard coming your way.Large towns with large buildings to explore and loot (there is a lot of loot) gives the game a feeling that your always doing something.I've seen some negative reviews about the new look and feel since recent updates and I can only think this is a multiplayer issue because I think the game has never played so good.Not so regular but meaningfull updates fill me with hope that this project will make it through EA to a final release.8/10----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE 16/4/16Outstanding updates have polished the whole look and feel of the game with brilliant new UI and crafting and a very realistic look to the world now.News is it is coming to consoles which does not surprise me as it really is polished now.Good job. This EA title came through.10/10			"

								Well if you are a fan of the scavange/craft/survive formula, this game has it in spades!It's the true evolution from minecraft. And after dumping hundreds of hours into vanilla minecraft and looking for something new to try, this game has not failed to impress. 42.3hrs played in just a handful of days and looking forward to more. (version A15)No, the graphics aren't exactly pushing boundaries. And yes, there are some glitches and bugs still.But the atmosphere, sounds of the weather, your foot steps, your stomach growling, the animal life, haunting music, and zombies....it all adds up to create a level of intensity that minecraft never did achieve.I've begun watching Dev videos and reading news for upcoming planned changes. It's all extremely exciting. And I look forward to dumping hundreds of hours into this game also. I even nominated it for a Steam Award :D			"

Early Access Review
								Im well over 200 hours into this game and have loved every moment after the first initial learning curve.  Make no mistake, the begining of this game is not for everyone and it does take a plan with some knowledge of in game mechanics to be successful.  This is not dayz or lfd2.  You do not go in rambo style and kill zombies right off the bat.  It takes practice and a plan.  The begining is hard.  With that said there is so much opportunity they are recognizing adding tons of different ways to die and ways to survive.  I have owned this game for awhile and did not care for the first few Alphas but now its pretty much one of the best I have played.My GF and i have both over 200 hours in game and love the base building along with the survival / treasure hunt aspects which they are only improving on with every release.Basic premise, you start out naked and alone in the forest.  Survive... the first 20 minutes of your life are probably the hardest and it gets easier as you gain levels, make better loot, etc.  Knowing things like crafting 2-4 stone axes in the begining and checking the durability so you keep the good one can go a long way from being ""wtf this game is impossible why cant i cut a tree down"" to ""oh ok, thats how that works"".  Hunting could definitely be expanded on at the time of this review there are only three animals to hunt.  Rabbit, pig and deer.  All with varying food recipes that you can make like stews and steaks.  Boiled or grilled, etc.  Farming is pretty cool and you can become self sufficient eventually (Baked potatos!!) and growing things like Coffee and Golden Rods really go a long way for making things easier.  Coffee and beer give you stamina regen allowing you to do more things without tiring for a bit while golden rod can help you level, quench thirst and regen stamina instantly.  Its knowledge of the mechanics and a small learning curve.  Once you figure it out this game is deeply rewarding.Base building is pretty good with a lot of options with the objects you can create like wood, stone, hay, dirt, etc.  The physics system is getting upgraded this next release so that will help with the destruction of things.  Its pretty satisfying building castles, houses and bases with moats and wood spikes and other defenses around protecting you from hordes.  One of my favs is placing dynamite sticks around the outside and shooting them when hordes walk by :DThere is a night and day system, the night time can be configured to have zombies be a bit quicker.  One thing about this game is they allow you to tweak or mod anything you want since its just changing a script.  Dont like the dogs?  Take them out.  Dont like the bees?  take them out.  Want more zombies, increase the spawn level.  Tons of options if you modify some .ini files plus they give quite a few tweaks in the initial world setup which you can change at anytime.  So starting out on a easier difficulty helps and once you get established increase it or increase zombie spawn levels.  They are adding weather in the next release and eventually you can freeze to death and the weather will have effects on you.  Desert making you drink more, etc.Like i said, its got a bit of learning curve but it is absolutely a blast and fun ride once you get the hang of it.  Awesome coop game if you just want to play with friends.  I anxiously await every release.  Make no mistake though, this is Alpha and you will encounter bugs.  I have yet to experience anything game breaking but we have had things like disappearing supply crates (the ones from the planes, currently was just fixed), breaking of legs too easily (also just fixed), abnormalities with the voxel system like floating water or floating land pieces, looting of animals broken.  The pimps are usually pretty good about getting them hotfixed but the game could use some polish and we all know that but its Alpha and polish is what Beta is for.  If you are not ready to play a game in Alpha then wait it out.  The forums are great for finding work arounds.			"

								Pros-Lots of content-Fairly friendly community-Both singleplayer and Multiplayer are equally enjoyable-Dedicated developers who are constantly improving the game and fixing bugs-Is a great game despite being another ""ZOMBIES, CRAFTING, SURVIVAL, EARLY RELEASE""-Being a owner of most alpha zombie survival game out right now, this is probably the most realistic one you can buy-The player can make the game as easy or hard as they wish-Many different ways you can approach aspects of survival in-game-Tons of fun-Is well worth what you pay forCons-Multiplayer is not as active as I would have expected, as most choose a random generated map for their server. Therefore in most cases, it's almost impossible to encounter other players.-DOGS ARE OP AF-In order to craft some things in-game you have to find books that tell you how to craft them. This meaning, progressing in-game can be a pain if you are unable to find certain crafting recipies.Somethings to note-I didn't include any cons or pros about bugs because hell, it's still an alpha game so duh there will be some flaws and bugs.-The cons listed where things I personally thought were annoying but none of them came EVEN CLOSE to ruining the game for me.-This is a great game. I suggest playing with friends. I feel as if the game makes the player feel deep within the game.-Lastly, if you are trying to decided between other Early Access zombie survival games such as: DayZ, WarZ, Nether, etc. and this game? CHOOSE THIS GAME. You will be glad you did.			"

In my opinion, this title blends some of the best elements of games like Fallout, Stalker, No More Room in Hell and Minecraft. There's just a little bit of everything for everyone!I would give it an 8 out of 10 on it's current state just because of some small performance issues. There's many work to be done, but if this is how it plays unfinished, I seriously can't wait for the final product.Congratulations, Fun Pimps. Thank you for a fantastic game. You are doing AWESOME!

								7 Days to Die is the perfect example of the generic survival genre, and unlike other titles such as 'Day Z and 'H1Z1'. 7 Days to Die actually includes a steady flow of zombies, and of which are a threat to the player and any other structure and/or establishment they have built alone or with friends. This game captures what many other survival games have failed to execute, a solid crafting and combat system allows the player to feel as if they are in the midst of a real apocolypse. 7 Days to Die, although in need of constant bug fixes, it has a friendly community behind it and a team of tech-perts that are always willing to lend a helping hand to all.7 Days to Die is in my opinion is the best available survival/horror game which is set at a reasonable price. Having been a new-comer to the game I was suprised just how in-depth the crafting system is and how vast the randomly generated worlds really are, filled with nature and resources such as tress, water, wildlife and other commodities.7 Days to Die is my top pick and only (thus far) prefered game in the genre, which is why I highly recommend this game to any fan of the late zombies trend.

								You can build a super fortress and live like a king, or you can accidentally cut a tree down wrong and die. You can kill more zombies than Rick Grimes or you can eat broken glass and die from internal bleeding. 7 Days to Die is about choice, and it is choice that sets this game apart from other survival games.Essentially this game is a zombie survival game, but rather than be like Day Z or other games of similar enviornments 7 Days to Die has a large focus on both exploration and building. The greatest thing about it, is that it forces you to participate in both aspects if you want to survive. The game is brutal. Don't be surprised if your first night i the game is spent warding off 50+ zombies from your tiny refuge inside a local house. And as the game progresses don't be surprised when you're warding off more than that from your fortress built from the ground up by you. Did I mention that this is just the default normal difficulty? The game's difficulty brilliantly forces you to explore the world around you for necessary supplies, while also forcing you to build a safe haven because you won't find one anywhere prebuilt. So now that you hopefully have a basic understanding of the game, let's get a little more in depth. Exploration Exploration in 7 Days to Die is not going to be a big surprise to you if you've played any other survival game ever. You walk around a world and look inside any possible thing in hopes to find something of value. While it may not always make sense (oh sure, killing a zombie dog in real life always gets me two cans of gas), it is certainly rewarding to open up another bag of trash and find that last pistol part you needed to complete your weapon. There is nothing particularly original about the exploration, but it keeps it rewarding and entertaining so there really isn't much to complain about. I will however say that exploration is key to the game, as most supplies you will need to find to stay alive, especially in the beginning. In fact most items you can't even craft without finding schematics that teach you recipes for things such as ammo and armor. So there is always a reason to get back out there and explore, which does go aways to keep you interested in affairs outside your own stronghold. Building/Crafting This is where I believe 7 Days to Die really shines. Where as most survival games are about finding supplies and minimal building, 7 Days to Die is about finding supplies and  A LOT  of building. You are offered a wide range of building blocks and all around construction tools to really create and personalize your own base in ways not many games have. I hate to make this comparrison, but the building is most comparable to minecraft albeit with many more things to create. On top of buildings, you can also craft your own weapons, tools, armor, and accessories such as chairs and tables for your house. Very few games have a fleshed out building system like 7 Days to Die, and to miss out on it would just be a shame.  The World When starting up a new world you have the option of one of two things. You can choose their prebuilt game world ""Navezgane"" or you can choose a randomly generated world. While both are similar in the fact that they have buildings, heaps of supplies, and all different biomes on them, Navezgane is generally a little more organized simply because of the fact that it was hand crafted by the devs rather than randomly produced by a computer. Either way both world types are a joy to be in and produce a fresh experience with every play through. Several biomes are available in the game including forests, tundras, deserts, and burned forests. Buildings are also spawned frequently throughout the world, with each biome having its own set of building types. Admittedly though it would be nice to see a broader range of building types. Many of the houses are essentially copy/paste with small adjustments in a poor attempt to hide the lack of variety. Overall the world is interesting enough, but I'd like to see a greater variety between housing types to keep the game from getting stale. Graphics/Optimization This is probably the game's weakest point. The game looks ok, but far from breathtaking. To give the devs some credit they have improved the graphics dratically from previous builds I've seen online, but some work is needed. Speaking of work needed, optimization is an issue for this game. I'm on a pretty up to date PC that can run games like Battlefield 4 on ultra settings like a charm, yet I still get frequent frame dips when running the game on the lower middle settings. Once again this has improved through updates, and the game is definitely playable it would just be welcomed if the game could run a bit smoother. However there are many bugs that plague this game. While I haven't found any game breaking ones, you will have frequent issues of general things getting wonky on you. The game is of course in early access however, so this should be expected. Combat There really isn't too much to write about the combat in 7 Days to Die. You find or craft weapons to use against massive hordes of zombies. These weapons (as well as tools) must be maintained using varoius repair items to keep a weapons damage up. The melee weapons can be a little hard to usae at time given they require you to come close to a zombie to use them, but guns feel powerful and are fun to use albeit smalll glitches sometimes pull you out of the immersion. You also have a range of explosives such as TNT and mines to use againt your undead foe. Overall the combat is a rewarding experience that may require a little work but gets the job done in a satisfactory manner. Community/Devs The community is fantastic! Any issue I've had was openly welcomed by the community, and the willingness to help out was a welcome breath of fresh air from other games with a toxic community. And the devs on this game at The Fun Pimps are some of the most interactive and helpful I've ever seen. They release frequent patches and updates about progress, ensuring that this game won't be abandoned half way through like so many other early release titles. I have no doubt that this game will continue to grow under their development. Overall Overall this game is a unique and brilliant experience. Whether you love the slow and careful nature of building for a few hours or the fast paced rushing nature of killing undead freakbags I have no doubt you will find yourself having a lot of fun with 7 Days to Die. I've had the game for less than a week and have 38 hours on it. So just make sure you're ready to abandon your friends and family when you purchase this game!			"

								As a side note, I'd prever a ~ vote rather than Y or N, but I'll ere on the side of nice because this has potential.When I bought this game, I figured I'd have a survival horror Minecraft clone that wasn't blocky, but was visually pleasing and somewhat realisitc. I was disappointed on one end of this. The graphical quality right now is a tossup. Damaging 'blocks' does change their appearance notably (Doors loose planks and you can see through them, et cetera), but the actual textures are worse than Half Life. No, Not HL:S, the original Half Life. In time, I hope to see this get some high-res textures, but for now, don't be too hopeful. They have bigger issues than how your rocks look, seeing as this is an Alpha-stage project.The fighting, while I did very little thusfar, is hit and miss, quite literally. I'm not overly sure how this is to work, but with a bow, I find aiming for the head to be quite difficult, and the crosshair is for nothing beyond centering your screen. The damage is seemingly low on even the most basic zombie, and therefore you're very much at a disadvantage with low tier weapons. A nice horror touch to my original idea, which compared this to minecraft at first glance. I'm more apt to play a game where you can't survive the night in the woods by punching everything you see.The construction in this game is amazing. I jumpped right into creative and have not been disappointed in the system for building. There are in fact 'blocks' of material, but you only notice them when you are placing building blocks, at which point you have a green cube and highilighted area within that shows exactly where you will place if you click place right then. Very nice, and doesn't subtract from the potentially beutiful end result when this game is finalized in the least bit.Movement, without the cheat-mode Flight enabled, is slower than the creeping death by old age of a newborn. I visited three separate biomes (Desert, Fallout Zone, and a Snowy Forest of some sort), and decided temperature has no influence on speed, you just are that slow. Maybe getting clothes helps (Yes, you start in your boxers//bra and undies), but I didn't bother with that because I was focused on the creative aspects of this game.Overall, hold your breath for later updates! This shows a great deal of potential, and just needs a few things fixed up here and there. This IS an ALPHA game, afterall.			"

Early Access Review
								Although I haven't played it recently I have enough game time on the ""very"" early access to say I thoroughly enjoyed it.           I'll start with game machanics; the crafting system is vast with usefull items pretty much all the way through, you wont want to leave anything behind because pretty much everything has a use some where along the way. The challenge of making molds for certain parts is clever aswell, adding a nice feel to the craffting system. It makes making the more complicated items all the more worth it. To follow on from this, buildings and construction are done very well. Searching buildings is standered, but the buildings them selves look very good for the enviorment they are in. For example the destryed city with it's half destryed buildings look dangerous and with the meterial strengh machanic (talk about that in a second) the buildings look like they are about to fall on your head, be careful. While other buildings like one found on its own in a foggy area look very creepy and mysterious. Construction is fun and simple while feeling really cool and characteristic to real construction. The fact you have to put a wood frame down first that can be destryed easily makes home building effecient and easy. Then using your tools add meterial to the frame, I also had to make frame scafolds around my house to get to certain reaches, very cool. This along side the meterial strengh system where some meterials can reach out further without support than others made building a home with the correct supports very imptortant. This just had a really nice feel to making my house and made it worth the effort.          The zombies! Like I said i haven't played it recently but when I did this was something that kinda spoiled the game for me. I'm happy to fend off zombies attracted by the smell of my raw meat, or empty a house of the masses because there might be vaulable loot inside. But when the game turns into a wave survival game, it gets pretty annoying. At random points the game will throw a hord of zombies to the posistion you where standing when they spawned util they see you. Now, when the position they are heading for is the center of your home, and maybe I'll sneak out the back to avoid confilct, they will happily tear a hole in your walls, look for you, and then tear a new hole out of your home again. So if you dont kill them with guns, 5 rows of spikes (not very asthetically pleasing) or lead them away your home will be trashed. I had 3 hords come attack one straight after another and frankly I was getting bored of it. This is probably the main reason I stopped playing.           The multiplayer is fun so long as you are with friends. The textures do well to make it look nice. And they are always adding new content, they seem dedicated.           Overall I did enjoy this game with the building and scavenging, killing zombies and finding new equipment, crafting tea (too English for words haha) and making molds, along with a very neat mining system that i love. Tis game is all round fun to play, gets some friends on, build a safe house and beat the crap out of any zombies that come near. Enjoy o7			"

Early Access Review
								Pros-Lots of content-Fairly friendly community-Both singleplayer and Multiplayer are equally enjoyable-Dedicated developers who are constantly improving the game and fixing bugs-Is a great game despite being another ""ZOMBIES, CRAFTING, SURVIVAL, EARLY RELEASE""-Being a owner of most alpha zombie survival game out right now, this is probably the most realistic one you can buy-The player can make the game as easy or hard as they wish-Many different ways you can approach aspects of survival in-game-Tons of fun-Is well worth what you pay forCons-Multiplayer is not as active as I would have expected, as most choose a random generated map for their server. Therefore in most cases, it's almost impossible to encounter other players.-DOGS ARE OP AF-In order to craft some things in-game you have to find books that tell you how to craft them. This meaning, progressing in-game can be a pain if you are unable to find certain crafting recipies.Somethings to note-I didn't include any cons or pros about bugs because hell, it's still an alpha game so duh there will be some flaws and bugs.-The cons listed where things I personally thought were annoying but none of them came EVEN CLOSE to ruining the game for me.-This is a great game. I suggest playing with friends. I feel as if the game makes the player feel deep within the game.-Lastly, if you are trying to decided between other Early Access zombie survival games such as: DayZ, WarZ, Nether, etc. and this game? CHOOSE THIS GAME. You will be glad you did.			"

								You can build a super fortress and live like a king, or you can accidentally cut a tree down wrong and die. You can kill more zombies than Rick Grimes or you can eat broken glass and die from internal bleeding. 7 Days to Die is about choice, and it is choice that sets this game apart from other survival games.Essentially this game is a zombie survival game, but rather than be like Day Z or other games of similar enviornments 7 Days to Die has a large focus on both exploration and building. The greatest thing about it, is that it forces you to participate in both aspects if you want to survive. The game is brutal. Don't be surprised if your first night i the game is spent warding off 50+ zombies from your tiny refuge inside a local house. And as the game progresses don't be surprised when you're warding off more than that from your fortress built from the ground up by you. Did I mention that this is just the default normal difficulty? The game's difficulty brilliantly forces you to explore the world around you for necessary supplies, while also forcing you to build a safe haven because you won't find one anywhere prebuilt. So now that you hopefully have a basic understanding of the game, let's get a little more in depth. Exploration Exploration in 7 Days to Die is not going to be a big surprise to you if you've played any other survival game ever. You walk around a world and look inside any possible thing in hopes to find something of value. While it may not always make sense (oh sure, killing a zombie dog in real life always gets me two cans of gas), it is certainly rewarding to open up another bag of trash and find that last pistol part you needed to complete your weapon. There is nothing particularly original about the exploration, but it keeps it rewarding and entertaining so there really isn't much to complain about. I will however say that exploration is key to the game, as most supplies you will need to find to stay alive, especially in the beginning. In fact most items you can't even craft without finding schematics that teach you recipes for things such as ammo and armor. So there is always a reason to get back out there and explore, which does go aways to keep you interested in affairs outside your own stronghold. Building/Crafting This is where I believe 7 Days to Die really shines. Where as most survival games are about finding supplies and minimal building, 7 Days to Die is about finding supplies and  A LOT  of building. You are offered a wide range of building blocks and all around construction tools to really create and personalize your own base in ways not many games have. I hate to make this comparrison, but the building is most comparable to minecraft albeit with many more things to create. On top of buildings, you can also craft your own weapons, tools, armor, and accessories such as chairs and tables for your house. Very few games have a fleshed out building system like 7 Days to Die, and to miss out on it would just be a shame.  The World When starting up a new world you have the option of one of two things. You can choose their prebuilt game world ""Navezgane"" or you can choose a randomly generated world. While both are similar in the fact that they have buildings, heaps of supplies, and all different biomes on them, Navezgane is generally a little more organized simply because of the fact that it was hand crafted by the devs rather than randomly produced by a computer. Either way both world types are a joy to be in and produce a fresh experience with every play through. Several biomes are available in the game including forests, tundras, deserts, and burned forests. Buildings are also spawned frequently throughout the world, with each biome having its own set of building types. Admittedly though it would be nice to see a broader range of building types. Many of the houses are essentially copy/paste with small adjustments in a poor attempt to hide the lack of variety. Overall the world is interesting enough, but I'd like to see a greater variety between housing types to keep the game from getting stale. Graphics/Optimization This is probably the game's weakest point. The game looks ok, but far from breathtaking. To give the devs some credit they have improved the graphics dratically from previous builds I've seen online, but some work is needed. Speaking of work needed, optimization is an issue for this game. I'm on a pretty up to date PC that can run games like Battlefield 4 on ultra settings like a charm, yet I still get frequent frame dips when running the game on the lower middle settings. Once again this has improved through updates, and the game is definitely playable it would just be welcomed if the game could run a bit smoother. However there are many bugs that plague this game. While I haven't found any game breaking ones, you will have frequent issues of general things getting wonky on you. The game is of course in early access however, so this should be expected. Combat There really isn't too much to write about the combat in 7 Days to Die. You find or craft weapons to use against massive hordes of zombies. These weapons (as well as tools) must be maintained using varoius repair items to keep a weapons damage up. The melee weapons can be a little hard to usae at time given they require you to come close to a zombie to use them, but guns feel powerful and are fun to use albeit smalll glitches sometimes pull you out of the immersion. You also have a range of explosives such as TNT and mines to use againt your undead foe. Overall the combat is a rewarding experience that may require a little work but gets the job done in a satisfactory manner. Community/Devs The community is fantastic! Any issue I've had was openly welcomed by the community, and the willingness to help out was a welcome breath of fresh air from other games with a toxic community. And the devs on this game at The Fun Pimps are some of the most interactive and helpful I've ever seen. They release frequent patches and updates about progress, ensuring that this game won't be abandoned half way through like so many other early release titles. I have no doubt that this game will continue to grow under their development. Overall Overall this game is a unique and brilliant experience. Whether you love the slow and careful nature of building for a few hours or the fast paced rushing nature of killing undead freakbags I have no doubt you will find yourself having a lot of fun with 7 Days to Die. I've had the game for less than a week and have 38 hours on it. So just make sure you're ready to abandon your friends and family when you purchase this game!			"

								7 Days to Die is the perfect example of the generic survival genre, and unlike other titles such as 'Day Z and 'H1Z1'. 7 Days to Die actually includes a steady flow of zombies, and of which are a threat to the player and any other structure and/or establishment they have built alone or with friends. This game captures what many other survival games have failed to execute, a solid crafting and combat system allows the player to feel as if they are in the midst of a real apocolypse. 7 Days to Die, although in need of constant bug fixes, it has a friendly community behind it and a team of tech-perts that are always willing to lend a helping hand to all.7 Days to Die is in my opinion is the best available survival/horror game which is set at a reasonable price. Having been a new-comer to the game I was suprised just how in-depth the crafting system is and how vast the randomly generated worlds really are, filled with nature and resources such as tress, water, wildlife and other commodities.7 Days to Die is my top pick and only (thus far) prefered game in the genre, which is why I highly recommend this game to any fan of the late zombies trend.

I didn't understand how to craft properly or anything I needed to do. However, after watching a video or two, I was well versed and able to survive. ---All in all, in the current alpha version (11.6) I rate the game an 8 out of 10 stars.

								Enjoy voxel survival games? Buy this. Seriously.I thought about buying this game for months before I finally convinced myself to buy it. I don't regret a single penny.With or without multiplayer you'll get your moneys worth out of this game. It's an alpha so don't jump into this thinking it's a polished game, it's not. Regardless of the games current state, it is still an extreme joy to play. Nothing in this game belongs to you. It all belongs to the zombies now. Enjoy fighting them off every night as the bodies pile at your door steps. Better hope you have materials to repair or your nights aren't going to end very pretty.Have fun.			"

								Early access reviews need their own system.  Atm I recommend the game with a thumbs up, it is a lot of fun; however, I give two big thumbs down to the devs.This game makes me want to cry.  Not because it has an emotionally driven story that tugs at the heart strings, but because the concept of this game is pure gold while the devs in control of it are pure horse sh!t.- 6 months between updates (this is not a joke)- never give release dates - must be nice to not have to meet any deadlines ever- game changing bugs that have been around for years- ZERO interest in what the community has to say- ZERO communication through steam- Started console development before the game was finish (further slowing down the process)Just listening to the dev blogs kills my brain cells.  The lead dev is borderline brain-dead.  It is  truly painful to hear him speak some times.I have 1,000 + hours in this game, so I get it: ""you can't rate this game down!"" and you might think so, but like I said, the concept is beautiful, but I am scared for this game's future given that its fate rests within the hands of The Fun Pimps.  Though I will be one of the first to log in when the next update hits, the devs are showing everyone exactly how early access should not be handled			"

								This game is the best bang-for-the-buck title I've ever purchased on Steam.  The developers are doing significant content updates every 3 months, and regular bug fixes every few weeks.After many hours the single player/PVE modes get trivial once you're established and know what you're doing, but the game really takes off when you step into a Multiplayer PVP environment.  Just like on The Walking Dead, your biggest threat becomes other survivors in the wasteland.			"

								Excellent game and one of its kind. Zombies are more threatening, creating a suspenseful atmosphere that no other zombie game I have played compares to. In dead island you can hack and slash a group of zombies, in this game they are just as threatening as Rick finds them in episode 1 of The Walking Dead; it creates the game feeling that survival horror gamers crave. While the graphics arent the best (yet), games mechanics are unique and realistic (if a zombie apocalypse were to occur) and the physics engine requires players to strategically construct their base. I am posting this after having my entire base attacked by zombies and causing my building to collapse, ultimately losing my game but boy it was a thrill. It is very atmospheric and exciting to play, and theres a lot to do. The only downside that really stood out to me was the sheer difficulty of the game. The game is harsh and if 99 things wont kill you, the 100th one will (i.e, you could be going great and so lucky then bam you fell off somewhere and broke your leg, good luck surviving). I could only properly enjoy the game on the easiest setting which I would HIGHLY recommend for new players. While fun, the game is extremely difficult. That's why it doesnt tire - you dont really get to stable plateu of feeling safe and secure even after hours of playing it. There is always the exciting suspense that horror survivalists crave. You are never safe, even in your cozy wooden shelter....And the game is only Alpha. I cannot wait to see what more content makes this good game even better.Would recommend 100%			"

								I speak Portuguese, so probably this review contains grammatical mistakes. I apologize in advance.This review is about Alpha 14.7. The next version (Alpha 15) will add new features!In a few words, it is a survival game about zombies, where you need defend yourself against hordes every seven days. But this game is not focused in building a base in the beginning and wait. On the contrary, it forces the player to explore the world gathering resources, since you spawn with nothing more than a bottle of water, one torch and few medicine. Each new release, the game is balanced and some resources (like food and water) becomes more scarce (I believe that they don't need balance these two any more), giving a better and bigger challenge - just like a survival game would be. There are some RPG elements, where each action gives you experience, leveling up the character, giving points to spend in some stats (or skills and perks, in this case). This is important since every day the number of zombies rises and spawn some harder ones. Also, you will start from pretty nothing and will have a progression path, learning some recipes and leveling up, until you can craft some better equipment (tools, weapons and armor). After a while it is possible build a self-sufficient base (or upgrade the existent ones), with forges, plantations and digging the ground for mining, which stops the real need to explore the map. In this stage it is possible hunt animals but you can not domesticate them (plantations works just fine though). I hope they add some new features to force at least some roaming from time to time (just my gameplay style preference, not a problem at all). Oh! I almost forgot... If you are playing in the default settings, you will need to be very careful to roam at night. Take a look for yourself - no spoilers. hahaThat said, it is a solid game even for an alpha. Not many updates as other alpha games, but the developers usually informs the community what they are doing in each minor release. Major updates only occurs in major releases (from alpha 14 to 15, for example), which will break your saves, unfortunately (I believe it is OK, since is an alpha). Most bad reviews are about the save breaks from release to release. Be advised!It is a voxel game, so, if you do not like, that is not for you. They implemented physics, so take care about foundations! If you want to build a mine, for example, you will need some support pillars. The same goes to walkways and bridges. Almost everything is destroyable... I believe only bedrock (the foundation of the game world) is not. Not sure about the height limits of the world, but is pretty big. The default map also is pretty big in length too. It will take a lot of time to explore and loot all.I'm not adept of high graphics settings in my games, but I see a lot of people saying they are having problems with performance. I play in medium with my laptop (i5, 6GB RAM and nVidia 930M) only with 'no shadows' and it runs fine. Every update and release they are trying to optimize the game as much as they can, so let's hope.As I said, if you keep in mind that is an alpha game and they are working every day to bring some new features and balance the game, it is a very good and fun game. Pretty solid in features and gameplay. I believe that optimization, as I said, is the only bigger problem, but the developers are working hard on this. I believe the game has some problem about some hit boxes as well, where some zombies can hit you from distance even if their arm don't hit you in the animation.It is known that some MAC users are having problems each new release, but it seems like is and engine issue... So, if you are a MAC user, you need to go to the forums and find if the issues were fixed. In the Windows, where I play, I had no problems.Never played multiplayer, but the mechanics is the same.

								Just noticed I never wrote a review for this game..First things first, I only play single player because I dont care for the ""Hunger Game"" like muiltplayer.I want to kill zombies in peace without fearing someone will blow up my home. That being said....Pros-The game is constantly being worked on.-Looks very good, and gets better over time.-Its not easy.-Due to game options you can play just about any scenario you want. Be it running zombies, or walkers.-Items are plenty in variety. -Crafting system is topnotch.-Weather is a threat, you will freeze or burn to death.-Combat is pretty nice.Cons-Somethings are changed that never should be.-A bullet to the head does not kill. Requires many shots.-Guns have a ""Quality"" level, thuse guns can be not that great.-Gliches, bugs.- Zombie dogs.Overall its a great game. Zombies are a threat, and food/clean drinking water can be hard to come by early game. Especially if you spawn in a biome that has no clear source of clean drinking water (such as a desert or Snow forest). I will say this because I think its important to metion. Because the game is under a constant viel of change. Somethings that make sense maybe removed and replaced with something not as nice, then again things that are bad are always replaced with something better.Besides, you have no lived till you survived your first Horde....manly because you will die but that is beside the point.

								I'm crazy about this game! sure there are some bugs but its alpha people... It is very playable and loads of fun. I have mostly played single player so far and it has robbed me of my free time for weeks. I usually play and see how long i can go before dieing. Either the zombies get me or I die from a cavein while mining but its loads of fun just seeing how long you can survive before you become zombie dinner. Crank up the settings if you want a real challenge. If you set the zombies to always run and feral don't expect to last long. You can continue playing after you die you respawn if thats your thing.

								If you were like me you seen the graphics in this game and said nope not for me...but I liked the concept of the game. My brother in-law bought this for me as a gift during the summer sale and I have been addicted ever since. Im going to list some pros and cons of this game in my eyes.Pros-The game play and core concept are amazing its like rust/ dying light / mine craft /day z all mixed together. The crafting and amount of craft able items/lootable items is nothing short of amazing they have really put some thought into a zombie apocalypse situation. Everything from caned cat food to a mini bike!I like the fact that you can dig down in the earth and build a base... this gives you a feeling of security...i mean all major military installations are underground bunkers why wouldn't your base be?You can garden food...but not after a lot of searching for seeds. Nothing is handed to you in this game, if  you are thirsty yea you could just drink straight from the lake but you run the chance of getting dysentery, which takes antibiotics (which are also craft-able) to cure it.  Hunger and thirst are a real problem in this game and ive only played on lvl 3 difficulty it goes to 6 to my knowledge. I play with 3 other people on a private server and we had a hard time with hunger for a while we set up base right next to a water source. But we are just not to the point 17 hours of game play in that we have a garden big enough to sustain us but we still have to hunt. This unlike other games drives your to keep grinding!Every 7 days! Well every 7 days a horde of zombies come to your location on the map and destory everything in sight.. my first 7th night was not bad we read some reviews and put up a 5 deep spike wall around our base not one zombie made it through I was kind of sad I thought it would be tougher Day 14-- keep the same spike wall didnt think much about it...went up after dark and the zombies had destroyed the spike wall and started to dig down to or base!!!Day 21-- We beefed up our base and added reinforced metal doors...it didnt work the feral zombies smashed everything and were still alive in the morning.. about 5 of them we had to go out our escape tunnel that lead adjacent to the main entrance just to be able to kill them it took around 20 shots from a bow each to kill them even after they we already weakened from the  spikes.Day 28-- still hasnt come but ive read up and every 7 days it gets worse and worse. Up until day 49 which its suppose to be the peak. This also makes you constantly grind and gather resources and upgrade you base all the time the first two days after a horde we gather wood, food, etc after that we build the base and loot for blue prints gun parts etc.You can host your own server! This is one of the best things if you have a group you can play with no hackers, no bs, just game play!!!! Cons-Poorly optimized--> I have ran this on both my desktop and my gaming laptops both with Intel I7s desktop has Gtx 970 and Lappy has a GTX 880m.  Both get random lag spikes the 970 really never drops below 60fps. The 880m will drop to around 35-40 but averages around 45fps.  These cards should eat this game up no problem the laptop will play DOOM 2016 on ultra at 45fps. But the devs seem to constantly be updating the game so no worries there. Zombies swim like dolphins when they hit the water you are screwed if you mess up and get near one while swimming you are done for. Random bugs → But its still in alpha so no points docked there!Price of the game I feel $24.99 for this game is way way to high. I would gladly pay $15.00 for a game at this stage of development no problem. If the graphics were better I would have no problem paying $40.00 for a game like this. But that's really my only problems with the game.  Overall I would give this game a 8/10 and a must buy if its on sale! Dont let the graphics fool you of how fun the game play can be! If they make it more graphic this could be hands down the highest selling zombie survival game out there!!!			"

								7 Days to Die is the perfect example of the generic survival genre, and unlike other titles such as 'Day Z and 'H1Z1'. 7 Days to Die actually includes a steady flow of zombies, and of which are a threat to the player and any other structure and/or establishment they have built alone or with friends. This game captures what many other survival games have failed to execute, a solid crafting and combat system allows the player to feel as if they are in the midst of a real apocolypse. 7 Days to Die, although in need of constant bug fixes, it has a friendly community behind it and a team of tech-perts that are always willing to lend a helping hand to all.7 Days to Die is in my opinion is the best available survival/horror game which is set at a reasonable price. Having been a new-comer to the game I was suprised just how in-depth the crafting system is and how vast the randomly generated worlds really are, filled with nature and resources such as tress, water, wildlife and other commodities.7 Days to Die is my top pick and only (thus far) prefered game in the genre, which is why I highly recommend this game to any fan of the late zombies trend.

								Enjoy voxel survival games? Buy this. Seriously.I thought about buying this game for months before I finally convinced myself to buy it. I don't regret a single penny.With or without multiplayer you'll get your moneys worth out of this game. It's an alpha so don't jump into this thinking it's a polished game, it's not. Regardless of the games current state, it is still an extreme joy to play. Nothing in this game belongs to you. It all belongs to the zombies now. Enjoy fighting them off every night as the bodies pile at your door steps. Better hope you have materials to repair or your nights aren't going to end very pretty.Have fun.			"

								You can build a super fortress and live like a king, or you can accidentally cut a tree down wrong and die. You can kill more zombies than Rick Grimes or you can eat broken glass and die from internal bleeding. 7 Days to Die is about choice, and it is choice that sets this game apart from other survival games.Essentially this game is a zombie survival game, but rather than be like Day Z or other games of similar enviornments 7 Days to Die has a large focus on both exploration and building. The greatest thing about it, is that it forces you to participate in both aspects if you want to survive. The game is brutal. Don't be surprised if your first night i the game is spent warding off 50+ zombies from your tiny refuge inside a local house. And as the game progresses don't be surprised when you're warding off more than that from your fortress built from the ground up by you. Did I mention that this is just the default normal difficulty? The game's difficulty brilliantly forces you to explore the world around you for necessary supplies, while also forcing you to build a safe haven because you won't find one anywhere prebuilt. So now that you hopefully have a basic understanding of the game, let's get a little more in depth. Exploration Exploration in 7 Days to Die is not going to be a big surprise to you if you've played any other survival game ever. You walk around a world and look inside any possible thing in hopes to find something of value. While it may not always make sense (oh sure, killing a zombie dog in real life always gets me two cans of gas), it is certainly rewarding to open up another bag of trash and find that last pistol part you needed to complete your weapon. There is nothing particularly original about the exploration, but it keeps it rewarding and entertaining so there really isn't much to complain about. I will however say that exploration is key to the game, as most supplies you will need to find to stay alive, especially in the beginning. In fact most items you can't even craft without finding schematics that teach you recipes for things such as ammo and armor. So there is always a reason to get back out there and explore, which does go aways to keep you interested in affairs outside your own stronghold. Building/Crafting This is where I believe 7 Days to Die really shines. Where as most survival games are about finding supplies and minimal building, 7 Days to Die is about finding supplies and  A LOT  of building. You are offered a wide range of building blocks and all around construction tools to really create and personalize your own base in ways not many games have. I hate to make this comparrison, but the building is most comparable to minecraft albeit with many more things to create. On top of buildings, you can also craft your own weapons, tools, armor, and accessories such as chairs and tables for your house. Very few games have a fleshed out building system like 7 Days to Die, and to miss out on it would just be a shame.  The World When starting up a new world you have the option of one of two things. You can choose their prebuilt game world ""Navezgane"" or you can choose a randomly generated world. While both are similar in the fact that they have buildings, heaps of supplies, and all different biomes on them, Navezgane is generally a little more organized simply because of the fact that it was hand crafted by the devs rather than randomly produced by a computer. Either way both world types are a joy to be in and produce a fresh experience with every play through. Several biomes are available in the game including forests, tundras, deserts, and burned forests. Buildings are also spawned frequently throughout the world, with each biome having its own set of building types. Admittedly though it would be nice to see a broader range of building types. Many of the houses are essentially copy/paste with small adjustments in a poor attempt to hide the lack of variety. Overall the world is interesting enough, but I'd like to see a greater variety between housing types to keep the game from getting stale. Graphics/Optimization This is probably the game's weakest point. The game looks ok, but far from breathtaking. To give the devs some credit they have improved the graphics dratically from previous builds I've seen online, but some work is needed. Speaking of work needed, optimization is an issue for this game. I'm on a pretty up to date PC that can run games like Battlefield 4 on ultra settings like a charm, yet I still get frequent frame dips when running the game on the lower middle settings. Once again this has improved through updates, and the game is definitely playable it would just be welcomed if the game could run a bit smoother. However there are many bugs that plague this game. While I haven't found any game breaking ones, you will have frequent issues of general things getting wonky on you. The game is of course in early access however, so this should be expected. Combat There really isn't too much to write about the combat in 7 Days to Die. You find or craft weapons to use against massive hordes of zombies. These weapons (as well as tools) must be maintained using varoius repair items to keep a weapons damage up. The melee weapons can be a little hard to usae at time given they require you to come close to a zombie to use them, but guns feel powerful and are fun to use albeit smalll glitches sometimes pull you out of the immersion. You also have a range of explosives such as TNT and mines to use againt your undead foe. Overall the combat is a rewarding experience that may require a little work but gets the job done in a satisfactory manner. Community/Devs The community is fantastic! Any issue I've had was openly welcomed by the community, and the willingness to help out was a welcome breath of fresh air from other games with a toxic community. And the devs on this game at The Fun Pimps are some of the most interactive and helpful I've ever seen. They release frequent patches and updates about progress, ensuring that this game won't be abandoned half way through like so many other early release titles. I have no doubt that this game will continue to grow under their development. Overall Overall this game is a unique and brilliant experience. Whether you love the slow and careful nature of building for a few hours or the fast paced rushing nature of killing undead freakbags I have no doubt you will find yourself having a lot of fun with 7 Days to Die. I've had the game for less than a week and have 38 hours on it. So just make sure you're ready to abandon your friends and family when you purchase this game!			"

Early Access Review
								*Review of Alpha 11.6*My hapless survivor awoke in a wilderness next to a beat up car with nothing but a few scraps of clothing to hide her nakedness. She was beaten bloody by zombies time after time, finally holing up in an abandoned lodge in a wood where she cowered overnight, suffering with diahorrea and chilled to the bone by the low moaning of zombies outside the door. It seemed like she'd never find another thing to eat or drink.Fast forward to week 2, and she is now living in a deep underground bunker, mining and forging by night and exploring towns overrun by zombies in the daytime, whilst also working part time as a lumberjack and gardener. Things are certainly looking up!This game is brutally hard to begin with. You will die multiple times trying to figure things out and the first few days in-game are a truly punishing experience. However, once you find your feet and have your defences and life support set up, I feel like it becomes almost too easy. I am still really enjoying building and exploring, but after 30 or so hours I feel I have found most stuff there is to find. For a game that's still only in alpha, I'd say it's really really fun though, particularly if you have an imagination! I've only played solo but I would wager that playing with friends would make it even better.I can see this game becoming a real classic if the devs continue to introduce awesome new stuff. NPCs would really give it a lift, particularly if there were assaults on your base from roaming gangs or something.			"

								7 days...You will die in 7 days...7 Days to Die can be pretty challenging. The zombies are way harder to deal with than zombies from other games like DayZ or H1Z1. This game actually puts a little more focus into fighting zombies and defending your base from them. They're not just all slow-walking target practices, but they actually start running during the  night which makes you actually go into hiding or you'll die.On the crafting side, it's pretty much like Minecraft in that you place everything as blocks. There is actually a pretty deep crafting system in this game and there are loads upon loads of things to make. You can pretty much get creative and build anything you want. However, you better have a good defense or what you build will probably be destroyed during the night.I've died many times. 53 times to be exact. 1 death for each hour I've played, but once you start getting how everything works, you start to live longer. Once you're done building a base and make it zombie-proof however, you may start running out of things to do. So let your creative juices run wild and definitely play this game with friends!See you on the other side.Godspeed!			"

								I purchased this game a long time ago but hadn't really played it much. So fast forward and a lot of updates and I can say that this game is now starting to mature into a great zombie survival game. There is a huge amount of crafting options which allow you to build amazingly complex bases. The actual gameplay feels a lot more balanced and well rounded. Currently I've sunk a number of hours in with Alpha 15 and am really enjoying it. The latest build has added some great upgrades to graphics and crafting as well as adding a number of new locations and zombies. Some things I would like to see added are more weapons in each class such as 9mm, 10mm and 7.62mm. I would also love to see a 12mm tripod mounted gun for base defence. Some more traps would be good as well.Playing solo or co-op is rewarding and better still you can run a dedicated server if you have a large group to accomodate.  If you have been watching this game and had it on your wishlist I can say from my experience that it is now worth the purchase. It is fast becoming my favourite survival game.			"

								This game is what Early Access was made for. It is fully playable, and quite enjoyable already, but the developers will not claim it to be a finished product because they know there is so much potential for it still. They take their time to ensure quality content updates. Although updates can be slow, they are always very large, and worth waiting for. This game was worth its price from the very beginning, and it's only getting more content as they go. Play it alone or with your buddies. Honestly, I would buy this game whether it was on sale or not, and buy copies for my friends, if I could afford it. As far as zombie games go, this is a 10/10, 5 Star, 100% awesome game.			"

								Yes, i can recommend this game.It´s fun.Update, 03/20/2016Sadly, I feel the need to edit my review. For me, Alpha 9 was the last good one, it was good old 7 days. Now, with Alpha 13.8, everything has change.The UI turned to be like the UI of RUST. There is no lovely belt graphic for the toolbar at the bottom, no backpack graphic for the inventory, no minimap, no food and drink meter anymore. You need to run around naked to not overheat, you fall through the floor into the nothingness, until you relog and spawn somewhere in a village full of zombies at night. Nice.Buggy as hell. Characters lying on the floor sliding around instead of walking, wanking animations while standing still, missing character textures, white wall trees. The new zombie animations are nice though.I hope the devs will change the game again to the better. I miss 7 Days..			"

								This game is a lot of fun especially in group of friends that you know. I finally met up with my one friend and we work as a great team. Watching each other's backs as we hunt. The survival is brutal, there is no way to find fresh water until you can boil it and you will die of dysentery, multiple times. If you get hit by zombies you will get infected unless you find antiobiotics and die, multiple times. But then finally things begin to look better and you become more established, but the survival is still difficult. One thing is it is definitely in alpha, in fact we have a phrase called ""getting alpha'd"" meaning sometimes our stuff randomly dissapears when you drop it, try to cook or forge.  ""Ok I'm all set to make 10 blueberry pies, enough to last me 2 days!"" *clicks on cook* *items dissapear* ""Well I just got alpha'd, guess I'm going to starve instead"" Still worth.			"

								For me, 7 Days to Die is the most enjoyable open world survival based game I've played. Compared to others such as Space Engineers and The Forest, 7 Days to Die maintains a good balance of stress and pressure to keep progressing.My only bad experience with the game was when I had my computer hosting a public multiplayer game. A new arrival said hello, then within minutes was sniping players left and right. I got the drop on him and after an insane amount of rounds, killed him. He didn't drop anything, and within moments of my wondering if his backpack just glitched away, he sniped me. The only possible explanation anyone could come up with that we had a cheater in game who simply sought to ruin it for everyone else. So I closed down the game, and switched it over to Private multiplayer game where only people on my friends list can play, and we've been having a blast ever since.I know it's a zombie game in a market flooded with them, and if you look at my library, you'll see I've tried a lot of them. For me, this one is one of the best and my favorite survival game.			"

								7 Days to Die is a great zombie survival simulation game. There,s still a lot to be done in the game (balancing bugs, items, adding new ones), but overall the game is fun. It's possible to play the game alone, but it's better if you play in team. That way, you won't get killed so easily by zombies.I definitely now know the feeling that the Walking Dead cast suffered when they lost everything. 10/10			"

I agree the spawning is increased but if anyone actually read the review of what was done it says they increased enemy and aminal  spawning in the biomes so quit ♥♥♥♥♥ing and deal with it until it's fixed. The additional buildings and the smoke trailers for the airdrops are a nice touch (need work on lessening the effect).			"

								--- About Early Access Experience ---I feel a lot of negativity has been posted on Devs going for cash crabs etc. I am of the opposite opinion and suspect that these reviewers expect a game like this to be done in a year or 2. Please understand many great games are in development for many years. That said...I've played 7dtd since A9 and it's been getting better and better. Sure, there's a set back every now and then when the Devs try something new. But it's always quickly fixed. This is early access done right because:- The devs listen very carefully to community input. I've seen several ideas suggested in the forums that made it into the game.- Development progress is tracked on the tumblr of Joel Huenink, keeping you up to date from week to week on progress.- Progress is fast. I remember it was just a year and a half ago when this game was still block based like minecraft. Now look at how gorgeous it has become. I wouldn't be surprised if they can get the game finished somewhere in 2018.--- The game experience ---The construction freedom of Minecraft with a lot more realism and but not as gritty as DayZ. Already great balancing of gameplay mechanics despite being early alpha. I love how, especially in PVP, you will seriously need your wits to survive and not get your base raided.			"

								So, regretfully I have to post this honest update to 7 days. I've played this game for a long time now since the early versions, but hackers are now ruining this game in multiplayer, just as they did with rust previously.  This is extremely unfortunate because in the early days almost no hackers were encountered in PVP but now it seems like every server has some chinese guy with wierd symbols for a name just killing everyone from the sky, using teleporting, having unlimited inventory, can open and close your own base doors, and all manor of other impossible hacker behaviour.Until the hacking situation is improved in this game I can no longer endorse it as a multiplayer experience. As it stands now, it is not fun to spend 48+ hours accumulating resources and building a base to have it repeatedly either destroyed or emptied by cheats in a matter of seconds.I still recommend if for the single player experience, or you can play on a shared map with friends for example, but it will quickly become stale playing on your own.

								I have to say. This game has actually came a long way since its release. I played this game quite often when they first released into Alpha. If you like building, scavenging, killing zombies, and adventure-like open world: this game is for you!This game has gotten a lot harder to stay alive and involves actual thinking and planning where you want to go in the world. You can die a lot easier from a simple zombie attack or starvation. I like that. It is an extreme challenge. On first release, I could stay alive forever. Dig underground and scavenge towns with ease. Now towns are almost a deathtrap unless you're well prepared, and living away still has its dangers suppply-wise.I give the devs huge props for keeping this game moving steadily. There has been errors along the way, but that's with any game. I have seen more work from them than a lot of bigger games that are still in Alpha today. Keep on doing what you're doing! 5***** from this guy!			"

								UPDATE: Out of all the Alpha/Open beta games i have player - This is the most promising by far.I sort of hate that im playing it so much as it will take all the challenges out of the final release.If you buy an Alpha release game - I HIGHLY recommend this.Over the past few years we have seen a lot of games try and re-create minecraft. Once DayZ came about, we then had games try and recreate that. 7 Days to Die gives me a feeling that these two met nicely. When I first played this. I was not overly impressed. I spawned in a barron land, which made the game look very empty upon first glance. I walked around to find a few cinder blocks and scrap metal on the floor, before having a dog just appear out of nowhere and kill me... Right! *Looks at the wiki, gets a friend, hosts a server*Okay, so as I started playing until now, I feel as ive seen more then just a barron wasteland, the graphics aren't that bad. Similar to minecraft, the game still works on a block system, however, the benefits are the fact walls can go N, E, S, W as well as NE SE SW NW. meaning the fandation work can be a lot more fun the minecraft.I did enjoy the fact the ground was not all as blocky as minecraft either. When you dug a hole, it blended well with the environment, often making trench and spikes fun to play with with friends, as you could make them discrete.I would like to see a lot more pluggins and addons for this game, user content. Possible reskins and remodels on this game could make it very good.My only downside to this game is the random gen world. Each one I have tried has been VERY spaced out, and I am running a couple of km before I find prefabs/towns together. I think if the random Gen world was touched up, this would be very good, as on the main map, I always see myself running to the same location and fortifying it.Overall I give this game a good rating and would like to see a lot more content added over time such as items like gates to be used with spikes or barbed wire to make trap usage better and more efficient.

								Well if you are a fan of the scavange/craft/survive formula, this game has it in spades!It's the true evolution from minecraft. And after dumping hundreds of hours into vanilla minecraft and looking for something new to try, this game has not failed to impress. 42.3hrs played in just a handful of days and looking forward to more. (version A15)No, the graphics aren't exactly pushing boundaries. And yes, there are some glitches and bugs still.But the atmosphere, sounds of the weather, your foot steps, your stomach growling, the animal life, haunting music, and zombies....it all adds up to create a level of intensity that minecraft never did achieve.I've begun watching Dev videos and reading news for upcoming planned changes. It's all extremely exciting. And I look forward to dumping hundreds of hours into this game also. I even nominated it for a Steam Award :D			"

Get it all built up, go roaming around for weapons and ammo to learn to craft them yourself, stock pile an arsenal... then kill all your friends and lock them out of your fortress and declare yourself king of the server.

								Logged 150 hours here. I personally recommend this game. It is a very fun and interesting game that you can play hours on. I am a very picky person when it comes to my games, but I really like this one. It is a very hard game to get a hold of to be good. It is totally worth it after the first ten hours of learning how to rock at it. I like the graphics and all the gameplay except the dogs. The dogs are the bane of my existence. They used to be bearable when they spawned rarely, but now that they spawn all over, the game has become extremely hard. It is a very fun game. IF you have time.EDIT #1: Logged 230 hours here. Alpha 13. I have come to love and hate this game. It was a really great game once upon a time... There were some rough patches recently that made the game quite unplayable. I was rather disappointed considering that this is the game the I have logged the most hours on. It was a great game a year ago, but now it is just a another zombie killing game. I like the new system for building and gathering resources. It is a change for the better in this game. Although, it still has a long ways to go. I seem to travel about three thousand whatevers from the middle and the map seems to become a total mess. There are no rivers anymore. I really liked the rivers; they were able to save my butt a couple times when a horde would start chasing me. The maps have just gotten a bit ugly now. If you want water you might just have to travel ten kilometers to get it. I like that little aspect, but when the only nearest water is a tiny pond that has three buckets worth of water it can get a bit difficult. I may be attached to the old memories that I have of this game frome when I used to play it, but that helps me prove my point here. What I am trying to say is that if the developers really want to make a big difference to the game they should go way back and implement a few new things there. Like the minibike for instance is a great idea that helps me in my gameplay, but can become a nuesance. It is an extremely glitchy peice of work. I was driving to my base one day when all of a sudden it felll through the world and I havent been able to find it since. The dogs still seem a bit over powered but that might be me. And I am going to say the same about this patch as I did the other; you can play this game and you will probably enjoy, but you are going to sacrifice a lot of time learning how to play and adapt to the changes as new updates come out. I still recommend this game as of 1/4/2016. No matter how hard they mess this game up I will most likely like it. It has a great concept and I am a very picky person when it comes to my games.			"

I also like that server owners can make changes to their servers to suit the players and make custom recipes. Im always excited to see the new updates and see what the pimps are going to do next. I can hardly wait for all the plugins that will be written for the game. I dont like that you can,t get away from dogs or running zombies once your attacked. But this is also ajustable.

								7 days to die had a lot of appeal when it released and part of that appeal was the constant evolution brought by frequent updates. Then a horrible thing happened. Horde Mode was removed and with that a lot of the appeal to some players. Some people don't like to play online but still love to dwell on this great open world, killing zombies and crafting their way to a huge fortress. The A.I. is bugged from the begginning although it has slowly improved. Graphics are middle of the road and have massively improved from what they were. Crafting is by far the greatest strenght of 7DTD and has also improved greatly.Now the worst that could happen to the PC version of this game: The consoles version. The updates to the PC have almost grind to a halt, and it's hard to not notice the console's influence in that matter.FINAL VERDICT: If you are a zombie, crafting and sandbox fan you have to buy it. You just have to remember that the final product is subject to changes that you might not like and is going to be in alpha state for years.			"

								First of all I bought this game on sale with a few friends. That being said, it is extremely hard to get started, come nightfall you will find yourself being murdered by zombies and unable to see, you will be dehydrated with no way to drink clean water thus suffering from diareaha from drinking murky water, or you poison yourself with snowberries because you have run out of food to eat. Regardless of the difficulty of the game I have not played it enough to be an expert by no means or know much about getting a proper start but this game does have lots of potential.For me - this game is a bit too early in development for my liking but others may really enjoy it.I will definitely come back to playing this game maybe in a month or two when the game is further along in its development. That being said, I would buy it again but only while it is on sale - you may or may not like it but its only 11$ and is still an enjoyable game to mess around with.			"

								2 Hours into the game and here is my review.Overall: I like the concept and I found the atmosphere truly frightening, the sounds the zombies make, the difficulty seeing them and ambient music is quite terrifying at times. I would recommend this game if you like the concept and you are willing to support the developers financially. However the games is alpha, and quite early alpha it seems. Therefore below is a list of things I think the developers should work on as a priority.1) Movement and combat mechanics: the way you move and fight is very reminisent of games like fallout 3, it is clumsy and slow, this is bad with mouse and keyboard and terrible with a controller. I think they should improve this first as it will massively improve the enjoyability of the game.2) The inventory and crafting UI and management system: This again is tedious and slow to use and as it is necessary to use it alot it becomes a little tiresome.3)The game textures: They are pretty low resolution even on ultra setting, I think that this game could do with some major update to the quality of the textures.Final Remarks: I think developers get a little hung up on adding new content when they should focus on the game mechanics and how fluid the movement and combat feels.This game certainly requires attention in this area. If I were to score the game from 0 - 10 I would give it a 7 at this stage in development.			"

								When my friend invited me to play this game, I chuckled and told him..."" I'm too scary to play a zombie survival game. Don't you remember how pitiful I was as Test Subject #1-9 in the last zombie game you invited me to?"".  He said awww this is nothing like that.  Well I'm still a scardie cat but I'm loving this game.  With my friends showing me the ropes I have actually killed 4 zombies, 1 deer, planted gardens, scavenged and only died twice.  I will never forget the moment we got separated on day 2, it was pitch dark, and I was running like a mad woman trying to get back to them.  Fell in some sort of trench couldn't get out and actually posted in global chat....HELP ME!!!! I'M GONNA DIE.  So many people replied with help and I didn't die:)  Definitely worth a look see, and remember to join the Deadlight modded server, excellent community, polished site and nice props......Gooooooo Gooooo Goooo Deadlight.

								Feels like Skyrim, Dead Island, and Minecraft had a lovely, slightly glitchy baby. As each Alpha update comes out, the variety of things to do and the fun potential increases. Zombies are getting harder to kill, physics more realistic, and the community participation on servers is A+The game itself lfeels more like Beta than Alpha, with a few more obvious weird spots (Strange deer running animation and occasional floating buildings come to mind) Why do I have so damn much fun playing this?It has ALL THE THINGS. Hunting/Gathering? Yup. Plenty of variety in that, plants need sunlight and some need tilled earth, and certain items can only be found by exploring dangerous areas. Building artistry? Have at it! While you can't MAKE floating cities very easily, like is possible in minecraft, there is still a TON of different blocks and rotations and ways they support each other that makes customizing your own place - or building a grand castle - something that is both time consuming and very satisfying. ZOMBIE SLAYING GOODNESS - Hell yeah~ There are normal zombies that take a headshot and fall, and variations all the way up to Feral zombies, who take 10 shots to the head with a pistol, and keep coming at you. Run. Run for the hills. Your armor cannot save you against that horde. EXPLODE EVERYTHING! - With a bit of time invested in mining and crafting, you can build some pretty stellar explosives and weapons - even a minibike now, for faster travel! All in all, even in its alpha stage, this is my absolute favorite game. It has the 'Huge, explorable world with acceptable graphics for immersion' appeal of skyrim, 'EVERYTHING IS BLOCKS YOU CAN BUILD IT ALL' bonus of Minecraft, with lots of scary zombies that you may or may not want to approach, because they could potentially kick your♥♥♥♥♥			"

								I love this game, I absolutely do.  But, recently, my characters have been having missing textures, even being large black textureless charcaters.  I've been meaning to get back into this game again, but for the life of me, I can't anymore, not with this texture glitch.  The game looks absolutely beautiful.  I was shocked.  I didn't expect such a nice looking game such as this one.  I have almost 400 hours now, been playing since Alpha 14 into 15.  I recommend this game for anyone with a decent PC that can handle games like this at medium to max settings.			"

								7 Days to Die is one of the best zombie open world games I have encountered so far. The detail and thinking that has gone into this game is huge from keeping warm to hunting for food and water to keep you alive. The open world is very detailed and has lots of items to loot even more than Fallout. Yes there is a few bugs in this game but non of them game breaking. I would really recommend this game to anyone. I am not a fan of zombie games but this one has changed my mind. Good work developers and I hope you keep adding and improving the game.			"

								Reviewed edited to account for the massive amounts of updates that have been added to the game since I last played.Tl;dr: The devs have taken this game a long way since it was added to early access (for that alone, how many early access survival/zombie games compare?) For the most part the devs have delivered on there promises when it comes to content. This game is easily one of the best survival and voxel based games that I've played. 7 days to die offers a LOT for an alpha game. The survival and crafting mechanics are in a depth that beats most fully released games. The construction of bases offers vast amount of variety and care, and if youre the type who prefers doing so with an editor mode, its an option available to you. Upon starting a game you have a multitude of options to choose from that mark the settings of your world, including the value of loot you can find, the difficulty of enemies (via changing zombie behavior and so forth) and the strength of structures, among so much more.The combat is similar to most other fps survival games, however much of what you can fight with comes from either scavenging or crafting it yourself. Based on your settings things can be found in plenty, though among my friends and I, we prefer a difficult to survive and rarely scavengable outlook. We like to struggle and this game provides that option for us.If you enjoy zombie survival, base crafting, and character development this game has everything you could want and more. Don't let the looks fool you, this game is easily top-tier when it comes to the survival market, which as of late has been flooded with nonsense. 10/10 would recommend.			"

								-Early Access Review-I have been playing this game since it came to Steam, on and off.I have played all the way from Alpha 5 to the current alpha (15). It is an awesome game that constantly gets better.Hotfixes come very fast after a new major update release but when it comes to major updates they do take a couple months, though their major updates bring huge changes and improvements. I especially love that Madmole does showcase videos and a Q&A video every two weeks which really shows commitment to the community and wanting to keep them up to date.One of the developers has a blog on Tumblr that he uses to disperse information to the people, he is also quite active on the forum in answering questions and giving updates on what is going on and on the road map.I recommend to buy this game and try it out, it will only get better as development goes further and it keeps sucking me back in every alpha.

Early Access Review
								Excellent game and one of its kind. Zombies are more threatening, creating a suspenseful atmosphere that no other zombie game I have played compares to. In dead island you can hack and slash a group of zombies, in this game they are just as threatening as Rick finds them in episode 1 of The Walking Dead; it creates the game feeling that survival horror gamers crave. While the graphics arent the best (yet), games mechanics are unique and realistic (if a zombie apocalypse were to occur) and the physics engine requires players to strategically construct their base. I am posting this after having my entire base attacked by zombies and causing my building to collapse, ultimately losing my game but boy it was a thrill. It is very atmospheric and exciting to play, and theres a lot to do. The only downside that really stood out to me was the sheer difficulty of the game. The game is harsh and if 99 things wont kill you, the 100th one will (i.e, you could be going great and so lucky then bam you fell off somewhere and broke your leg, good luck surviving). I could only properly enjoy the game on the easiest setting which I would HIGHLY recommend for new players. While fun, the game is extremely difficult. That's why it doesnt tire - you dont really get to stable plateu of feeling safe and secure even after hours of playing it. There is always the exciting suspense that horror survivalists crave. You are never safe, even in your cozy wooden shelter....And the game is only Alpha. I cannot wait to see what more content makes this good game even better.Would recommend 100%			"

								I speak Portuguese, so probably this review contains grammatical mistakes. I apologize in advance.This review is about Alpha 14.7. The next version (Alpha 15) will add new features!In a few words, it is a survival game about zombies, where you need defend yourself against hordes every seven days. But this game is not focused in building a base in the beginning and wait. On the contrary, it forces the player to explore the world gathering resources, since you spawn with nothing more than a bottle of water, one torch and few medicine. Each new release, the game is balanced and some resources (like food and water) becomes more scarce (I believe that they don't need balance these two any more), giving a better and bigger challenge - just like a survival game would be. There are some RPG elements, where each action gives you experience, leveling up the character, giving points to spend in some stats (or skills and perks, in this case). This is important since every day the number of zombies rises and spawn some harder ones. Also, you will start from pretty nothing and will have a progression path, learning some recipes and leveling up, until you can craft some better equipment (tools, weapons and armor). After a while it is possible build a self-sufficient base (or upgrade the existent ones), with forges, plantations and digging the ground for mining, which stops the real need to explore the map. In this stage it is possible hunt animals but you can not domesticate them (plantations works just fine though). I hope they add some new features to force at least some roaming from time to time (just my gameplay style preference, not a problem at all). Oh! I almost forgot... If you are playing in the default settings, you will need to be very careful to roam at night. Take a look for yourself - no spoilers. hahaThat said, it is a solid game even for an alpha. Not many updates as other alpha games, but the developers usually informs the community what they are doing in each minor release. Major updates only occurs in major releases (from alpha 14 to 15, for example), which will break your saves, unfortunately (I believe it is OK, since is an alpha). Most bad reviews are about the save breaks from release to release. Be advised!It is a voxel game, so, if you do not like, that is not for you. They implemented physics, so take care about foundations! If you want to build a mine, for example, you will need some support pillars. The same goes to walkways and bridges. Almost everything is destroyable... I believe only bedrock (the foundation of the game world) is not. Not sure about the height limits of the world, but is pretty big. The default map also is pretty big in length too. It will take a lot of time to explore and loot all.I'm not adept of high graphics settings in my games, but I see a lot of people saying they are having problems with performance. I play in medium with my laptop (i5, 6GB RAM and nVidia 930M) only with 'no shadows' and it runs fine. Every update and release they are trying to optimize the game as much as they can, so let's hope.As I said, if you keep in mind that is an alpha game and they are working every day to bring some new features and balance the game, it is a very good and fun game. Pretty solid in features and gameplay. I believe that optimization, as I said, is the only bigger problem, but the developers are working hard on this. I believe the game has some problem about some hit boxes as well, where some zombies can hit you from distance even if their arm don't hit you in the animation.It is known that some MAC users are having problems each new release, but it seems like is and engine issue... So, if you are a MAC user, you need to go to the forums and find if the issues were fixed. In the Windows, where I play, I had no problems.Never played multiplayer, but the mechanics is the same.

								This game is the best bang-for-the-buck title I've ever purchased on Steam.  The developers are doing significant content updates every 3 months, and regular bug fixes every few weeks.After many hours the single player/PVE modes get trivial once you're established and know what you're doing, but the game really takes off when you step into a Multiplayer PVP environment.  Just like on The Walking Dead, your biggest threat becomes other survivors in the wasteland.			"

								Just noticed I never wrote a review for this game..First things first, I only play single player because I dont care for the ""Hunger Game"" like muiltplayer.I want to kill zombies in peace without fearing someone will blow up my home. That being said....Pros-The game is constantly being worked on.-Looks very good, and gets better over time.-Its not easy.-Due to game options you can play just about any scenario you want. Be it running zombies, or walkers.-Items are plenty in variety. -Crafting system is topnotch.-Weather is a threat, you will freeze or burn to death.-Combat is pretty nice.Cons-Somethings are changed that never should be.-A bullet to the head does not kill. Requires many shots.-Guns have a ""Quality"" level, thuse guns can be not that great.-Gliches, bugs.- Zombie dogs.Overall its a great game. Zombies are a threat, and food/clean drinking water can be hard to come by early game. Especially if you spawn in a biome that has no clear source of clean drinking water (such as a desert or Snow forest). I will say this because I think its important to metion. Because the game is under a constant viel of change. Somethings that make sense maybe removed and replaced with something not as nice, then again things that are bad are always replaced with something better.Besides, you have no lived till you survived your first Horde....manly because you will die but that is beside the point.

								This is probably my most favorite game on Steam! I love the ability for solo play, as I like to build AND kill alone or with 1 friend. The random gen maps are awesome!			"

								This game is fun! Its fun figuring out how to survive in the beginning then you learn and you can see your skills. You do not need to be a twitch shooter to do great, however if you are those skills will help as you get better weapons. This is a creative game where your planning effects your survivability. this game is varried. Sometimes its an adrenilin rush, sometimes its quiet crafting behind solid defences, and others its christmas and that supply drop gave you much critically needed antibiotics to starve off that deadly zombie bite infection. Plus watching the game develop has been fun!			"

								Great game, very grindy. So much fun looting building after building in some city then trying to haul♥♥♥♥♥back to my base before night comes, and make sure things are ready for horde night. Just when you think you got a great base, have all the supplies and gear you need, the game actually gets tougher. The gears in my head are always spinning when I play this, because you're constantly thinking of how to make things better.Would love to see the devs hire some of these great modders that make really good content for the game. More progress would be made developing the game, and would finally get it out of alpha.			"

								-Early Access Review-I have been playing this game since it came to Steam, on and off.I have played all the way from Alpha 5 to the current alpha (15). It is an awesome game that constantly gets better.Hotfixes come very fast after a new major update release but when it comes to major updates they do take a couple months, though their major updates bring huge changes and improvements. I especially love that Madmole does showcase videos and a Q&A video every two weeks which really shows commitment to the community and wanting to keep them up to date.One of the developers has a blog on Tumblr that he uses to disperse information to the people, he is also quite active on the forum in answering questions and giving updates on what is going on and on the road map.I recommend to buy this game and try it out, it will only get better as development goes further and it keeps sucking me back in every alpha.

								This is an Early-Access, Alpha-type game and it blows other ""finished"" games away! Not only are the Fun Pimps responsive to the public forums, they have put together a beautiful looking game. There's a bit of everything in this game; mining, crafting, building, exploring, looting, shooting zombies, and tower-defense. Play alone or play with friends, this game keeps you engaged.HIGHLY recommended!!!!			"

								So I recently bought this game after being on the fence for a while. Talked about it with some buddies and we decided to take the plunge together. I'm really happy I did, the game is simply put a ton of fun right from the beginning. From being absolutely chickenshit scared about seeing the first bunch of zombies to getting ripped to shreds at the first blood moon, its been an absolute blast.I love the archery, I love watching my buddies get chased by dogs. I love how scary it can be to sit holed up in a house surrounded by zombies tearing at every side. I love having to risk it all to find some water or food, and how the world feels dangerous and unforgiving at times, and how great it can be to get back to the safety of the base I built.Right now im really hooked on the game, and from what I've seen of the upcoming patch it's only going to get better. Furthermore I'm really happy about the openness and honesty with which the devs communicate and the videos of whats to come.Great buy for such a cheap game, definitely recommend.			"

								I don't ever review games but i felt that 7 Days To Die desereved a fair shake. I bought this game in the past and put it down after 10 minutes because the graphics turned me off pretty hard. Needless to say i got my money back. I decided to give it another shot and i highly regret ever refunding the game in the first place. I know i only have 9 hours played at the time of writing this but those 9 hours flew by due to the amount of fun i was having. I have about 200 hours in Ark and another 200+ in the Forest, and another 100 in Rust. I truly believe this game can bang with the best of them. If you can lower your standards a bit graphically and give this game a real shot i really dont think you'll be dissapointed. The graphics really aren't even that bad either. If you enjoy survival games and have not played this yet, do your self a favor and get to it.			"

								At first I was a bit sceptic regarding this game as I'm not really a fan of zombie related games. BUT...as soon as I received this game as gift I was totally immersed to it. The building options and gameplay are superb. You constantly get a feeling of anxiety wondering when you're going to be attacked. Basically the game goes down to building a stronghold to last every senth night, explore the map, build fortifications, traps, weapons, armor, ammo, minibikes etc in order to last as long as possible.Really interesting game worth trying it, good value for money.I would like to move forward in the days to give a more accurate opinion, as I currently have 4 different games running. Can get really confusing remembering what was the status to every game each time I log in :) "

								Based on a true story, probably, i think, maybe, yeah...A dark night, with stars like chocolate buttons twirling through the fog which is falling, a normal night for the fellow survivors of the safezone which might be safe, but probably isnt, this is 7 days to die after all, with time running out, they expend their stamina reaching the hovel they now call home, a reminiscent of life before the suspiciously similar events of minecraft and the walking dead somehow broke out.  The sound of rabbits being eaten in the distance and pigs getting killed by glitchy chunks have shredded the survivors morale.  As the time reaches midnight the survivors check their rations, only to find that they are down to the last can of peas and their last two pieces of corn, the last of the beer had been stolen by some guy who probably didnt survive the night, This could only mean ome thing, the end is near.As the foggy morning rises over the plains of plainland one survivor notices a pig rummaging around their forging area, and he though to himself, hmm, Bacon.  With his thought he grabbed his Rifle and crossbow, not forgetting his handy knife as he left the warmth and comfort of the shack to track and eat this pig.  He followed its tracks for several miles untill he could get a clear enough shot to kill it, and turn it into bacon, He fires, He hits, and the pig runs off like nothing happened, the Survivor is mort annoyed by this and started spamming crossbow bolts at the pig, which appears to be eating them as the bolts are nowhere to be seen, after several hours of this the pig finally gives in and collapses, But what do you know, there is a growling noise not to far away, the survivor crouches down, edges towards the pig, never bothering to look behind him, big mistake, he harvests his bacon, turns around, and there was a FERAL!!!   Demon zombie with an attitude which wasnt very nice.  An extaordinarily tense batle broke out between survivor and feral which resulted in the feral dropping dead with a hunting knife wedged in its frontal lobe, the feral gave what he got back though, as the survivor was now bleeding out and with a sprained leg, night was aproaching on the infamous day 7 he had heard so much about.He was hobbling, as fast as his now damaged leg would carry him, but he did not make it back to the shack, as the horde of many zombies and death doggies had descended, right across his path, how convienient.  a walking buffet the walkers thought, and decided to run towards our dear survivor, While i would like to say that the survivor fought the good fight, he did not, he screamed and ran like a little B***h and fell off a cliff, along with several dogs and angry bloaters, that was the last they ever saw of the survivor, and the last they ever heard, as his screams carried over the night like an eerie sirenBasically, Yeah, great ganme, 100/9/3 "

								As I am typing this, a zombie is making an herculean effort to reach me on this expertly-crafted and well-textured blob of a mountain.  My potato-shaped pack of bandages (which I now affectionately refer to as a ""bandato"") are my only defense in this ultra-realistic simulation (no games here sonny boy). I was going to type more compliments, but I accidentally hit the windows key, and almost closed out my game, but since this game is lighter than Facebook Messenger, I fortunately was able to jump right back in for more zombie-eradicating action. I only wish that I had gotten this game in an earlier beta- oh, I mean alpha v10.1 - so I could enjoy even more default zombie hit sounds and hurt noises, fonts copied directly from Skyrim and an overall highly-detailed landscape laden with bent cacti.I now must return to the game.With love,Sincerely,Yours truly,♥♥♥♥ my life,xXx_IHATEGARRUS_xXx			"

								7 Days to Die is a really fun game and it keeps getting better with each updates. The challenge even on default settings is interesting and keeps you on your toes, especially at night when the zombies go ferals and the hunter becomes the hunted! I like how you can tailor your game to your playstyle, like making zombies tougher, air supplies rarer etc. this can go hardcore in no time. Update 10.3 added more clothing options and character customization it's a nice improvement. Crafting in this game is very well done too and there are not a lot of limits on what you can build! Get caught outside at night when a feral horde is chasing you and feel your adrelin skyrocket IRL!			"

								If I was going to boil this game down to one word it would be ""FUN"".Yes its an alpha and it has its share of issues but nothing game breaking at least for me. The graphics are pretty good and the mechanics of the game are much better with alpha 6 than in alpha 5. If your familiar with the game Minecraft than you will be familiar with this game when it comes to the crafting and mining aspects, just the graphics are much better as well as the graphics engine. The new forging system in Alpha 6 make for more realism and some added complexity but its a welcome change for me. Crafting houses, farms, furniture, farming for food, mining for ore and stone, making your own ammo and weapons are what make the game fun. I can only see this game getting better with time. Not sure what is next on the features list but here is a wish list from me.Some basic vehicles (I have a ton of gas and no chainsaw yet. Maybe a horse!. Or just to get around the map faster when you don't want to walk)Ability to make more furniture and household items. (I saw double and queen sized beds as well as lamps)More faming options (more crops, and tools)Fence gates (just can't keep out those pesky critters)More food and crafted food options.Double doors that work (They seem to be inthe premade buildings but thedon't work correctly.)Boss zombies (know they were listed as a coming feature but just stating how much I would like them.)Ramdom Dungeons (Something to explore. Might even be filled with zombies and that zombie boss)Third person view (So I can take a look at myself) Seems F5 does the trick in Alpha 6.Clothes and hats ( So I can see myself all decked out. Can you say hunting outfits so I can hang around the abandon hunting lodge)Item slots (For the clothes and hat)The only problem that I can see with the game is that the zombie aspects are fun but at night its pretty much death city because there is no way even at the highest daylight to night time period setting that you can gather enough resources and defend yourself. The zombies are way to aggressive at night and seem to make a bee line right for you even though they can't even see you. Its almost like at night they can sense where you are, even when I was at the bottom of a deep pit. If they would not seek you out then the game would be more playable in my opinion with zombies turned on. Mostly I just play with them turned off which also is a nice feature.Grampybones			"

								I normaly dont spend much time on reviews of games becouse i tend to play them, but this game deserves it.Its been what, over 2 years now since i bought the game? I pretty much got it when it got on steam, and wow what a great 2~ish years it has been.If you are looking at a game in early access, you want one thing, and thats propper development.Well stop looking since this game had exactly that and much much more.In the years i played it up till now, this game has always been great, and it just keeps getting better with every update. This review is for version 14.5, but i will also take the development in the past years into account.Ill give an overview of pros and cons, then a summary of when to buy this game, and last some game tips and tricks for when you start off.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pros;+ Large open world, multiple biomes each with a unique feel to them+ Interesting, realistic and versatile crafting system+ Great gameplay (controlls, movement etc)+ Skill and level system+ Good grafics, and music+ Lots of  tools and weapons, for everyone something (melee brawling, guns blazing or stealthy, you can play how you like)+ Lots of loot and building materials+ Weather system, that changes depending on the biome your in.+ Set world, random generated worlds, single player and multiplayer (with easy to set up server)+ Propper development, every update makes the game betterCons;- Its an early access game, meaning you might encounter some bugs, and saved games might not work after major updates. - Loading screen takes long when you start the game up.The few bugs or gliches that i have encountered in the past years are few and got fixed in a matter of days sometimes even hours.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------When should you buy this game?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you like Zombie games, Survival, Crafting, Building, Lots of loot, the option to play the way you want, and a game that keeps getting better with every update, this is the game for you.If i had to compare this game with other games, i would say it reminds me of Minecraft, and survival games like DayZ, Rust etc.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Below i will give some tips on how to start off, beware of MINOR SPOILERS!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Last updated: April 2016---------------------------When you start off in the world you get only the most bastic needs, a bit of water, and food, a torch, and a bandage.First thing you want to get as fast as posible, is a stone axe, the game tells you in a little tuturial what to do. You need to pick up stones laying arround with the button ''E'' or hit some boulders with your fist (left mouse button), then you need some grass, hit it with your fist to pick some up.Then you need wood, any tree or bush will give you some when hit.You can craft the stone axe in your crafting menu by pressing ''TAB''.The stone axe is a multi purpose tool that is your new friend, you can use it as a club to smash zombie heads, use it as an axe to chop down trees, and a pickaxe to get stone.Make sure you pick up a lot of stone, wood, and grass becouse you will be making lots of stone axes.You might want a save way to kill a zombie here and there, the bow is a cheap and easy item for this.You will need some wood, and grass to build the bow, the arrows can be made with stone, wood and feathers.Feathers can be found in bird nest that are scattered on the floor here and there (and in or on some buildings)Food/Water; you can fill glass bottles and empty cans with water from rivers and lakes, also you can cook the water on a campfire so you wont get sick. Food can be cooked in different ways, altough not all food needs to be cooked to savely eat it, all canned food can be eaten right away.Surviving is your main priority at the start of the game, you want to loot as much as you can and stay away from zombies, getting hurt early in the game is a bad idea, and dieing (if you dont have perma death on) will lower your wellness, wich is the maximum hitpoints and stamina you have.Only take out the lone zombie here and there if they are in the way of a building you want to loot, by using a bow and/or using the hit and run tacktic. Try hitting zombies in the head.You can find Cloth fragment by looting, breaking down clothing you find, and by crafting it from cotton plants (those bushes with white fluffy balls on it). You will need it for making bandages, and first aid bandages in case you get hurt.Where to survive your first night: Its best to find 2-4 buildings together, and choose the highest one. There you would want to make your first base at the top floor or roof. While one of the  buildings will be your starting base, the other buildings can provide food and materials to survive.If you play with a seed or random generated game, you might have to do with what you find, always try to be from the ground so zombies cant reach you straight away. (shops have a flat roof with a ladder at the back and will do just fine)Every 3 days, unless set differently a plane will fly over and drop a supply crate, this always contains resources like antibiotics, medkits and sometimes other suplies. If you get infected you have 3 days to live unless you take antibiotics or honey, so make sure you get that crate, since its a great help.Usefull loot: Canned food, Water, Medical suplies, Mining helmet (great protection and flashlight that you can turn on with ''F'')Tips!If you are having trouble with surviving at night, instead of setting the dificulty lower, you can also set the zombies to always walk. As default the zombies run when its dark and walk when in (day) light. I always have them set to walk becouse it feels to me like zombies should walk.This however does not affect zombie dogs.Dont go into cities or any big cluster of buildings, more zombies and also stronger zombies spawn here.Every 7 days at night time a horde will come for you, if you are having trouble with them or find them anoying, either keep moving when they come or go back to menu when they have spawned and then go back into the game, and they will be gone.___________________________________________I hope this review was usefull to you.

								Day 1 - I'm alone in the snowy wilderness with nothing on me but my underwear. Must of been one heck of a night, but that's over with. I rip what little weeds are around me from the ground, pick up a stone, and punch some shrubbery to make a simple stone axe. From here I can scavenge and forage until I find enough to make some bows and arrows. Night is coming, so I decide to crash into an old semi-abandoned lumber mill...just have to clear out the frozen lumberjacks first...Day 2 - I scavenge the nearby areas for supplies, while honing my skills with a bow and arrow on frostbitten zombies. There's a nice lake with some cabins, and a big hunting lodge in the other direction. I take what I need and crash at the lumber mill. I fortify it a bit to help out at night. Day 3 - A dog bit me and infected me. I will die without antibiotics in roughly 3 days. I need to find them fast. I scavenge some more, but no luck. I board up all the windows to the 2 story house next to the lumber mill and add a shooting platform out back. Day 4 - The infection has spread; I must leave to find medicine. My health is dropping slowly...but dropping. After a while, I stumble upon a holy grail of weapons - the Shotgun store in the frigid wasteland. They must cater to hunters. I manage to find an antibiotic and clear the infection. Zombies are everywhere, but things are looking up. I have weapons to even the playing field.Day 5 - I scavenege for supplies only to come across what looks to be like a small military outpost. It's abandoned except for a few zombies throwing themselves on landmines for some reason. I take all 66 landmines and bring them back home. Suprisingly there were no weapons in the outpost. It was much to open-air for my taste, so I bring everything of use back to my lumber castle.Day 6 - I spend the day gathering supplies to build additions to my wooden fortress. I build a forge, smelt metal and craft better tools and improve my weapons. I place landmines all around my house and dig trenches. Day 7 - An ominous feeling of dread approaches in the morning. I don't want to go out. I don't want to leave my house, so I spend the day adding mazes of wood to herd hostiles into landmines and trenches. This is oddly relaxing, but the feel of dread approaches. Night 7 - I stand on my shooting platform and watch the sun go down over my minefield and oil drums scattered in the snow. If I had a cigarrette, I'd smoke it. I wait, and wait, but nothing happens. Midnight approaches, and still nothing. I am getting on edge each minute, but still nothing but silence. At 3am, I step away from my shooting platform and head for the door to go in when I hear a dog growl. It shrieked in pain as it slammed against wooden spikes below me. I turned around to see 50 zombies running at full speed. Charging through my landmines and blowing their faces off just to make me bleed. I shoot some oil drums nearby and take out about a dozen. Ten more were unfortunate enough to step on landmines. Another dozen impaled themselves on spikes as their undead comrades climbed their bodies to try and reach me. I pull out a shotgun and shoot wildly at any survivors. An hour passes of rampage and carnage, but I survive. My fortress pulled through as well. I pack up everything and decide to move to greener pastures.Day 8 - I am a zombie slayer. I have survived against hordes, dogs, and everything else I have come across. I pack up and leave my lovely winter fortress to explore. I pass through lovely forests, deserts, and some sort of charred ground shooting every zombie I come across. Nothing can stop me. I make it to the ruins of a city and start looking for a good place to set up for the night. I shoot a few zombies, nothing I can't handle. I see a movie theatre that looks pretty fortified, so I break down the doors. More zombies aproach, but I take them out. I break down the doors and hear dogs. One jumps on me before I can get a shotgun blast off. More zombies bang on the doors all around me. I run around the corner and come face to face with 3 more zombies. One shotgun blasts drops all three. Another dog lunged at me and caused me to bleed. I took him down but need to heal or I will bleed out. I run around the corner to the theater room. The emergency exit door busts open and 4 zombies come in. I shoot them and head up the stairs to bandage myself. I can see a dozen rotten bodies slowly approach me from the bottom of the stairs of the movie room. I pull out the bandages and first aid kits from my inventory. The last thing I hear is glass shattering from above me, and a famished shout as undead arms grab me from behind. I didn't have the high ground...TLDR - This game is in alpha stage, but it is extremely fun. The graphics aren't great yet, but I have seen developer posts of really good graphics, so I assume they will be implemented at some point (beta or later). Basically all you need to know if you should buy this game.Do you like crafting and building games like minecraft?Do you like tower defense games?Do you like open world exploration games like skyrim?If you answered yes to all 3, then you will like this game. There will be story lines and npc quests in later updates, but none are in the game so far. That said, this game is very fun even without those things.			"

								I normaly dont spend much time on reviews of games becouse i tend to play them, but this game deserves it.Its been what, over 2 years now since i bought the game? I pretty much got it when it got on steam, and wow what a great 2~ish years it has been.If you are looking at a game in early access, you want one thing, and thats propper development.Well stop looking since this game had exactly that and much much more.In the years i played it up till now, this game has always been great, and it just keeps getting better with every update. This review is for version 14.5, but i will also take the development in the past years into account.Ill give an overview of pros and cons, then a summary of when to buy this game, and last some game tips and tricks for when you start off.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pros;+ Large open world, multiple biomes each with a unique feel to them+ Interesting, realistic and versatile crafting system+ Great gameplay (controlls, movement etc)+ Skill and level system+ Good grafics, and music+ Lots of  tools and weapons, for everyone something (melee brawling, guns blazing or stealthy, you can play how you like)+ Lots of loot and building materials+ Weather system, that changes depending on the biome your in.+ Set world, random generated worlds, single player and multiplayer (with easy to set up server)+ Propper development, every update makes the game betterCons;- Its an early access game, meaning you might encounter some bugs, and saved games might not work after major updates. - Loading screen takes long when you start the game up.The few bugs or gliches that i have encountered in the past years are few and got fixed in a matter of days sometimes even hours.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------When should you buy this game?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you like Zombie games, Survival, Crafting, Building, Lots of loot, the option to play the way you want, and a game that keeps getting better with every update, this is the game for you.If i had to compare this game with other games, i would say it reminds me of Minecraft, and survival games like DayZ, Rust etc.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Below i will give some tips on how to start off, beware of MINOR SPOILERS!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Last updated: April 2016---------------------------When you start off in the world you get only the most bastic needs, a bit of water, and food, a torch, and a bandage.First thing you want to get as fast as posible, is a stone axe, the game tells you in a little tuturial what to do. You need to pick up stones laying arround with the button ''E'' or hit some boulders with your fist (left mouse button), then you need some grass, hit it with your fist to pick some up.Then you need wood, any tree or bush will give you some when hit.You can craft the stone axe in your crafting menu by pressing ''TAB''.The stone axe is a multi purpose tool that is your new friend, you can use it as a club to smash zombie heads, use it as an axe to chop down trees, and a pickaxe to get stone.Make sure you pick up a lot of stone, wood, and grass becouse you will be making lots of stone axes.You might want a save way to kill a zombie here and there, the bow is a cheap and easy item for this.You will need some wood, and grass to build the bow, the arrows can be made with stone, wood and feathers.Feathers can be found in bird nest that are scattered on the floor here and there (and in or on some buildings)Food/Water; you can fill glass bottles and empty cans with water from rivers and lakes, also you can cook the water on a campfire so you wont get sick. Food can be cooked in different ways, altough not all food needs to be cooked to savely eat it, all canned food can be eaten right away.Surviving is your main priority at the start of the game, you want to loot as much as you can and stay away from zombies, getting hurt early in the game is a bad idea, and dieing (if you dont have perma death on) will lower your wellness, wich is the maximum hitpoints and stamina you have.Only take out the lone zombie here and there if they are in the way of a building you want to loot, by using a bow and/or using the hit and run tacktic. Try hitting zombies in the head.You can find Cloth fragment by looting, breaking down clothing you find, and by crafting it from cotton plants (those bushes with white fluffy balls on it). You will need it for making bandages, and first aid bandages in case you get hurt.Where to survive your first night: Its best to find 2-4 buildings together, and choose the highest one. There you would want to make your first base at the top floor or roof. While one of the  buildings will be your starting base, the other buildings can provide food and materials to survive.If you play with a seed or random generated game, you might have to do with what you find, always try to be from the ground so zombies cant reach you straight away. (shops have a flat roof with a ladder at the back and will do just fine)Every 3 days, unless set differently a plane will fly over and drop a supply crate, this always contains resources like antibiotics, medkits and sometimes other suplies. If you get infected you have 3 days to live unless you take antibiotics or honey, so make sure you get that crate, since its a great help.Usefull loot: Canned food, Water, Medical suplies, Mining helmet (great protection and flashlight that you can turn on with ''F'')Tips!If you are having trouble with surviving at night, instead of setting the dificulty lower, you can also set the zombies to always walk. As default the zombies run when its dark and walk when in (day) light. I always have them set to walk becouse it feels to me like zombies should walk.This however does not affect zombie dogs.Dont go into cities or any big cluster of buildings, more zombies and also stronger zombies spawn here.Every 7 days at night time a horde will come for you, if you are having trouble with them or find them anoying, either keep moving when they come or go back to menu when they have spawned and then go back into the game, and they will be gone.___________________________________________I hope this review was usefull to you.

								This game is really good. I'm a huge survival game fan and I can't wait for the game to be finished. What i like most is how open the world is with a nice sandbox feel to it, the buffs and debuffs are a great idea and the options for making your server into the world that you chose is really nice.I dont have much complaints or dislikes but the new Heat Map system is kinda messed up, would be nice if i could see on the map what kind of heat I am generating. that would make a big difference. It seems it doesnt matter if your campfires or forges are hidden and your queit as a mouse...you still get hordes. The horde size should scale based on your heat map.			"

I've played too many of this type of game and was sick of this format. I am glad that my buddy made me buy this because it is honestly fun. Only encountered a few bad bugs. I am excited to see what this game will turn into by completion.			"

								Extremely fun to play crafting survival game where you get to fight a zombie horde (that you can't hide from) every 7 days.Between the hordes you will be scavenging, gathering materials and upgrading your base/tools/equipment. This happens in a huge open world map that zombies spawn/roam in. There are also roaming hordes that wander around. There are also different types of mines on ground (tin cans, hubcaps etc.), so watch your step.The game uses a skill system where you have skills for making tools, weapons, gathering materials etc. and using them. These skills are trained either by doing activities associated to said skills or by spending skill points. At the start collecting materials is going to take some time, but it gets better after a short while.There are also skill perks that can only be trained by using skill points, so it's advised to save your skill points for these. Notable ones include being able to produce concrete and steel.You can make the game either easier or harder by changing various settings that include zombie spawn rate, amount of loot, daytime lenght and zombie movement. By default zombies only run at night, but that can be changed.Bugs. Lots of them. Not surprising for a game that is in Alpha state, but the game is in an excellent condition for it's state.The game is also very easily moddable, which unfortunately makes cheating easier, too.			"

								I bought this game somewhere around Alpha 12, and it has gone from strength to strength ever since. It has everything a zombie survival game should have and a whole lot more to boot, which includes :-•	A great variety of weapons and armour to suit a number of play styles.•	The ability to construct any base your imagination can conceive, above or below ground.•	A levelling up system that allows you to specialise in certain weapon or armour types.•	The ability to improve your crafting, construction and mining skills.•	The flexibility to hunt for food or grow your own.•	A large predetermined map with the option to play a randomly generated one.•	The impetus to prepare for the inevitable horde every 7 days, lest you be caught off guard.I could go on, however the point is this game is fantastic, adaptive and a must for anybody who is a fan of the genre. People often complain about how slow updates are being released, about how a console version was released before it was finished in order to make money etc. Guess what? That is how small development teams, like The Fun Pimps, have to operate in order to survive and to continue game development and production. The game can be buggy in places and glitchy in others, but so what, it is in Alpha after all and they rely on player feedback to help them iron out the creases. I have 273.9 hours of play time at the time of writing this review and I will add many more to that total as time goes on. I can't recommend this game enough, just bare with the progress and I know we'll all be rewarded in the end.Update-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Having watched the weekly Q&A YouTube sessions and Alpha 16 updates from one of The Fun Pimps development team, Mad Mole, it is clear to see that the game will definitely have the experience enhanced. Additions in future Alpha's include electricity, enhanced base defence options, different modes of transport and alternative ways to gather food; this is only a small selection of the additions to the game so I would recommend going to YouTube and seeing for yourself.

								I played rust and it has a lees polished look that rust has.Gameplay is cool and you can find ways to hide your base from raids. Zombies are cool, not really excited about the ""Every 7th day"" a horde comes by and kicks the living crap out of your house and you really can't respawn cause they will just kick the crap out of you again and your nude. This causes people to do one of two things, they will log off and the game stops for a half hour while erveyone waits it out or people give it a shot (rare) and end out dying most of the time.Crafting is complex and will take more than 20hrs to grab enough to build a house and maintain yourself (water, food, Health). Good game and a nice difference from Rust.			"

								Well for a start i have been playing Dayz alot the real dayz. When the Epoc came to the game well that was awsome you could build a ♥♥♥♥ing base. That was great but well it was kinda strict how you could build. But you could build a relly nice base against other players.But here i 7 days to die , You relly just need your fantasy and you will have a great time. So far i have only been playing PVE in this game i think that enough. For me Dayz its more for PVP and 7 days for PVE. For the 1 week cycle of blood moon and horde system etc etc. Well do you like to build and kill zombies you should try this game out. Been playing like 100 hours on just one base so far. Took over a prison and did a ""upgrade"" on it.10/10 for the building and zombie slaying.			"

								If you like Minecraft, but also want to be mercilessly hunted by hordes of the undead, this is the game for you. While enjoyable by yourself, I'd recommend playing with a group of friends to improve your chances of survival. There is a bit of a learning curve, so don't get upset when you die again and again until you get the hang of crafting, combat, construction, and character developement. 10/10 would recommend.			"

								Very good overall and has many updates because of the active developers working on this game. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes Minecraft because this game is pretty much a realisitic version of it. The only problem I may say is that although they have added objectives recently the game is still too boring to play on your own, due to the amount of time you have to waste and is something like an 1 hr+ to get to another biome because the map is very massive, so take this into consideration before buying, if you havn't got any friends who play this game or aren't willing to buy the game, due to the high price of it then don't buy the game.

								Had to update my review again. I came back to this game after a year away and the dev team keep making this game better and better. It still receives major updates, and the player base is still huge. By far the best zombie survival, and possibly best overall survival game on steam.Very highly recommend 7 Days to Die. Even with a lower-end machine, it is still very playable. With a better machine, it looks and plays downright fantastic. Find a good modded server (deadlights) and you'll find the game to be even more involved, with more to build, craft and explore.			"

								Addictive and fun with a tough early learning curve for those new to zombie survival and block crafting games. The game can be best described as minecraft meets DayZ. Can host your own game to play by yourself and invite friends or join other pve and pvp servers. Crafting is deep and rewarding often soaking up large amounts of your time and attention. Surviving is fun on your own and with friends. Game is still early access at this time but it is polished and complex enough to be very much playable. It's updated regularly and there are tons of resources on the internet to guide you along the games progress. Highly recommended			"

								Just finished my first session with the game, first impression: It's like RUST without the stupid blueprints that severely cripple solo players, and like DayZ but with a PVE element that's actually challenging. And the crafting seems to be more advanced compared to said games. Safe to say I like the game so far, my only gripe is I have some frame drop issues, this may be due to poor optimization. Yeah, yeah, it's pre alpha. 7.5/10 so far, and I assume it will only get better as it develops. In my opinion, one of the better survival MMO's, and may just yet be the best one I've played.			"

								7 Days to Die is a brutal and unforgiving game where the player must survive against countless zombies in harsh environments. The fact that the game incorporates a hunger and hydration system adds to the survive theme as well as overall health and stamina. With multiplayer also available you and your friends can take on all the zombie hordes you desire, hours of fun! The crafting system in this game is a little tricky but you should not let that discourage you, put a little time into it and you can build pretty much any kind of structure you want to survive the zombie apocalypse in, however, the building mechanics have real physics so build carefully because your structure will collapse under the many loads you have applied. The game also includes a map pre-made but now you have the option to randomly generate a map for you to fully explore and discover new and interesting locations. Despite this game being in alpha, the development team works very hard to add new content as well as working tirelessly to remove any bugs that might arise.Overall I give this game a 9/10 but it receives a 10/10 for survival fun.If you are looking for a good zombie + survival + horror + crafting + multiplayer, buy this game and have some fun!- Dovah Vick.

								Very good overall and has many updates because of the active developers working on this game. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes Minecraft because this game is pretty much a realisitic version of it. The only problem I may say is that although they have added objectives recently the game is still too boring to play on your own, due to the amount of time you have to waste and is something like an 1 hr+ to get to another biome because the map is very massive, so take this into consideration before buying, if you havn't got any friends who play this game or aren't willing to buy the game, due to the high price of it then don't buy the game.

								I sincerley belive that the devs of this and other survival games have ever actually been outside. My favourite features of this game are 1: Stunned, stunned is a great feature becuase it only seems to work when I'm 10 feet away from the ♥♥♥♥ing zombie 10/10 fun. 2: Overheating, this one is probably my favourite I love being a fresh spawn player in the burnt forest wearing only a pair of shades, a coebo hat, and banndana (-15 insulation) and i'm still ♥♥♥♥ing overheating. Seriously fix/remove this. 3: Bleeding, This isn't really a bad idea but every person in this game have around 700 spikes each and you are bound to walk into them, I have used more health items healing myself from walking out my ♥♥♥♥ing door than actually fighting zombos. 4: Zombie Health, Most zombie games have a rule, shot em' in the head and they're ded. Not this one, there is nothing more immersive than shooting a zombie 6 times in the head with a 9mm pistol 3 feet away from it only for it to fall over, get back up stun you and then get you down to 30 health. This isn't so much a problem later in the game, except for ferals. ♥♥♥♥ing ferals. I get they are ment to be a challange but when it takes 5 ♥♥♥♥ing rockets directly and 20 sniper rounds, it gets kind of out of hand. 5: Loot, I no longer open gun safes. It is not worth it to waste even a little bit of durability and time on opening these ♥♥♥♥ing things that seem to only contain ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pistol parts. I have found far far more guns in toilets than I have in gunsafes. The figure is probably around Gunsafe 0, Toilet 15. Before the bombs fell everyone made sure to lock all their gun safes but take out all the guns and throw them in the toiletEven after all that I would still recommend this game, but not for 20 pounds. Buy it on sale idk if it's a beta. These ♥♥♥♥ers seem more intrested in porting this game to console, than actually finishing it. Still fun though, unless you have no friends and then ♥♥♥♥ you becuase u are KOS			"

Early Access Review
								This was my first survival horror game on PC. After a friend convinced me to purchase it we have continually come back to explore the new additions and updates when they come out. I believe we started playing on alpha 10 or 11 and after many changes we still come back and enjoy this game. The gameplay is very basic. You start out with very few things and must find resources and set up a base. You have to keep track of basic hunger and thirst stats and recently temperature. Other stats like wellness determine how healthy your character is and other illnesses like dysentary, infection, or a broken ankle can heavily hinder or kill your character. Day time will be spent gathering resources and exploring and night is usually spent huddled in your house or base hoping you don't attract attention from a passing hoard. There are two map variations, one premade by the devs and one randomly generated. There is plenty of exploration and is highly encouraged to find food, weapons, or the ever elusive calipers. The crafting options have only gotten larger and better and later in game when you're not worrying about dysentary you can build and customize a fortress to withstand any hoard. I'd like to mention I never actually play this game solo. For a fully enjoyable experience play with some friends. In every new game we play the first few nights are a scramble as we rush to find each other and set up a base to keep ourselves safe from the night. After playing many new games the first week or two in game are definitely more fun. Eventually when you find better weapons and have a system going things get pretty easy and the game loses it's luster. However with the newest updates adding quests and new materials to craft the end game stays interesting for a little longer. Overall I would highly recommend this game. It only keeps getting better.			"

								Extremely fun to play crafting survival game where you get to fight a zombie horde (that you can't hide from) every 7 days.Between the hordes you will be scavenging, gathering materials and upgrading your base/tools/equipment. This happens in a huge open world map that zombies spawn/roam in. There are also roaming hordes that wander around. There are also different types of mines on ground (tin cans, hubcaps etc.), so watch your step.The game uses a skill system where you have skills for making tools, weapons, gathering materials etc. and using them. These skills are trained either by doing activities associated to said skills or by spending skill points. At the start collecting materials is going to take some time, but it gets better after a short while.There are also skill perks that can only be trained by using skill points, so it's advised to save your skill points for these. Notable ones include being able to produce concrete and steel.You can make the game either easier or harder by changing various settings that include zombie spawn rate, amount of loot, daytime lenght and zombie movement. By default zombies only run at night, but that can be changed.Bugs. Lots of them. Not surprising for a game that is in Alpha state, but the game is in an excellent condition for it's state.The game is also very easily moddable, which unfortunately makes cheating easier, too.			"

								I bought this game somewhere around Alpha 12, and it has gone from strength to strength ever since. It has everything a zombie survival game should have and a whole lot more to boot, which includes :-•	A great variety of weapons and armour to suit a number of play styles.•	The ability to construct any base your imagination can conceive, above or below ground.•	A levelling up system that allows you to specialise in certain weapon or armour types.•	The ability to improve your crafting, construction and mining skills.•	The flexibility to hunt for food or grow your own.•	A large predetermined map with the option to play a randomly generated one.•	The impetus to prepare for the inevitable horde every 7 days, lest you be caught off guard.I could go on, however the point is this game is fantastic, adaptive and a must for anybody who is a fan of the genre. People often complain about how slow updates are being released, about how a console version was released before it was finished in order to make money etc. Guess what? That is how small development teams, like The Fun Pimps, have to operate in order to survive and to continue game development and production. The game can be buggy in places and glitchy in others, but so what, it is in Alpha after all and they rely on player feedback to help them iron out the creases. I have 273.9 hours of play time at the time of writing this review and I will add many more to that total as time goes on. I can't recommend this game enough, just bare with the progress and I know we'll all be rewarded in the end.Update-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Having watched the weekly Q&A YouTube sessions and Alpha 16 updates from one of The Fun Pimps development team, Mad Mole, it is clear to see that the game will definitely have the experience enhanced. Additions in future Alpha's include electricity, enhanced base defence options, different modes of transport and alternative ways to gather food; this is only a small selection of the additions to the game so I would recommend going to YouTube and seeing for yourself.

								Although lacking of some options in the menu, 7 Days To Die is still one of the more promising early access titles when it comes to zombie survival games. Among so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ titles out on steam, the market is oversaturated and riddled with crap. Yet, I love playing this with my friends and just mess around (although this has become harder with feral hordes and no option to turn it off).I wish the developers would add some options for things like:Feral Hordes.Measurment of temperature (Celsius without having to get it through console).All in all though, I think of this as one of the best if not the best zombie survival sandbox game out on steam currently, and I hope the developers will actually finish it instead of leaving it in the dirt.

								Great game, already put about 160 hrs into the game since I bought it.  I've been playing with four other friends, have our own dedicated server and it's been awesome.  That being said, there are still some very irritating bugs and weird issues.  I'd love to see this game go further, and more effort into fixing bugs.  This game has so much potential, and could continue to grow and become more successful.Some bugs/issues:1. Poor framerates when riding the minibike (GPU and CPU are nowhere near capacity)2. Bikes disappeared completely from our server (We had 8 minibikes parked) 3. Dirt, Sand, Clay blocks act very strange, weird artifacts in the game while digging4. Dirt, Sand, Clay blocks can disappear competely and you fall through the world5. Poor framerates during day 7 attacksThings I'd like to see:1. Multi-passenger vehicles2. More uses for Leather3. Steel armor4. Ability to craft gun parts5. More gun and ammo variety6. More Melee weapons, especially blade weapons.. like swords7. Bigger nastier boss like zombies8. More crafting in general9. More light objects besides candle, torch and barrelGreat game, devs, keep it coming and this will be a major success! "

								Probably the best Zombie Apocalypse survival game out right now. The game is still relatively buggy, but has become quite polished since its early days. It is in my opinion one of the most beautiful voxel-based games now that lighting has been updated and distant terrain is supported now, as well as significant improvements to random world generation. It is essentially Minecraft on steroids and everything that DayZ was supposed to be. Unlimited replayability makes this game definitely worth the price.A few people seem to be under the impression that updates are going to be delayed and halted because of 7DTD's console release. This is false; a different team is working on the console version and will not have any sort of effects on the PC version's development. Updates are still released quite regularly and the game is nowhere close to falling into the notorious forever-""early access"" pit.			"

								Gifted by a friend, spent a total of over 24hrs playing it with them since I received it, at that point, less than 2 days ago. Brilliant game, with pretty decent graphics (on max). Nice crafting and XP level systems in place, and with a few more updates could surpass the popularity of something like Rust. Few minor errors (my friend glitched through the ground and fell out of the world) but found that pretty funny. Overall great game - though it does need to get out of Alpha and into the full edition. Totally worth every second I have spent on it so far, looking to clock up over 100hrs in the next week or so.Personal rating: 9/10 "

								7DTD Is one of the best survivals I ever played. I started alone, whitout watching any youtube videos. The learning curve was very good, as I kept dying from hunger. I invaded a abandoned house and stayed there for days, whitou leaving at night... Than the horde came... OMG... That was SO scary... I felt like I was inside TWD world. It took me almost 40 days inside game, alone and afraid, to learn all the skills I needed to survive. Yes, graphics are a little bit outdated, but as TWS is not about zombies, this game is not about graphics. AWESOME. Recommended, but not for the faint hearted.			"

								Its funny, their biggest content drop to date just happened to ruin everything i ever did in this game! :D until its fully released (LOL) be careful not to build anything too meaningful. every block you place must be placed with the accompanied knowledge that all those blocks could turn into  F***ING TREES.  basically dialed back my playtime from 24 to 0 hours! Great game The....Fun...Pimps?Edit: ^^^ i wrote that yesterday, i'm calmer now, and in all actuality, this is a great game. Hell, i wouldnt of cared so much about our work being destroyed if the game was ****. understand that what i encountered was a glitch, a bug, you may not even encounter it, but if thats something you arent prepared for, or even want to deal with, then i would recommend waiting on this game as it is being updated and improved upon.  but if minecraft style survival is your thing, and you dont mind that you're work might get screwed up with updates (that ultimately make the game better) then pick it up and you wont regret it. if i put behind my prejudices, i'd say a solid 8/10 for a game in this genre			"

No other Survival game creates the since of urgency and excitement as well has having an incredibly in-depth crafting system.  I see other Survival games being released announcing ""Now with base building!"" as though that is a feature that is not necessary to the game.Keep updating the game please, I have tried so many Survival games and this is the only one worth playing for more than 10 hours.

Early Access Review
								7 Days to Die is a very good game - especially if you play it with friends, so you can all co-operate together.It's like a cross between Minecraft and Rust/H1Z1.You start out with nothing, but you quickly farm a few grasses, trees, and stones to make a stone axe, and start upgrading from there.If you get a well-built defensible base built, then you can survive the zombie hordes and craft bigger and better items.The game has a high-ish learning curve, as you have to make quite a few items before you can learn to craft others.But once you have your furnace going (and other advancements) you can start to upgrade your crafting abilities.The map is very big, and there are zombies roaming all over the place, so it can be quite hard to survive, especially at night (10pm to 4am, in-game) when the zombie hordes turn up (and they are faster and more vicious during the night).And then, every seventh night, the zombies come for you in earnest; if you're not prepared for that, then you're dead.I've only played this game on PVE (Player Versus Environment) servers, which was hard enough - I hate to think how bad it would be when you're playing on a PVP (Player Versus Player) server, where you have to fight other people as well as the zombies.Mind you, on the PVE servers, there is a lot more scope for creating buildings - I've seen some great structures made by players. On PVP, you''ll probably be too busy watching your back (unless you have a gang to back you up).Get some friends to join you, to help you build.Or go it solo, if you're a hero.Either way, you can have a good time.If you like Rust, H1Z1, and Minecraft, then 7 Days to Die would be worth getting.Even if you haven't played similar games, I would still recommend giving this one a go.Well worth a try.

Early Access Review
								If you told me there was an early-access zombie survival game on Steam that featured an rpg-like leveling tree, a crafting menu, and Minecraft-esque destruction and construction system, I would tell you to stay well away from that game, just on principle.Having said that, 7 Days to Die is an early-access zombie survival game, available on Steam, that features leveling and crafting, along with a Minecraft-esque building system.And 7 Days to Die is better than it has any right to be.For me, this game is right up my alley.  I love going around and looting everything that I can see, and then bringing my haul back to my base and sorting it into neat piles.  On top of that, you can build your own base and fortify it against the zombies.  They can be a bit tenacious, which makes it all the more important to put some thought into your base design.  However, seeing as this game is still in an Alpha state, their AI is more than a little abuse-able, so at this point in development, you don't have to put too much thought in.The leveling system is quite brilliantly done.  As you train certain skills, they level up, which means that the skills you use regularly level up quickly.  On top of that, you also get skill points after you earn a certain amount of experience or complete fetch quests, which you can then put towards skills that you don't use that often, removing the grind through boring skills. Next, is the crafting system, which I also feel is quite brilliantly done.  You craft tools and weapons which degrade with use, and then can be repaired with raw materials or by smooshing a second copy of the tool into the first at a workbench (think Minecraft).  However, not only does this repair the tool in question, but it upgrades it to be more effective.  This can be done repeatedly for stacking results.  Contrary to what one might think, this does not completely break the game’s system of progression.  Yes, you can make a hundred stone axes at the beginning of the game and combine them all to make an extremely high-quality stone axe.  However, workbenches are difficult to make and rare to find.  Furthermore, that stone axe will still be out-performed by all but the shoddiest iron axes.  This ability to combine like tools simply reduces the grind if you're mid-game and suddenly find yourself without mid-tier tools.  Did you die and lose your steel shovel?  No worries, you're not back to square one; just make a bunch of stone shovels, combine them at a workbench, and you have a semi-decent shovel to work with until you get your old one back!Finally, I couldn't talk about a zombie survival game without talking about the combat.  The melee combat is average.  While it isn't terrible, it's not very engaging.  Run in, swing, run out, repeat.  I definitely would like some more feedback as to what I'm doing.  Sometimes the zombies will stumble or fall down randomly, but there's no indicator as to what I did to cause that.  Sure, I cracked the zombie over the head with a tree branch, but I've hit thirty other zombies the same exact way and they didn't react like that.  A more dynamic melee system would make combat so much more engaging.  Thankfully, you're given the resources to craft a bow and some arrows right at the start of the game, and the archery mechanics are so much more fun to play with than the melee mechanics.  Archery at least introduces arrow drop-off; melee is just “hit the thing until it stops moving.”7 Days to Die is filled with so much potential; however, there is one caveat to this review: I don't believe it is worth the full price at the moment.  If 7 Days to Die was guaranteed to live up to its potential, I would definitely recommend it at its current price; however, the game is currently in Alpha and has been in Alpha since December of 2013.  There’s nothing wrong with spending a long time in Alpha but, while it would be incredibly disappointing to see such potential go to waste, there’s nothing stopping the developers from dropping the game tomorrow.  There are bugs as well as balance and optimization issues that still need to be addressed and there is so much potential for new content and polish around the edges to push this game up to the twenty-five dollar range.  I’m having a blast with the game as it is, but until some of the major issues are addressed I would say wait for a Steam sale, and if you can get the game for ten or fifteen dollars, that would be a wise investment.

Theres all types of servers ranging from pvp to pve to modded or unmodded so much to choose from! I do highly suggest you play this game with friends though because it can be quite scary and challenging surviving all by yourself!			"

								At first I was a bit sceptic regarding this game as I'm not really a fan of zombie related games. BUT...as soon as I received this game as gift I was totally immersed to it. The building options and gameplay are superb. You constantly get a feeling of anxiety wondering when you're going to be attacked. Basically the game goes down to building a stronghold to last every senth night, explore the map, build fortifications, traps, weapons, armor, ammo, minibikes etc in order to last as long as possible.Really interesting game worth trying it, good value for money.I would like to move forward in the days to give a more accurate opinion, as I currently have 4 different games running. Can get really confusing remembering what was the status to every game each time I log in :) "

It seems it doesnt matter if your campfires or forges are hidden and your queit as a mouse...you still get hordes. The horde size should scale based on your heat map.			"

								it's similar with Rust but of course there are lots of differences such as weapons, crafts, zombies. For the beginners, understanding the game meta and playing can be seen little bit difficult but after you play some you get addicted to it, start living in 7days life. For example, you dont eat&drink in reality but you do these in game :)			"

								After only 21 hours of gameplay, I've got to say this is a very good game, though it is still the alpha version. The entire world is craftable, from grass and soil to buildings and tents, and everything inside them. Sneak past the zombies and zombie dogs, or shoot them with ur crafted weapon for resources they carry. Use a building and reinforce it, or build your own home!The graphics aren't perfect, but the gameplay is: of course you need food and water, but if you don't cook it you'll be sick! Also, don't get: a broken leg, an infection, diarrhea, a bleeding wound, and more...But for every complaint is a solution: bandages, first aid, antibiotics, painkillers, a splint... find one or craft one, the possibilities are (almost) endless!

								Apparently they don't want bug reports for this game since they made it a rather cumbersome way to register for reporting them. So if they happen to read this. Game disconnects randomly, not very often (once per hour) but it happens. IF this happens just as you are opening a chest that chest gets locked out from further interaction in the future, just as though someone is already looking in that chest, even from yourself.This leads to loosing all the content in the chest. Since this now happened twice (never happened in earlier versions), I find no pleasure in restarting my progress over and over because of loosing all the stuff. I will wait for never versions.Other bugs, when digging with a shovel, blocks behind the block you are digging gets dug out instead of the one you are looking at. The particles bouncing about indicates the correct block though.			"

								i have to admit this game has to be one of the best out there at the moment, spending alot of time on single player at the moment building a base and mining digging deep. i hear zombies close by thinking theres a tunnel close i will head for it as i mine more i hear more zombies and zombie dogs, ive got to be close but my pick axe is nearly broke as i head out of my cave i relize that the zombie noises were not coming from a cave but i had attracted a hoard about my cave most of been 30-40 zombies i panic and run to my base for cover but they followed i quickly got my hunting rifle out and started shooting getting head shots and taking them down, ha ha i thought until click no bullets left and still maybe 20 coming to me and i can hear them breaking the door down, i ran out of my house and started to draw them away killing one at a time. am going to do this i thought until 1 hit me and i got infected, i killed the lot of them but then died 3 days later due to the infection. over all this game is a must buy in my eyes lots of fun in building hunting mining, crafting and must of all killing zombies defo a 10/10 from me			"

								7 Days to Die is a really fun game and it keeps getting better with each updates. The challenge even on default settings is interesting and keeps you on your toes, especially at night when the zombies go ferals and the hunter becomes the hunted! I like how you can tailor your game to your playstyle, like making zombies tougher, air supplies rarer etc. this can go hardcore in no time. Update 10.3 added more clothing options and character customization it's a nice improvement. Crafting in this game is very well done too and there are not a lot of limits on what you can build! Get caught outside at night when a feral horde is chasing you and feel your adrelin skyrocket IRL!			"

								Why on earth would someone want this game? Allow me to recall an old memory of goofing around with a friend on a private server...It was a dark and stor... ok ok, fine. So there I was, fiddling around in my inventory moving things around and crafting. My ears nearly bleed as I hear DUCK! in a very panicked voice. My only response was, ""What? they added ducks? Didn't see that in the patch notes..."" next thing i knew was a crossbow bolt was in my head. turns out a zombie was right next to me and i was oblivious to it. heh. go figure. so we went around scavenging for usable stuff as always. me and my crossbow bolt hat. i miss that hat.

								Very good overall and has many updates because of the active developers working on this game. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes Minecraft because this game is pretty much a realisitic version of it. The only problem I may say is that although they have added objectives recently the game is still too boring to play on your own, due to the amount of time you have to waste and is something like an 1 hr+ to get to another biome because the map is very massive, so take this into consideration before buying, if you havn't got any friends who play this game or aren't willing to buy the game, due to the high price of it then don't buy the game.

								Day 1 - I'm alone in the snowy wilderness with nothing on me but my underwear. Must of been one heck of a night, but that's over with. I rip what little weeds are around me from the ground, pick up a stone, and punch some shrubbery to make a simple stone axe. From here I can scavenge and forage until I find enough to make some bows and arrows. Night is coming, so I decide to crash into an old semi-abandoned lumber mill...just have to clear out the frozen lumberjacks first...Day 2 - I scavenge the nearby areas for supplies, while honing my skills with a bow and arrow on frostbitten zombies. There's a nice lake with some cabins, and a big hunting lodge in the other direction. I take what I need and crash at the lumber mill. I fortify it a bit to help out at night. Day 3 - A dog bit me and infected me. I will die without antibiotics in roughly 3 days. I need to find them fast. I scavenge some more, but no luck. I board up all the windows to the 2 story house next to the lumber mill and add a shooting platform out back. Day 4 - The infection has spread; I must leave to find medicine. My health is dropping slowly...but dropping. After a while, I stumble upon a holy grail of weapons - the Shotgun store in the frigid wasteland. They must cater to hunters. I manage to find an antibiotic and clear the infection. Zombies are everywhere, but things are looking up. I have weapons to even the playing field.Day 5 - I scavenege for supplies only to come across what looks to be like a small military outpost. It's abandoned except for a few zombies throwing themselves on landmines for some reason. I take all 66 landmines and bring them back home. Suprisingly there were no weapons in the outpost. It was much to open-air for my taste, so I bring everything of use back to my lumber castle.Day 6 - I spend the day gathering supplies to build additions to my wooden fortress. I build a forge, smelt metal and craft better tools and improve my weapons. I place landmines all around my house and dig trenches. Day 7 - An ominous feeling of dread approaches in the morning. I don't want to go out. I don't want to leave my house, so I spend the day adding mazes of wood to herd hostiles into landmines and trenches. This is oddly relaxing, but the feel of dread approaches. Night 7 - I stand on my shooting platform and watch the sun go down over my minefield and oil drums scattered in the snow. If I had a cigarrette, I'd smoke it. I wait, and wait, but nothing happens. Midnight approaches, and still nothing. I am getting on edge each minute, but still nothing but silence. At 3am, I step away from my shooting platform and head for the door to go in when I hear a dog growl. It shrieked in pain as it slammed against wooden spikes below me. I turned around to see 50 zombies running at full speed. Charging through my landmines and blowing their faces off just to make me bleed. I shoot some oil drums nearby and take out about a dozen. Ten more were unfortunate enough to step on landmines. Another dozen impaled themselves on spikes as their undead comrades climbed their bodies to try and reach me. I pull out a shotgun and shoot wildly at any survivors. An hour passes of rampage and carnage, but I survive. My fortress pulled through as well. I pack up everything and decide to move to greener pastures.Day 8 - I am a zombie slayer. I have survived against hordes, dogs, and everything else I have come across. I pack up and leave my lovely winter fortress to explore. I pass through lovely forests, deserts, and some sort of charred ground shooting every zombie I come across. Nothing can stop me. I make it to the ruins of a city and start looking for a good place to set up for the night. I shoot a few zombies, nothing I can't handle. I see a movie theatre that looks pretty fortified, so I break down the doors. More zombies aproach, but I take them out. I break down the doors and hear dogs. One jumps on me before I can get a shotgun blast off. More zombies bang on the doors all around me. I run around the corner and come face to face with 3 more zombies. One shotgun blasts drops all three. Another dog lunged at me and caused me to bleed. I took him down but need to heal or I will bleed out. I run around the corner to the theater room. The emergency exit door busts open and 4 zombies come in. I shoot them and head up the stairs to bandage myself. I can see a dozen rotten bodies slowly approach me from the bottom of the stairs of the movie room. I pull out the bandages and first aid kits from my inventory. The last thing I hear is glass shattering from above me, and a famished shout as undead arms grab me from behind. I didn't have the high ground...TLDR - This game is in alpha stage, but it is extremely fun. The graphics aren't great yet, but I have seen developer posts of really good graphics, so I assume they will be implemented at some point (beta or later). Basically all you need to know if you should buy this game.Do you like crafting and building games like minecraft?Do you like tower defense games?Do you like open world exploration games like skyrim?If you answered yes to all 3, then you will like this game. There will be story lines and npc quests in later updates, but none are in the game so far. That said, this game is very fun even without those things.			"

								I sincerley belive that the devs of this and other survival games have ever actually been outside. My favourite features of this game are 1: Stunned, stunned is a great feature becuase it only seems to work when I'm 10 feet away from the ♥♥♥♥ing zombie 10/10 fun. 2: Overheating, this one is probably my favourite I love being a fresh spawn player in the burnt forest wearing only a pair of shades, a coebo hat, and banndana (-15 insulation) and i'm still ♥♥♥♥ing overheating. Seriously fix/remove this. 3: Bleeding, This isn't really a bad idea but every person in this game have around 700 spikes each and you are bound to walk into them, I have used more health items healing myself from walking out my ♥♥♥♥ing door than actually fighting zombos. 4: Zombie Health, Most zombie games have a rule, shot em' in the head and they're ded. Not this one, there is nothing more immersive than shooting a zombie 6 times in the head with a 9mm pistol 3 feet away from it only for it to fall over, get back up stun you and then get you down to 30 health. This isn't so much a problem later in the game, except for ferals. ♥♥♥♥ing ferals. I get they are ment to be a challange but when it takes 5 ♥♥♥♥ing rockets directly and 20 sniper rounds, it gets kind of out of hand. 5: Loot, I no longer open gun safes. It is not worth it to waste even a little bit of durability and time on opening these ♥♥♥♥ing things that seem to only contain ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pistol parts. I have found far far more guns in toilets than I have in gunsafes. The figure is probably around Gunsafe 0, Toilet 15. Before the bombs fell everyone made sure to lock all their gun safes but take out all the guns and throw them in the toiletEven after all that I would still recommend this game, but not for 20 pounds. Buy it on sale idk if it's a beta. These ♥♥♥♥ers seem more intrested in porting this game to console, than actually finishing it. Still fun though, unless you have no friends and then ♥♥♥♥ you becuase u are KOS			"

								It was day 7 and I knew I wasn't going to be ready. Too little ammo found in time, too few hours spent prepping the walls. Worst of all, I didn't have enough light, not by a long shot. Those last few flicks of sun glimmering gold through the trees made my stomach lurch. Behind me, where the shadows of night grew, there was screaming in the distance. The dogs reached me first, packs of baying hounds, savagely driving across the field laden with spikes. Some went down, yet others ran even with prongs of wood embedded in them, uncaring, mindless zombies. I unloaded rifle rounds with unsteady shots, I couldn't help but shake, the sound of wailing grew ever stronger and before even a few dogs were down the rest of the undead were swarming the front wall. Flesh clambering over flesh, driving some down into the spikes only to climb over thier own dead and ascend. Spider zombies scaling the walls from behind, forcing me to turn my back to them and fire the last of my ammo. There was nothing left to do but desperate measures. I had found her in the trunk of a car, pure steel, heavy as sin. I named her Vera after my lost ones. Zombies were soft, and the sledge was hard as it arced down onto the first. Bones crunched, it collapsed, step back, swing again. More screaming. This time it was me. They were going down, but so was I. No choice. I lied about the ammo thing. I left one. In the pistol. Under this entire thing I had placed every last barrel of gas I had found. And that last bullet well... it sank into the metal with a flash and as I watched pieces of zombie all around me and my fort shatter I was sure I was done for, ears battered and ringing from the explosion. When I opened my eyes in a fine haze of falling red mist, I could see the blast was just right. Just far enough away to spare me, shivering, bruised, covered in gore, atop the shattered smouldering ruins of my fort. It was time to eat some soup and splint my arm, in a few hours the sun would rise, and I would need to prepare much. Day 7 it seems, was just the beginning.This game keeps getting better and better.			"

								I just love this game eventhough it's still on alpha after 4 years. I choose to play it single player and multiplayer although i always stick to single player as i have limited data.Sometimes the noises that zombies produces turns to be really close but they're actually quite far, which creeps me out most of the time, especially during night times.

								After only 21 hours of gameplay, I've got to say this is a very good game, though it is still the alpha version. The entire world is craftable, from grass and soil to buildings and tents, and everything inside them. Sneak past the zombies and zombie dogs, or shoot them with ur crafted weapon for resources they carry. Use a building and reinforce it, or build your own home!The graphics aren't perfect, but the gameplay is: of course you need food and water, but if you don't cook it you'll be sick! Also, don't get: a broken leg, an infection, diarrhea, a bleeding wound, and more...But for every complaint is a solution: bandages, first aid, antibiotics, painkillers, a splint... find one or craft one, the possibilities are (almost) endless!

								Pro's: A decent amount of diversity, and I appreciate being able to build up from the ground.I like the new procedurally generated map and the zones.A decent learning curve and nice online community making some interesting environments.Not completely simple and easy like other games.Really appreciating the multiplayer aspect. Certainly helps.Con's:Don't drill straight down or risk never coming out. o.oLearning curve from an older version of the game to a newer one was steep, but figured it out - after dying a few times.Not really much else to say in terms of cons. I'd appreciate more variety of bad guys, though.Overall: 9/10			"

								Fun if you have friends, the servers can be changed to have diffrent settings. Overall fun if you have a group to grind and play with. My only complaint is the zombie combat sucks, flat out terriable. Hit boxes are a mess and the zombies can stun you. You miss then get stunned get hit 3 times then die. Also they can slow you after you get stunned so you striaght up just cant fight them on harder difficulties. If you can get passed that its fun.			"

								Do you want a survival crafting game on Steam?Are you tired of indie survival games that are not fleshed out at all?Sick of DayZ because it is abandoned and not Enjoyable?Looking for a rather cheap game with a lot of potential?Search no more my fellow survivor!After DayZ it was hard for me to find a game in Early Access that I can trust in. Well, friends recommended 7DTD so I went and bought it. They were like: ""Play a bit of Survival Singleplayer, because it cannot harm to learn the game first."" It is sp00ky when no one is there with you. I am dead serious, as a man who has trampled on graves on Halloween night, i♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants as the first screamer zombie came at me! I was amazed by how good the crafting system works and absolutely love the things you can do in this game! But search for friends first, or else your pants will need to be changed every few seconds.If you should have any questions just hit me up in the comments of the review and I will edit it.			"

								I am going to be short. Take this as-is. This is my first, and currently, only steam review. I simply don't have alot of time to write. I have been playing computer games since 1986's Starflight by Binary Systems and I have nearly 4000 hours in this game alone.Considering 7day's systems, features, and overall gameplay, additionally where it is headed in the future, it is the best game that I have ever played and quite possibly the best game ever made to date in spite of it's niche theme.If you have not played 7days you MUST try it. Of late all the AAA games are full of game-breaking bugs that are never fixed except by the game playing community- especially Bethesda's games. The bugs in 7days are few and for the most part short lived especially when compared to the big commercial studios work.GET 7DAYS. You will not regret it.			"

								7 Days to Die is probably the best zombie survival base-defense game out there. The mechanics are great. You don't need to demolish or move blocks to upgrade your base. You can upgrade blocks in-place so long as you have the required materials. Progression makes nighttime more dangerous to the player. This forces players to plan their bases accordingly. For example, running several furnaces and workbenches will attract more zombies to your base. This is because 7 Days to Die uses an 'actions per area per time' feature that most people call a 'heatmap'. This can become problematic, or not, depending on your base design.The graphics are good. This is especially true if you like the gritty-style art textures. I am not necessarily a fan of the world textures or character models but it fits with the rest of the game. If you're looking for great HD textures and models, play Rust. If you're looking for great PVE, PVP AND base building that doesn't wipe every week or month play 7 Days to Die.			"

								This game has come A LONG WAY! When I first purchased and played the game, I didn't play for long and it was not an enjoyable experience. Recently, with the console version coming out, my friends began to talk about it and I decided that if they purchased it, I would play with them. The experience I have since had has been a great one. I really do enjoy the game. Yes, there are some things that I still am not in love with. The ""Early Access"" and ""Alpha"" parts of this game should not lead you to believe it is underdeveloped and buggy. This game has been out for almost 3 years, and like I said, has come a long way. If you are thinking about buying it, I know for a fact that you will either love the game or hate the game within the 2 hour time period that Valve gives you to return it. However, if you don't want to spend $25 on it, I don't blame you. Go buy it on♥♥♥♥♥for $15 instead!			"

								7 Days to Die is the Best Horror Survival Game I ever played. In all the other Horror games, your safe, your in your shelter, you have the top notch stuff, and you know no Zombies will spawn next to you. But in this, every 7 Days your unlucky, You think you are Safe in your little House, but then Zombies start attacking. Thats the Suspense I like in this game. Sometimes you are locked outside the house or a 5 Story Building because of all the zombies. If you play this, you should play it with Friends. This is a really great game and if you play it with friends it will be even more fun then expected. Don't go on a PVE Server, go to a Peer2Peer server if you want to have CO-OP with people (Mostly Peer2Peer is playing with other people that aren't your friends and you make friends by doing so) which I think Peer2Peer helped me A LOT make new Friends. Now I play on about 10 Peer2Peer servers. This game can really be Addicting too, you may have something you have to do but you ignore it because you cannot wait for Horde night if your Playing Peer2Peer. You spent great work on your new Shelter, and the people need a extra bow, will you abandon them and let them die? Or will you stay and help.			"

								Plain and simply; this game is fantastic and has tons of potential.     I started playing 7 Days to Die when it was first released. No matter how cliche or bad a zombie game is, I just can't wait to get my hands on it. Naturally, I bought the game and immediately and started playing it. Like any alpha game it was quite rocky, but it was incredibly fun. The ability to break and sculpt the world like minecraft has always been appealing to me, but adding in a sense of realism and a zombie apocalypse sold it. I wasted hours running around searching empty everythings, transforming houses into piles of collectable cubes, and building poor excuses of houses that looked weird and broke under the physics engine. It's just really fun to do, even when the terrain wasn't smoothed, a roof would cave in under your feet, and bees wouldn't ruin camping out on top of a building while grabbing a snack. Adding in the sense of survival and the need to build and collect bigger and better while fending off walking corpses was just great.    I just recently came back to the game after a long break waiting for more content and I was amazed. The game feels very different now compared to before, and all for the better. The updates have been phenominal, from terrain smoothing to beautiful lighting, to forging, random map regen, and frozen zombies in the winter landscape. This game is just tons of fun especially with other people. Nowadays I'm enjoying converting log cabins into concrete, barbwire, spikes, and sandbag fortresses while blowing up buildings and scavenging the randomly generated worlds for better jank.    That all said, the game is still an alpha and has room for improvement. There is definitely an amazing game sitting at the end of this undead rainbow, but it needs some more solid content first.     The two things this game needs before it's completely solid; A more defined progress/difficulty curve, and much more world content. I find that there isn't much of an ""end-game"" and less in-between. It doesn't take much effort to get the resources for reinforced concrete blocks to buff out a house, and have a decent belt of gear. I think the devs tried to limit how easy it is to get to end-game content by making the best guns very rare, which sadly only amounts to grinding out loot resets and hoping you have luck on your side. The book-reading aspect was clever, but needs to be flayed out more and possibly tiered. Honestly, I think there should be a tier between a rock axe and a fire axe, something like a ""shoddy tool"" tier, where the tool is made of metal but is crudely put together, requiring a forgery/blacksmithing book before you can make or repair the regular versions. The same goes for reinforced concrete, and anything of higher defense levels. Either way, the progress curve is short and only limited by spawn-rates. High tier books could even be put in the back of a library or other such building guarded by a nasty spawn of zombs. Leading to another point; zombies should have a progressive difficulty. I find by around the 10th day, I have all the gear and bullets I need to take down anything other than the mega horde, a vicious spawn of cops and dogs and everything in between. Normal zombies and hordes become dull, and upping the difficulty and tweaking settings does little more than make them sort-of challenging if they can actually hit you. Possibly adding more types of zombies, zombies in riot gear, or making hordes larger/more frequent/multiple at a time/hostile survivors, increasing with the days survived, would really add to the longevity of the game. *Edit; they've added increasingly hard hordes every 7 days, as well as adding risk to staying in an area too long/producing too much noise, smell, etc. Great stuff.    My final point is the in-game locations. In both the newly added random gen, but more importantly in Navezgane there are a limited number of interesting buildings. I feel Navezgane could be bigger, and I have a list of suggested things that will likely get lost in the sea of comments that I would really love to see in the game; convenience stores, shopping mall, hospital, grocery store, library, restaurant, office building, subway/sewer? (if at all, would probably be much later content), a large cemetary, full military base, ship port, docks, airport, news station, reinforced dead survivor city, disease center, train station?, highway, pharmacy, gun store, carnival?, apocalypse bunker, trailer park, prison, sports arena, fast food joint... The list could go on, but the game needs more places to explore, preferably with a more intimidating zombie spawn inside of them to create risk of exploring. When I came back for the Alpha 9 I was way too excited to see new places to explore such as rich houses, apartments, movie theaters, the destroyed city, and so forth. It was always exciting to find something new. After playing for a while, each new discovery feels like a disappointment as they really boil down to things you've seen MANY many times already. The loot also starts to sort of blend together leading you to forget about the need to explore most non-unique buildings.    Closing thoughts; great game, tons of fun, multiplayer is awesome, however it's still an alpha and has a long way to go before it is everything that it can be. I'm glad I spent the money to support the dev team and have spent the same amount of money on worse games that are fully released. Just add in a gameplay curve and much more to explore and I'll never put this game down. 10/10 would buy again.			"

								I am loving this game! I bought it back in 2015 during the Steam Summer Sale. I played for about an hour before giving up. It was not very intuitive, had no direction, and was really tough. Recently, after searching for a game that would have similar features to Fallout 4's base building mechanics and defense, I was referred to this game. I came back and gave it a second try... and I love it! I'm addicted and want to play every day. It doesn't feel like an early access game anymore and you can lose several hours quickly to playing this game. I highly recommend it. It could still use a better tutorial on all the features, and there is plenty of room for improvement, but I would gladly pay the current full price if I didn't already own it.			"

								I gave this game an honest chance for its potential for PVP. While at first it was enjoyable, I learned the current state is ripe for abuse on many levels.Players are able to look through the ground using various methods and it makes hiding any kind of base virtually impossible. In my experience on one of the more popular servers, the group run by the server owner just happend to know where everyones base was and raided everyone when they were offlineIt's an overall good game for what it is but not if you're into PVP			"

								This game is Fantastic! And it's still in the beta. In this game you have no objectives but to survive, its open world with lots of loot and toggleable loot respawn settings. The zombies in this game are realistic in that they do heavy damage. The health bar was designed fantastically, it doesn't just go up by eating food or using bandages, health going up is only a minor side effect of eating. Bandages are only useful when the should be, when you are bleeding and will bleed to death if bandages are not applied. The entire world is destructible, both you and zombies can destroy everything, so you can never be truly safe, as it should be. There are many toggleable settings about how the zombie world you enter will work, and later in the beta there will be a world generator so you can have more original worlds. The variety of items is great, lots of stuff and a very complicated but nice crafting system. There are some crafting recipes you can't do until your character reads a book about that particular field of survival. The crafting system remembers allrecipes you know, so no need to memorize any recipies. There is a great cooking system in the game, you can boil water you get from lakes to clean it, and you can make coffee among other things, though it may still be too early in beta for working cooking for most recipes or it's just difficult to figure out. This game doesn't have awkward looking blocks everywhere like you see in minecraft, it smooths out landscapes and even in player created caves. This game has good physics, there is very rarely any floating blocks(floating would be a glitch), and all blocks  have weight, durability and strength that determine how they can be used architecturally.Complaints: (most of this stuff is minor that doesn't take away much from gameplay.)->Its probably because its still in beta but, when you exit and reenter the game you can force zombies nearby that are chasing you to despawn, which could be used as a cheap solution to survival.->As i said above, the cooking system is confusing or unfinished.->There is no tool in the game to desmooth the block smoothing, i dug a cave house and if i want it to have corners i'd have to dig out the walls and replace them with a different block.->When respawning on your bed, you can spawn partially in the wall and see through the world, idk if you can jump into the void(I haven't tried).->When in a 1 block wide and 2 block tall tunnel that has block smoothing when your back is to a dead end you can look up and see through the world.->If you chop down a tree, then stack those logs on top of each other, the logs will look way wider than they were before, the game should make them 2 different wood blocks that can be broken down into different amounts of planks, other wood stuff, etc.->Zombie pathfinding could use a lot of work, when i scavenge a house and quickly close the doors the zombies won't attack the doors, they will attack the base of the house itself, meaning they are incredibly inefficient at breaking into houses, and you can easily just loot the house quickly then get out of there before they break in.->As I said above, some items can somewhat float as they are currently, if you destroy the block under a gunsafe the gun safe will not fall until all adjacent blocks are gone.->When you destroy a gun safe, Stove, air conditioner and many other things, no items fall as loot from them falling apart, there should at least be some scrap metal or something.->When cooking no lighter or ignition is required, it just magically ignites when you put fuel on it.->Not all blocks in the game are craftable from what i've seen, cabinets, refrigerators, lights for houses, and lots of other things can't be made. I think they should think ahead in case they add a book on how to build solar panel or generator for players that have been in the world a while and have the available resources to make one, so that things like light can be powered.->Related to the last complaint, as the game is currently there are some lights that are lit up mysteriously when some others aren't. I think they should just have all lights not work unless they add a power station building and somewhat allow the player to operate it.			"

								This game is very similar to ""RUST"" but I like 7DTD's in game menu system layout and functionallity better. The things I like about this game is the freedom to do just about anything you can think of from mining underground for minerals, cooking meat on a camp fire for food to building structures of all kinds for shelter and all of it is almost limitless. You can choose any location to start digging....and digging....and digging. This is truly an open world sandbox kind of game; it can easily become very addictive to play. The things I dislike about this game is that it has a limited amount of items that can be moved, for example: creating a wooden chest to store stuff in and when placed on the ground it becomes permanent and can’t be moved. It would be nice to be able to select the chest or item and move it to another location. Would like to see an Iron Bar Door so I can see who is on the other side of it, a Floor Hatch Door (1/2 height or one block size) for sealing cellar and ladder ways. A motored vehicle for transportation use would be a pleasant addition as well.			"

								If you have read any of the other reviews, you would see the that this game has a Unique take on the average zombie game. I would strongly agree.First time i played, i came across lots of fat zombies, and got mauled by a dog. the second time i got killed by giant flying bees, the third was radiation outside the map, another time was dying by a horde in a cabin. This game is HARD... in a good way. I personally love it to bits, and would play it every day i could, but i've got too much stuff to do, sadly. Don't do what most do. Give this game a try, plus... with the new refunds for steam, you wouldn't lose any money!			"

Early Access Review
								With the newest A15 update, which has updated the game even further and brought much more substance to the game, I figured it was a good time to do a review.Originally, I hated this game back when I first bought it, back around the time the original game came out. It has become a complete turnaround for me, and currently it's a game I'm very addicted to.Before I go on, I do want to say that the majority of my experience in this game is in single player. But I'm sure multiplayer with randoms can be just as exciting as a game like DayZ. And playing the game with just friends, well.. it can become an incredible co-op experience.First off, I love survival-type games like DayZ and the like (more specifically, DayZ Epoch/Overpoch and DayZ Origins). I also love base building, hording weapons/items/etc, and stuff like that. In this game, building a base, as well as going out and getting supplies, building up my arsenal and so on, is a lot of fun. Build a base, build defenses, take care of your survival needs such as hunger and hydration (which goes even deeper with having to be careful about your temperature, and diseases), and survive the hordes that come every seven days - hence the name of the game. To make everything all the more better, the game includes RPG elements that reward you for killing zombies, scavenging, building and much more. It all becomes together as an incredibly addictiveIf you're new and you want to get settled in before getting overwhelmed, there are plenty of options in single player that allows you to change the difficulty. You can even turn off zombies, which can allow you to build a base in peace, before you decide to take on the hordes. There are a lot of options, from changing how much loot there is out in the world, to how thick the zombie population is in the world.. from difficulties varying from ""Very Easy"" to ""Very Hard.""As you work on your base, you can go out and loot, level up, kill zombies and try to find weapons, equipment and building supplies to make your life a lot easier. The RPG system makes the game all the more addicting, as I stated before.There are a lot of options now when it comes to building bases, whether you're using different materials (wood, scrap metal, concrete, etc). Making an ultimate base that can stand a beating will takes time to build, as you'll generally want to use concrete, which will take awhile to craft. It's a good end-game type scenario to go for, and while you wait, you can make bases made out of wood to start you out. It doesn't take that long to build a simple base with wood, and with the right supplies, you can even upgrade your wooden base to more solid materials, such as scrap metal, brick, concrete and more. Meaning, you don't have to destroy your starter base made out of wood. Instead, you can upgrade it/build around it. And with the A15 update, there are a ton of different things you can build for your base, to make it your own original fortress. Just look up images of what people have done with their bases in the game, especially bases built in the current A15 build. Create a simple log cabin in the woods and live out your days in the wild. Dig yourself a secret underground bunker, with a giant maze of underground mining tunnels. Find a mountain and dig in, build a fortress that zombies and bandits alike would have trouble getting into, using both your structures and the mountain to protect you and your loot. Or make it easy, find an existing building in the world and customize it to your liking (just be aware of zombies spawning nearby). Heck, you can actually build a castle with a moat and a working drawbridge - though I'd recommend filling the moat with spikes and other defenses, as zombies aren't really bothered by water!Even if you aren't into base building, there's still a lot to do. Killing zombies, collecting items.. and if you're playing multiplayer, and if you're into that sort of thing, you can hunt players if you prefer a more PvP element. I don't have much experience with that in this game so I can't really go into it, but with my experience, I can't imagine it being bad.There's so much to collect and build on, and the game is still in early access.. meaning, there'll be even more added. And there's already a lot of different items to collect in the world as is, so it's extremely exciting to think about how the game will turn out once it's officially out of early access!In the end, the base building and looting mixed with the RPG element makes it a game that's not only incredibly addictive, it also gives it endless replayability. Your skills in the RPG department can effect many things. It can effect the level of loot you find, with the more you level up, the better level of loot you'll find. You can level up your Rifle skills, Handgun, Blunt or Bladed Weapons, and more. Focus on leveling on one in particular, or try to raise all your skills at the same time.Each time you level up - or complete missions - you are rewarded skill points. You can level up your skills by using these skill points, and/or you can also level up certain abilities by other means. Such as, if you want to raise your Scavenging skill, you can spend points in it. Otherwise, each time you loot an object, you gain experience towards your Scavenging skill. Same goes for pretty much all the rest of the skillsets, such as using Rifle weaponry to level up your Rifle skill level, using/building mining tools to level up your Mining and so on. There are also special abilities that can only be bought, that can make some of your base skills even more powerful, such as buying an ability that gives your bladed weapons a better chance to dismember your opponent's head/arm/leg, and much more.I could go on for quite awhile, so I'll just say.. if you aren't convinced yet, just go on Youtube and watch videos of other people playing the game. If you're into survival games, looting and base building.. or if you're into games such as Minecraft or DayZ, then chances are you'll enjoy it.Pros -- Endless replayability, whether you're playing alone or with friends.- Base building is a lot of fun, and there are a ton of blocks and such that'll allow you to create your own unique base.- RPG elements that end up mixing extremely well with the survival and base building aspects of the game, which ends up making the game incredibly addictive.- A lot of variety when it comes to items you can find in the world, and a good amount of variety when it comes to zombies, clothing, building blocks and more.- If you get bored of the main map, you can create a random map - complete with seeds - similar to Minecraft.- You can build a motorcycle once you get the right materials, making traveling the world a lot easier and faster. The better the engine, the faster it'll go, making it so the game isn't a complete walking simulator.- Too much to list, honestly. Read the TLDR version above and you'll get the gist of it.Cons -(First off, chances are these will be changed - hopefully for the better - as the game is still in early access.)- Weather system can be incredibly frustrating. You'll generally need to plan out what clothing to take with you, depending on what biome you go to. Some of the biomes are WAY too sensitive. It's not too bad once you get used to it and have the clothing you need, but it could definitely be annoying to new players, or experienced players creating new characters that are starting off from scratch.- While I don't mind this myself, some may be turned off to some of the grinding you may have to do to build concrete bases, or to find good items, such as the Auger which allows you to dig underground/collect rock and ores extremely quickly. It will take time.- Addictive! :] Which is.. bad for some people, I guess? lol.			"

								I want to start out by saying out of the gate, this review isn't going to just be on the game itself, but also the developers creating this masterpiece. This game as it stands right now (in Alpha 10.2) is in it's current state, more ""complete"" and feature rich and immersive than many other ""complete"" zombie games out there (looking at you infestation). If you like zombie games like ""State of Decay"", but wish it was multiplayer coop, or ""Infestation"" and ""DayZ"" but wish it wasn't a PvP gank fest, then this is your game. The developer has put up two meaningful and excellent updates in the time I have owned it, and a hotpatch to fix some gripes the community have with in 24 hours of a patch drop to fix things.  The developers are very good at what they do, and the game is very good at what it was intended to do. For those that don't know 7D2D is an amazing combination of Minecraft and State of Decay with a lot of emphasis on multi player coop (although not required to survive). You want the rush of having to make yourself a shelter and building that hole in the ground into a full fledged zombie fortress? Look no further. The lighting effects are impressive, the crafting is intuitive, the zombie AI is not bad (there is room for improvement but hey, it's still in Alpha). Overall the game is great fun if you play solo or with friends. You want this game, it's worth it at full price... even more so when it's on sale.			"

								Lets see. I bought this game a while back not too long after release and to be quite honest with you, at that very time I did not enjoy one bit of it. I felt like it was released way too early, which im sure most people would agree with me. However, I just recently decided to give it another go and man can I tell you that im glad I did! This game is the only survival horror game that makes you actually feel like you are literally playing the part. Unlike DayZ this game has vitually mastered all mechanics instead of make it "" pretty "". Don't get me wrong the game is still very pleseant to look at. I also very much appreciate being able to tweek almost every aspect of the gameplay itself as far as block durability and air drop spawn frequencies just to use as an example. Is this game worth your $25? The answer is a big fat YES. The Community is outstanding and you can find people to play with in no time.			"

It truly has a gameplay cycle that gives it the feel of its own, and the smooth voxel world is absolutely beautiful.

It's a wonderful game, and a must have if you like creativity or a true survival experience.			"

								So at first I saw this game and went ""Gah, another ripoff of dayZ?"" but I saw through about 15 minuets on twitch that it had crafting and some other cool components, so I bought the game. After the ten hours I have played I have determined that this game is better than DayZ in litterally EVERY WAY. It has crafting, It has single player AND multiplayer. You can choose to make a house or just take one over. The Combat is actually really good for a game thats in alpha... In fact it is extremely Un-Buggy for an alpha game. I have found very few glitches or bugs after ten hours of gameplay. It has different biomes and climates, each with their own uniqe enemies.  I Really like the game.9/10 (Dayz standalone is a 6/10, just for comparison)			"

								Lets see. I bought this game a while back not too long after release and to be quite honest with you, at that very time I did not enjoy one bit of it. I felt like it was released way too early, which im sure most people would agree with me. However, I just recently decided to give it another go and man can I tell you that im glad I did! This game is the only survival horror game that makes you actually feel like you are literally playing the part. Unlike DayZ this game has vitually mastered all mechanics instead of make it "" pretty "". Don't get me wrong the game is still very pleseant to look at. I also very much appreciate being able to tweek almost every aspect of the gameplay itself as far as block durability and air drop spawn frequencies just to use as an example. Is this game worth your $25? The answer is a big fat YES. The Community is outstanding and you can find people to play with in no time.			"

Early Access Review
								With the newest A15 update, which has updated the game even further and brought much more substance to the game, I figured it was a good time to do a review.Originally, I hated this game back when I first bought it, back around the time the original game came out. It has become a complete turnaround for me, and currently it's a game I'm very addicted to.Before I go on, I do want to say that the majority of my experience in this game is in single player. But I'm sure multiplayer with randoms can be just as exciting as a game like DayZ. And playing the game with just friends, well.. it can become an incredible co-op experience.First off, I love survival-type games like DayZ and the like (more specifically, DayZ Epoch/Overpoch and DayZ Origins). I also love base building, hording weapons/items/etc, and stuff like that. In this game, building a base, as well as going out and getting supplies, building up my arsenal and so on, is a lot of fun. Build a base, build defenses, take care of your survival needs such as hunger and hydration (which goes even deeper with having to be careful about your temperature, and diseases), and survive the hordes that come every seven days - hence the name of the game. To make everything all the more better, the game includes RPG elements that reward you for killing zombies, scavenging, building and much more. It all becomes together as an incredibly addictiveIf you're new and you want to get settled in before getting overwhelmed, there are plenty of options in single player that allows you to change the difficulty. You can even turn off zombies, which can allow you to build a base in peace, before you decide to take on the hordes. There are a lot of options, from changing how much loot there is out in the world, to how thick the zombie population is in the world.. from difficulties varying from ""Very Easy"" to ""Very Hard.""As you work on your base, you can go out and loot, level up, kill zombies and try to find weapons, equipment and building supplies to make your life a lot easier. The RPG system makes the game all the more addicting, as I stated before.There are a lot of options now when it comes to building bases, whether you're using different materials (wood, scrap metal, concrete, etc). Making an ultimate base that can stand a beating will takes time to build, as you'll generally want to use concrete, which will take awhile to craft. It's a good end-game type scenario to go for, and while you wait, you can make bases made out of wood to start you out. It doesn't take that long to build a simple base with wood, and with the right supplies, you can even upgrade your wooden base to more solid materials, such as scrap metal, brick, concrete and more. Meaning, you don't have to destroy your starter base made out of wood. Instead, you can upgrade it/build around it. And with the A15 update, there are a ton of different things you can build for your base, to make it your own original fortress. Just look up images of what people have done with their bases in the game, especially bases built in the current A15 build. Create a simple log cabin in the woods and live out your days in the wild. Dig yourself a secret underground bunker, with a giant maze of underground mining tunnels. Find a mountain and dig in, build a fortress that zombies and bandits alike would have trouble getting into, using both your structures and the mountain to protect you and your loot. Or make it easy, find an existing building in the world and customize it to your liking (just be aware of zombies spawning nearby). Heck, you can actually build a castle with a moat and a working drawbridge - though I'd recommend filling the moat with spikes and other defenses, as zombies aren't really bothered by water!Even if you aren't into base building, there's still a lot to do. Killing zombies, collecting items.. and if you're playing multiplayer, and if you're into that sort of thing, you can hunt players if you prefer a more PvP element. I don't have much experience with that in this game so I can't really go into it, but with my experience, I can't imagine it being bad.There's so much to collect and build on, and the game is still in early access.. meaning, there'll be even more added. And there's already a lot of different items to collect in the world as is, so it's extremely exciting to think about how the game will turn out once it's officially out of early access!In the end, the base building and looting mixed with the RPG element makes it a game that's not only incredibly addictive, it also gives it endless replayability. Your skills in the RPG department can effect many things. It can effect the level of loot you find, with the more you level up, the better level of loot you'll find. You can level up your Rifle skills, Handgun, Blunt or Bladed Weapons, and more. Focus on leveling on one in particular, or try to raise all your skills at the same time.Each time you level up - or complete missions - you are rewarded skill points. You can level up your skills by using these skill points, and/or you can also level up certain abilities by other means. Such as, if you want to raise your Scavenging skill, you can spend points in it. Otherwise, each time you loot an object, you gain experience towards your Scavenging skill. Same goes for pretty much all the rest of the skillsets, such as using Rifle weaponry to level up your Rifle skill level, using/building mining tools to level up your Mining and so on. There are also special abilities that can only be bought, that can make some of your base skills even more powerful, such as buying an ability that gives your bladed weapons a better chance to dismember your opponent's head/arm/leg, and much more.I could go on for quite awhile, so I'll just say.. if you aren't convinced yet, just go on Youtube and watch videos of other people playing the game. If you're into survival games, looting and base building.. or if you're into games such as Minecraft or DayZ, then chances are you'll enjoy it.Pros -- Endless replayability, whether you're playing alone or with friends.- Base building is a lot of fun, and there are a ton of blocks and such that'll allow you to create your own unique base.- RPG elements that end up mixing extremely well with the survival and base building aspects of the game, which ends up making the game incredibly addictive.- A lot of variety when it comes to items you can find in the world, and a good amount of variety when it comes to zombies, clothing, building blocks and more.- If you get bored of the main map, you can create a random map - complete with seeds - similar to Minecraft.- You can build a motorcycle once you get the right materials, making traveling the world a lot easier and faster. The better the engine, the faster it'll go, making it so the game isn't a complete walking simulator.- Too much to list, honestly. Read the TLDR version above and you'll get the gist of it.Cons -(First off, chances are these will be changed - hopefully for the better - as the game is still in early access.)- Weather system can be incredibly frustrating. You'll generally need to plan out what clothing to take with you, depending on what biome you go to. Some of the biomes are WAY too sensitive. It's not too bad once you get used to it and have the clothing you need, but it could definitely be annoying to new players, or experienced players creating new characters that are starting off from scratch.- While I don't mind this myself, some may be turned off to some of the grinding you may have to do to build concrete bases, or to find good items, such as the Auger which allows you to dig underground/collect rock and ores extremely quickly. It will take time.- Addictive! :] Which is.. bad for some people, I guess? lol.			"

Early Access Review
								I want to start out by saying out of the gate, this review isn't going to just be on the game itself, but also the developers creating this masterpiece. This game as it stands right now (in Alpha 10.2) is in it's current state, more ""complete"" and feature rich and immersive than many other ""complete"" zombie games out there (looking at you infestation). If you like zombie games like ""State of Decay"", but wish it was multiplayer coop, or ""Infestation"" and ""DayZ"" but wish it wasn't a PvP gank fest, then this is your game. The developer has put up two meaningful and excellent updates in the time I have owned it, and a hotpatch to fix some gripes the community have with in 24 hours of a patch drop to fix things.  The developers are very good at what they do, and the game is very good at what it was intended to do. For those that don't know 7D2D is an amazing combination of Minecraft and State of Decay with a lot of emphasis on multi player coop (although not required to survive). You want the rush of having to make yourself a shelter and building that hole in the ground into a full fledged zombie fortress? Look no further. The lighting effects are impressive, the crafting is intuitive, the zombie AI is not bad (there is room for improvement but hey, it's still in Alpha). Overall the game is great fun if you play solo or with friends. You want this game, it's worth it at full price... even more so when it's on sale.			"

Early Access Review
								Please note - this is an early access review.First off, let me say that I postponed reviewing this game due to having reviewed another early access game a bit too soon, and being forced to revise my review of that game because of it.Several of my friends bought into this game much earlier than I did. I held out because I'd been burned by early access before. But eventually I decided that, while 7 Days to Die was on sale, I should give it a try. So I did. I have not been disappointed.I'll list the good and bad first, then give a synopsis. Most people seem to like that kind of review style.Pros Game is currently playable and has plenty to do. Game has random world generation that is currently infinite - never run out of things to explore. Game uses voxels similar to Minecraft making everything interactive on some level. Game has hundreds of recipes for crafting. Game has farming, with 5 (soon to be 6) plantable seed types. Game has zombies to keep you on your toes, including running and fast variations. Game menu offers a wide variety of options to allow you to play the game the way you want to play it. Game has building with a wide variety of block types - make a hut, a cave or a castle, you are only limited by your imagination. Game has a wide variety of weapons with many more coming soon, from melee to projectile (clubs to guns). Game has buffs, debuffs and player attributes that must be maintained for optimal character performance. These include stamina, hunger, thirst, health, caffeine, broken bones, infection, bleeding, drowning, and several others. Game has day / night cycles with varying levels of light. Relatively low system requirements with decent framerate even on a laptop.Cons Currently no transportation methods, so infinite world can be daunting. These should be coming in the next few months. Limited zombie types with common skins - not a lot of zombie variety (roughly 12 different types). This should increase in the next few months. Lots of bugs - some that prevent an enjoyable multiplayer experience, but most aren't game-breaking.Synopsis / SummaryHaving played over 300 hours in the past 4.5 months, I'd say I already got my money's worth out of this game. I spend a lot of time on the official forums and have gotten a good feel for how the developers and moderators react to many things. Though the players and developers do defend their game when something negative is said, it doesn't feel like a hostile conversation for the most part.7DTD is a great game, even now in its uncompleted form. I have enjoyed playing numerous hours with my son and a few friends. The focus of the game is cooperative survival, but there's definitely a place for PvP. Nothing really feels like it was tacked on as an afterthought, although many of the sub-systems within the game are or feel like placeholders.If you're looking for a destructible world where survival and sandbox gameplay mix beautifully with a zombie apocalypse, look no further. I've never played Minecraft, but as far as I can tell, this is what mature, adult Minecraft would be. If you find someone else's review that states they do not recommend the game, look at their hours. Anything less than 10 hours and they have barely scratched the surface. Anything over 40 hours and they obviously enjoyed the game enough to keep coming back.I don't like to compare games unless they have a lot in common, at least regarding play style. But as far as early access goes, 7DTD has restored my faith in indie development teams. I've never put this many hours into a game before. And I'm far from bored, or done, playing it. Go buy it, or watch some youTube videos, and see what you're missing out on.			"

								Phenomenal Early Access game...incredible amount of content that combines exploration, scavenging, crafting, building and, of course, zombie slaying : )  The options available include single and multiplayer and multiplayer is available either by joining an existing public server or hosting your own game with friends only.  The are various setting options which allow you to control everything from day/night cycles to zombie spawn rates (and much, much more....the options are incredible!).  This allows you to enter the game at any intensity, from hardcore to no-zombies at all if you just want to get the hang of crafing, tunnelling, etc. without interruption before bashing some heads in. There are so many materials to build with and the freedom to build original structures any way you like, the possibilities are endless.  And, of course, zombie slaying : )  Thank you, Devs, for making such an in-depth and fantastic game!			"

Early Access Review
								This is one of my favorite games I have ever played. With the saturation of gathering/crafting games in the last few years it almost seems like the genre will be played out soon. But this game, in my opinion, outshines any of the other games remotely similar to it by far. The developers are always active and you can follow what they're working on via their development blog. A lot of people complain about the fact that they estimate a release date and sometimes the update won't be out until a little bit after but, in my book, that's the sign of a good development team. They're willing to push back a release to make sure that it is how they envisioned it, functioning properly, playable. You can tell they love this game and put their all into it.Hosting your own server is pretty awesome, I love the options you have to make the game however easy or difficult you desire. I originally was hosting my own server off of my second computer during alpha 11 but as I was running into issues. I ended up joining a server with similar settings I enjoyed and had a much better experience with letting someone else manage the server so I could just play and enjoy. I believe my map data was corrupting but I didn't spend too much time troubleshooting so I'm not positive.To sum things up, I love this game and would highly recommend it to any one who ever enjoyed minecraft and left4dead...This game is kind of like those two had a kid. Zombies run at night, every 7 days there is a feral horde that will stop at nothing to kill you, PvP servers are pretty brutal (and super fun!), active developers...whats not to love?**************************************************************************************************************Here it is about a year later, Wrote a second review forgetting I had already wrote one:I've been playing since version A-9. I enjoyed it back then and it has come a long way since then and I still love it. I have probably spent 3X more time playing this game than any other game I have ever owned. It is a unique open world zombie survival game. It's like minecraft and left for dead had a baby. The devs, The Fun Pimps, have been pretty on top of this game and, if not pushing frequent updates out, allowing you to follow their progress and work via their Tumblr account. The shear amount of rebalancing and overhaul that they've done on this game gives it a fresh feel everytime I play through it again. If you get this game and it feels like you have everything you could ever want...well my advice is start over from lvl 1 on a new random gen map and have another go at it. Try joining a different server, PVP servers are a whole different experience from PVE servers. If you've only ever played single player, join a pve server and try to join up with a group or get your friends to join you, it really changes the dynamic of the game.I ran my own server for a little while, there are plenty of options to change and customize the game play to your liking from loot spawn frequency and amount, day light hours and over all 24 hour cycle real to real time ratio(zombies sprint at night), zombie spawn frequency and difficulty, and many more options to get it just the way you want it. I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys survival games and zombies.			"

								I have played alot of this game. Here is my honest review.Single player -Boring!!! Only time i play single player is when my internet is out from a storm. Multi player  - Pve - Fun to build what you want. Most servers are not hard on pve. You can trade items. Not many hackers troll pve servers. But after building a casle and a cave system. Zombies are no longer a problem. Gets boring fast.Multi player  - PvP - IF you find a good server with great admins/mods. This can be extremely fun. Some have drop all features. ( An oldschool Runescape style get everything once you kill them) Most servers on pvp lets you raid other peoples bases. This can take alot of time. But rewards are mostly good. Its can be extremely fun waiting outside someones base for an hour listening to him craft and wait for him to open his door. Then ""boom"" shotgun to the head.. Rush in take his sleeping bag, then take over his base. Most hackers are on pvp servers. You can find people who can fly, shoot threw walls. But, If you play the game right and know the tricks. Hackers are not really a problem.Over all, If you are learning the game go pve. You will learn the tricks of building a base for pvp. For long term playing. PVP is the way to go. After you get all the items you need. Food,water,weapons, and a base there is not much to do. So pvp is for long term playing.Graphics      -8/10   -    ( i don't know max my computer can't handle it.}Gameplay    -10/10 -   ( Lots to do so much to loot, World never ends)Replay          -5/10  -   ( i give this because solo playing can and will get boring fast)Overall         - 9/10 -    { Still in alpha and better then 80% of the games on steam)			"

Sneaking from house to house I acquired a pistol, set up a base in one of the houses, and got semi-comfortable. Then came the horde of dogs.			"

								With the newest A15 update, which has updated the game even further and brought much more substance to the game, I figured it was a good time to do a review.Originally, I hated this game back when I first bought it, back around the time the original game came out. It has become a complete turnaround for me, and currently it's a game I'm very addicted to.Before I go on, I do want to say that the majority of my experience in this game is in single player. But I'm sure multiplayer with randoms can be just as exciting as a game like DayZ. And playing the game with just friends, well.. it can become an incredible co-op experience.First off, I love survival-type games like DayZ and the like (more specifically, DayZ Epoch/Overpoch and DayZ Origins). I also love base building, hording weapons/items/etc, and stuff like that. In this game, building a base, as well as going out and getting supplies, building up my arsenal and so on, is a lot of fun. Build a base, build defenses, take care of your survival needs such as hunger and hydration (which goes even deeper with having to be careful about your temperature, and diseases), and survive the hordes that come every seven days - hence the name of the game. To make everything all the more better, the game includes RPG elements that reward you for killing zombies, scavenging, building and much more. It all becomes together as an incredibly addictiveIf you're new and you want to get settled in before getting overwhelmed, there are plenty of options in single player that allows you to change the difficulty. You can even turn off zombies, which can allow you to build a base in peace, before you decide to take on the hordes. There are a lot of options, from changing how much loot there is out in the world, to how thick the zombie population is in the world.. from difficulties varying from ""Very Easy"" to ""Very Hard.""As you work on your base, you can go out and loot, level up, kill zombies and try to find weapons, equipment and building supplies to make your life a lot easier. The RPG system makes the game all the more addicting, as I stated before.There are a lot of options now when it comes to building bases, whether you're using different materials (wood, scrap metal, concrete, etc). Making an ultimate base that can stand a beating will takes time to build, as you'll generally want to use concrete, which will take awhile to craft. It's a good end-game type scenario to go for, and while you wait, you can make bases made out of wood to start you out. It doesn't take that long to build a simple base with wood, and with the right supplies, you can even upgrade your wooden base to more solid materials, such as scrap metal, brick, concrete and more. Meaning, you don't have to destroy your starter base made out of wood. Instead, you can upgrade it/build around it. And with the A15 update, there are a ton of different things you can build for your base, to make it your own original fortress. Just look up images of what people have done with their bases in the game, especially bases built in the current A15 build. Create a simple log cabin in the woods and live out your days in the wild. Dig yourself a secret underground bunker, with a giant maze of underground mining tunnels. Find a mountain and dig in, build a fortress that zombies and bandits alike would have trouble getting into, using both your structures and the mountain to protect you and your loot. Or make it easy, find an existing building in the world and customize it to your liking (just be aware of zombies spawning nearby). Heck, you can actually build a castle with a moat and a working drawbridge - though I'd recommend filling the moat with spikes and other defenses, as zombies aren't really bothered by water!Even if you aren't into base building, there's still a lot to do. Killing zombies, collecting items.. and if you're playing multiplayer, and if you're into that sort of thing, you can hunt players if you prefer a more PvP element. I don't have much experience with that in this game so I can't really go into it, but with my experience, I can't imagine it being bad.There's so much to collect and build on, and the game is still in early access.. meaning, there'll be even more added. And there's already a lot of different items to collect in the world as is, so it's extremely exciting to think about how the game will turn out once it's officially out of early access!In the end, the base building and looting mixed with the RPG element makes it a game that's not only incredibly addictive, it also gives it endless replayability. Your skills in the RPG department can effect many things. It can effect the level of loot you find, with the more you level up, the better level of loot you'll find. You can level up your Rifle skills, Handgun, Blunt or Bladed Weapons, and more. Focus on leveling on one in particular, or try to raise all your skills at the same time.Each time you level up - or complete missions - you are rewarded skill points. You can level up your skills by using these skill points, and/or you can also level up certain abilities by other means. Such as, if you want to raise your Scavenging skill, you can spend points in it. Otherwise, each time you loot an object, you gain experience towards your Scavenging skill. Same goes for pretty much all the rest of the skillsets, such as using Rifle weaponry to level up your Rifle skill level, using/building mining tools to level up your Mining and so on. There are also special abilities that can only be bought, that can make some of your base skills even more powerful, such as buying an ability that gives your bladed weapons a better chance to dismember your opponent's head/arm/leg, and much more.I could go on for quite awhile, so I'll just say.. if you aren't convinced yet, just go on Youtube and watch videos of other people playing the game. If you're into survival games, looting and base building.. or if you're into games such as Minecraft or DayZ, then chances are you'll enjoy it.Pros -- Endless replayability, whether you're playing alone or with friends.- Base building is a lot of fun, and there are a ton of blocks and such that'll allow you to create your own unique base.- RPG elements that end up mixing extremely well with the survival and base building aspects of the game, which ends up making the game incredibly addictive.- A lot of variety when it comes to items you can find in the world, and a good amount of variety when it comes to zombies, clothing, building blocks and more.- If you get bored of the main map, you can create a random map - complete with seeds - similar to Minecraft.- You can build a motorcycle once you get the right materials, making traveling the world a lot easier and faster. The better the engine, the faster it'll go, making it so the game isn't a complete walking simulator.- Too much to list, honestly. Read the TLDR version above and you'll get the gist of it.Cons -(First off, chances are these will be changed - hopefully for the better - as the game is still in early access.)- Weather system can be incredibly frustrating. You'll generally need to plan out what clothing to take with you, depending on what biome you go to. Some of the biomes are WAY too sensitive. It's not too bad once you get used to it and have the clothing you need, but it could definitely be annoying to new players, or experienced players creating new characters that are starting off from scratch.- While I don't mind this myself, some may be turned off to some of the grinding you may have to do to build concrete bases, or to find good items, such as the Auger which allows you to dig underground/collect rock and ores extremely quickly. It will take time.- Addictive! :] Which is.. bad for some people, I guess? lol.			"

								Great game! Allowed me and my closest proletariats to rise up and fight back against the dirty bourgeoisie zombies. We were able to take back all that was rightfully ours and create our own world with no class struggle. A society of cooperation, one in which the working people were free, we finally seized control of the means of production. I hope that all others will follow our example and take back what is rightfully theirs from their oppressors .			"

								Have you ever played a Zombie game where you get your gun, scrounge some ammo, then farm till you're bored?ever played where you wall yourself in somewhere, get overwhelmed and just decide it's not fun anymore because you did all you could?Spend in-game days in some room somewhere wondering ""when was the last time this guy ate?""... ever wished you could just take a buiding apart with your sledgehammer?how about blow the ever-loving smeg out of the floor with your rocket-launcher?THIS IS NOTHING LIKE ANY OF THEM!I have played this game for hours. Crafting. Food farming. Weapon repairing. metal forging. looting. running like heck through a snowy hill surrounded by dead things without any kind of light source!oh yeah... this game has all that AND MORE!best played with the lights out, headphones on, best bro backing you up and with lots and lots of sugar to keep you allert!you're going to need to free up a few hours to play this because you won't believe how much you can do!I spent nearly three hours barricading a petrol station.. zombie dogs baying at the windows, huge zombies beating at the doors... i was desperate. i gathered my resources, built a ladder, broke a hole in the wall beside the door and shot the gas pump! the explosion bought me enough time to get to the roof, destroy the ladder and hole up for the night to repair my weapons and eat something before i starved to death!got bored of that... so i made another game, made a pickaxe and dug straight down! my friend built a farm and i got him the materials to make bullets! now, we're living like dwarven kings in an underground structure bigger than the houses on the surface!This game isn't even finished yet and it's one of the best ever zombie games i've ever seen![EDIT]I have been following the developers as this game updates through the alphas. I can't think of many other games that deserve a console-release as much as 7Days and I am increasingly glad with every new feature they impliment with each new alpha.My only regret is that it takes so long to make a game. TFP work hard and this is not a sleight on them, but making a game THIS EPIC takes a lot of man-hours and there are not enough hours in the day haha!			"

								Fantastic game that I'm enjoying more and more each day as I discover something new. Similar to minecraft with the crafting, mining and trying to survive but with added realism. EDIT: Put a few more hours in now and love it! Perfect to play in single player but I think it plays best with others so you have other players and zombies to worry about.Zombies can pose a real threat and will break through your defenses to hunt you down. Your buildings need to take in to account physics / gravity - you can't place blocks in ""thin air"". Mines will colapse on top of you if not adequately supported. If you carry raw meat or cooked food then the zombies can smell it if they get close.Multiple ways to play as well. Play by yourself against the zombies, bring friends along to work with you or against you, or go online and join P v P v E servers for some real carnage.Highlight for me so far is a zombie horde tearing our base to pieces just as I was thinking that we were pretty well established.So for an alpha I'm very impressed with the content and how it plays though the game still has a few things to iron out:Hackers - First few online games I played in had the odd hacker. The latest release has an additional cheat protection that is being trialled so hopefully this will help.  EDIT: Not really had problems with hackers since finding a good server with good admin and good protection (IP blocks, Ping limits, EAC and GBL enabled). Glitches - Some graphical glitches allowing me to get out of a sealed underground mine. Not a massive problem. Cooking mechanic can get glitchy and mean more fuel is needed to cook things. EDIT: Still some glitches though gets better with each patch. Not really an issue for single player or PvE and only becomes a slight problem for PvP if people abuse exploits.I think it is worth buying at normal price and a MUST BUY if it goes on sale again (which it no doubt will soon enough).

								I am writing this review in response to Holly nielsons post on how this game is 'wasting its potential'...Ok first of all, it's still in alpha. Secondly, for me graphics and animations are by far the least important aspect of a game...gameplay is whats important and 7 Days to Die has some of the funnest gameplay out there, If your a creative person. You see, someone like holly likes to be handed fun on a silver platter where as if you create fun things in a sandbox the limits are endless. The crafting/building aspect of this game alone is better than minecraft and then you add in zombies and the tower defense aspect and you have pure 500 hours plus of fun and andventure without even reaching a max level character or seeing everything in a random gen map. Then you add PvP which I think is absolutley amazing as well, once you get the PvE elements down you learn to stalk people, follow their trail of looted trash, case their fortress and then eventually take them out. No this isnt Call of duty where you get kills all the time bc in this game its about survival and dying is really rough. These things are positives for someone who uuses their brain and makes hidden drop boxes with extra sets of gear and thinks ahead for these things. Further more you can always turn up the setting to have zombies set to 'Always Run' a challenge ive been working on for some time now and its very possible and very fun! overall 7 days to die is amazing and the only way to get bored in the game is to stop being creative..mic drop			"

								I enjoy the survival games and own RUST, The Stomping Land, DayZ, State of Decay and this 7DTD.  7 Days 2 Die is a very nice game to play.  The graphics update has been a massive improvement and helped seperate the game from Mincraft in my opinion.  I would say the best feature of the game is that you can play at your own pace.  Either by yourself in the ""Single Player game"" or challenge yourself in the PvE or even just play online with new people and even a option to play just with your buddies in a game where you create every rule for the game before playing.  There is even an option to play in a create mode game where you can enable the create tab where every item is available for you to use wiith out having to craft it.  So you can learn how to build things that may take time in the game.  The servers are small at the moment devs stating the game right now runs the best at 8 players.  Mutiplayer servers give admins the freedom to create there own buildings so some of the servers have extra towns that the server owner has set up to spawn items and I have to say some of them are well put together and add that extra wow feature to there servers.  I would rate the game in its current state as a 7/10.  There is still that wall in the game of ""Well I have done everthing so what is there now?""			"

								Now, 7 Days to Die is a great game for creating a server and playing with friends, it however has it's cons.  Sketchy performance being one of them. I have a GTX 1070 and cannot run the game on high at 60fps or more. This game is an EA game so there is not much more to say about that. However, it's release date was in 2013. It has been three years and the game is still in alpha? I have looked at some patch notes, and watched some previews for the Alpha 16 build, and it is obvious the the devs are still supporting the game. I just wish it was further in devolpment for the time given. I enjoy the game and love playing it with friends. I hope this game does not end up like Dayz, and does get past alpha. With all of that being said 7 Days to Die is a great game. I recommend trying it out, and if you do not like it, you can refund it. 10/10 would find a pistol in the tiolet again.Edit: Turns out there is dedicated server support, removing that from my cons.

								7 Days to Die is good zombie apocalypse game that holds on to a realistsic game play style. As a survivor you have to scavenge for everyday necessaties like food and water while avoiding being eaten. A key and realistic feature, however, is the discipline required to effectively survive this onslaught; Ammo conservation and combat restriction (knowing when to pick fights or when to just run) is important as running straight into the zombie horde, guns ablazing will waste valuable resources and your life. The only thing that would make this game better is if it have a few more weapon options and if there was more of a goal to achieve, since after a while you are able to build up a steady supply of everything you need. All in all this game is very good and has been well crafted together. I strongly recommend this game to anyone who is into survival crafting games.			"

								This game is a pretty vast game with a lot of hidden secrets. Even if the game looks a little jagged and rough around the edges, it's a great eperience. The biggest perk about 7 days to die for me was the amount of alterations you can modify: Percentage of day and night cycles, speed of time,  the amount of zombies spawn, zombie difficulty, if zombies run, your strength, zombie strength, litterally everything can be modified to fit your level of gaming experience. So litterally everyone will have fun without dying every 3 seconds from getting swarmed by a heard of zombies or just getting bored because you became very good at the game. If you like sandbox games and zombies, its a must buy. Best game I've bought in a while... 9/10			"

								I am writing this review in response to Holly nielsons post on how this game is 'wasting its potential'...Ok first of all, it's still in alpha. Secondly, for me graphics and animations are by far the least important aspect of a game...gameplay is whats important and 7 Days to Die has some of the funnest gameplay out there, If your a creative person. You see, someone like holly likes to be handed fun on a silver platter where as if you create fun things in a sandbox the limits are endless. The crafting/building aspect of this game alone is better than minecraft and then you add in zombies and the tower defense aspect and you have pure 500 hours plus of fun and andventure without even reaching a max level character or seeing everything in a random gen map. Then you add PvP which I think is absolutley amazing as well, once you get the PvE elements down you learn to stalk people, follow their trail of looted trash, case their fortress and then eventually take them out. No this isnt Call of duty where you get kills all the time bc in this game its about survival and dying is really rough. These things are positives for someone who uuses their brain and makes hidden drop boxes with extra sets of gear and thinks ahead for these things. Further more you can always turn up the setting to have zombies set to 'Always Run' a challenge ive been working on for some time now and its very possible and very fun! overall 7 days to die is amazing and the only way to get bored in the game is to stop being creative..mic drop			"

								I purchased this game when it was Alpha 9.3; I have played SP for a long time before joining MP servers which got enjoyable. I also run a lightly modded MP PvE server with TS.. Its development is good for the most part. And we anticipate a better experience from TFP in the future.. Highly recommended, but keep in mind: It is in Alpha, so expect bugs;			"

								7 Days to Die is a fun and refreshing survival/horror game. I enjoy the exploration of different biomes and the ability to search and loot practically every building and trash bag in the universe. It's great to play and search alone in singleplayer, but even better when you team up with friends and raid enemy bases and massive skyscrapers! The game gets even better at night, when the stars are out and the zombies get crazier, adding to the horror and intense feel of wanting to stay hidden from view of them, however sometimes the AI of the zombies is a bit silly and pulls away from the feel, but the game is still in development so I can assume it will be fixed in the future. Overall this game is great and well worth the money. You can expect many hours of fun and new places that you haven't explored.			"

								My all time favorite game. This is my go to game in my eclectic game library. Even though it is early access, the developers are dedicated! Constantly working with their community and listening. Balancing and adding features that the community recommends is the way of the future. The game itself just continues to get better and better as time goes on. The graphics are pretty decent but could be better. The content is incredible. There is literally so much to do, you could spend hours and hours doing one thing and move to another. The Fun Pimps are sticking to their word. Adding kickstarter goals and adding a bunch of other epic features is awesome. This is and always will have a deep rooted spot in my heart. It does take time to get used to the gameplay, people that are new will get frustrated and upset, but end game is so rewarding and gratifing. If you havent yet, please check out this game if you are a zombie horror survival game lover!Update: I am a VR enthusiast and just read that the developers will be adding VR support. I cannot wait and am so excited that developers are adopting new technologies and are open to new features. Great!			"

								7 Days to Die is good zombie apocalypse game that holds on to a realistsic game play style. As a survivor you have to scavenge for everyday necessaties like food and water while avoiding being eaten. A key and realistic feature, however, is the discipline required to effectively survive this onslaught; Ammo conservation and combat restriction (knowing when to pick fights or when to just run) is important as running straight into the zombie horde, guns ablazing will waste valuable resources and your life. The only thing that would make this game better is if it have a few more weapon options and if there was more of a goal to achieve, since after a while you are able to build up a steady supply of everything you need. All in all this game is very good and has been well crafted together. I strongly recommend this game to anyone who is into survival crafting games.			"

								This game is a pretty vast game with a lot of hidden secrets. Even if the game looks a little jagged and rough around the edges, it's a great eperience. The biggest perk about 7 days to die for me was the amount of alterations you can modify: Percentage of day and night cycles, speed of time,  the amount of zombies spawn, zombie difficulty, if zombies run, your strength, zombie strength, litterally everything can be modified to fit your level of gaming experience. So litterally everyone will have fun without dying every 3 seconds from getting swarmed by a heard of zombies or just getting bored because you became very good at the game. If you like sandbox games and zombies, its a must buy. Best game I've bought in a while... 9/10			"

								I have a policy that I can't ""not recommend"" any game that beats the $4=1 hour ratio. No matter how much i wind up disliking a game, at the end of the day its there to distract me and if I comit a ludicrous amount of time to it. Then it could be about potato chip eating and I still have to thumbs up it. This game will do what you pay it to do, distract, because it takes alot of time to experiment and discover how shallow the game is.I imagine my reaction to this game was similar to alot of others, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥its like minecraft but the monsters attack your place and you have a reason to set up proper defences. I was ready for a tower defense game, using my wit to slaughter hundreds of enemies instead of brute force.Well, I was wrong. Looking through the crafting menu it would APPEAR that I was right, wood spikes, land mines, fire based items. Buuuuut;  mines you have to replace and screw up the landscape, fires you have to start by hand in the campfire through their ui, and their effeciency is questionable. The only reliable defense are the spikes which degrade pretty rapidly and often times straight up break in 3-4 zombies. They also consume material like no tomorrow via repair and upgrade.So that means Every. Single. Wandering. Zombie you hear bashing at your walls, you have to deal with by hand. This is a brute force game. However, ""brute force"" basically means having to grind your head off for feathers to make arrows until you find the book and parts to make a yellow (medium) or higher shot gun. Usually by day 10 or so, then you win the game, as nothing will pose a challange anymore. Make a 3 layered wall with iron bars and at that point you're just fighting at night and repairing during the day. There are no more curve balls other than maintenance which is a fricken chore.I don't play alot of multiplayer as many people have complained about having all their work destroyed by other players, so I don't know much about straight pvp. But frankly that concept boggles my mind as there is nothing to gain by killing another player and everything to lose. All of their resources, I guarentee you, are just as prevelant and by consequence worthless as yours. There is no mega difference between a purple hunting rifle and a green one other than the 15% extra times it can be fired before being repaired.My comments would be - get rid of the asinine tempature mechanic, honestly what the ♥♥♥♥! my inventory is small enough without having to devot 6 slots to heat opposites.- and just add an electricity mechanic. That's it, some pistons and redstone and let us use our creative minds to deal with the zombies.TL:DR Consumes hours to find out its pretty shallow, but still consumes them. I would give a f*ck but I hear a zombie outside and now I have to take another 3 sh*t blistering minutes to deal with him by hand like the last 6.			"

You don't have to focus on crafting if you don't want and trying to survive is more your thing.  Well thought out so far, looking forward to what else can be done...though I would like if you could control the total population limit sorta like Project Zomboid has a ""limit"" but different games and the current system works well for 7...so really, I have no complaints.  Good game, keep up the great work devs.			"

								Now, 7 Days to Die is a great game for creating a server and playing with friends, it however has it's cons.  Sketchy performance being one of them. I have a GTX 1070 and cannot run the game on high at 60fps or more. This game is an EA game so there is not much more to say about that. However, it's release date was in 2013. It has been three years and the game is still in alpha? I have looked at some patch notes, and watched some previews for the Alpha 16 build, and it is obvious the the devs are still supporting the game. I just wish it was further in devolpment for the time given. I enjoy the game and love playing it with friends. I hope this game does not end up like Dayz, and does get past alpha. With all of that being said 7 Days to Die is a great game. I recommend trying it out, and if you do not like it, you can refund it. 10/10 would find a pistol in the tiolet again.Edit: Turns out there is dedicated server support, removing that from my cons.

								Phenomenal Early Access game...incredible amount of content that combines exploration, scavenging, crafting, building and, of course, zombie slaying : )  The options available include single and multiplayer and multiplayer is available either by joining an existing public server or hosting your own game with friends only.  The are various setting options which allow you to control everything from day/night cycles to zombie spawn rates (and much, much more....the options are incredible!).  This allows you to enter the game at any intensity, from hardcore to no-zombies at all if you just want to get the hang of crafing, tunnelling, etc. without interruption before bashing some heads in. There are so many materials to build with and the freedom to build original structures any way you like, the possibilities are endless.  And, of course, zombie slaying : )  Thank you, Devs, for making such an in-depth and fantastic game!			"

								All I can say is I wish I bought this sooner.For the longest time I was interested in this game, looking at screenshots, Twitch streams, and Youtube videos but for some reason it didn't look quite like something I enjoyed. I thought it was going to be a very 'carebear-ish' minecraft survival game. Finally I picked it up a week or so ago on the Steam sale cause for what they were charging I would be alright if my preconceptions were confirmed. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥was I wrong.Right off the bat this game is going to kick the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you. You'll fumble through trying to figure out how to craft the basics, thinking you can take on a group of Zombies like you can in other games, only to get your head pushed in. The crafting system is incredibly indepth and rewarding. The zombies (unlike other games) are not to be underestimated.

								A11.6 Review (Currently 27 hours played)This game is on track for an awesome release.   The current meat of the game is a very solid apocalyptic zombie survival game that allows a multitude of options from difficulty, to day-night cycle length, to zombie AI behavior (and more) when setting up a single player or multiplayer game.  The combat handles well, the crafting is fun, and the building and upgrading of your home base seems to be coming along great.  Right now you can adventure in the preset world, or let the game procedurally generate a new world for you.  With the ability to generate new random worlds, there's endless territory to explore.Hunger, thirst, health, stamina, wellness - these are your current stats that you need to keep an eye on.  And of course, there's all sorts of injuries and sickness you need to watch out for as well.  Almost everyting in the world is destructable, and most of it yields items or parts you can use to craft something else.  And the main selling point for me, is the ability to setup a co-op, non-friendly-fire game, where I don't have to worry about PvP.  It's just me and my friends, against the zombies and the cruel, harsh environment.Of course, there are bugs to contend with, as it's still alpha, but with monthly updates, and an exciting list of improvements to look forward to, if you like survival games, this one is definitely one to watch.(Will update this review as the game progressess!)

								Like minecraft you can build plenty of items. Unlike minecraft you must build a fortress that can actually withstand attacks from zombie hordes. There are different types so your not fighting the same kind all the time. The waste that you have to roam is filled with plenty of items to keep you busy for hours. The realistic texture to the game makes it a lot better on the eyes. You can play on LAN parties or go online and play with friends. There are plenty of servers up to choose from. And if you dont want to play with anyone else, you can always go solo, Creative or Survival. "

								7 days to die is basically a survival game, its like a advanced version of minecraft, where the zombies are more aggressive and dangerous.If minecraft and survival isn't your thing then this game will not be suitable for you.In 7 days to die your goal is to survive but you can also be aggressive and hunt zombies instead its up to you.build a fotress against the limitless horde or a farm and live peacefully in the wild, or simply move from one location to another surviving on what you find there are many ways to play this game.But I definately recommend playing the Multiplayer its fun, PVP is not bad but it does get annoying when peoples who have been on the server longer pick on the new comers. Some servers are PVE and the community are pretty friendly just don't go joining a game and start asking for freebies.................			"

								I've been playing this for sometime now some 6months, Its still in development and still progressing nicely if a little slower than i'd like. Since Unity engine has been implented the graphics are truly amazing making everything crisp and scenic, Gamplay is great fun although still many bugs throught none that i would say really impact too much on playing.I love the crafting, poping zombie heads finding loot and general ambience of your typical survival fest. If i'm honest at this point in time i am starting to become bored. There could be so much more (and i imagine at some point there will be...when is a different matter) Once you build that great fort or team up and pvp om multi-player server or loner out in your own sandbox it all becomes repetitative. there is a nice array of tools and things to build, cook, farm and mine but once you have suited and armed up with a sniper rifle, magnum or smg it all becomes kinda pointless not that it isnt still fun in its own right.....What i hope we will see... More weapons, Traps, Armor, Vehicles. (im thinking 5+ times more what is already available) Mega Zombies with variety of skills sets to compliement the atomosphere Like while you raiding a town and searching an attic only to turn on a light and see the whole in stasis family swaying with blood lust at your arrival. Big Zombie ""see the size of that thing""  ""♥♥♥♥♥♥im out of ammo.F""£%..RUN!"". Im sure everyone can pick a unique setting or zombie and its that lacking part that for the most part at AT THIS TIME making it all a little mundane. But Overall im still playing so that speak volumes. Finger crossed i get all i wish for and then some. Worth a look if you like this sort of thing.!! Buy it.			"

								My all time favorite game. This is my go to game in my eclectic game library. Even though it is early access, the developers are dedicated! Constantly working with their community and listening. Balancing and adding features that the community recommends is the way of the future. The game itself just continues to get better and better as time goes on. The graphics are pretty decent but could be better. The content is incredible. There is literally so much to do, you could spend hours and hours doing one thing and move to another. The Fun Pimps are sticking to their word. Adding kickstarter goals and adding a bunch of other epic features is awesome. This is and always will have a deep rooted spot in my heart. It does take time to get used to the gameplay, people that are new will get frustrated and upset, but end game is so rewarding and gratifing. If you havent yet, please check out this game if you are a zombie horror survival game lover!Update: I am a VR enthusiast and just read that the developers will be adding VR support. I cannot wait and am so excited that developers are adopting new technologies and are open to new features. Great!			"

								This game has quite a long way to go before it's feature complete, but it's already a hell of a lot of fun and pretty expansive. The combat in particular is crunchy and satisfying, and with the infinite worlds update you can just keep travelling in one direction and never stop. Apparently vehicles are planned for the future so we'll all be zipping around in junk buggies before too long. If you like Minecraft and wanted more of a zombie survival feel to it, you'll absolutely love this game. If you like games like State of Decay and DayZ you'll probably like it too.			"

								All I can say is I wish I bought this sooner.For the longest time I was interested in this game, looking at screenshots, Twitch streams, and Youtube videos but for some reason it didn't look quite like something I enjoyed. I thought it was going to be a very 'carebear-ish' minecraft survival game. Finally I picked it up a week or so ago on the Steam sale cause for what they were charging I would be alright if my preconceptions were confirmed. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥was I wrong.Right off the bat this game is going to kick the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you. You'll fumble through trying to figure out how to craft the basics, thinking you can take on a group of Zombies like you can in other games, only to get your head pushed in. The crafting system is incredibly indepth and rewarding. The zombies (unlike other games) are not to be underestimated. Even if you are geared well and levelled up, if you don't keep a track of what's going on you can get swarmed and smashed very easily.I'm not even into what I think is mid-game and I'm loving it, if this sparks a little bit of interest in you and you have a few extra bucks kicking around and love the survival genre, you really need to check this out. I've played a good portion of Survival games out there, Early Access and otherwise, and this is without a doubt at the top of my list.			"

								A11.6 Review (Currently 27 hours played)This game is on track for an awesome release.   The current meat of the game is a very solid apocalyptic zombie survival game that allows a multitude of options from difficulty, to day-night cycle length, to zombie AI behavior (and more) when setting up a single player or multiplayer game.  The combat handles well, the crafting is fun, and the building and upgrading of your home base seems to be coming along great.

								Day 1: Died, a lot.  Eventually lived long enough and gathered enough mats to have a bow and arrow.  Survived the night by crouching down in a field...Day 2: Died a bit less.  Finally found a spot to build the perfect little base!  Started gathering wood for walls and such, had a full suit of cloth armor, all the basic tools, just great!Day 3: Storage boxes for all the things!  Had to drink some pond water and got Dysentery...  which sucked until a murderous 6 zombie rampage that netted some vitamins!  Things are looking up!  Laid out the first, of many, sleeping bags as well!Day 4: Are there a few more zombies around this morning than yesterday?  I can't quite tell so the day is spent slaughtering all zombies nearby - just in case.  Double bonus with some fresh pig!  Start cooking the pig and hear lots of footsteps....  It's getting near dark so it's Rambo time.  Arrows flying everywhere!  2 slow big ones, 2 infected walkers, and a crawler for flavor.  Dispatched easily enough and back into the wooded house for the night.Day 4 - Midnight: There are a lot of footsteps outside now...  Mostly just middling about though...  And then you hear it.  One of the zombies stomping with purpose.  The torch is extinguished as fast as possible!  Maybe if they can't see me then I'll be ok!  The thing roars as it nears the door.  Your wounds are still too fresh from earlier.*CRACK* go the *CRACK* zombie's *CRACK!* knocks *CRASH*...  and then it's over.Respawning in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...			"

Sneaking from house to house I acquired a pistol, set up a base in one of the houses, and got semi-comfortable. Then came the horde of dogs.			"

								I have played alot of this game. Here is my honest review.Single player -Boring!!! Only time i play single player is when my internet is out from a storm. Multi player  - Pve - Fun to build what you want. Most servers are not hard on pve. You can trade items. Not many hackers troll pve servers. But after building a casle and a cave system. Zombies are no longer a problem. Gets boring fast.Multi player  - PvP - IF you find a good server with great admins/mods. This can be extremely fun. Some have drop all features. ( An oldschool Runescape style get everything once you kill them) Most servers on pvp lets you raid other peoples bases. This can take alot of time. But rewards are mostly good. Its can be extremely fun waiting outside someones base for an hour listening to him craft and wait for him to open his door. Then ""boom"" shotgun to the head.. Rush in take his sleeping bag, then take over his base. Most hackers are on pvp servers. You can find people who can fly, shoot threw walls. But, If you play the game right and know the tricks. Hackers are not really a problem.Over all, If you are learning the game go pve. You will learn the tricks of building a base for pvp. For long term playing. PVP is the way to go. After you get all the items you need. Food,water,weapons, and a base there is not much to do. So pvp is for long term playing.Graphics      -8/10   -    ( i don't know max my computer can't handle it.}Gameplay    -10/10 -   ( Lots to do so much to loot, World never ends)Replay          -5/10  -   ( i give this because solo playing can and will get boring fast)Overall         - 9/10 -    { Still in alpha and better then 80% of the games on steam)			"

								Don't let my 116+ hours fool you; I was playing 7 Days to Die in 2013.  Today we are at Alpha 10.4 - well over a year from initial release and I still can't get enough.   For those with a creative mind and a love of all things zombie - you may skip my review and purchase the game with confidence.  For the curious or undecided, please read on.This is a game that stands head and shoulders above all other early-access-survival offerings by far.  Unlike some of those work-in-progress titles, 7 days delivers uncommon depth and the opportunity for unlimited hours of enjoyable gameplay today.  Exciting, challenging and content heavy - you will gather, loot, hunt, farm, cook, mine, forge, craft and build as you fight to survive the zombie apocalypse.RPG elements don't overwhelm but enhance the experience and include full character customisation.  Through a clever 'wellness system' with buffs and debuffs (including clothing, armor, infection, broken bones, hunger, thirst etc.) you have a real reason to invest in your characters upkeep.   The healthier your lifestyle, the stronger you become and the longer you live.   Death - whilst inevitable - is not permanent but comes at the cost of said wellness.  Let it fall too low and as a weakling, you will struggle.Hundreds of loot types from full weapons to tools to scrap metals and seeds must be managed and stored in your custom base.  Build Fort Knox, Edinburgh Castle, an underground lair or a shed made of wood, the choice is yours and with hundreds of materials to use, you are limited only by your imagination, skill and dedication.  Keep in mind - zombies *will* pay your base a visit.Through that dedication, you will go from undressed and unarmed to being an iron clad, heavily armed killing machine, (relatively) safe in your spiked fortress.Other reasons to recommend this wonderful game include :- Tight controls- Handsome visuals- Highly customisable game options- Procedurally generated endless maps or 'Navezgane' - a prefab map- Real physics (think 'Minecraft with gravity')- Free of game-breaking bugs- Tower Defence elements- Large and growing online community- Detailed Wiki and stacks of Youtube content for the beginner- Guaranteed further development by passionate devs (Alpha 11 due late February)- Value for money!- ZOMBIEZ and SHOTGUNS!I've been a gamer since the 1980's, starting with Grundig Pong.  7 Days to Die is *the game* I've always wanted.Thank you Fun Pimps.   My rating : 9/10 (leaving 1 spare point for the completed release!)Right, I'm off to kill some zombies.Besos,Max xP.S.  If I can tack on one slightly negative comment :  Some public servers do currently contain hackers and griefers intent on spoiling your experience.  This said, it is a mostly helpful and friendly online community.			"

								I wish i could do more than just recommend this guy. i wish i could make it mandatory. i've been watching this game change and evolve from an already great game into the incredible-almost unbelievable state it's in now. and the developers are some of the best i've seen for any game-they keep churning out new updates and fixing problems and bugs and adding new features i didn't even know i wanted. like rocket launchers, mini bikes, and bears. i didn't know i wanted those things in the game until they were mentioned and now i couldn't imagine this game without them. adding a loot rarity system that ties in with your level keeps me coming back. just getting to that next in tier in loot and being able to craft that better weapon or tool to help you survive a little bit better...it's fantastic. and the zombies. jesus, jesus christ, the zombies. the longer you survive the more there are. think turning the spawn rate down to very low will help you? maybe for the first few days, but when you're 2-4 weeks in, they get ♥♥♥♥ing massive and you can spend almost a whole hour wiping out some of the bigger hordes they send your way (i don't use the guns on zombies, though, so it might take you a lot less time if you were)anyway, all i can really add is that if you like a crafting or survival game or you like zombies or a good open world FPS-then stop reading reviews and BUY THIS GAME			"

								Pretty cool. The performance is a bit bad and it does take alot of RAM.But the survival aspect is really exciting wheter you are going thru ghost towns for some loot or you are hiding from danger.The horror aspect really kicks in as the nights are pitch black. I will recomend it :)			"

								Billoins of years ago in a computer game filled with zombies I finaly found somthing good. . .I have played alot of zombie games and alot of survivel games, Many of them have on cool mechanic or function that makes the uniq. But come on most of them are just the same thing. Well of all the games I played that mix Zombie and Survival, What makes this game stand out? I think I must say its the fact that the game have a nice paste, or that I did not expect anything but a  minecraft/dayz clone. But found a game game that perfectly is a mix of them all. You can get PvP if u join a random server or PvE by playing with friends (or offline in the dark hell you call a home) The fact is that I started playing around 13:00 and five min later my watch was 22:00.. I really do feel like a surviver searching for food in old shops and fleeing zombies the next. In a way, great immersion. The fact that the developers ""the funny pimps"" are doing great job on the game and always keep realeasing new stuff helps to. I want to see some things added, like: More weapons, Some way of transport. NPC trading towns. + stats on difrent type of armour so not all are running around in only iron armour,So lets just see what more this game gives me in time :) I do want to see more ppl playing this game, and I must say I really recommend it.Dont take my word for it, see this video:

								Although still Early Access, currently Alpha 14, this captivating game has enough content and replayability to entertain and keep you busy for hundreds of hours if not more. Going forward there is amazing potential and plans in the development process as well. Developers are constantly working on improving and adding new features to this sandbox game. A premade and a random procedurally generated map are the current options for the game world. Haven't played on the premade ""Navezgane"" map very much but random generated world is fantastic and so much fun, be it single player mode or multiplayer. There are public servers to play on as well. One very noteworthy experience I would like to share is playing on a public PvP server. There are a handful of properly managed servers out there, but when done right with active admins etc., the PvP server experience is comparible to Rust itself and the game struck me as a super detailed (in terms of base building and crafting) and a more relaxed, less hostile PvP version of Rust. It is still kill on sight, but bases are much more safe and durable, which is configurable. As a player who is frustrated with the PvP experience in Rust, this was the perfect alternative for me, couldn't have asked for a better improvement over Rust! Cities and towns to loot, spawn containers to control, air drops and hidden treasures to snatch, base(s) to defend both vs. players and zombie hordes, hunt the wildlife for food, character progression, design a base for security AND aesthetics using many different types of building materials, taking into account gravity and block pyhsics in this voxel based world. Dig an underground bunker, build a tower to the skies, whatever you want!An amazing zombie survival voxel based sandbox game. Much recommendo.			"

								This is one of my favorite games ever. Even although it is still in EA, it is already more complete (and more fun) than many ""complete"" games, providing infinite replay value. Deep and complex crafting system, tense night system (tension builds up as night time approaches every day, because it gets very dark and zombies run like hell at night – until you get a proper light source, it is better to stay quiet somewhere until day light again) and an insane adaptive zombie horde every 7 days (i.e. 7 Days to Die). Also LOOT, lots of LOOTING!I own it since 2014 and it evolved absurdly since then. Actually they release a new big milestone every 2 months or so. And even if the game never leaves EA, it will still be huge. Just check the thousands of series in YouTube. I recommend specially the series from the channel Games4Kickz (with ""z"").Regarding modding, you can find mods in the official forums. Check specially the Valmond and the Starving Mod. They change the game completely, but I recommend trying them out only after you get experienced with the base game.PS: As of today, in the upcoming Alpha 16, electricity, turrets, painting and a behemoth type zombie are going to be added. A16 will probably be the most game changing update so far.			"

								There are a lot of games i regret buying in early access on steam, games that are so rough that they are unplayable, games that promise so much and just cannot deliver, developers who have abandoned their games completely after just a few months or developers who do not communicate with their community and put out very minimal updates several months apart, Lucky for us! This is not one of those games and these aren't those types of developers, Phew..     7 Days To Die is an amazing game even at such an early stage. If i were to compare 7 Days To Die with a few other games so you had a better understanding on what you were in for i would say 7 Days To Die takes all the best parts of DayZ, Minecraft and Project Zomboid and jam it into this early access in the best way possible.     With the constant updates that are nothing to scoff at and check ins with the community to let us know what's going on and what to expect in the future; 7 Days To Die is sure to a game that you would be proud to add to your collection.     keep up the outstanding work Fun Pimps, we really do appreciate you holding early access games to a higher standard.

								This is my first ever Steam review (I THINK). When I played this game a while back I just didn't get it. I died. I died a LOT. I don't even think I made it to the first 7th day. I came back recently and I can't stop playing it. There's something exciting about getting ready for the onslaught, planning out escape routes, coming up with defenses. If you like base building, crafting, exploring and running for your life, this could be the game for you.			"

Early Access Review
In Brief7 Days to Die is Day Z-style zombie survival strongest in collaborative play.Most valuable resource: Moments of genuine fear for your life.Of interest to: people who want their zombie apocalypse to be gritty rather than comic-book, or who want to work with their friends to survive.I wrote a review for this game way back when I got it, when I had six hours in it, back in Alpha 5.  Now in Alpha 9 the game has developed and improved so much that I routinely point at it whenever people lambast Early Access as a concept.  7 Days is the very best example I know of an Early Access game on steam that was already a good, playable experience and which has, with community involvement, only become better with each update.I don't want to start listing off features as the game is adding new and improving existing features all the time - just like zombies, I want this review to remain timeless.  What I will say is that since the inclusion of infinite randomly-generated maps, the game has really opened up.  My friend an I originally holed up in the city at which we spawned, hiding on the top floor of an apartment building, scavenging food from the fridges and cupboards of the departed, eking out a meagre existence, until finally, terrorised too many times by acid-vomiting cops, ferocious dogs and the patient stalking of giant wasps, we just picked a direction and walked out into the wilderness.  We walked for hours, raiding every house we passed, watching our food and water supplies slowly diminishing, until finally, out of food, miles from our city base, in a great canyon in an open plain, we made crossbows and started hunting deer.  It took time, and we developed skills needed to take down the beasts.  We fought off zombies attracted by the smell of fresh meat, tracked down every air drop, came up with a plan to gather essential resources and cook food on the go, and then, after days of playing the game together, we felt like we had a handle on things.  With new armour, improved combat skills and a sense of confidence we returned to the city ... and spent a solid hour screaming other over vent as we struggled to survive.Zombie survival is a flooded genre.  What makes this game stand out are that the developers are constantly balancing those elements that focus on survival.  Food drops with just slightly less than the frequency you need it to, but the fullness of your belly is linked to your stamina and health.  Your health regens, but slowly, making you run away from fights that go south and cower for in-game hours waiting until you have recovered.  The crossbow is an exceptional weapon, but requires you to constantly gather feathers for bolts, compelling you to scavenge and keep moving to keep your ammunition count up.  Killing every zombie you see uses time, weapon durability and ammunition, and risks injury, but it also reduces the zombie spawn rate in an area, forcing to decide whether to kill or to avoid.  Zombies will always attack your base, so you make it strong enough to survive the night and then spend the morning repairing the damage.  Guns are powerful weapons, but also make noise, attracting other zombies.  Like no other zombie survival game 7 Days actually feels like survival.Special reference needs to be made to the variety of zombies.  Each looks, moves, sounds and fights a little differently, but the design is perfectly cohesive.  You don't feel you are fighting a cavalcade of comic book nasties; there is a consistency to the way the different zombies operate.  Terrain makes crawlers hard to shoot, but they can injure your legs, making it harder to run away, so you don't want to close with them.  Bloated corpses are really tough to take down, but go down quickly to a head shot, compelling you to stop and aim mid-fight to remove them before they reach you.  Burned corpses have a weird shambling gait that means their head is constantly ducking and bobbing, messing up your shots at range.  The charge of a dog is terrifying, but if you can hold your cool a clean head shot will end them before they reach you.  Wasps - and this is really clever - you can hear coming, their buzzing taunting you, but they don't attack immediately, and in fact targetting them with a weapon causes them to back off, making fighting them - especially when there are other targets to focus on - a real game of stoplight.  Nurses are always worth killing as they sometimes carry essential medications.  Big men may drop sham sandwiches which might keep you fed if you are starving but at the risk of reducing your stamina, preventing you from running from enemies.There are still some balance issues with the game - weapon damage is not in line with materials cost to make them, certain very cheap building materials have very high damage resistance, hordes on the new infinite map are far too scarce.  There are some bugs and some missing features - most notably for me the server time advances when you are not playing, meaning hard work and progress and using up resources from one session don't carry through to the next.  But these are all being tweaked as the game develops, and they are minor things.  If they change nothing else about this game it is already well worth the price, and is a complete experience.As one final word I encourage you to play this game with friends.  Get a private server, set up a skype call, and work together.  It only enhances the survival apocalypse feel of the game.			"

Early Access Review
Fans of Telltale's The Walking Dead series will be excited to learn that pre-ordering7 Days to Die will give them exclusive access to 5 character skins from Telltale's hit series, including Michonne and Lee Everett. The console version of 7 Days to Die adds a new multiplayer mode supporting local split-screen for couch play, additional online multiplayer modes and features will be revealed in the coming weeks. 7 Days to Die will be supported by exciting DLC content, with details to be revealed in the near future.Turns out 7 Days to Die is now going to consoles! Good thing the game isn't finished yet. There's also new talk about DLC! Not just any DLC, though, there's also Preorder exclusive DLC,with possible console exclusive splitscreen and multiplayer modes. All with the announcement of a new publisher, Telltale Games. This game is still very broken, full of game breaking bugs, multiplayer dsync, unbalance, crashes, and lack of content and optimization, yet here we are talking about (preorder exclusive) dlc plans, and console ports. The Fun Pimps have lost most of the remaining respect I have. Finish the game before all this new publisher game ruining bull♥♥♥♥♥♥ Pimps. The game isn't even close to being done. Why on Earth would you think this is a good idea? Is this really how you want your game and (its) reputation to die?---------------------------------------------------- Alpha 13 Review7 Days to Die started off pretty good. It seemed really promising and update after update it continued to improve. Now, before I get into the review, I want to say used to love this game. It was my favorite game that I would defend to my grave and have spent nearly 300 hours enjoying. However, after awhile bugs started appearing, and updates kept coming, but they never got rid of the bugs. Not only did the amount of bugs rise, so did the small design flaws and simple mistakes that they can't seem to get around to fixing. In the games current state, it's hardly playable. I find myself either just quitting or resorting to using console commands to cope with the sheer amount of bull♥♥♥♥♥♥that has been taking over this game. Things like weapons iron sites or aim being slightly off, leaving you to use trial and error for awhile until you learn which weapon aims where. The first person animations also leave your weapon stuck in the middle of the screen blocking your aim entirely and preventing you from firing accurately. In addition to FP animations, almost all the animations in the game look really laggy. I assume somehow they all render at 30fps? but it really breaks the look of the game when half of everything plays at half the FPS you do. Console errors are also rampant, removing your mouse cursor, preventing you from searching objects (even your own storage chests which means loss of items), or spamming so many errors you can't play the game anymore becuase the console won't close.If you think that sounds bad, you haven't seen the multiplayer. The netcode is horrible. Zombies snipe you with undodgable lunge attacks, players float all over the place with broken animations, all movements take almost a full second to register with others. It's not too bad if you play PvE, but PvP is out of the question. If you try and host your own private game, have fun only playing with 1-2 other people without the game not working. I have a 6/12 core i7 with a GTX 770 and decent internet. If more than one other person is in my game, the game no longer works for them because they can't open/interact with anything or die from invisible zombies. In addition to that, every player who joins takes off ~20 FPS from my game, taking me from 80 fps down to 30 with a couple of people. The framerate also isn't stable to begin with have constant FPS drops and stuttering.The terrain is a huge pain to work with. Placing blocks/items if there is grass is one of the most infuriating things ever, so you have to punch every individual piece of grass if you want to build there but don't want to struggle. If you're like me and want your bases to look nice and neat, you have to take wood frames and place them on every block in order to level it out. This one is kind of hard to explain unless you've experienced it, but the ground is very uneven and can't be fixed without placing blocks on it to level it out.There's also the wellness system, which remains very unbalanced. It takes a couple of hours of eating healthy to gain 10 wellness, and just one death to remove the hours you just spent raising it. This is very significant because wellness governs your max health and stamina. The lowest wellness you can get is 60, and the highest is 200. The highest I've ever gotten is about 92 (from 60) and that didn't last. I think the system is a neat idea, it's just near impossible to maintain unless you're a god at this game. The bugs aren't the only thing that ruin this game. The developers are doing it almost just as well. Recently with alpha 13, the game took a huge nose dive. There are some good things about it, I like the skill tree, I like how the new forge system works, and I like some aspects of the new UI. Along with alpha 13, though, a ton more bugs were introduced. They also tried to simplify the game, by removing a lot of what made their crafting system unique and enjoyable. They removed the grid which was very useful for crafting quick easy items (now you have to search through multiple menues for the same thing). The menues are now really unintuitive and frustrating to use. You can only set a small amount of waypoints, you can't craft amounts of items higher than 3 didgets, actions require excessive amounts of clicks, and is all around irritating to use. They got rid of the very handy right click menu and have told us they have no plan to return it, as well. The HUD that shows your health, toolbar, etc, was also downgraded. They removed important information like hunger and thirst with no option to put it back, exp counter, and you now have to check your character menu every time to see whether or not you're about to starve. They also for some reason limited the toolbar to only 8 items, instead of 9. The developers also tend to ignore a lot of community feedback and have been known to be hostile to community critics by cussing them out on the forums. Unfortunately, they have a small army of hardcore fanboys that will deny/dismiss/justify all of the negatives. They don't seem like bad guys, though. They work hard, push frequent updates with a good amount of content, and are rightfully proud of their success. It just feels like they've lost track of their original idea and are trying to make the game appeal to a larger audience, and focus on the future rather than the present (more updates/content but lack of fixes for current/past issues).Tl;Dr/ConclusionI know this game is in alpha, and a lot of these may very likely be fixed in the future. In it's current state, though, I cannot recommend it. I try again and again to play this with friends and enjoy the game, but the copious amount of bugs and horrible design decisions and flaws that never get fixed prevent us from enjoying the game. I really wish I wasn't writing this review as I've had so much fun with the game but I can only handle so much. I hope the game will improve with future updates but at the rate that it's been going I don't expect it anytime soon.			"

								255 hours and counting, why?7DTD starts to mature like an old Zonbies pair or rotten socks. At first this title can have and will have you up against the ropes. My suggestion is you crank the difficulties up to the max, why? Because for me this is where the game plays best and makes you change your play style when your life is really on the line. You will change your whole outlook on how to survive and how far you venture each time from your initial make shift bases.....hordes, well thats an entirely new write up.7DTD has a great MODDING community however vannilla is just fine as  a start point. Multiplayer you will find very entertaining and will keep you  busy and entertained as you decide whos going to fill the water bottles!! maybe an archery competition like we do :) solves a many disbutes.Lots of serversLots of great peopleLots of fun (or is it fear?)Enjoy!!

								A bit like Minecraft but with a bit of a challenge. Fun and exciting, I've put in many hours of this game and plan to invest many more. Starting out, with not so much as a pair of pants to protect you from the elements, and a small dinky hole in the ground you managed to carve out for shelter. There is nothing quite like that feeling of working your way up from that hole in the ground to building a huge fortress and defending it to your last bit of ammo against the zombie horde.It is a game that is enjoyable whether you're playing in single player by yourself, or multiplayer with your friends. Its safe for me to say, this game that isn't even out of Alpha yet, and it has me absolutely hooked.The only two things I will say that this game needs is more support for larger multiplayer play, and perhaps Steam Workshop, as the game's possibilities would be nearly endless with that kind of support.Looking forward to seeing where this game goes in the future!

Early Access Review
								TLDR: 7d2d is, thankfully, one of those early access games that, while somewhat buggy, is extremely playable. This is the game I always wanted Minecraft to be, and is the best of the zombie survival games to date. For why I feel this way, continue reading ;)This is how I see the game _Right Now_. I am not taking into account what the devs are planning to do, the game's potential, or any other such garbage. This is what you can expect right when you download the game, today.I almost passed on this game. I'm burnt out on minecraft, early access games, and unfinished poorly excecuted zombie apocalypse survival games in general. Thankfully, I didn't pass on it, and picked up the 2 pack to play with my wife. 7d2d has given us a lot of fun, and has overall been a pleasant experience. While occasional bugs and unexplained deaths did occur, they were never so frequent as to interfere with our ability to enjoy the game. Usually, when my wife and I play a game like this, we end up getting to a point where the pve is no longer a threat, so we turn to building bigger and better things. With this game, however, there's so many options for customizing the gameplay, that once it's no longer a threat on default settings, we can crank the difficulty way, way up, and extract more fun from the game that way, instead of building giant houses and stuff until I discover how effective pipe bombs are at making her latest monument to boredom go away. (Holy run-on Batman! Quick, get the grammar nazi reppellant!) On that note, I'll spare you from further rambling with a nice little list.The Good:-Excellent Atmosphere and tension.-Extensive Crafting.-Loads of fun with friends.-Built in challenges, without smacking you over the head and saying, ""Oh look, if you beat me instead of hiding in your little hole, I'll give you an achievement."" (The supply drop is an excellent mechanic.)-Zombies will make you afraid of the dark.-Extensive customization options. Want a hardcore mode? check. Want turbo zombies? check. Want hundreds of zombies that are as dangerous as baby seals? check. Infinite day/night? check. Pvp on/off? check. Create the experience and challenge that you want, not what they want you to have.-Managing your stamina, food, and water is critical to success, and not a tacked on checkbox for a survival game.-Looting takes time. (can be changed in the options)-Things make sense. Meaning, water needs to be boiled before used, meat cooked, wood is weaker than rock, etc.-The smell/scent system is well done, and a very enjoyable mechanic.The Bad:-Zombie Dogs.-Zombie Dogs early game, when you have no weapon.-Most of the bugs I ran into were with the dedicated server client.-Pathfinding and AI still needs work. (Allegedly this will be improved in an upcoming patch.)-Occasionally difficult to find the crafting recipe you need.-Random death for no apparent cause. This happened to me several times, and while it's entirely possible/likely that I died from something that I overlooked, if that's the case, it should be made far more apparent in the UI than it is now.-Most of the time upon killing a crawling zombie, the model will stretch/distort in a bizzarre fashion, leaving it difficult or impossible to loot.-The sound effects could be better. (I swear the sound effect the zombie dog uses when hit is the same sound a gnoll makes when getting hit in everquest.)-Dirt blocks break into octahedra (2 pyramids put together,) which just feels a little ackward, and makes it so that judging block size and distance requires practice.-You have to set all your options (graphics, sound, etc) before you join a game, as once you have, your 2 options are either ""quit"" or ""suicide.""-Zombie dogs.In conclusion, if you're on the fence about this game, or if survival games are your thing, do yourself a favor and pick this one up, it's worth it.

								A bit like Minecraft but with a bit of a challenge. Fun and exciting, I've put in many hours of this game and plan to invest many more. Starting out, with not so much as a pair of pants to protect you from the elements, and a small dinky hole in the ground you managed to carve out for shelter. There is nothing quite like that feeling of working your way up from that hole in the ground to building a huge fortress and defending it to your last bit of ammo against the zombie horde.It is a game that is enjoyable whether you're playing in single player by yourself, or multiplayer with your friends. Its safe for me to say, this game that isn't even out of Alpha yet, and it has me absolutely hooked.The only two things I will say that this game needs is more support for larger multiplayer play, and perhaps Steam Workshop, as the game's possibilities would be nearly endless with that kind of support.Looking forward to seeing where this game goes in the future!

Yes you may have to make a new world after each time it updates, but remeber its only in alpha so its just trying to get better and better with each update it has!!! Hope this game goes far!  I am and always will be a fan of 7 Days To Die!!!Edit: Nominate this game for the ""Test of time"" award :D A very good game, its more fun to be with others in a co-op game but single player is fun but not as much as co-op.  People that want this for PvP, DONT.  They are not making this in a mindset for PvP this is more of a PvE game.			"

								If Minecraft grew up, DayZ wasn't bugged, and H1Z1 worked, then they would all be called 7 Days to Die.So, what is 7 Days to Die?It is an open-world sandbox set in a post-apocalyptic environment.http://youtu.be/V5dWpZXrnwYOk, but what makes it good?1. Ingame item search engine2. Ingame crafting guide3. An exceptional building system4. Feral running zombies which are actually a threat5. PHYSICS!!!!6. PVP and PVE options7. Password protection for servers and crates8. MODS!!!!!! YEA BABY!!!! xD9. Continuous progress being made towards developing the gameOk, so what does it lack in?1. Moving vehicles (Alpha 11 update will be adding a moving vehicle into the game)2. A wider range of items, structures, and textures (can be remedied with mods)3. An end game Summary:7 Days to Die is in Alpha, so it is still very much in early development. Despite that, it is a hugely fun and addictive game which sees constant progress and updates.So, if you are in the market for DayZ, or H1Z1 then you might want to check out 7 Days to Die before throwing your money away.

Early Access Review
								A very fun open world survival game. It's clearly still in Alpha, however the game is still very playable, its definatly better than some other early access games i've paid into.When you first start the game there is a slight learning curve (using inventory/crafting/survival of the first night) and you wont really know what you should be doing. But after you make it past the first in-game day you should know whats coming the next night and know how to avoid it. The game is great fun to play by yourself, but playing with friends would really improve the experiance. When the game is finished it will be among one of the best survival games out there.I read lots of reviews before buying this game, the negative ones drone on about how unfinished the game is (its in alpha... what did you expect?). Some reviews even talk about how planned features aren't yet in the game, i guess they dont know what planned features are.Overall, a little steep in the pricing, but you pay once and get the game when its finished, including every single planned feature, more of the game is in development than is finished right now, when its finished it will be worth the price it's being sold for. To get a good feel for the game before you buy it i recommend you watch multiple videos of it to be sure you know what your buying in to. "

								I got this game for christmas... I have not played that much of it, but I can say that it is definately worth the 30 dollars... I enjoy every minute of it... I don't understand why people rate the game down so much! They knew it was an alpha game... (Don't buy this game yet if you can't deal with bugs) For an alpha, definately great... I think this game has a great future, and I want to see it develop and add more content!The chaos of building a base, and watching it be eaten by zombies, or digging a tunnel and someone leaving a hole for the zombies to get in... This game is in alpha, but it is already very satisfying to play... They are adding new features to the game, somewhat slowly... But surely.I thoroughly enjoy this game, especially playing multiplayer, which is at the minute a bit buggy... there is nothing like killing zombies with your friends, especially with such a neat game.The update I am looking forward to which will add a lot to the game in my opinion is the random terrain update. Right now, the map navezgane is very fun to play, but it isn't random when you play it... The size of the map makes up for this, but I would like some randomization (especially random caves). Overall, if you can deal with the occasional crash, and some bugginess, then you will most likely enjoy this game. I am sure the devs will optimise this game as they develop it.Hope this review is helpful!			"

								So, today I was sent a request to do a game review for a game I recently bought called 7 Days to Die. Supposedly my game reviews are famous now or something. Dunno what's up with that...Anyway, as for 7 Days to Die, I would say this game has a lot of potential. That's the thing with early access games, especially ones that are still in the Alpha stage. As it is now, the game definitely has an unfinished feel to it I think. However, with what it has now as a base, and adding on top of it the features that the game creators are planning for it? This game is really going to go far, and I can't wait to see it. That's the second reason I bought this game, the potential it has, and the potential it has is enormous.One of the coolest things about this game though is that it's the closest thing to a proper sequel to Minecraft right now. It uses the Voxel engine though so the best way I could describe it for looks would be taking Half Life 2 and making it completely destructible. Pretty amazing ne?As for the gameplay itself, that's a touch lacking, especially knowing some of the things they plan to add to the game later. Don't get me wrong, for an Alpha, it's pretty far along and pretty darn expansive, but considering the sheer amount of features they've yet to add, it's understandable why they still have the game listed as Alpha. The crafting system is really good. Some parts are a little weird, like only being able to get sticks from breaking apart bushes, rather than being able to snap off branches for sticks, and the game relies on Scrap Metal as its base staple resource for building tools, and you can only get that if you break metal things or if you scavenge for it.The game has a bigger focus on survival than Minecraft does. Zombies are currently the main enemy of the game, and they're dangerous, in that they can spawn at any time in any light source, which means even if you make it impossible for Zombies to get into your base, if you go out far enough, they will spawn in it regardless. That's one of my biggest complaints for the game currently. Minecraft did a better job by making mobs only spawn in darkness since that means there's an actual designated safe zone that you can create. In this game, currently, no where is safe, and the ambiance reflects that with some fairly creepy music and the sound of a guy whispering in a cult-ish voice that echoes on the wind(yes that's a word now). The game is also going to have a story, but it hasn't really been implemented yet. I'm guessing the whispering is going to have something to do with it, thought it's any guess what it is, since scattered news papers on the ground talk about everything from epidemics to nuclear war for the cause of this post apocalyptic world.Let's see... as for anything I don't really like about this game... I already mentioned the Zombies spawning no matter what... they can break through anything you can, but that's a deliberate game mechanic... I'm not so fond of the food/water/stamina system... I realize it's also for survival, but currently water can only be carried in jars that are consumed when you drink them, which is really really annoying. Hopefully this game will have an equipable canteen and food satchel, cause right now, water takes up half my inventory and food is difficult to come by, unless you find a corn field, but raw food like corn hardly feeds you. I don't know about you, but I'd feel pretty full after eating three corn cobs let alone 15.Oh there is one other thing I really dislike, but this is more of a glitch than anything I hope and will get fixed soon. If you ever get this game, do yourself a favor and stay away from corn fields, or at least get in and get out if you want the corn and seeds. Entities such as yourself, zombies, and animals break resource plants when they walk on them. I can't tell you how annoyed I was when the game suddenly started lagging like crazy because a bunny and a couple of stags decided to spawn in the middle of a corn field and run around AT THE SAME TIME. I think the only reason my game didn't crash is because my computer is ridiculously high end. Nevermind the fact that I had enemy spawning turned off. If zombies had been in that mess shambling everywhere and chasing the animals through the corn field, wrecking things themselves... ugh...But yeah. Other than that, this game is looking really good. I really hope they implement a way to stop zombies from spawning in certain areas soon though, cause until that happens, I don't really like playing the game with enemy spawning on, which kind of takes away from the challenge of the game itself.Huh. Just thought of something interesting. In all honestly, the best zombie survival game I've ever played is a flash game called Rebuild and Rebuild 2 (The sequel is actually better than the first. Surprising ne?) In that series, Zombies don't just spawn anywhere. They have a designated spawning zone, since some dumb cultists opened a portal to a Nether world and Zombies pour out of it. Sometimes there'd be more than one portal, and since the game setting is that of a town you have to utilize your survivors to be able to take back and defend, the town is surrounded on all sides by a forest, and there are other towns with portals open so Zombies come from those towns as well, and thus coming from the edges of the map. If they implemented THAT particular system for 7 Days to Die, that would be awesome. Like, when the world is first created, each area has a set number of Zombies, and as time goes on more come in from Death Portals as well as the borders of the map! That way instead of just survival, the game will have a somewhat clear set of objectives and goals. After all, humans as a rule don't want to just survive, we want to thrive!			"

								(edited for alpha 11) Really fun zombie survival/crafting game. Frequent updates and improvements. There are still bugs because it is in early access and constantly changing. They made multiplayer easier. You can play with friends easily without renting a server now. But you still shouldn't play with strangers (unless you want to PvP) because people will hack and level your base (even with land claim blocks set to infinite strength.)Not a fan of the new gore blocks... but I'm sure that will be adjusted eventually.

								This game is amazing! It focuses on realism in many different ways, which i find challanging and a welcome relief from today's cut and dried ""shoot and be shot"" games. You need to forage the zombie infested wilderness, be stealthy, quick and resourceful. Gathering food and water is a constant concern. The water you gather must be boiled or you will get diarrhea and suffer a slow death unless you can make yourself some herbal tea to cure yourself. Food, which can be obtained by looting houses, dead zombies, old cars and trash, can also be hunted. If you hunt and get yourself some nice fresh rabbit or boar meat, zombies can smell you for miles around. This creates an interesting challange and a necessary risk, that you need to quickly cook and contain the meat before you are set upon by zombies. Finding shelter is, in its self, an interesting challange too. Zombies can destroy walls and doors just as well as you can, so fortifying your home or making traps is recommended. Even just staying in your house, using a fireplace or smelting guns or armor can attract zombies. At night zombies run, and there are more than one type. The zombie dogs are particularly lethal. You can plant crops or minecraft it up by digging deep and finding coal and iron and potassium nitrate. With these you can make ammo and guns and armor which are a must if you plan to do more than just survive. You can choose from a premade world, or much like minecraft, a world that is generated. This game is co-op, meaning you can invite your buddies to play with you or just play solo and tough it out yourself. The game is early access, so it is being updated. Updates can be read about on their website. I reccomend this to anyone who likes killing zombies, exploration, survival and crafting.			"

Just thought of something interesting. In all honestly, the best zombie survival game I've ever played is a flash game called Rebuild and Rebuild 2 (The sequel is actually better than the first. Surprising ne?) In that series, Zombies don't just spawn anywhere. They have a designated spawning zone, since some dumb cultists opened a portal to a Nether world and Zombies pour out of it. Sometimes there'd be more than one portal, and since the game setting is that of a town you have to utilize your survivors to be able to take back and defend, the town is surrounded on all sides by a forest, and there are other towns with portals open so Zombies come from those towns as well, and thus coming from the edges of the map. If they implemented THAT particular system for 7 Days to Die, that would be awesome. Like, when the world is first created, each area has a set number of Zombies, and as time goes on more come in from Death Portals as well as the borders of the map! That way instead of just survival, the game will have a somewhat clear set of objectives and goals. After all, humans as a rule don't want to just survive, we want to thrive!			"

								(edited for alpha 11) Really fun zombie survival/crafting game. Frequent updates and improvements. There are still bugs because it is in early access and constantly changing. They made multiplayer easier. You can play with friends easily without renting a server now. But you still shouldn't play with strangers (unless you want to PvP) because people will hack and level your base (even with land claim blocks set to infinite strength.)Not a fan of the new gore blocks... but I'm sure that will be adjusted eventually.

								One of the best games I've ever played.   It might not seem like much at first but then as you uncover this gem over time you realize that there is a ton of strategy invloved as well as those oh $hit moments of rapid clicking and heart pounding fun!  Not to mention that you can easily setup the game as you want to play it.  In addition to that, the devs have set it up so that you can easily change the xml files they provided to customize it even further.  Oh, and lets not forget the large community of modders, who share ideas, files, and how to's.This game is still in Alpha, and it's already better and more feature complete than most Triple AAA backed titles out there.

There are game updates that include new features with each release and even recently an entire game engine update overhaul to improve graphics!   The devs for this game care so much that they actually listen to their community and share stuff with them all the time.  I've played so many games that are just rushed to final release just to cash-in and walk away from leaving you feel that there is something missing or unbalanced or just broken.

								I got this game just after I came out, and I have to say, as far as Alphas go, this one should win an award.  I have recommended this game to many of my gaming freinds, and they have all bought it and we play it together often through my easily configured dedicated server.There is something in here for everyone.  If you like killing zombies, mining, building, crafting, and exploring, this is definitely for you.  Nothing is more gratifying than walking up to a zombie and smashing them one in the face with your bare fist.  Or if you're in to guns, 7 days will not disappoint.  Sure, most of the weapons are generic, but whether you like donning  a pistol, or taking out a crowd of zombies with a rocket launcher, then it here.I am also fond of the forging and crafting system.  Once you learn recipes, you can strip down a weapon to its bare parts, create a mold of these parts and then manufacture all the weapons but the rocket launcher.  You can even craft your own bullets using the method described above.I love the two power tools, the chainsaw and the auger.  Not only are these great for gathering wood and stone, but they make quick work of any zombies.This game is filled with pure enjoyment, despite the occasional bug here and there.The Fun Pimps are great at what they do.  Although they have not implemented all the features detailed in the video, they have been consistant at following the road map of development.I would give this game 5 stars, and it, even in alpha I would give it a metacritic rating of 95.Bottom line:  Pure enjoyment! Worth more than just a cursory glance.			"

								This game kept me and my friend up late so up, we did buy the 2-pack together but we didn't expect to see a game that'll keep us up past 1am and the funny thing is we started before 9pm. Anyway in this current version (8.6), in my opinion the game is incredibly, although might take some time to learn the crafting recipes. Also my friend and I had taken at least 20 minutes trying to work up how to set up a private server, after all that time we gave up and we just joined a server with no-one and hoped no one will join. Anyway incredible game but has alot of bugs but is forgiven since it is still in Early Alpha. Enemy A.I. is incredibly hard during the Night. The thing i would want is an easier way to create private servers since we had trouble trying to create one but anyway other than these minors flaws and the fact that it is in early alpha, this game is amazing and addictive. Get it NOW!Final Verdict:10/10			"

								I got this game for christmas... I have not played that much of it, but I can say that it is definately worth the 30 dollars... I enjoy every minute of it... I don't understand why people rate the game down so much! They knew it was an alpha game... (Don't buy this game yet if you can't deal with bugs) For an alpha, definately great... I think this game has a great future, and I want to see it develop and add more content!The chaos of building a base, and watching it be eaten by zombies, or digging a tunnel and someone leaving a hole for the zombies to get in... This game is in alpha, but it is already very satisfying to play... They are adding new features to the game, somewhat slowly... But surely.I thoroughly enjoy this game, especially playing multiplayer, which is at the minute a bit buggy... there is nothing like killing zombies with your friends, especially with such a neat game.The update I am looking forward to which will add a lot to the game in my opinion is the random terrain update. Right now, the map navezgane is very fun to play, but it isn't random when you play it... The size of the map makes up for this, but I would like some randomization (especially random caves). Overall, if you can deal with the occasional crash, and some bugginess, then you will most likely enjoy this game. I am sure the devs will optimise this game as they develop it.Hope this review is helpful!			"

Early Access Review
								So, today I was sent a request to do a game review for a game I recently bought called 7 Days to Die. Supposedly my game reviews are famous now or something. Dunno what's up with that...Anyway, as for 7 Days to Die, I would say this game has a lot of potential. That's the thing with early access games, especially ones that are still in the Alpha stage. As it is now, the game definitely has an unfinished feel to it I think. However, with what it has now as a base, and adding on top of it the features that the game creators are planning for it? This game is really going to go far, and I can't wait to see it. That's the second reason I bought this game, the potential it has, and the potential it has is enormous.One of the coolest things about this game though is that it's the closest thing to a proper sequel to Minecraft right now. It uses the Voxel engine though so the best way I could describe it for looks would be taking Half Life 2 and making it completely destructible. Pretty amazing ne?As for the gameplay itself, that's a touch lacking, especially knowing some of the things they plan to add to the game later. Don't get me wrong, for an Alpha, it's pretty far along and pretty darn expansive, but considering the sheer amount of features they've yet to add, it's understandable why they still have the game listed as Alpha. The crafting system is really good. Some parts are a little weird, like only being able to get sticks from breaking apart bushes, rather than being able to snap off branches for sticks, and the game relies on Scrap Metal as its base staple resource for building tools, and you can only get that if you break metal things or if you scavenge for it.The game has a bigger focus on survival than Minecraft does. Zombies are currently the main enemy of the game, and they're dangerous, in that they can spawn at any time in any light source, which means even if you make it impossible for Zombies to get into your base, if you go out far enough, they will spawn in it regardless. That's one of my biggest complaints for the game currently. Minecraft did a better job by making mobs only spawn in darkness since that means there's an actual designated safe zone that you can create. In this game, currently, no where is safe, and the ambiance reflects that with some fairly creepy music and the sound of a guy whispering in a cult-ish voice that echoes on the wind(yes that's a word now). The game is also going to have a story, but it hasn't really been implemented yet. I'm guessing the whispering is going to have something to do with it, thought it's any guess what it is, since scattered news papers on the ground talk about everything from epidemics to nuclear war for the cause of this post apocalyptic world.Let's see... as for anything I don't really like about this game... I already mentioned the Zombies spawning no matter what... they can break through anything you can, but that's a deliberate game mechanic... I'm not so fond of the food/water/stamina system... I realize it's also for survival, but currently water can only be carried in jars that are consumed when you drink them, which is really really annoying. Hopefully this game will have an equipable canteen and food satchel, cause right now, water takes up half my inventory and food is difficult to come by, unless you find a corn field, but raw food like corn hardly feeds you. I don't know about you, but I'd feel pretty full after eating three corn cobs let alone 15.Oh there is one other thing I really dislike, but this is more of a glitch than anything I hope and will get fixed soon. If you ever get this game, do yourself a favor and stay away from corn fields, or at least get in and get out if you want the corn and seeds. Entities such as yourself, zombies, and animals break resource plants when they walk on them. I can't tell you how annoyed I was when the game suddenly started lagging like crazy because a bunny and a couple of stags decided to spawn in the middle of a corn field and run around AT THE SAME TIME. I think the only reason my game didn't crash is because my computer is ridiculously high end. Nevermind the fact that I had enemy spawning turned off. If zombies had been in that mess shambling everywhere and chasing the animals through the corn field, wrecking things themselves... ugh...But yeah. Other than that, this game is looking really good. I really hope they implement a way to stop zombies from spawning in certain areas soon though, cause until that happens, I don't really like playing the game with enemy spawning on, which kind of takes away from the challenge of the game itself.Huh. Just thought of something interesting. In all honestly, the best zombie survival game I've ever played is a flash game called Rebuild and Rebuild 2 (The sequel is actually better than the first.

If they implemented THAT particular system for 7 Days to Die, that would be awesome. Like, when the world is first created, each area has a set number of Zombies, and as time goes on more come in from Death Portals as well as the borders of the map! That way instead of just survival, the game will have a somewhat clear set of objectives and goals. After all, humans as a rule don't want to just survive, we want to thrive!			"

								7 Days to die is a post-apocalyptic zombie survial game with a built in crafting system, The game is designed so that you are put into an environment to survive with the resources around you, A bit of polish can be put in a few areas such as graphics and animation, But the gameplay is absolutely phenominal, Well thought out areas, A huge map to explore, Endless hordes of zombies, and a slight feeling of desperation and fear. Everything seems perfectly balanced within the game.Not to mention the frequent updates from this game are very uplifting. I definately Give it my reccomendation These guys know what they're doing and the price is well worth it!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is amazing! It focuses on realism in many different ways, which i find challanging and a welcome relief from today's cut and dried ""shoot and be shot"" games. You need to forage the zombie infested wilderness, be stealthy, quick and resourceful. Gathering food and water is a constant concern. The water you gather must be boiled or you will get diarrhea and suffer a slow death unless you can make yourself some herbal tea to cure yourself. Food, which can be obtained by looting houses, dead zombies, old cars and trash, can also be hunted. If you hunt and get yourself some nice fresh rabbit or boar meat, zombies can smell you for miles around. This creates an interesting challange and a necessary risk, that you need to quickly cook and contain the meat before you are set upon by zombies. Finding shelter is, in its self, an interesting challange too. Zombies can destroy walls and doors just as well as you can, so fortifying your home or making traps is recommended. Even just staying in your house, using a fireplace or smelting guns or armor can attract zombies. At night zombies run, and there are more than one type. The zombie dogs are particularly lethal. You can plant crops or minecraft it up by digging deep and finding coal and iron and potassium nitrate. With these you can make ammo and guns and armor which are a must if you plan to do more than just survive. You can choose from a premade world, or much like minecraft, a world that is generated. This game is co-op, meaning you can invite your buddies to play with you or just play solo and tough it out yourself. The game is early access, so it is being updated. Updates can be read about on their website. I reccomend this to anyone who likes killing zombies, exploration, survival and crafting.			"
