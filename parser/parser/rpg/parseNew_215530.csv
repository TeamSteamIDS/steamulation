												A very atmospheric, dark-fantasy/steampunk Action-RPG.I wasn't sure about buying it, as ARPGs aren't my favourite (though i really enjoyed Diablo 2), but i didn't regret it.Actually, it's pretty well done.You play the son of the famous Van Helsing, accompanied by the ghost of Lady Katarina, which will aid you in your battle against werewolves, robots and all sorts of other monsters.The world is dark and with lots of steampunk elements in it, very detailed and atmospheric.As you progress, you also hear some nice dialogues between the two main characters, which are pretty humorous sometimes. The game is also filled with some pop-culture-references (Lord of the Rings, The Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy, as to name only 2).Though it has some minor flaws and might not be as polished as bigger productions, it's a nice and well done game, which i would recommend to anyone who likes ARPGs.

												Excellent voice acting, original atmospheric music , 15+ hour storyline and great attention to detail easily matches full price releases. Very underrated and together with path of exile the best in their genre (with PoE being the more hardcore/advanced option).The class dlc is somewhat scummy but seeing as how the base game is so cheap its pretty bearable (plus the 'new' classes are just very specialized variants on the base class but still completely new in terms of trees and skills)Minor critiques is that the gem slot system barely makes an impact but that wont ruin your enjoyment and fairly long load times on zone transitions (but barely slowdown once properly loaded)Warning: game seems to use a consistent 1,5K-2,5K ram depending on settings			"

												How to begin...The first impression of the game wasn't that great. A rather generic forest area with expectable enemies didn't get my hopes up too high, but after around an hour the game gained a lot in both presentation and interesting content. For around 7-8 hours afterwards you are in for a great ride with excellent graphics, music and quests. Your companion really adds to game and lifts it above most Diablo clones. Sadly at a certain point the game turns into a pure grind fest and the content runs thin, very thin. The final battle is over the top hard and while it's certainly finishable, nothing in the game prepares you for it.A lot of great ideas and lovely designed areas will keep you entertained for a few hours and if you can forgive the game a rather rushed/forced ending, I'd say it's a really good hack 'n slash RPG.Pro:- Great design- Atmospheric music- Interesting skill system- Sarcastic and entertaining companionCon:- Too short and yet it still feels lengthy in the last 1/4 of the game- Crashes occasionally			"

 “Be a hunter, they said. Kill monsters, they said! No one ever mentioned something about picking flowers!” The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing represents a solid action role-playing game, based on Bram Stoker’s legendary vampire slayer. It has a charming atmosphere in combination with an interesting storyline and lovely characters, set in a gothic–noir universe resembling the 19th century Eastern Europe, that is filled with original monsters, magic and weird technology. The protagonist and his delightful ghostly companion have a wry sense of humor and contribute to the game’s atmosphere with many snappy dialogues. Especially the details in form of allusions to certain films, comics and the original book by Bram Stoker will keep you entertained.The only shortcoming of this game is the rather stiff combat system, which would have needed more attention to establish a more fluent hack & slash feeling.

Nice but short gameVan Helsing is a typical hack'n'slay with skill tree, mana, cooldowns and so on.I took me about 18 hours to complete the game with one character (caster aka Thaumaturge), this include finishing all sidequests and expose every single area. Compared with other games like torchlight this is a bit short.One variety was a tower defence part and the possibility to power up the generator for the traps. Unfortunately there were only 2 events were you have to defeat the secret lab. After I finished the game I also tried the Scneario mode which contain higher difficulties starting from 31 (current cap level for the player is 30). In this mode you could gain glory points instead of xp. Normally you should find better items on this single map scenarios but compared with the items I already had the weren't better. But this depends on kind of luck you have (like in other games).So I created new characters to test the other classes, but after a short time it doesn't makes fun playing the same story again.At last I tried the ""Neverending Story"" mode which was described as ""The monster will keep getting stronger while your only way to improve is to play even better. See how far you can get!"".Well it was really hard and the main thing I did was casting my spells and run away till all was dead. For stronger monsters that means run in a circle arround them casting again and again and don't stop to drink healt potions. And the bad thing was, this tooks a lot of time and after a while it gets boring. Short game summary- Level cap: 30- Skill and ability  points could be assigned- Skill and ability points could be assigned to your aide (Lady Katarina)- Perks: by finishing quest and killing enemies you gain reputation. There are 10 levels of reputation and on each of them you could choose one perk to activate e.g Unstoppable (Immunity to all movement impedding effects)   - Glory: after reching max level you could gain glory points in scenario mode. And with these points you could increase stats like attack rate, fire damage or cooldown reduction- game modes:-- Story-- Scenario-- Neverending Story- classes:-- Hunter (blades, firearms) -- Thaumaturge (caster)-- Arcane Mechanic (expulsion cannon)- difficulties:-- casual-- normal-- hard-- heroic-- hardcore character as special option (like in other games ""death is final"") - multiplayer modePositive:- good hack'n'slay: I played it through in 18 hours on two days caused of pickup loot and leveling up - chest were you could share items with other characters- single skills from the skill tree of player and aide could be removed by paying gold (same for abilities)- multiplayerNegative:- too short- difficulty could only be choosen on character creation time and not be changed after that - difficulty varies to much: normal game could be played through no problem but the ""Neverending Story"" mode was too hard.Conclusion:It's a nice game which facinates me from the beginning till the end. Even if it's a short game I would definitely suggest this game.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a third person hack and slash game very similar to the Diablo / Torchlight series. If you’ve played any of those, you should be able to drop right into Van Helsing with a good idea of how to play. The game seems pretty demanding hardware wise, and it heats up my computer, which is unusual for a top down isometric game.You play the title character Van Helsing, a monster hunter on a mission to the country of Borgovia to answer a distress letter. It seems some unspecified evil is causing trouble for the people there. In the game’s world, monsters seem pretty commonplace, and you are actually accompanied on your quest by a snarky ghost named Lady Katarina. Gameplay-wise Lady Katarina is the equivalent of the “pet” in Torchlight, or a “merc” in Diablo 2, except that she talks to you all the time as part of the story. She has her own gear/stats/skills and can go back to town to sell loot for you, just like the pet in Torchlight. In combat she can hold her own for a while, but dies pretty quickly later on in the game.The game is broken up into 2 city hubs like Diablo 2 Acts, each with its own main town, NPC shops, and quests. The game is filled with little hidden quests that you may not find in 1 playthrough, even though the maps are not randomly generated.  I’ve finished 2 characters and the maps were exactly the same both times. There is an option in the main menu to have enemies respawn each time you leave and re-enter a game (like Diablo 2), and you can turn this on or off whenever you want. Like Diablo 2, you can’t see what level the enemies are, but if you’re having a hard time, you should probably go back and level up a little more.  This isn’t possible if the enemies don’t respawn. In my experience if you don’t grind at least a few levels, you’ll end the game around level 27 (max level is 30).The game has an extensive loot system similar to Diablo/Torchlight with normal/rare/set/epic item types as well as “+magic find%” attributes that can be found on gear to boost your chances of getting rarer items. There is also a way to upgrade particular items with “essence” which is kind of like gems in Diablo, or ember in Torchlight. I haven’t used the system much since every time I find a better weapon I just sell the old one, and don’t bother breaking it down for all the essences that I’ve put into it. The game’s stat system should be familiar to people who play dungeon crawler games. Body (hp / melee damage), Dexterity (dodge chance / range damage), Willpower (magic damage/ mana), and Luck (critical damage / magic find) are your four stats and you get 5 per level up to distribute as you please.  The skill system is more complicated because you don’t just choose skills (which can cost more than 1 skill point), you can also choose the “power ups” that can be used with the skills. These power ups are activated before you cast the skill, and use a “rage” meter which is separate from your mana bar.  You build rage by killing monsters while mana just regenerates by itself. So an example would be activating a damage boost power up right before casting a lightning bolt spell. The power up drains some of your rage bar and the spell drains some of your mana bar with the result being a lightning bolt with increased damage.  You can toggle an auto-activate to your power ups if you don’t want to deal with pressing the button every time.  You’ll probably run out of rage really quickly though.Another thing to note about the skill system is that your skills are broken up into several categories, though they all take skill points to level up. There are your main Skills, Auras, and Tricks. Auras are passive boosts that you have on permanently, though you can only have 2 auras active at any time. An example would be the Rampage aura which boosts your critical hit damage. Tricks are just another set of skills and personally I don’t see why they were separated from the other skills, except that they don’t use mana. An example would be Arcane Healing, which is an area affecting heal spell. Tricks have a cool down to prevent you from constantly spamming them. Pros:+Decent story set in a medieval fantasy world.+Gameplay is mostly intuitive though some things really could benefit from further explanation. For example there is no explanation of the skill system. I went about 5 – 6 levels before I put points into any skills because I was afraid I might be wasting points on weak skills. Turns out you can re-spec them later, so go wild.+Pretty simple multi player co-op system. I’m able to join my brother’s game pretty quickly and easily with an average ping of 80 ms. One thing I noticed is that the game’s multiplayer server browser doesn’t tell you if a person’s game has a password until you’ve tried connecting to it. That’s kind of dumb. A bunch of people constantly try connecting to my brother and my games and disconnecting because they don’t know the password.Cons:-There is very little information online for beginners. In most games of this type, you can find a wiki or strategy website where people share their character builds. I found one site like this, but a lot of the info is outdated. In RPG games I hate feeling like I missed out on something cool.If you got this game from the Humble Jumbo 2 bundle, you should have the “Complete Pack” which includes the Thaumaturge and Arcane Mechanic DLCs. These DLCs are 2 new character classes along with a few class specific quests. That means you can see a few areas in the game that you can’t get into unless you’re one of these 2 new classes. The Thaumaturge is a pure spell caster and is probably the most enjoyable class, but easily killed. The Arcane Mechanic is a ranged attacker who shoots slow moving grenades and can summon support units. The base class Hunter is a little bit of everything, but really best as a melee tank with some back up spells.I’ve heard people say that the game is pretty short, but personally I’m happy with a 12 hour game, especially one in the $1 tier of a humble bundle.  I'm actually glad it doesn't have an end game grind like Diablo, where you just play over and over looking for better gear after you've finished the main storyline. Van Helsing also has a hardcore mode for people who want that extra element of risk (death is permanent). I never have and probably never will create a hardcore character since I die all the time in games like this. Overall I give the game a thumbs up if you enjoy hack and slash dungeon crawlers. You’ll find the graphics comparable with Path of Exile, and the loot finding should keep you occupied for a while. "

												Beside the Torchlight franchise, Titan Quest and the free Path of Exile NeocoreGames' Van Helsing represents another alternative for those finding the latest Diablo entry a bit too casual. What's more is that while Van Helsing is shorter than aforementioned hack 'n' slash games it still offers a decent story and a lot of content. Due to the additional game modes (scenario and neverending story) it has a high replayability value, as well.The game follows a quest of Van Helsing and his companion, the ghost Katharina, who try to get to Borgovia to stop a mad scientist. Along the way you encounter dozens of different enemies throughout numerous different environments. Some of these locales look stunningly beautiful: you traverse through a muddy forest fighting hideous monsters and evil spirits and also join the resistance in a town to fight the soldier-machines. These machines add the steampunk part of the game - with all the traps and contraptions you find they make the game even more diverse.One of the things I liked about Van Helsing was its atmosphere. Sound effects and the score are excellent and I liked the sarcastic conversations between Helsing and Katharina. One-liners are common from them as well as from enemies and there are numerous references to other video games and films throughout the game. In order to find all of them it's worth hovering the cursor over all objects in every environment - Van Helsing might collect a quest item or just make a funny comment.There are many sidemissions, of course, as it is common in this genre and there's even one that takes you throughout the game. You just need to carefully look everywhere and open all chests, containers, destroy all barrels and boxes as you might find the next piece of the puzzle. It's worth mentioning, though, that not all items are related to a quest, still, they will be part of the corresponding tab in your inventory.Normally, Van Helsing wields two swords and two pistols. You can decide which way to go from there in terms of customisation. Beside these two tabs there is also one called Tricks (active spells) and Auras (passive skills). Every level-up grants you ability points (the good-old attributes we are talking about here), skill points and occasionally reputation points, but the latter is not related to quest but more to the annihilation of strong beasts. Your reputation can then yields you perks - the list is gradually increasing and you can pick more and more of them along the way.Katharina, the ghost companion is a bit similar to the pet we have in Torchlight. She can do the shopping on behalf of us and can also pick up loot by category. Her behaviour is completely modifiable. Of course, she has many skills and also attributes - her skills either make her stronger or support Van Helsing in combat. While there are no other companions in the game the abovementioned customisation I described for Van Helsing is the Hunter class only. With the added DLCs you can play as a Thaumaturge or Arcane Mechanic. I hear they are pretty fun and diverse, too, so this is all the more in favour of the longevity of this game.Van Helsing is pretty cool game considering it is a relatively low-budget hack 'n' slash. It is filled with content and there's high replayability due to the 3 different classes, more difficulty levels, hardcore mode, online cooperative mode in the game. I look forward to playing with its sequel. In the meantime, if you are the fan of the genre Van Helsing should be in your library. Word of advice: buckle up as the game can be pretty challenging even on normal difficulty setting!			"

												If you're looking for a quick ARPG fix you can't really go wrong with The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing.  In my opinion it's a better experience in comparison to Diablo 3.  There's a fun variety of loot with some really cool unique weapons that you can find early in the game which is exciting.  There's also a endless story mode where creatures get more and more difficult at ""end game"" max level being 30.  There are also scenarios that can be played at level 30 that offer even more challenges with unique bosses and objectives.  Def a recommended game if you're into this sort of thing.			"

												Most of the negative reviews are related to multiplayer. I'm a hermit in real life and in gaming, so that didn't phase me. Without reading tutorials and by taking my time and enjoying the game on normal, I beat the game in about 15 hours. I didn't notice any glitches. With the summer sale, I went ahead and bought the DLC, so I can try the other classes next weekend. If you're buying the game, and you're buying it for the 1p experience, save a few bucks by buying the game+dlc pack.			"

												I started playing this game because I didn't really feel like playing Diablo 3, and all in all I'm pretty happy with my choice.Story:I was expecting the game to be a Diablo-clone in most ways, so having the big bad be a mad human scientist instead of a demon-monster-creature was a pretty nice surprise. Fighting robots(?) in a steampunk-ish world also felt a bit fresh compared to fighting the same old demons and mythological creatures (some of which do appear in this game as well). The basic story is of course the good old ""hack your way through a bunch of enemies to defeat the big bad trying to take over the world (or country?)"", but there's nothing wrong with that.Gameplay:If you have played Diablo or any other ARPG you will probably recognize the play style right away. You use your mouse and a couple of buttons to dash out various spells while keeping an eye on your health and mana. The addition of rage, which refills when you kill a creature and can be used to power up your spells, was a nice  touch. It gives you an extra thing to do during fights, as well as more ways to personalize your skill tree, so an extra plus there.Graphics:The graphics were fine. Not great, not bad. Some creatures looked pretty good, some looked pretty bland. The same can be said for the environment. Personally I enjoyed the city zones more than the nature zones. The (few and short) cut scenes were pretty meh, especially compared to the Diablo cut scenes, but that's acceptable.Music:While playing the game I thought that the music fit the mood pretty well, but as soon as I stopped playing I forgot the soundtrack right away.The voice acting in this game... At first I thought that the voice acting was just really, really bad, and almost lol'ed a couple of times during the first few hours of the game. But then I realized that that was what they were going for (probably?). Sort of cheesy, over-the-top voice acting, that when you get used to it fit the game really well, and was sometimes just really funny (in a good way!). Some of the comments from both Van Helsing and Lady Katarina were just hilarious, although by the end of the game Katarina was becoming quite annoying.Overall:Overall I enjoyed this game, even my second playthrough, which was a little unexpected. I don't really want to call Van Helsing a Diablo-clone, since there were a couple of things that set it apart from Diablo, so let's just call it a decent option if you like ARPGs. I recommend this game, even at full price if you don't want to wait for a sale, however I do have a couple of warnings:1. There are some bugs in the game, the most common being corpses stuck in walls or terrain that can't be looted. I also found a couple of chests that I couldn't open for whatever reason. The biggest bug I faced was a door leading to the next zone being closed, forcing me to start over with a new character. (Luckily this didn't happen with my hardcore heroic character.) There was a fix posted on the developer's forum to fix this, but that fix didn't work for me. On July 2nd 2015 they added the ""Mantis Bug Tracker"" to the game, which should help fix more bugs, but I wasn't able to test this out myself.2. If you care about achievements you can get most of the achievements by playing through the game twice. None of them are really that hard to get, as my first playthrough was on hardcore heroic difficulty (=perma-death), and I only died four times, so the game is fairly easy. However, there is one achievement that is just plain stupid. It requires you to get 500,000 kills, which is a lot, seeing as you only get about 10,000-15,000 kills per playthrough. Luckily there is a way to make Lady Katarina afk farm kills for you, which she is doing for me as I am typing this, but just be aware that there is this one really annoying achievement if you (like me) want to clear the game 100%.But all in all, a really good game.

Action RPG taken to perfectionThe first game in what would become a series a three, was released by Neocore Games in May 2013. At first sight, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing doesn't seem to offer much new or original to a well-established gaming genre: the fast-paced action rpg, played from an isometric point of view. After all, we had the Diablo and Torchlight series, which did a pretty good job at delivering extremely enjoyable games.From my first impressions with this game, it was clear that Neocore Games knows its classics: they stayed true to the core of this particular genre, which is the combination of the fast-paced hack 'n slash (or shoot 'n bewitch) gameplay with the development of your character and the endless craving for loot. After all, what's more rewarding than mowing down horde after horde of enemies, in order to find dozens of lootable items, among which there might be just that one special items? Or breaking hundreds of barrels, hoping to stumble upon a golden ring belonging to a named set?Actually, Van Helsing goes several steps further than most other action rpg when it comes to loot, objects and what you can accomplish with them. I've played through the entire game twice (first as a gun-oriented hunter, than as a melee character), and both times I found myself busy with objects for a fair amount of time. There's not only an incredible number of weapons, armour, rings, boots, gloves, hats, capes and trophees, there's also the possibility to enchant and even enhance them with small magical pieces, ""essences"". The best items come with a slot for one or more essences, and it's great fun to upgrade one's armour or items in this way. The game gives you a huge amount of customization options over your character (although you can only play as Van Helsing himself, obviously) too: upon levelling up, you can spend 5 ability points (to build your character's strenghts) and 3 skill points (spent in a very extensive skill & spell tree). Part of the immense fun this game provides, lies in building a well-balanced, skilled character that's up to the task and to the items he can wield. There are ""perks"" too, which offer a general or more specific buff and which unlock after meeting certain requirements.But Neocore Games went even one step further by introducing a companion to Van Helsing: a female ghost, who can help you defeating the enemies in several ways (melee, range or simply by enhancing your capabilities). Even better: Katharina also gains experience and can be upgraded, can learn skill and can be equipped with weapons, rings and armour. All of which can be upgraded and enchanted, of course. So if you like that sort of finetuning a character, Van Helsing offers a fantastic experience. And Katharina even helps to solve to everlasting problem of having too much loot but too little inventory space: you can send her off to town to sell some items for cash, or for potions.Compared to such an extensive character building & enhancing system, the actual gameplay is a little more bland, although it's still pretty solid and enjoyable. With the aid of good weaponry, skills, spells and aura's it is great fun to mow down entire legions of enemies, which the game keeps throwing at you. But towards the latter part of the game it becomes clear which skills are best suited to your style of playing, and the gameplay starts to show some repetition. The story itself is decent enough - nothing special, but it does the job of keeping the game going, and Katherina is a humorous sidekick in many situations. The user interfaces (and the extremely important inventory screens) are a marvel of lay-out and offer whatever you want at a mouse-click. This game offers the perfect example of how developers can make life easy and enjoyable, even in the most complex of situations.And if all of this were not enough, Van Helsing offers perfect integration with Steam through leaderboards, co-op multiplayer, and nearly one hundred achievements which offer an extra challenge and a great fun to hunt after. The three main dlc's are pretty useful too: they offer two new sets of skills & spells so that you can play either as a magic character or as an ""arcane mechanic"" (have to try that one out sometime). The third dlc offers a new set of skills for your female companion.Highly recommend, and an essential purchase for everyone who loves a good action rpg. "

												I finished my 1st playthrough of Van Helsing the other day. It was pretty good, the graphics were fine (nothing great), the story was very average (the usual save the world from the bad-guy & his minions), & the gameplay was similar to Torchlight/Diablo ARPG's.I ended up with 73/95 Achievements, & that's ok with me. To get them all you would need to do multiple playthrough's, & i wasn't impressed enough to want to replay it, maybe in another year or so.All in all, it was a good game. I used a controller, & it worked fine. If you like ARPG's, i'd say give it a try, but don't expect an involved storyline. It's more loot collecting & monster killing, so if you like that sort of game, you'll like this.Enjoy   :) "

												I'm going to be honest - I love Diablo 3.Why? Well, I loved Diablo 2...but I grew up, got as job, got responsibilities, lost all my free time and any gaming is done briefly. To put it simply - I need bang for my buck. Don't get me wrong: I'd love to be able to lose myself in Paths of Exiles skill trees, or spend ages on new builds in Torchlight but these don't matter when I have an hour to sit down and, dammit, I wanna see monsters explode and organs fly across the screen while I whirlwind across the screen.And that's why I recommend Van Helsing - it looks good, feels good, sounds good and doesn't require massive amounts of time and commitment - the skill trees are basic, items work well and you feel more or less done once you've played through once.Pick it up in a sale (I think it's worth full price), drop 20ish hours into, reminisce about how terrified you were twenty (!) years ago the first time you heard ""Ah, fresh meat!"", and appreciate the fun that is Van Helsing.

												This game is as its name implies: ""INCREDIBLE""!I have played Diablo, Diablo 2, Torchlight, Torchlight 2, and not one of them was as pure fun as this.The main characters, Van Helsing and Katharina are what makes the game great. They're incredibly funny to listen to. Great dialogue, with very nice voiceovers which seem almost impossibly good for such a small game. The references to other games, books and movies are great and fit the tone, which is always one of (mostly) lighthearted fun. The game is set in a sort of dark steampunk/clockwork setting, but it always aims to amuse and not to drag you down. It doesn't take itself too seriously and that is rare in games like this.It is a solid ARPG, and the mechanics are simple and still have depth and it's really fun and rewarding trying out different approaches. You can play your Van Helsing as a gun-toting Monsterhunter or as a sword-fighting Slayer. You can even play him as a Mage. Each class plays very different and you can also adjust your companion similarly, which is a great idea.As I said, I got more fun out of this than Torchlight 2, for example (the story here and the graphics fit my tastes better), so it is a definitve must buy for any ARPG fan, especially if it's on sale.

												Genre - Steampunk/Supernatural Action RPGI am a massive fan of the Diablo games and enjoy Path of Exile. I got this game on sale and randomly chose to give it a try. I have been through the whole game on normal using one character (I had the DLC to expand the choice). The game is enjoyable and a decent length. I spent 15 hours re-visitng some sections and fully exploring most maps. The humour is good and the dialogue with your ghostly companion keeps the story flowing. There is a hardcore mode if you are that way inclined and different difficulty settings. At a couple of points in the game it allows you to do tower defence, which can break up the game a bit. I have found out you can also take your level 30 character (max level) into the next game. So I will definately be getting that at some point.			"

												An extremely addicting and visually stunning ARPG. Solid graphics and an extremely well designed world with a steampunk-noir feel. If you're a fan of Torchlight, PoE, Diablo (especially if you were left less than satisfied with Diablo 3) then this should be right up your alley. The character development is pretty unique, in a very good way. Each skill offers various ""powerups"" which you can use during fights to better suit whatever challenge you face. This makes for a very fun combat system that I would love to see more of in the future. Besides skills, you also have the ability to use XP to purchase auras, tricks, and perks. Your companion, Katarina, has her own attributes as well as unique skills which you can select as she levels with you. This all combines to make for one of the most customizable games I've played in a while. For this quality and the playtime which it offers this game is well worth the purchase, especially if you factor in the replay value which the DLC's bring with their addictional classes. This game seems to go on sale fairly frequently, so if you can manage to catch it during one of those times you'll be getting more than your moneys worth.			"

												Gorgeous looking Hack N' Slash, (Diablo, Torchlight, Etc.), with that lovely Van Helsing vibe.  Lovely monster design, great looking levels, and an overall good atmosphere.  Character development is two fold, yourself and your companion can both be upgraded through leveling up and adding not only Ability Points for stats, but Skill points for Skills,(Spells,Attacks, Auras, Tricks, etc.), which opens up the play style for all three classes to your own interuptation quite well. Finished it in around 20hrs, with a few more discovering all the extra the game has to offer after completion, which is a scenario mode for a challenge and chance at some better drops.  Also Neverending Story, which is like a New Game+ mode, where you continue on, but this time, because you'll probably be maxed at level 30, you start to gain Glory, and each level of that, lets you further strengthen and build your character.  Overall I had a great time playing, only had a few bugs here and there, which I've read are being constantly worked on and fixed, and didn't have any trouble running the game, minus extended load times, and an occasion stutter on certain levels due to the sheer amount of plantlife and monsters I suppose. In Closing: Worth Picking up if you love Hack N' Slash.  It's not going to be a game changer, but it's a great 20 hours+ depending on your love for the game.  Which should be quite great!			"

												Played the game on hard mode.The previous reviews pretty much summarized the good sides of this game:- Well designed world.- Some really nice background music (definitely getting game OST if there is one). - Attractive graphics.- Highly customizable settings (could play this game on my laptop).- Some interesting references to pop culture (really liked Baggins dude!).- Good voice acting.- Decent storyline.But all in all I would advise you to avoid this game. Here is why:- If you do not buy DLCs then there is only one character class you can 'choose' from. The character can do both melee and range attacks, however, due to horrible difficulty balance I had to specialize only on one attack type. The result is there is not a lot of variation in the action. - Except very rare short conversations, the sidekick ghost lady is useless. She dies really fast and eats up all the health potions. I have ended up keeping her in a ghost form all the time. The result is the game would not change much if she was removed completely.- The game gives you impression of customization, but it actuallly punishes you for doint it. After mid point of the game, customization becomes really expensive and you can end up spending all the gold and still not getting what you want.- The essense system (aka gems and gem slots) is useless. Items where you can put gems are rare. If one is found then usually it does not have enough essense capacity to put useful essense. You can use an essense to increase the capacity but during my 27 hours of gameplay I had collected only 3 capacity increasing essense. Finally, there is not a lot of variation in essense types. I had collected only 20 or so different essense types during the entire game!- The fighting becomes really repetitive quite fast. There are many enemies that look different, but really just a skin deep difference. All off them can be categorized into melee enemies that charge in mass, melee enemies with hooks and ranged enemies. There is no interesting behavior from AI. More challenging enemies have simply 1) more HP and higher defense points, 2) just attack in bigger numbers, or 3) have more HP and defense and attack in higher numbers. It is not possible to use interesting tactics. Most of my gameplay consisted of repeating two things: have a short skirmish and then running away to use potion before having another short skirmish. Bullet spongy enemies just killed all the fun for me in this game. Most annoying are the enemies with hooks. It is not possible to predict or avoid hooks using your skills. The hook animation is instantaneous. The problem is, at least on higher difficulty, if you get hooked then you are basically dead.- Horrible camera angles. It is not possible to control the camera. Did I tell you about enemies with hooks? Well many times I was hooked by enemies I could not even see. I am not even talking about number of times I was shot at by enemies outside of the screen.- Bad character controls. There is no keyboard-based movement control. Mouse is used to click on a place where you want to move your character. Sounds good enough right? Well not. Combined with horrible camera angles and enemies swarming everywhere you will end up in many situation where you cannot find a free space to click on and move your character. I ended up more than dozen times dead because my character refused to move. The complexity of the surrounding world makes the situation even worse because it is not immediately obvious where you can and cannot click.If you are looking for a good ARPG then go for Path of Exile. PoE is superior to this game in everyway. Plus, PoE is free, and there is no DLC nonsense.			"

 The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing – REVIEW    Graphics (Environment 9/10, Models 7/10) 8/10   Animations 7/10   Sound 6/10   Music 8/10   Story 6.5/10   Gameplay 6.5/10   Inovation 7/10   TOTAL SCORE 7  GraphicsOn all max settings this game looked very nice. Environments and most models of the enemy creatures were designed pretty well, but sadly the characters of people felt 'just' boring. AnimationsThe animated events that happened while playing were nicely done, but that can't be said for animations of your character, Katarina and other enemies, which felt too repetitious, harsh and halting, that definitely spoiled the feeling of a smoother and more efficient gameplay. Sound & MusicThe voice acting and other sounds in this game were mostly bad and disappointing, but the soundtrack was good and enjoyable. StoryEven the Blizzard's Diablo, with its all magnificence in every aspect, sometimes fell short in the story, so there's not much to say about the story of Van Helsing. I completed the first chapter which seemed really short with a main story that wasn't any special (with a few side quests). Second chapter put me in exploring of a steampunk city called Borgova, which I personally found a little better. But because of bad gameplay mechanics and other repetitive elements were 13 hours spent in the game just enough for me to get an overall impression and write a review. GameplayMany players complained about the difficulty of this game, which is really hard even on normal settings! But the problem isn't just in some ridiculously 'strong' enemies, but in the hordes that attack you all at once. That's when the game of a cat and mouse begin, which really spoils the charm of your gameplay and feels totally unbalanced.If you have ever played Dota 2 or (to be more fair and precise) Diablo III or some other quality hack'n'slash rpgs and truly experienced (mastered?) their gameplay, than you should know how far superior are their gameplay mechanics to the game like The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing. It definitely tries and has some new cards in its hands, but it doesn't come really close. ConslusionThe Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing has some new ideas and approaches in this genre and some of its parts are done pretty well, but on the other hand lacks of some vital and more polished details that would make this game a truly unique gaming experience ...Replay value: This game was built for it, but in my opinion: NO.Recommended: Yes, but ONLY ON SALE!  by Garret A.M.

												The Incredible Adventures Of Van Helsing is a decent action RPG experience. I've seen games that were a lot worse in the last couple of months. Van Helsing brings nothing new to the table but is enjoyable nevertheless. If you ever played Diablo or Torchlight, or any other aRPG, you know exactly what to expect. Lots of killing, upgrading, sidequests to complete and loot to collect. This game has tons of loot, by the way. Maybe not all useful, but enough to let you choose your own equipment, creating a character based on your preferences. Same goes for the skills and perks. Plenty of choice here.The game is pretty challenging, but it's not because of its carefully placed (groups of) enemies, but because of the fact that enemies are on every corner of the road, never alone and always in groups. It feels like the developer just spammed enemies on the map, not knowing it would result in difficulty spikes. These enemies frequently get mixed up with a bunch of elites/uniques as well, making the game even harder than it probably should be.Please note that I do like a challenge, as long as it's fair.Graphically it looks pretty and it runs reasonably well, despite its framerate issues. The voice acting is mediocre, but I guess it gets the job done. There isn't a lot of acting anyway, so it's alright.Van Helsing doesn't do anything particularly wrong except for the enemy placement, and what's there is mostly good fun so if you'd like to have a cheap but lenghty aRPG give this one a spin.[Rating: 72/100]			"

												Van Helsing is a game similar to Path of Exile&thelike in terms of how the combat plays out. Except there are a few twists that make Van Helsing worth picking up.+The story is filled with entertaining humor.+You get a game-long companion in the form of a ghost named katarina, similar to the companion in Torchlight. Every one of her lines are witty and help the humor and flavor of the game.+There is a large set of skill trees to customize your character AND katarina with. While you cannot max it out, I enjoy how it forced me to assign certain roles to myself and Katarina.+There is functioning co-op. Further being able to assign roles with friends and their katarinas really helped make the game fun. And there are plenty of modes you can play with your friends.+PLENTY OF LOOT. Which I understand is a big thing in these kinds of games.+Graphics are great! The art design really helps create an atmosphere in which you can get immersed into this game.-There's a SINGLE broken quest in this game. They are never going to fix it. It's a side quest so it's not game-breaking. But do know you will NEVER be able to finish every quest in this game.+A very innovative and interesting tower-defense 'minigame' is in this. It seems to be a bit glitchy in coop mode but it's a lot of fun and inspired the game ""Deathtrap"".Overall I really liked this game. It's nothing special though. Just another ARPG, this one making its mark with its tower defense mechanic and its witty writing. If those don't turn you on however, then it's just an average ARPG like PoE, Diablo, and Torchlight- with nothing setting it apart other than that.I give it an 8/10. Was a whole lot of fun and I do recommened picking this up. But do note my negative points, some persons I know, may find them critical.			"

												Having just finished the heroic hardcore mode, these are my thoughts of the game, spoiler free!Even though i failed a few times, i still think the game is pretty easy. My fails were mostly because i got pulled in the middle of a mob all of a sudden, and couldn't get out. Even though i had good defense, they were still too much to handle eventually. So there was bad luck, and that's why my playing hours are what they are. My game usually ended near the end, so hours clocked in when i started again.Game is fun, my only ARPG experience is D2 and Torchlight really but i liked this as well. Dialoque has it's moments that made me laugh. The world is interesting, though the ink dungeons got a bit tiring. But the some of the areas were really detailed and i was genuinely interested in exploring them.Now to the part why i think this game is easy. As i said, i finished it on the hardest difficulty, with permadeath on. There's lots of builds that are just plain OP. Those times that i was in the middle of the mobs, it took time to kill me, except once when there was 2,5 mobs on me :D Then it was over pretty quick. No game breaking bugs encountered, only some minor ones like gargoyles staying stuck high in the sky, or some enemies teleporting outside a bridge etc. This is  fun game, funny dialoque interesting and diverse world, good came to kill time for a while (again, don't look at my playing hours :D).

												Van Helsing is a game with a lot of promise: a fresh take on the action rpg dungeon crawler genre that has been rather stale in recent years.  It has some great successes, and some great failures in this goal.  After almost finishing the game, I have to say I'm not feeling as good about it as when I started.The game follows the structure you'd expect: you run around, kill monsters, do quests, get loot.  Combat is mediocre, not having much feedback and pretty poor animations and sound, though the graphical effects are nice.  The game likes to throw massive hordes of enemies at you though so that does liven things up a bit.The skill system is interesting an unique, though I don't think it's been balanced very well.  You have a set of skills in 2 trees encompassing melee, ranged, and magic attacks as well as a few passive skills.  Each skill unlocks powerup abilities when you put enough points in which you have to activate manually by consuming rage (which you gain from killing monsters.)  It's a nice system that keeps you focused on what you're doing, though I wish there was a bit more flexibility and variety in it.The quests are well done for the most part.  There are a few choices to be made, and the quests that feel rather bland your ghost companion will make snarky comments about.  I feel safe saying she's the best character in the game and she does a pretty good job livening things up.The graphics are very good, though unfortunately the loading times are very high due to this.  The engine is fairly scalable and it runs decently on older computers though not as well as I'd like.  It does its job well and is surprisingly stable considering how buggy other aspects of the game are.I've run into a lot of situations where clicking to walk up a staircase makes me run down the staircase to try to get underneath it, or trying to hit an enemy with a spell shoots it straight into the ground.  Enemy selection boxes always seem to be the wrong size, feeling extremely large when you need to move so all you can do is attack, and extremely small when you're trying to hit them so you only seem to be able to move.  I don't know why these games have so much trouble with selection boxes these days, Diablo 3 had plenty of problems with this as well.  Multiplayer has done really strange things to save games (though I believe the devs have fixed most of this,) only saving progress on the host's save and even replacing your gear with completely random items.  Somehow my character was missing an NPC in the second hub town so I didn't have a shop available for a long time due to these bugs.Now the game's greatest failing is balance.  The early game is very easy, and ramps up very suddenly later in the game.  Certain enemies do tons of damage and come in massive hordes, all but guaranteeing your death unless you play a melee tank.  In fact, melee tank seems to be the only real choice as it does the most damage as well as being the only survivable build.  What really put the nail in the coffin for me playing a magic user, however, was reaching the final boss and finding him impossible to beat.  So much for that.So while being initially excited and quite enjoying the game, after reaching the end I have to say, wait for Grim Dawn.  Maybe it can breathe life back into this genre like no other games seem to be able to.  If you can't wait, give Marvel Heroes a try.			"

												This is a hard one to judge.I purchased this on the release day with the sole purpose of playing coop with a friend, but that failed miserably as the net-code of the game was severely broken and it was unplayable @ multiplayer.So, I forgot about this game for half a year and just now realised that I've haven't played it yet, so I gave it a try.This is a classic hack-n-slash, let's break it down to points a little bit.pros:-Good setting, steampunk, mad scientists, vampires, monsters. All that good stuff.-Gameplay feels solid. UI is good, mechanics are there and do not fall apart.-Katarina =)cons:-Out of 3 classes of heroes - 2 are locked away in DLC. That's just a♥♥♥♥♥♥move really.-Simplicity of it's core. Zero build diversity, while you have to appoint attributes and skills - it's pretty much useless, you might as well had them auto-allocated. Action is not as good and diverse as in Diablo 3, systems behind the game are not as deep and complex as in Path of Exile.I will definitely finish the game, because it grabbed me in some way, but I really couldn't recommend to buy this game, as it seems like a easily skippable one.

												Generally, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing appears to me as a fun production, but a little misguided. At times it is extended like a big hack & slash in which we play for weeks or even months - but it is not. It's pleasant, climatic, well-sounding and truly impressive-looking action game, little sophisticated, but without much problem, able to keep it with you for several hours. I can't stop thinking how cool it could be if it hadn't devoted as much time and resources on masking her and dressing in robes ""game similar to Diablo"" ... which wasn't needed because its main strength lies elsewhere and it had to focus on. If instead of extensive character development, loot system and crafting they had been devoted to improving combat mechanics and creating more decent plot, Van Helsing could be a really good game. But it is not, unfortunately. I admit it with pain, because I liked it for the ambience and Katarinas jokes. It is simply bearable. However, spending 15 euros (5 while discount) on it, isn't the worst idea, especially if u are fed up with more or less infantile fantasy, which offers us ARPG games. Well, also if one would like to play in a slightly different scenery - just because the authors managed to create it gloriously.			"

This game is a real challenge if you overlook this deficiencies and try hardcore mode, there you gotta be very careful and the game starts to demand more use of your skills in strategy. 6/10			"

												6/10: Really bad execution with exploring the world of the game and controls, but a good experience once a guide is used and controls are modified.I need to be as clear as possible when I say the default settings and controls make this game a 3/10, where it's practically impossible to play on Hardcore, let alone the highest difficulty due to enemies having large hit boxes and no easy way to move without using the mouse. The arrow keys can be used, but considering the game requires the use of a mouse for targeting, as well as the number keys and QWERTY, the range of motion for play is too frantic for a realistic level of fun while playing. Immediately change the game to use WASD to move and play the game like that when fighting enemies or it'll be a hassle during tough fights.The next negative that is important to mention is the bulk of quests have no method to learn what to do, let alone not mess it up since they can't be repeated to get it done correctly. It practically requires using a guide because the game doesn't do anything useful to hint at what to do, or even warn if the quest leads to a boss fight you can't run away from.I'm still giving it a positive review because those problems can be solved outside of the game, but I will give it a massive deduction in score because of that. The voice acting and dialogue are well done, the atmosphere is something I greatly enjoy and overall, it's worth it if you pay about $5. As of right now, it's not worth $15 because the game has too many issues that should have been solved in development and are obvious how easy they are to fix once the player experiences the bad decisions.

												A memorable hack-n'-slash ARPG. The gameplay is not necessarily unique, but the game manages to stand out in its own way with its 'magic vs machine' theme. It also has quite a bit of technical flaws, but the art style and the steampunk atmosphere manages to make up for it. (I have not tried co-op mode yet, so do not expect it to be included in this review)Pros: Immersive steampunk setting and soundtrack Amazing voice acting, one of the best I've heard so far Flavorful dialogues, that does not make you want to skip them (some even have references) I personally liked the character design and personality of Katarina, your companion, as she really feels like a living (lol) partner you actually share your adventure with Character designs of the mobs/monsters are also interesting and original Tons of loot A handful of quests are fun and creative Lots of options to customize your character build, from skills, to spells, to auras and tricks, etc.Cons: Gameplay is entirely similar to that of Torchlight II and Diablo III, pretty much same formula While Katarina has an interesting character, her function has been reduced to that of Torchlight II's pet (she can go to town and buy potions/sell stuff on her inventory, etc) which seems out of character for her Too much mobs in one area with the same AI, so that they can easily crowd you ^ Because of this, combat feels too repetitive and bland at late-game Limited variation of mobs, as the same mobs appear in different areas and levels of the game I'm not sure if this was only me, but unique items in the game seemed too easy to acquire (I ended up with lots of uniques even though I never went out of my way to acquire them or whatever) Loading screens take longer as you progress further into the story. And whenever you die, you are brought back to a loading screen unless you spend gold to resurrect yourself on the spot Game also freezes for no reason in the middle of combatOverall Rating:7.5/10Edit 05/10/16: Just corrected a few in-game terms I have used "

												I wasn't expecting much from this, seeing the low metacritic (72), but it turned out to be better than its score implied, especially considering the low price point.The high points are solid ARPG gameplay, graphics, and atmosphere.The atmosphere features Eastern European (""gothic-noir"") influences not often seen in the genre (and steampunk elements very often seen in the genre lately).Mechanically, it's a mix of other recent ARPG titles - most closely resembling Torchlight (with at least one overt reference to it during the game). It also has odd Tower Defense sequences thrown in at the end (think Sanctum, but with ARPG instead of FPS mechanics).The itemization is solid, albeit relatively unimaginative. Apart from well balanced base rolls and selection of basic, magic, rare, set, and unique items, you can further enhance your gear by adding a stat (Enchant) to any item for cost, and some items can hold ""essences"" (a sort of socketing system, minus the sockets) for even more customization. There is also gambling and a limited form of crafting (item rerolls/recycling via Artifact Forge).For those of you wondering - you can respec individual skill and stat points at (relatively low) cost (or all points at once for Katarina), so there is freedom to experiment and no need to grind out multiple characters to experience the entire skill tree.Especially notable is your companion ghost, Lady Katarina, who serves as both a wose-cracking companion to make your single player adventure less lonely, and an able fighter in her own right, with her own equipment slots, inventory, skill trees, and behavior settings. She can also go shopping for you.The most disappointing aspect is the prevalence of bugs, which have been getting fixed over time, but are still apparent as of writing. This includes some game breaking bugs that make it impossible or difficult (via a workaround) to progress with the main quest.The low metacritic can largely be explained by the shortcomings of the original release, which have since been amended via updates and DLC. The updates include additional endgame content (high level ""scenarios"", Glory System (perks for completing scenarios), and a new game+ mode).DLC adds two character classes (previously there was just one, with a melee, ranged, and magic path), a passive skill tree for Katarina, and more endgame content (high level ""scenarios"", and a new game+ mode). Not having played the DLC classes yet, I can't comment on whether they are worth it. Blue Blood basically makes Katarina substantially more powerful, which is certainly eyebrow raising, but that DLC could be skipped with limited gameplay consequences.Overall, I would recommend the game as an enjoyable diversion for any fan of ARPGs, especially for anyone looking for an atmospherically unusual ARPG or fans of the source material, but keep in mind that my own experience was limited to single player.

												You liked D2:LoD? GET THIS GAME! Detailed review is below. (Sorry for English, not my native)A short ""what is it all about?"" - hack'n'slash with great and complex character development, decent number of items (magic, uniques, sets, legendaries are included), great crafting system for improving gear. Good interface and interesting monsters to slay (available in great quantities). Replayable and good for multiplayer.This is one of the best aRPG games I've ever played. And my gaming 'career' is long and glorious - started aRPG genre with original Diablo, carved my way throught D2:LoD [and kept carving it until 2012], tried my luck in Sacred series, Titan Quest and lots of other titles. Except D2:LoD, none managed to kept my attention - sure, I played them, finished them but always returned to good'ol.What I have to say it that this game for me is second to D2:LoD only - with a chances to even surpasses it, never forget that this is only one third of full game. What made me put an unfinished game over, for instance D3 or PoE? Regarding D3 - Van Helsing is what D3 should have been. Regarding PoE - it's a close match, but i prefer graphics, interface and overall feeling to a more complex and somewhat confusing skill system. Don't get me wrong, I've played fair share of both, regretting deeply what D3 could become and seeing potential in PoE.Game itself is fun to play, even repeatedly over and over. Price is fine, and you don't REALLY need paid DLCs (except 1.5EUR ""Blue Blood"") - the basic game brings more builds and customization of character than whole D3 - and I stand firmly behind this claim. Interface is excellent, any D2 veteran will find himself at home. So is the monster density and constant action (but with good measure!). Character progression is good, there is a 'respec' option (I don't like it personally, but it seems like a trend nowadays), but some choices are permanent, as it should be.Voice casting is excellent, and dialogues between main character and ghost sidekick (which can be customized almost as much as main character, making a deadly duo in fight, and source of fun inbetween - again, clever dialogues doesn't make it boring).I was with the game since release, and developer team knows what they are doing - many additions/changes were always for the better - I've returned to the game after few months hiatus and got surprised by amount of small, but important quality oflife improvements. And bug/exploit fixes. And new feeling and better endgame.Pros: - High technical quality (graphics, sound, voice-acting)- Various builds for each character- Complex companion development, something unseen in aRPG before- Intriguing (and unfinished) storyline- A unique game settings: alternate history with slavic mythology mixed with steampunk, working PERFECTLY- Storytelling is very good- Game lore is excellent, and so are little details who mean much - names of the people, equipment etc - all very atmospheric- Character progression is complex, depending on several separated systems - dwarfing D3, keeping in line with PoE (on a different level, though) and succeeding D2:LoD rapidlyCons:- Non-random maps and moster type/positions- Lack of random events and quest- Scripted story - not really a problem, but little more open game with randomization and wide range of optional quests appearing randomly - would add more replayability. There is a replayability value, don't get me wrong, but more never hurts- Bugs in multiplayer - once plagued the game, now mostly fixed - and this 'mostly' is why I mention this. Won't destroy your days of playing, but you'll maybe need to repeat quest, for instance. Big deal.Finishing thoughts:I understand that now there is a demo. At least try it. As of myself, I've bought several copies as a gifts to my friends. DLCs add multiplayer value - you can have dedicated melee/ranged/caster characters (and companions with different builds!) with regular game, and it's way better than parties in D3, but DLCs add more.If you like D2:LoD, you'll probably like Van Helsing - it is true spiritual successor of a legendary game. If you think that D3 is what aRPG should be, you probably should try anyway - just to see a different side of a coin, how modern game functions with different mechanics. It's just 17% of what you paid for D3.			"

												Rating - 84/100Recommendation - There's something for everyone. Even non-ARPG-fans.It is a travesty how far under the radar this game has flown. Even rather diehard ARPG fans have overlooked it, which is not only a sin, but should also be a crime. This game is GREAT.All the hallmarks of a modern ARPG are here: Hordes and hordes of enemies, quick level-ups, copious perks and skill points, gigantic boss monsters, and a minion you can outfit who levels up alongside you. There are 3 acts, waypoints, hidden quests, socketables, stashes, etc. Don't go thinking this game is just like every other ARPG, however. There are a number of ways Van Helsing differs from its siblings.The main surprise for me was how Lady Katarina (Van Helsing's companion) feels like a fully-fledged player character. Her skills can be absurdly powerful, and you can build her to either be completely passive and only provide boosts to Van Helsing, or as a hell-raising destruction machine (with Van Helsing providing boosts to her if wanted). She has a full set of skills, mildly-programmable AI, and nearly the same amount of equipment options as Van Helsing himself. While minions in other games really feel like nothing more than pets, Katarina felt more like a full co-op partner.Another part that surprised me was the skill system. When you level up, you earn points that you can use to unlock skills and skill upgrades. In battle, you can use your mana to unleash special attacks, and use so-called rage points (you have a rage meter that charges up as you use regular attacks) to add modifiers to your skills. For example, you can use a lightning strike that sends 3 small electric tendrils snaking out along the ground, and you can use your rage points to add additional tendrils, increase the damage, or add a stun effect. Each modifier can be stacked up to 3 times, and the effects can be devastatingly powerful. Rage charges up rather slowly, though, so it's best to save them up for any one of the brutally-difficult boss fights.Speaking of difficulty, this game skates the same tough-but-doable line that other recent ARPGs (other than Diablo 3) have. It's also worth mentioning that playing in co-op increases the difficulty drastically. I found it much easier when I played in single player, so bring a friend who knows what they're doing.Overall, I have nothing that I can complain about with this game. The graphics are great, the voice acting is well-done and often hilarious, the multiplayer is stable, the combat is visceral and entertaining, the skill system is unique and robust, the difficulty is even and fair, the story is interesting, the game length is just right, and the whole affair is filled with the mindless slaughtering of countless enemies that you've come to know and love. There are riddles, cultural references, ethereal ""rift"" sections, and even a few little tower defense distractions.If you are at all a fan of ARPGs, I honestly cannot recommend it enough. Even if you aren't a fan of the genre, this one does just enough things differently that you will likely find something to enjoy. If not, well, at least it's cheap.-DrB			"

												I heard of this game by accident and, after playing Torchlight I & II, I decided to give it a try since it seemed so dark and atmospheric.  And it seams I wasn't wrong. The first thing I noticed was that, unlike other similar games, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a game with a distinct ""personality"" (assuming this can be said about a video game). The action takes place in the dark and mysterious world of Borgovia, a world where magic and science(and of course mad scientists) can coexist. The world is beautifully designed and it seems the designers paid a lot of attention to details. The atmosphere somehow reminded me of London as imagined by Conan Doyle as well as Transylvania as portrayed by Bram Stocker in ""Dracula"". The soundtrack is great and it fits perfectly with the dark foggy streets full of strange creatures hiding in the shadows. It's really hard to tell how much it adds to the game feeling but it's obviously, once you start playing, that the game wouldn't be the same with a different soundtrack. The game features 3 classes, The Hunter, The Thaumaturge and The Arcane Mechanic, the last 2 being sold separately as 2 DLCs. Each class has a very complex skill system, with multiple skill trees as well as many abilities that can be both, passive or active. While this can be frustrating for those who don't like to replay the game, due to the fact that it's quite impossible to complete a skill tree in a single playthrough, unless you wonder around and kill monsters just for fun, this makes more sense if you plan on playing the sequel, since you can import everything and continue from where you left. The main character, Van Helsing, also has his own companion, Lady Katerina, the ghost of a noble lady. Just like Van Helsing, Lady Katarina has her own skill system with a few active and passive skills as well as different combat modes (melee, ranged). You can also set her to attack those who attack you, those you are attacking or anyone around or you can tell her to stay out of battle. She can be very useful when you're overwhelmed and she can also go grab loot for you and sell/buy items. Voice acting and dialog is great and you can actually see the chemistry between Van Helsing and Lady Katarina. The game also has a lot of pop culture references to movies/games like The Witcher and Lord Of The Rings. Unfortunately, for those who are used to games like Diablo and Torchlight, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, is a hard game and sometimes it can be very frustrating and cheap. There are moments when you will be overwhelmed by creatures 2+ levels ahead of you, in confined spaces and if their huge health given by the higher level won't be a problem for you, the huge number will eventually make it impossible for you to move so you'll just have to wait for your inevitable death and respawn. Overall, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a great game that will please many Diablo/Torchlight fans. 8.5/10			"

												In a cliched world of action RPGs involving medieval/fantasy type settings, it’s refreshing to discover Neocore’s 19th century steampunk gothic-noir type game, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing. The game’s ambience of nighttime villages and murky swamps accompanied by a greatly appropriate soundtrack will keep you playing until your index finger gets numb. Character class and selection is so varied the game will probably warrant more than a single playthrough to flesh out all of its possibilities. Upon seeing the blank skill tree when first starting out it’s almost mind blowing to wonder where you’re going to put all of the skills, perks and auras the game allows you to. It’s not quite the endless skill tree as Path of Exile, but it’s deep enough you’ll feel your character grow as you play. Enemies come in waves, overwhelmingly so. I played a range character and being able to kite the enemies helped somewhat. If you decide to play as a melee class I think you’ll have your work cut out for you. Neocore is a small publisher out of Hungary, and big publishers could take some lessons from these guys. I’ve never had the desire to play an RPG through more than once until I played this. Despite the trappings, however, all is not perfect. There was no game manual included in the download, and for the developers to instruct players to read online forums and watch online videos to learn simple instructions about the game bears little in the way of professionalism. Once I learned how “rage” (the energy required to do super attacks, acquired through killing NPCs) worked I was able to accomplish much more. Some creatures in the game had an attribute called Abomination. I never did find out exactly what that was. And the final boss fight involved a lot of lag for me. I died many times because I simply lagged out. Definitely not a deal breaker, but it made that final fight more difficult than it had any right to be. This may or may not be an issue affecting anybody else. I have a state of the art rig, and I was surprised the lag even occured.Still, I’m glad I found this game. I look forward to playing through it again, experimenting with another class. And then I’ll look forward to tackling Neocore’s sophomore effort, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II. "

												I'm a casual player. I mostly spend my time on simple games or on the ones which handle a story that I really like. The only serious, well-made RPG game I started and finished was DragonAge. And then came Van Helsing.I have never thought I would encounter a game that will mix up steampunk, monster killing and the legend on Van Helsing in such a perfect manner.The game is just amazing. I only played the hunter class, but I just can't wait to start it again as a mechanic or a thaumaturge. Well-balanced, fun to play, and Lady Katarina's character is just brilliant.It's worth every penny.			"

												This game is fine if you're a big fan of hack-and-slash action RPGs, otherwise I would not recommend it. I like the setting, and there's a lot of easter eggs in this game. But you get only one class with the game itself and 2 more as DLCs. You can differently build that single class, but there isn't much skills to chose from anyway. Surroundings are dull and gameplay quickly becomes too repetitive - just throw AoE attacks at huge and stupid crowds of enemies again and again. I haven't tried multiplayer, though - maybe that's where all the fun is hiding.			"

												☺ Everything an ARPG needs.☺ Great environments.☺ Nice soundtrack.☹ Repetitive encounters.An entertaining and enjoyable hack and slash, filled with loot, humour and atmosphere.If you're not a fan of Action Roleplaying Games, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing isn't going to be the game that changes your mind. However, if you're new to the genre or a fan of hack and slash loot fests, you're in luck! Van Helsing manages to provide an entertaining experience throughout its ten or so hour campaign (more so if you're an explorer like myself who likes to uncover all of the map).You take on the role of the famous Van Helsing (well one of them, his son to be exact) as he and his companion the ghostly Lady Katarina attempt to save the day as monsters and science collide to bring about death and destruction upon Borgovia. You empower the great monster hunter and snappy ghost with a variety of skills from melee to ranged attacks and can even increase your attack power or versatility mid combat by powering up said abilities. Although an interesting attempt at creating options in combat, I will admit I hardly ever used said system myself, as I created a character who got his benefits from not using Rage, the resource that powers the stronger attacks.The world itself is really well created with a lot of detail, creating a great mood as you hack and slash through groups of monsters. The encounters themselves are well balanced, but grow repetitive as you encounter the same groups of enemies again and again, a bit more variation in group makeup would have been welcome, but it's a slight issue rather than a deal breaker. Of course, the most important element for a game like this...the loot, is frequent and diverse. I was often switching over to newly acquired items or optimising my build.I must admit, I really enjoyed playing the game. The grim world is lightened with a sprinkling of humour, especially the witty banter between Van Helsing and Lady Katarina throughout the game, which is well acted and entertaining. The game itself is also littered with cultural references, if something is clickable, its likely Van Helsing has something to say about it that'll bring a smile to your face. I also found myself really enjoying the music, while not overly diverse, it's rather lovely and fits the world well.Listed under 'Main Features' is a section on building and developing traps to defend your lair. It's worth mentioning this is more of a brief distraction and isn't very deep. Those looking for a bit of tower defence in their ARPG might be a bit disappointed, despite the developers best intentions.I really do recommend the game to fans of action roleplaying games or for someone that fancies a simple, yet entertaining story with a touch of humour and a great deal of sparkly objects bursting out of everything you touch.

												I...really tried and yearned to love this game, as I do with every indie project that shows some semblance of original thought.I ended up...liking, if at times only TOLERATING, a lot of things about Van Helsing.Why do I say such a thing? because it got pretty bad at parts, but I also don't shy away from games totally unafraid to make me feel like a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥like they did 15 years ago. This game succeeds on that front unquestionably.Ideally for 2-4 players, I actually just finished the entire game solo. Be forewarned, if you're not an ARPG guy, you're even in for a rough time on easy difficulty, which I all but mandate in your first playthrough. This game will swarm your♥♥♥♥♥like Starship troopers with things that do not, I repeat NOT, die in 1, 2, even 5 hits. It's rough, and it works for the setting and the game.Now at this point the average Joe has some idea of what they're in for, so maybe you ARPG die hards are now asking: ""What's in it for me?"" Well I'll tell you!Great music: I had to talk about this here. It's a standard we all have with games of substance, especially a good APRG. This game delivers EXCESSIVELY. The entire score features soft harps and pianos, things you would expect to hear in this alternative dark fantasy Transylvanian tale. Hit up youtube and hear some of it for yourself. This is one of few games that I actually left on while I wrote the review because of how great an atmosphere the menu theme provided. Story: One thing I found funny about a game as goofy as Torchlight 2 is that it took its Story as seriously as Diablo did. This flip flops- very believable, gritty, down to earth graphics, sounds, and atmopshere, totally slapstick everything else. The characters engage in light heartened banter while picking up quests, interacting with objects, and more.♥♥♥♥♥♥ there's even a message board in town at the beginning that is for nothing beyond ""click for great pop culture reference."" It's a true joy to experience.Gameplay: Not much not already said here, You are in for a challenge, no way around that. A fun challenge with friends, but a challenge. Bring your A game, this game's ""easy"" is NOT TL2's.Fresh and new ideas: Ever think how badass it'd be to properly have your own hideout/camp, or even gather resources and build♥♥♥♥♥♥in a game like an ARPG? well VH almost delivers. I can't say there's any proper crafting, but midway your township where your vendors reside can actually get attacked, and you play a metagame of tower defense to protect it. Very innovative IMHO, and successful.Overall, if forcibly shoehorned into rating it on a 1-10 scale, which I like to refrain from, I would call this game a 7 without question. Flawed, buggy still, but the devs care about the latter and are working on it, it's an all out riot most of the time, and most important of all- it's fricken $10 until the 2nd. Consider snagging it if you're a fan of the genre, or even a new guy looking for a semi hardcore trial by fire.			"

The Story is pretty linear, not a lot of ""open world"" adventuring, but it's unique story kept me coming back for more. It's a trilogy game set, so keep in mind this isn't the end. Has this interesting power-up system that allows you be both melee or ranged. You can even equip both weapons.			"

												This game is a real mixed bag.On one hand - its fun. It's well designed, has interesting character aspects (skills, perks, etc), a companion , nice graphics, good gameplay. On the other hand - its hard to enjoy it when the game is riddled with bugs. Some of which were litterally game stopping (eg Industrial Port / Palace quest bug - only recently (12/10/13) patched. There are also other numerous bugs (now with fixes via the /FixQuest command) - and MP hasn't worked for many (perhaps patched today as well) and warning of data loss for MP characters.For some, having your game not progress unexpectedly, requiring you to search the web for solutions, isn't enjoyable or expected from Steam games. Perhaps now, the game is bug free. Perhaps not.I would say this game is not one i'd reccomend due to how many issues there have been that are substantial (MP, game stopping bugs) - unless you can get it for a massive Steam discount (80% off). Then the risk would be worth the reward. Paying full price now - without time showing if all the bugs are fully worked out - is not something recommended.			"

												Initial positive impression, as soon as I got into chapter 3 things went sour. Overall, not touching it again. TLDR on the bottom.+ Decent storytelling, somewhat involved.+ Comments from Lady Katarina are pretty amusing.+ Good pacing, good attribute system, fairly decent itemization (by comparison, MILES ahead of Diablo 3).- Little enemy variety, weird incoming damage at times.- Skill variety on the Hunter class is extremely poor. A handful of reskinned shots, didn't really feel progression or much weight from using differerent skills. Same deal goes for the melee tree.- BUGS. Oh the bugs. One of my hunter tricks crashed multiplayer games when I hosted, had to respec / avoid using skill to keep playing. The ""slow time"" skill on the Thaumaturge often bugged entire maps, lasting forever and then on a second cast engaging turbo mode. Random client crashes every 20-30 minutes.TLDR: The game is not entirely bad, but does not warrant a positive review. If you want the hack and slash experience and don't mind restarting the game every 30 minutes or so, go ahead. It's built on a solid foundation, but lacks the necessary polish to be a true contender in this genre.			"

If you call any isometric hack and slash RPG a Diablo rip-off, then yes, this is it.However, it puts its own spin on the genre and taking a lot from what Diablo did well, and added some things it maybe could have used.You play as Van Helsing, of the Monster Hunter lore, as one of three classes: Hunter, Thaumaturge, and Arcane Mechanic; each with it's own set of skills and abilities. The monsters and creatures you face are the ever-familiar brand you'd find in any fantasy setting, such as Rat-men, undead zombies, giant behemoths, acid-spitting breeders, and even automatons. From what I can tell, the story is pretty straightforward and can be completed in about 15 hours, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth your time.The inventory system is top-notch, taking much from Diablo where you have to arrange your items according to their size and shape in a grid fashion. You are provided with a storage that you can access through the town areas and depending on your choice of perk, you can store more than just a single page.Your companion through the game is Lady Katarina, a ghost of someone who knows the Van Helsing line quite well. She can be customized to be completely support (no fighting), ranged, melee, defense, attack, etc. She can even be configured to grab items from the battlefield according to their type or value. She can be sent to the store (like a town portal) to sell loot she's carrying and even buy potions if needed.They kept with the waypoint system of using an ""ink gate"" which allows you to teleport to the various areas you've discovered, as well as use a town portal for yourself.There's plenty of side-quests and the various tasks to keep you busy (as mundane as they can be sometimes), the rewards are quite worth it.Each character has a skill tree that can be traversed as you gain levels by investing skill points. There are class-specific skills (main attacks and passive abilities), tricks (which are like sub-skills), and auras (which are passive bonuses). There's also a perk system that allows you to choose various character bonuses as you gain reputation (how well you're known around the land -- kill lots of stuff).The HUD and interface are very easy to navigate, it's very hot-key friendly, and the music/controls are top-notch.The game also supports multiplayer as well, so you can team up with friends to take on the monsters of Borgovia.It's not the most revolutionary game out there, but I think anyone who's a fan of the lore and liked Diablo (maybe even those who didn't) will enjoy this game.

												Sleeper hit of 2013. It is a gem of a game with incredible voice acting, 2-3 times longer than Diablo 3's content. Best of all, Van Helsing is a trilogy and the 2nd installment arrives early 2014 and your character from the first game will import directly into the second. Found this to be much more enjoyable than Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2.			"

												I've always been a fan of ARPG's, since the very start of the first Diablo, so began my journey of endless clicking and replacing one pair of apparel with another due to a minor stat change! If you've played several ARPG's already, you'll know how they basically all share the same concept and pretty much are one in the same, perhaps the only difference would be the actual story, and even then it can become quite monotonous and you don't actually end up following it.Surprisingly, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is nothing like that! Sure it may be a hack 'n slash clickfest, but within its core lies a beautiful system unlike any other! The fast paced combat, the synergy with abilities and auras/tricks as well as the ability to craft (transmute) and enhance your items by adding and combining ""essences"" combined with a rather interesting story that one cannot help but follow (as there isn't many side quests to get lost on) makes for one hell of a good time in the beautiful world of Borgovia!I can however say from experience having played several ARPG's that this is by far the more challenging of the lot I've actually come across, and I mean that in a really good way. Though I did play on Hard it felt more like Hell of Diablo II right from the get go, and loot certainly wasn't overpowering (I was playing the newly released Thaumaturge class and it seems there isn't much unique loot as compared to the original Hunter class which every second unique I got was for it).The gameplay is really well polished, and so too are the graphics, which is surprising for an Indie release! I honestly cannot find any faults with the game itself, perhaps only that it was rather short (30 odd hours exploring EVERYTHING) but it strikes the perfect balance and somehow doesn't take you on a grindfest to actually progress and unlock everything you need or want! So all in all this is definitely a game I would recommend to any ARPG fans who loved Diablo or Torchlight!			"

												I found The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing to be a fun Diablo-esc game.  I did not purchase the DLC, as I got this game on sale at a much earlier point in time and only played it recently.  I did play the game on a normal difficulty setting, single player only.  If you are looking for a review of DLC or Multiplayer content, this is not for you.Van Helsing is filled with hand crafted art and textures, fair story writing, and the occassional surprising content.  There are quite a few references to what I imagine are their influences in game and story design.  On the flip side, I felt like the gameplay was lacking.  I also felt like the story was developing into something exciting, and quickly sputtered off like they lost the inspiration to keep going.I spent the first half of the game excited and drawn in.  The second half I felt like the gameplay had devolved into holding down the right mouse button waiting for my skills to kill ever increasing numbers of the same types of enemies.  It took me about 20 hours to finish based on my play time.  I felt like the skill trees had some fun possibilities, but nothing inspired me to branch out from what worked in the first hours of the game.  It was worth finishing the game to me, but I did feel this sense of, ""Was that it?"" -- I don't know that I could recommend this game to everyone.  I felt like it was worth the sale price I paid for it, and the 20 hours I invested in finishing it.  If it matters to those reading this I do not feel like its worth a replay, and I am not interested in DLC for it.  If I was to attach an arbitrary number to the game in regards to a ""score"", I would probably say a 60%.  It doesn't fail to create a fun game to play, but it did lack some kind of wow factor.			"

												This is pretty good. I am long since tired of Diablo clones, but I liked this one. It is worth a playthrough, somewhere on the order of 10 hours of play. It does not try to stretch that to 40 with fake longevity or 400 by asking you to keep re-running the same maps. It's not flawless, and I wouldn't recommend it without a sale (I got it in a Humble Bundle), but it does its job of being entertaining and engrossing.			"

												I was expecting something visceral and hard-hitting, and although the scenery is nice, as well as the number of enemies which can come rushing into you - Nothing you throw at them feels strong, nor does it feel satisfying when you use a strong ability.The animations are very lacking, as well, and the fact that you have to purchase DLC materials to get more than one character is the final nail in the coffin for me.Better stick to Diablo, even if everyone hates it.

I was very excited to play this game as it has everything i look for, but hours of searching on forums for a fix, I've come to the conclusion that this is money lost. The developers responses on all of the forums shows a lack of urgency to fix a glaring issue as hundreds of users have the same problem.			"

												A more than passable, fun game that manages to pick and choose the best elements from many other ARPGs and fit them all into a nice tidy package (with the inclusion of the DLC).  Pros:-No suicide bomber enemies.-3 playable classes with their own class specific items/sets/uniques.-A versatile companion npc with her own skill tree and equipment slots .  She can be your magic finder, help with your survivability, give offensive support, or a combination thereof.-Well done character banter.Cons:-Some of the unmarked quests, especially the one that spans the entire game are very easy to miss.-Multiplayer got off on a shaky start and never fully recovered.-Some quests teleport you without much warning to prepare.Overall it is a great game and well worth the price of admission.

												I didn't enjoyed The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing more than any of Diablo games. But for some reason, it was more fun than Torchlight series. Why? Not sure. Maybe because it looks a little more dark and I really loved atmosphere in this game. Having a lovely companion also made me enjoy this game really much and the way you could spend her skill points in whatever way you want was a good idea - you can build her so she will be a real support for the way you will be playing, not some kind of obstacle. Maybe because I was focused on hand-to-hand combat, sometimes I really had hard times - every new area ended for me the same way, with more deads than I could count. Not that I hated it, maybe it was also my fault, but I enjoyed it. This way I had more fun than just running and killing everyone with 1 hit. Also, the boss fights are great.Graphics looks nice, music fits really well. I could only complaing about how game ends, and while the story isn't the best but not that it really matter, at least I look for something different in hack and slash games. If you are fan of those, if you look for something interesting in this genre - you should try The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing. Maybe it's no use comparing it to other games like that but for sure it's worth playing. It's game that grabbed my attention for few hours and the time I spend playing it was truly fun.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is solid Diabloesque RPG on pc that plays well with a gamepad. That was my main draw point as got into the game. What I did not know is that it is actually very light-hearted and silly (in a positive way) RPG experience that really ended up enjoying.All the core mechanics work, the game play is solid, the story is there (perhaps not the best but certainly entertaining) and the game can be quite challenging at times. The questing is always about killing someone which ofc can be expected from this type of game and it might smother the enthusiast of some hard core RPG fans but aside from that it’s a very solid title.Crafting and enchanting provide plenty of variety; some interesting tower defence experiments were a fun idea as well. Graphics are nice as well but nothing amazing.An entertaining and fun RPG game that does not take itself seriously at all and provides just some solid entertainment.7.5/10PS: probably one of the best gamepad supported pc RPG games currently "

Also this is the first of three I believe so once your done you still have something to look forward to with your character in the future. Also there are game types that allow you to get loot after you beat the story so you can prepare for whats coming. Was very impressed and this game is a good little surprise.			"

												I recently purchased The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing Franchise pack and it's exactly the kind of game I've been looking for. Over-the-top monsters, decent world building and (for me) much more fun than Diablo 3. I wanted something that dealt with the supernatural and I wanted to kill a lot of monsters and this game gave me just that. I was already a big fan of the character's history and mythos (even though it's his son in this instance) I was very satisfied to step into the shoes of the world famous monster hunter. On the gameplay side of things, because I'm building strictly for ranged combat I like being able to set the behaviours of my companion Katarina and build her toward being a melee tank complimenting my own playstyle. The controls took a bit of getting used to, but they're quite cleverly implemented in that per shot you can decide which type of special round you'd like to load up into the gun. I'm still only very early into the game, but one of my favourite implementations that they've brought to the genre that I haven't seen anywhere else is that when you find a legendary item to gain it's full benefits you need to use the weapon to get kills in specific ways which unlock the item's abilities. It's one of those neat minor additions that helps keep the game interesting. Overall it has been a solid experience and I hope that this franchise can manage to keep going on strong.			"

The classes and skill tree and ability points are also well done and the companion ghost that you have with you throughout the game also levels up and gets skills and ability points and you can equip her with certain armor and weapons.To sum it up this is a really great & fun game that has good replayability and it also has a hardcore mode. The co-op is excellent!			"

												I'm not a big fan of top-down RPG's, but Van Helsing is a surprisingly good game. Although, I still believe it would've been better as ARPG. It has a pretty interesting story and nice character design. With tons of secrets, far-stretching maps and numerous missions it has hours of fun to offer.PROS:- Interesting story- Detailed and beautiful environment with atmosphere that involves both steampunk and gothic elements- Impeccable level design (a rarity these days)- Companion that comes in handy when facing hordes of enemies (Lady Caterina – available through DLC); she has her own skill tree and stats and can carry extra items, too- Convenient interface (compared to older games in RPG genre)- Contrary to other RPGs, the player is not tormented with endless choices between items, which are slightly better than the previous item in one aspect and slightly worse in another- Automatic equipment feature (allows to auto-equip best items)- Versatile skill tree- Relatively easy achievements (although, some might consider it a bad thing)CONS:- It's very demanding in terms of processing power. I experienced occasional freezes and lags on some maps (playing on high or very high settings). Some say it's because of bad optimisation and I tend to agree, as those lags occur in specific areas only.- IMO, towards the end, enemy spawn is a bit unbalanced; it's literally armies of enemies rushing towards you and, if you retreat in the wrong directions, it means another army. At times, you're just surrounded by countless enemies in a small circle and doomed to die. These hordes also make the game lag.- Level cap of 30 (not even enough to cover 20% of the skill tree)- Some missions use the previous maps and you have to reveal the whole territory again, even if you had explored it all before- This game does not launch on all systems without problems. In order to play the IAVH, I had to edit the registry valuesMy overall rating: 9/10			"

												What Van Helsing may lack in overall polish and length, especially for a hack and slash game of this type when some of its contemporaries seem to march on forever, it certainly makes up for with particular East European flavor and largely successful attempts at humor. If Van Helsing has one thing going for itself it's the fact it happens to have a very well defined atmosphere as well as some tangential gameplay additions you would not necessarily expect, mainly in the form of tower defense game and some separate scenarios unlocked towards the end.That's not to say the negatives don't rear their ugly head; from a single playable class, unless you buy the remaining two in the form of DLC/complete version, wonky and unclear itemization which will make you return to old RPG territory and simply look for basic attribute bonuses, and sometimes outright weirdly paced difficulty. Latter could be the failing of my own poor character building skills, but somewhere around The Old Town area difficulty seems to ramp up for no real reason other than perhaps the introduction of particularly annoying new enemy types. Ending is also an obvious cliffhanger, which may or may not annoy you depending on your take on the final boss.You will be in familiar waters if you have any experience with the genre in general, although your patience may be tested at certain parts as you struggle with camera spazzing out and somewhat obtuse quest directions leading you astray. Still worth checking out, though. "

The graphics and arts are good, even without DLCs your only class have total freedom of role (thanks to the customizable two characters skills and perks systems) and the loot system is rewarding, always leaving you with something usefull in the inventory.It lacks a bit in visual customization, monster models variety and, sadly, on the netcode but that won't ruin the, at least, 12 hours of fun offered by the story.

												One word: Katarina.  An amazing, funny and epically voiced companion who will add a lot of fun to your wondrous journey through Borgovia. More than once she made me smile with her smirky comments.There is abundance of references to other games and movies that are well placed and funny. The story is interesting and pulls you in more and more as you play, the combat on higher difficulty is actually challenging and you will find yourself dying more than once before you figure out a way to beat your enemy. As a first game in the series there are a few things that were a bit disappointing and some of them were even fixed later on in the second game:The traps are obsolete when you defending your lair on high difficulty; your own minions (if you chose to play this way) will trigger some of them; werewolf traps do not differentiate between you and the enemy and in most cases will get you killed.Once chosen, the difficulty cannot be changed.If you want to play with someone, you will have to invite a friend, because the multiplayer lobby is empty.You are given a very limited amount of skill points as you level up, placing the vast majority of perks and skills out of your reach so you will never have a chance to use them. I found myself using the same 3-4 skills/perks the entire game.That said, I enjoyed the game tremendously and maybe you will too...			"

												When I saw this, I thought this looks fun.  I was not wrong!  Besides the initial issue I had with DirectX (had to install DirectX 9 again), I had no problems or obvious bugs so far.  The game has performed well on my i7, 12GB memory, with SSD, and a GTX670 graphics card.Some users I noticed on the Steam forum have been having problems with the game not starting.  My wife and eldest son both play the game, and both had no problems.  But be aware that this seems to be happening with some people.  There is a dev that is on the forums at least trying to help now and then.Takes a short while to figure out the Rage, powerup settings and tricks, but once that is done, the rest of the game is easy to understand and grasp.  Pretty linear, just follow the quest markers.  Keep the tutorial on so you can easily get the initialy help you likely will need to better userstand the game.  Even then, you may need to play around a bit to fully understand the rage and powerup settings.  You can reset your abilitys, so don't worry about it being set in stone forever... just costs gold.Graphics and audio is great.  The audio is enjoyable and fits the action adventure gameplay.Some pointers:1. Take note that you can only have 10 perks during your 30 levels.  Many better perks don't show up initially in the game, so you may need to hold out before selecting.  Otherwise, find a resource online somewhere that provides all the perks and wait for the ones you want once you have seen them all.  Unlike your abilities and skills, you can't reset your perks.2. There is no save option, so you will always return to the waypoint (or ""ink"" point) of a certain area after you exit.  There is a setting in options that allows you stop the monsters from respawning if you exit.  Respawning after death costs money.  Once you get to your lair, you will be able to return to your lair for no cost.  Then you just run back to where ever you were when you died.  In general, the run back is not long for any place, so not a problem if you are a money scrooge.3. If you play all the quests, including most side quests, there is no need to grind for loot and leveling . Once you get further into the game, you can obtain a lot of loot by repeatedly killing certain mobs, bosses or champs, though in general there is no need to do this unless you want epic loot for all pieces of armour... and even more gold.  Gold is NOT difficult to come by.4. Your ghost, Lady Katarina, can be setup to pick up items for you.  Any items like potions and gold will be picked up on YOUR behalf.  So you will auto receive the items she gets.  She just saves you the inconvenience of going to collect them at times.  If you want her to actually use healing potions herself, you must specifically give them to her, and they will go in her potion's inventory tab.  On the other hand, the armour and weapons she picks up will go into her inventory.Overall, the game is fun, with some humour thrown in.  Make sure you get the DLC as it will give even more replayability.			"

												Van Helsing is a Diablo like action RPG developed by the Hungarian studio NeoCore Games known for their King Arthur series. Van Helsing combines a lot of the quality-of-life tweaks developers have been adding onto the genre ever since Diablo 2 became bigger than sliced bread. Some of these include the companion and pet system, the ability to respec your character without ever having to be afraid of gimping them, and the ability to disenchant and unsocket weapons without destroying either weapon or gem. However, the game is plagued by tons of bugs and performance issues and its multiplayer component should not even be considered playable.Issues in co-op:- The questline is not saved unless you are the host. Either play through the game entirely with a party or play it solo.- The tower defense portion and all the Secret Lair upgrades are inaccessible to anyone who is not the host.- Constant crashing when transitioning between areas.If you're opting for a single player only experience, then you'll get an average game that never takes off or goes anywhere. Remember, this is part 1 of an unfinished trilogy. Van Helsing lacks replay value as well. The level cap is 30 and there is no real endgame content. While the combat is genuinely fun despite adding nothing new to the genre, the customization options are very weak due to limited skill trees. NeoCore have rushed out an average game then proceeded to sell extra content for it without fixing longstanding issues. Both extra character classes, and the 2nd skill tree for Katarina, were sold for real money which is absolutely deplorable for an action RPG. Let’s not forget that people who pre-ordered this game got an exclusive permanent boost to their magic find. If you plan on buying the 2nd game, you can probably expect the same treatment. Buy a buggy game for $15, then pay $10 for additional content. These 3 games and all their content combined will end up costing you more money than a new game in the long run. Unless you've experienced every action RPG on the market right and starving for more, then there is no way I can recommend this title.My full video review is available at:

												Well well well, how did this little gem sneak under the radar?Already played Torchlight, Dungeon Siege and the other few hack and slash ARPGs?Want something to pass the time with as you await the full release of Grim Dawn?Boom here it is!For some reason some people dislike this game, no idea why. I found it to be quite enjoyable, although not of a quality in game of that as perhaps Torchlight II but still very fun.What this game does have over Torchlight II is a *story.*The voice acting is absolutly fantastic, and humorous as well.Many people had issue with a skill tree with large amounts of passives. And while, I do wish there were far more actual powers, I like having several passives to choose from.So as we wait for our next gem in this under developed genre go and play this, its loads of fun.

												One word: Katarina.  An amazing, funny and epically voiced companion who will add a lot of fun to your wondrous journey through Borgovia. More than once she made me smile with her smirky comments.There is abundance of references to other games and movies that are well placed and funny. The story is interesting and pulls you in more and more as you play, the combat on higher difficulty is actually challenging and you will find yourself dying more than once before you figure out a way to beat your enemy. As a first game in the series there are a few things that were a bit disappointing and some of them were even fixed later on in the second game:The traps are obsolete when you defending your lair on high difficulty; your own minions (if you chose to play this way) will trigger some of them; werewolf traps do not differentiate between you and the enemy and in most cases will get you killed.Once chosen, the difficulty cannot be changed.If you want to play with someone, you will have to invite a friend, because the multiplayer lobby is empty.You are given a very limited amount of skill points as you level up, placing the vast majority of perks and skills out of your reach so you will never have a chance to use them. I found myself using the same 3-4 skills/perks the entire game.That said, I enjoyed the game tremendously and maybe you will too...			"

												When I first played this game it had a sizeable number of bugsand a punishing difficulty, even on normal. But it was fun.Four playthroughs later, after using all three character classes; the game is a mix of Torchlight II in terms of mechanics and a steampunk-ish Dark Souls, with its keyboard-bashing AI swarmtactics and overpowered monsters thrown at the player.The game has its sizeable number of bugs trimmed down to'manageable' number of bugs with its patch history, but bugsremain. Some of the achievements do not unlock even whenall the prerequisites have been cleared, only to be unlocked in a separate playthrough with another character or when a level is loading between map screens.The writing in the game is, well; incredible. The introductorysequence alone leaves you wanting more with the variouslocations shown, but the witty banter between Van Helsing and Lady Katarina doesn't feel out-of-place in the grimly rendered, industrial-gothic-overtoned world.With design elements from other great games and its own combination of witty black humor and quirkiness, theIncredible Adventures of Van Helsing stands out well, morethan the sum of its parts. Recommended, but due to the bugs, proceed with caution.			"

												The Incredible Lag of Van HelsingGenerally I don't write bad reviews about games, but this time I have to.The main reason why I give this game negative score is because the technical aspect of this game is on the same level as that garbage of this game's steampunk scenery:1. It is badly optimized2. Quests get bugged all the time3. Ability sets don't get saved4. The game tends to crash after minimizing itTo eleborate:1. You will need better hardware you think for this game to be playable, the recommended settings I can consider to be lies. Even if you tinker the settings to get FPS up, the game still suffers from annoying stuttering and screen-tearing. V-sync will dump your performance even more.2. Scripts, gate openings, cutscene launches after booses - such quest related things routinely fail to execute, but hey - the devs got a ""solution"", open chat and type ""/FixQuest"" then space and a number, which quest needs fixing... it is better than nothing but such cheap solution is an insult to paying users - why the hell wasn't the game released in a proper condition in the first place?3. Similar to other hack and slash games, you can switch between saved skill combinations, the thing is, they are resetting to basic attacks after each loading screen. I have asked about this, the support quickly replied and said they will look into this, kudos to them, but that problem actually happening was just another drop to my already aggravated patience.4. Oh, another quest bugged? Just Google, which quest number should be entered now for the command, you minimize the game and it crashes...Even apart from technical problems, there are other things:1. The fights in this game get extremely overwhelming, you are attacked by a lot of enemies at once who charge at you from large distances, in some areas the enemies simply keep respawning indefinitely after you've killed a wave...2. Abilities feel they have low impact. Nothing you throw makes a lot of difference, in most of the game you'll be orb-dancing and spamming ranged attacks, constantly drinking potions and waiting for Katarina to respawn.3. Katarina doesn't understand the concept of tactical retreat. You can adjust her combat behaviour but it doesn't make any noticable difference.Now positive qualities:1. Humour. There are funny situations and interesting dialogues between the main character and Katarina - the ghost companion.2. Visuals.The game does look good, despite unreasonably high actual system requirements.Note that if the technical part of this game would be fine, I would give this game positive rating, there certainly are some interesting ideas and nice sceneries, however - in the condition how it is now I just cannot recommend anyone to pay for this.I am glad I bought this on sale, not for full price! And speaking of money - you can play only ONE class in this game, you are asked to buy DLC if you want other classes...It is NOT worth the money!			"

												I bought this game to play multiplayer with my girlfriend, after we beat Diablo 3. Honestly, it was some of the most frustrating gaming I've ever experienced, and if it wasn't for the fact that not many other games of this genre exist, I would've uninstalled it ages ago.Pros:- nice atmosphere and art- interesting character builds- decent story and voice acting- the game looks great and runs pretty well - no sudden slowdowns or anything like thatCons:- frequent crashing/locking up when doing scene transitions, to the point where we were lucky to play 2h at a time- frequent bugs that interrupt the gameplay (ie you are dead and can't respawn, or you respawn in your home-base but are dead and need resurrecting *in the base*)- bugs that break missions (had en entire level bug out with no enemies spawning over multiple visits/session, broke the final boss quest 3 or 4 times)- ridiculous difficulty. maybe we were playing it wrong after Diablo but dying constantly on Casual difficulty was not fun- as a spellcaster, I had frequent lock-ups where a spell would remain stuck casting, so I couldn't cast any other spells and could not move - had to just wait to die and respawnNot sure how that stacks up in single-player since I was not interested in that aspect, so if you're never intending to play multiplayer read some other reviews. However, if you want to play multiplayer, I hope you have endless patience.			"

												I want to like this game. The writing is decent and enjoyable, the ambiance is interesting, and it has a pet system similar to Torchlight, but with more customization and leveling options.However, ultimately, in my experience, it devolves into a tedius grind at higher levels, where virtually every fight wound up being 'aggro group of enemies, kite for an unforgivably long time until all dead, run to next group of enemies', and I really can't overlook that. Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't been playing on Hard difficulty, but the lack of variation in enemy AI and length of time every enemy took to kill really wore on me.Go download some mods for Torchlight II if you want to reinvigorate your Diablo-like experience.

												Recommend?  Just barely.Pros- Great environment- Good music- Decent voice acting- Defending your lair against waves of enemies- DLC - Lady Katarina and Thaumaturge class- Cool monsters to interact with - rat men, werewolves, and necrosCons- Story is a bit muddled.  Individual pieces make sense, but the overall theme gets lost.- Display issues.  Played on an older system with Nvidia GTX 560ti and it was almost unplayable with everything cranked down.  Upgraded to basically new everything and ran great with everything cranked to max though I would still login and have to restart my computer sometimes due to graphic bugs.- Level cap?!  So weird, they give you the option to have monsters respawn in areas you've cleared, etc. Got to end of the game and my level is capped, perks are capped, and I'm assuming Lady Katarina was capped too.  Lame.  Really killed replayability with that character on the different modes.- Crafting was needlessly complex for a top down RPG.  Let me combine A and B and get C.  Not A, B, C, with D to regulate this variable with E controlling something else.  I went straight to enchanting - pay a fee for a particular stat increase			"

Though, the controller is far worse imho. I'd recommend this game for the storyboard an some of the game play (if you don't mind playing around these frustrations). But the side characters can be really naggy and annoying. More so than usual sidekicks. So I play without the volume ;)			"

If you want a D2-style aRPG and dislike playing a game three times to get to the ""real game"" - get Van Helsing. You'll have a good time with it.Definitely get the Blue Blood DLC as it has some very useful skills for Katarina (which should've been there in the first place, but I digress).			"

												Van Helsing is an aRPG set in the mythical land of Borgovia. If you've played Grim Dawn, Diablo or Torchlight you'll be familiar with the gameplay. The game does have a unique ability system though, as you fight you gain rage which can be spent to powerup your abilities. For example lets say you're using a lightning spell, powering it up may cause enemies to be shocked, or it may increase the number of enemies hit. A powered up spell only has one charge and can be activated with the spacebar, although this becomes tedious very fast and I'd wager 99.9% of people have this set to auto cast whenever available. The game allows you to set up powerup presets so you can very much set it and forget it and the game will automatically boost the chosen ability(s) whenever you have sufficient rage. Apart from that it's your usual aRPG fare, you have a standard talent tree with forks and paths, passive abilities and stat points which allow you to customise your character further. When you create your character you have the choice of three classes, the Arcane Mechanic who is an engineer archetype, the Thaumaturge who is a mage and finally the Hunter who is the iconic poster child for the series. All classes can have two different weapon sets which can be swapped on the fly, and the Hunter can also specialise in either melee or range attacks.Throughout the game you're accompanied by your ghostly companion, Katarina. She works very much like the Torchlight pet, she can pick up items, fight for you and even be sent back to town to sell and buy which saves you the bother! She also has her own stats and talent tree, you can either build her to become stronger herself, or build her as a complete buff bot which will give you lots of powerful auras. Usefulness aside she's actually a big part of the game, and the banter between you and her is often really enjoyable, the voice acting for both Van Helsing and Katarina is top notch (the same can't be said for all the characters though!).The story will take around 15 hours to complete which is decent, but beyond that there's not much reason to continuing playing at max level. You do unlock scenarios which are basically dungeons with over levelled mobs which makes for a stiffer challenge and supposed higher rewards (I didn't get anything of worth) but there's no real point as the loot is lacking, which is a pretty big deal in an aRPG and why I didn't score the game higher. During my playthrough I saw a total of three legendary items and barely upgraded my gear at all, plus the items are all very generic and frankly boring. There was no excitement when an item dropped. You're also able to gamble for items with gold, but once again I never got anything of worth. I will say that this has been improved in the second game, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II which I started after finishing the first game so I'm sure I wasn't the only one who noticed this massive flaw.Technically the game is fine, most quests have voice acting which isn't always a given for this genre, especially from the smaller studios, and while not perfect it is pretty funny at times and there are plenty of references to other games and TV shows which I enjoyed. Graphically the game is OK, it's a couple of years old and wouldn't have been anything to rave about back then, but it's fine, and it performs well, I was able to maintain 60fps on ultra without dips (as you'd expect from an older game on a GTX 970). The audio is decent and the voice acting is good for the main characters and acceptable for the supporting cast, the game doesn't take itself too seriously in this department and you will find yourself smiling throughout the game at the silly things that are said.Overall it's a decent aRPG with some major flaws that prevent it from being more than decent but if you can grab it at 75% off in a Steam sale I would say go ahead and buy it, you'll get your monies worth at that price and while it's not perfect, it is an enjoyable experience. The devs are also still supporting the game two years later, and plan to bring out a ""Final Cut"" of all three games with new features and a more streamlined experience, this will be free if you own all three games already. If you're interested in the series it may be smart to wait until September to play it as the Final Cut will be released then.6/10			"

												Let me start by saying that this game doesnt really do much that is brand new. It is an action RPG in the vein of Diablo, and all the others. HOWEVER.. what it does, it does very, very well! It is truly a joy to play. Your Van Helsing can wield swords, or guns, or both. The guns really does add a fun dimension of ranged attack I havent really seen. The game has a marvelous steampunk type of setting, and it has loads of little inside jokes scattered around in dialogue and small details. I would definately pick this up... it doesnt play like the rest, even though it has similarities. It feels unique, even in its overplayed genre. 8.9/10			"

												9/10If you're a fan of Diablo or played the Fate demo on Windows XP as a kid you will like this game.It's a top-down RPG hack-n-slash set in a steampunk world where you are a monster hunter on a quest to take down the evil professor who's inventing a super weapon. Due to the simple, unremarkable gameplay and graphics, you'll either like this game or not. It has a very complex character building system that will take exploration, reading, trial and error, and Googling to master. Despite getting stuck on multiple occasions, it kept me coming back until I beat it.Bear in mind I am not a hardcore commited player of this game who's spend hundreds of hours and is on a quest to beat it on the hardest difficulty. I enjoyed it, but the one-track gameplay of this game and others like it is just something I and I think a lot of casual gamers find it hard to get into.			"

												Solid entry in the ARPG genre.  If you've played Diablo, Torchlight, etc then you won't see too much that is new.  Random items, set/unique items, packs of champion monsters, fetch quests, enchanter NPCs, imbuing socketed items with various items, and so on.  My first time through, I played it on the harder difficulty so I got about 20 hours of game play out of it using the Hunter class.  There are additional modes like New Game+ (which they call neverending story) and Scenario where you have to complete maps with a timelimit while also achieving another task (never dropping below 50% health, looting all the corpses, or other things like that).Things I liked that may or may not appeal to veterans of the genre: When you disenchant something, you only remove the custom enchantment that was placed on it.  The item's base enchantments are not affected.  You can only enchant items once, so this is a nice balance.When you hover over an item, it tells you *exactly* how much better or worse it is compared to what you currently have.  It will show you impacts to spellpower, DPS, protection, Mana, HP, etc.If you put an essence in an item (the equivalent of a gem, element, etc that adds effects to your stuff), you can later pay to remove it without destroying the item or the essence.The only restrictions on item use are class and level.  So that thing that happens in other ARPGs where you're using the stat bonus on one item to allow you to use another item causing your stuff to become unwearable if you remove things in the wrong order doesn't happen.Respec'ing or reassigning ability points isn't an all or nothing process - there is standard cost to take back points or skills and you can play around with options on what you'll unlock before you are asked to confirm or cancel out.For a steam-punk/fantasy themed ARPG, Torchlight 1 and 2 are better, but if you can pick this one up on a sale like I did, you'll have some fun.

												This is a fun little ARPG. Without DLC there are effectively two options - swordy type or shooty type, and you can switch between them basically at will. Your ghostly companion can be set up as either range or melee as well. The combination is pretty cool.  I've had some success levelling my ghost up as a tank, and sitting back at range and using my guns to finish off opponents which are targeting her. There's also some limited magic which you can use for basic AoE attacks.Environments are nice. Maps tend to be pretty big, and the sort-of-steampunk atmosphere is a nice change.The voice acting is a bit hit-and-miss. The main characters are fine, but you'll bump into some real howlers early on who I suspect were voiced by the game's programmers.The game is a bit more story-driven than, for example, Diablo III seems to be. You get quests popping up all over the place, and finishing them isn't too much of a stretch. You do have to do a lot of kiting. More than I'm particularly comfortable with. You either get mobbed by a *LOT* of enemies, with no real way to damage more than one at a time... or you'll get one mob which takes a long time to kill, even though it's not particularly challenging.   This is a bit of a flaw, but it's not a major one, all things considered.I got this on special for $4, and it's well worth that. This holds up nicely, even given the fact that ARPGs aren't really all that hard to come by.It could do with more character/attack customisation (without DLC) and the loot system is a bit 'meh', but it seems to be a pretty solid, enjoyable game.

												Diablo like game, I started multiplayer so I guess I didn't have any tutorial which made it more diffcult...Obviously it's not all like diablo, so I am happy because there is a really nice experience.I will definitely update this review when I keep progressing the game.UPDATE 04.03.2016 part 1-------------------------------I got stuck yesterday. I didn't see half of NPC in Secret Lair. Tried everything...Had to do Old town once again, thanks god it was multiplayer so the other person had proper save...USEFUL INFO 04.03.2016--------------------------------------- The game doesn't have ""I want to play once again"" experience.Maybe with DLC, but... probably nah.MUSIC-----------So far music is really nice and calming.But repeative and does not make any athmosphere.ISSUES-------------My game sometimes freezes while I'm playing and I need to wait till it will pass.Music and everything is fine, just have 1 frame per 6 seconds...MORE INFO AND SPOILERS...------------------------------------------------I wish there could be more essence adding gemstones...And more possibilities to mix essences.And also more powerful weapons... Fighting those monsters take ages with weapon 20-35 dmg...I've got 6 different green set items, each and every one from a different set.And I can mix 3 items into 1 item, but I got nothing good anyway.You have companion that acts like pet from Torchlight.You have sets like in Diablo.-------------------------------------------------Update 04.03.2016 Part 2---------------------------------------------There are some problems with the game.Firstly it's freezeing for no reason sometimes...Secondly it's repeative.When I mean repeative...I mean really... annoyingly repeative.The futher You go, the more it feels like grinding.Not hack and slash. I didn't get any better weapon since good 10 lvls...And the drop isn't good either.From some quests both players get the same items with same stats...When you do quest twice.. Happend to me, because of the invisible NPC bug...You get the same thing, same stats from the same quests...It is trully a one time game...I will update.Update 06-03-2016------------------------------Yesterday I finished the game. And I was very unhappy that I couldn't lvl up more than 30 lvl.That nothing really good dropped, and   the last boss was too easy All that grinding for this? Well... Still 7/10. But probably wouldn't play again.So far 7/10			"

												I've been playing Diablo 3 a lot lately, and I got a tad bored with it, so I decided to finally fire up Van Helsing. At first I didn't like it, but it gets progressively better the more you play. It has a few unique twists and mechanics to the whole ARPG formula that I really like. It's not quite a fluid and fast paced as Diablo, but that's not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion. Anyway, if you like ARPG's, then this is a no brainer.			"

												With GrimDawn, TorchLight 2 and TitanQuest Anniversary, its really hard to recommend this game.The fighting... feels sluggish and most of the time punishing. Commonly facing over 10 Werewolves or enemies at the same time which kill you as fast as looking at them, in normal difficulty, is not fun and the animation for executing skills are all slow and a bit sluggish.You will have to tweak the sounds properties since Music tends to opaque the sounds and voices.The age of this game... well I would not blame the age but the execution. Animations are sluggish but the killing time is freaking high when the monster attack you.Torchlight 1, the first game(2009), feels a lot better as a Diablo clone that this product(2013).			"

												Exactly what it wants to be. Completely aware of what it is. A smoothly produced, atmospheric and thoroughly entertaining ARPG emphasising singleplayer, enjoyable quests and characters, and a focused experience. A single character and his ghostly partner (playing the role of a pet or minion, albeit with a strong personality and her own inventory, abilities and progression) romp across a neo-Transylvanian setting combing classic Gothic horror, Shelley's Frankenstein and Teslapunk/Steampunk aesthetics.I've not enjoyed any other traditional ARPG as much as this one - more challenging than Path of Exile, more varied and consistently entertaining than Diablo II, richer and far better presented than Titan Quest, and more involving than Torchlight.If you want some story, good writing and something a little more lively than the conventional grind in an exceedingly well made and satisfying ARPG, jump in. If you want to level mindlessly and play the game repeatedly in multiplayer, play something else.This crew deserve your money. - Jack			"

The game has a unique gothic atmosphere, a well designed character development system, dynamic combat, storyline with decisions to make and some tower defense elements.

The mechanics aren't very original, and neither is the story - but it doesn't strive to be; the game clearly aims for enjoyment, and dry humour with multiple hidden (or not ;)) references to other games proves to be fun.I sincerely recommend this game if you like the genre, but also if you seek for an enjoyable experience :)			"

												Van Helsing was, to me, one of those games that was only pleasureful to play in c-op. I've started out playing it alone, but quickly grew tired of it. There isn't much holding this title up in terms of story or novel game mechanics. This is a classic, if a little simplistic RPG through and through. In co-op, however, I had the chance to play polar opposite builds with my gaming buddy which made for a more interesting, strategy-driven experience. Without this additional challenge, I wouldn't have found the incentive to ever finish this game. Your ghostly companion has a very enticing voice, though. All in all, I don't recommend it.			"

It becomes a gangbang after a while.  Some boss fights are frustrating. For example during drill monster fight it's really hard to click on the trigger in the middle.   Currently shrines are broken. When you click on them your character starts running in opposite direction. There are lots of forum posts about this but no one has fixed it yet. "

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is very reminiscent of the legendary Diablo II, an action RPG combining both alot & fast action with character progression. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing captures the return of Van Helsing junior to Eastern Europe in order to aid the people of Borgovia in their fight against evil. I didn't get really hooked by the storyline, but the action keeps you moving forward. While there is quite some decent game time before you finish the game, the plot seems rather unfinished. Guess we need to wait until the follow-up game arrives. Bought the game during a Steam sale, which included all three content DLC. The Blue Blood DLC was particularly useful as it improves the usability of Katerina, your ghostly sidekick. Both Thaumaturge and Arcane Mechanic DLC just add two new classes to play with instead of the default Hunter class. I only played the Hunter class as there wasn't much incentive (expect the odd class side quests) to replay the game with another class. Overall, the game is warmly recommended for both new and experienced action RPG fans. Score: 7.5/10Pro:+ character progression via skills, auras, perks, capabilities...+ appealing visuals+ Katerina your sidekick+ choice between melee & ranged+ loot, loot, loot!Contra:- character progression doesn't really matter, just stack melee or ranged skills and sweep through the game- some bugs, e.g. traps not working, movies not playing (edit: fix was released after I finished the game)- lots of crappy loot- lack of replayability			"

												Action RPG, Diablo-like game.Quite fun, environment is beautiful. Quite a lot of stuff you can customize as well.As of now there are 3 different classes, each with 2 different ability/skill paths.Hunter: Name defines the class, melee cool sword abilities, ranged revolver or shotgun battles, pretty cool effetcs and abilities.(the only class ive played), the other two are a battle mage, and a ranged specialist. All classes also has a set of Auras, and a set of ""Tricks"", special abilities rather said. Each ability can be infused with ""rage"" which you get form killing monsters and enemies. With the rage you make an ability stronger by choosing between three different powerups. SUch as 50% more dmg, or 5% heal per enemy hit, or mroe targets hit. the Artifical intelligence is quite something, works much better than in D3 and Torchlight 2, give it special acessories and upgade its abilities, which you choose yourself, talking about your companion, is it wasnt clear enough.Nice Features:Gem cutting, enhancing, upgrading.Armor forging, combine for chance to get better item(Artifact forge).Inktravel (basicly teleport).Enchanting, disenchanting.up to 4 player MP online OR local.Nice storyline, as well as great humor thrown in here and there.Companion called katarina, has her own abilities and passives, has 3 different ""modes"", defend, guard, and caster.Great environment, clothes could have been more detailed but still fits into the game perfectly.Spell details are also quite nice, but could have had more work, compared to the detaield environment and enemy-models.You get to play as the legendary monster hunter Van Helsing.I really recommend this game, very fun and entertaining, tons of quests and items with a large variety of ""stats"".9/10 for its astonishing humor, environment, customizing capability and storyline.

Katarina is pure awesomeness, loved her character!For me the game lacks a bit in info/hints/helps. It should at least teach you the basics enchancing/essences, although it is pretty easy to get the hang of it, i didn't have a problem with it but it's not friendly for new players into ARPG's.Also i didn't like the ending and i expected it to be more difficult.Might update this when i try the 2 modes that unlocked!

												Solid Hack&Slash, one of the better games of its kind that I've played. There's a lot of character advancement options, the writing is witty and fun, and the theme is pretty unique (a mixture of steampunk, gothic fiction and folklore undertones). Some slight innovations and experiments give the mechanics of this game a fresh and instantly recognizable feel.Despite many shortcomings and a general lack of polish in most places, fans of the genre should really check this one out. Keep in mind, however, that after finishing the campaign (which ends around the time you hit the level cap, which isn't too high at 30) there's not much left to do other than start a new character. A definite ending is a nice throwback to the original Diablo and personally, I enjoyed the fact that I can actually complete this game and it will acknowledge that, but I know that this may be an issue for many die-hard fans of the genre.

												I initially resisted buying this game because I thought it might be a lame movie tie-in game. However I decided to give it a shot after reading reviews. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is a very good arpg game. The game features standard arpg gameplay, well-adapted for using a controller. With dlc there are a few different classes, and different ways to build your character within those classes. The writing is good, with lots of clever banter between Van Helsing, his ghost companion, and sometimes the different characters you meet while adventuring. There are a few offbeat quests and amusing easter eggs to find. These touches help the game to stand out from the average hack n slash arpg. The action is top-notch. Mobs can be huge and overwhelming sometimes. The game definitely keeps you moving while in areas populated by enemies. This, combined with the large variety of monster types definitely keeps the game from getting repetitive. Monster respawn every time you leave an area. Fortunately the respawning can be turned off, and then can be turned on again if you feel you need to grind more xp before progressing further in the game. Overall I'd give the entire series an 8.5/10. This and its sequel are first class modern arpgs, just as good as Diablo III or Torchlight II.			"

Also boosting  the skills with your rage is 50/50 for me. I can not decide if I like it yet. But I would give this game a 9/10 for its price. Get it and have fun.			"

												Entertaining and fun. This game plays like Diablo meets the world of Van Helsing with vampires, werewolves, and other such monsters. It's a hack/slash fun-fest with some decent voice-acting (entertaining quips and interesting voices which does occasionally lull with some of the dialogue, but at least the voice-actors are pretty cool), some decent graphics, interesting powers/perks and character development, and other such fun. If you dig Diablo and the world of Van Helsing then check this game out. It's a shorter romp, but well-worth the playthrough!			"

												One of the better PC games I have played in a while.  It is also Full Controller Supported which makes it so much easier for me.  I am a console gamer at heart and this game is perfect for that feel.  This game feels a bit like Baldur's Gate with more extensive leveling and equipment.  The story is pretty good and after about 2 hours of gaming I can say I am pretty hooked.  Definitely a good purchase and well worth your time if you enjoy the RPG/Hack & Slash genre.			"

												I have played Diabo (1-3), Torchlight 1-2, Titan Quest, and few more others, and so far, Van Helsing is on the top. The world is set in dark sci-fi fantasy + steampunk world. The Loot is great, colorful and many to choose from so it can be adapt to your build. The map is premade and first time round, very engaging story. Here are Pro & Con's:Pro- easy navigation- fast, and candy eye action- many build to try- talent is permanent, hence replaybility to find your perfect Van Helsing- combination of APRG with bit of action Tower Defense- Nice story- and best of all Lady Katarina and her sacarsmCons- Loading time - maybe its bug- 20GB download - are you serious??- It gets bit easy... but still enjoyable smashing through enemySound - 8Graphic - 8.5Gameplay - 9Replayability - 7Control - 8Value - 9Overall - 8.5 higly recommended and I am looking forward for sequel			"

												I would say this is better than my first glance. I really like the theme, music, art style of the game, they matches well. The story is a little bit obscure. The good part is it is not text heavy, I can see the where the story comes from, where it might go, but I don't have to take too much care of any epic background history knowledge, makes the experience more relaxing. There are also new gameplay mechanics makes it stand out from epic ARPGs like Diablo2. I recommend it to players who like Diablo but feeling like there are something wrong in Torchlight XD.			"

The DLCs add even more varsity to the gameplay by adding skills to Katarina and introducing completely different gameplay styles with the two new characters, the arcane mechanic and the thaumaturge. I can't wait for more content to spend more time in this mysterious new world with van helsing and his ghost katarina, the monsters of east european myths, the steampunk machineries, etc.			"

												Man for the price of a movie ticket and a snack...you cant go wrong. I just started but the replay value seems pretty good already. I love the Diablo games and such, and this is similar. Story seems to be decent at this point. The only complaint I have is the skill usage. I am playing the regular character and skills do not seem very dynamic so far. Also boosting  the skills with your rage is 50/50 for me. I can not decide if I like it yet. But I would give this game a 9/10 for its price. Get it and have fun.			"

												A ton of fun. If you liked Titan Quest, this feels like a spiritual successor. It's not very long, guessing around 20 hours. I got it for less than $7 though, and that's a great value. I'll probably replay it at some point as well. I'd say it's easily worth the price at full price too. It feels more engaging than your typical isometric arpg, especially playing at higher difficulties. They made most of the abilities have combinations, so you're constantly doing things. Unless you're playing the game on an easier difficulty, it shouldn't be a matter of spamming a single ability over and over (which is nice compared to a majority of these style games).The leveling system feels nice. It's usually exciting to get a new level. There's also a reputation system, where you get to choose a new strong buff after gaining enough reputation. The reputation system felt a bit slow, though. I'm nearly at the end of the game and I've gotten around 6 levels in reputation. The loot system felt on-par with other games in this genre. I got the feeling that there weren't many ""set"" items, but that actually was a positive thing given the length of the game and it's focus on a single player experience. I was able to complete 2 sets in my playthrough. I usually don't like forced companions in these types of games, but I enjoyed the companion in this one. She had a lot of dialog, and actually felt helpful. She also buffs you as you level her up. There are side quests that give you unique items for the main Hunter class, but you can equip them on your companion if you're not a hunter.Overall, I had a ton of fun with this game, and I highly recommend it if it's on a sale or even if it's not. Just keep in mind isometric arpgs are not everyone's cup of tea.I did not try the multiplayer, so I cannot comment on that.			"

Well the game is really cool, it has a nice story , but i think it could be a bit deaper than it is now, but i guess that it will happen in The Sequel of the game that it comes.. The basic hero (hunder ) is ok , with some spells/skills be more powerfull than others , the melle is ok , but i prefered to play it on max range with guns... The good thing withthe game is that you can play it the way toy want it , it offers a great variety of gaming styes to chose what you really want.. I replayed as thaumaturge but this clas seemed a bit morre powerfull than the hunter....i dont know if this is my idea or not, but i finished the quest faster than the 1st time... Now i chosed the neverending story to find more chalenge in the game , which seems cool to me,, the ghost companion is a very good made implement in the game , and i ant to learn more about the lady..its on the high ights of thi game..the thing tha i dint like a lot is that i was 25-30 lvl and non of the items that i loot was good for me... i was with the same items from lvl 23 or so i think ,, which made the looot a very stupid thing... the only good thing bou t it in high levels is that you could selll them in high prises.. this continues in Neverending story.. i m still with the same item from before enter he mode, which is kinda stupid and boring..the replayability of the game  is pretty high and to be honnest is the first time in this kind of games tha i want to keep playing it .. also the achievments are kinda adictive i have to say, and i want to collect them alll.. the game ofc is not in the same level as Diablo 3 or POE but it is a great single play game that you hav to try if you are fan of those games!! Also the low prise helps in that, especially in dicount sales it costs 3-5 euro which is pretty cool if you thing the enjoyment that it will offer you...SO GUYS YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS GAME, IT WORTHS THE TIME AND THE MONEY			"

												First time I heard about this game I thought it was a cheap Hack n Slash similiar to Frater or Space Hack (which weren't really any good). The promo trailer shows a character being put in a bullet hell, but with monsters instead of bullets. This seemed like a good idea to me, but still I was thinking this only happens in special areas/zones, or during some in-game events.Couldn't be more wrong as this game is as intense as it should be. You can fight a lot of monsters and develop your skills in a way that expands your gameplay. Even though the plot and characters aren't really ""the best"" this is still a very good, plain hack'n'slash game. It offers a lot for the price of 3,73€. You should really try it. I'm a Diablo fan and even though I wouldn't play this over Diablo, I would totally play it over games like Torchlight. This game just gives you this feeling of fighting evil at it's finest.♥♥♥♥.			"

												I was pleasantly surprised by Van Helsing.  At it's core it is a typical action RPG, kill waves of varying enemies as you fight towards a boss all while collecting loot and skill points.  Although it does have a few unique features that make it stand out in certain ways, such as a lair defense game which has you defending your secret base from waves of enemies with traps you can upgrade and strategically place about.  The story is great it kept me interested up until the end.  The AI companion is actually incredibly useful, she has a ton of useful skill points and a ton of options for adjusting her behaviour.  This game is not as complex as other Action RPG's, Path of Exile for example.  In my opinion it doesn't have a lot of replay value after you complete the story, there's a neverending mode where you can farm for high level items and multiplayer for playing with friends for those that do want to keep going though.  Definately worth picking up, it's a great game that pretty much anybody should be able to enjoy.			"

												This game is an action packed, button mashing, Werewolf horde of excitement. If you plan on getting this game make sure you have a good keyboard. It might be controller compatible, but it gets quite tedious and hard (you end up teleporting a lot when you don't mean to), so i suggest using a keyboard and setting all 92390280938902 key binds to things you will easily remember (even though I still don't know where everything is). There is a lot going on in this game, especially when trying to figure out what to do, what skills and spells to use, what to keep for your character and setting up your companion followers stuff too. This is a game you can't just jump right into and rule the world, it's confusing for new players, but don't give up on it because of the confusement, stick around, bash some buttons and eventually you will get the hang of it because it's a pretty cool game.Edit: Cool until you hit a bunch of bugged quests and can't go any further...

I generally prefer to play any game with K+M but tried this with a controller and I must say I like it. The game itself is a bit buggy and preformance a bit iffy, but it's fun to play. It even got me to play some side quests and i only do that in games I truly enjoy. The graphics are decent, gameplay get's a bit repetitive toward the end and banter between Katalina and Van Helsing is truly delightful. All in all, i think it's worth a playtrough.			"

												Since some folks may look into puchasing these games individually as opposed to in the ""Final Cut"" edition which includes all 3 games, I'm going to also post a review of the individual games, taken from my Final Cut review with very slight modifications. I'm going to call this one Van Helsing I (while the sequels will be II and III, of course).Van Helsing I's content was great. I expected a garbage Diablo clone with a ghost following me around that wouldn't say anything and would be useless in regard to gameplay; just serving as a stand-in for a co-op partner because the game's balancing wasn't made for single player. Boy, was I wrong. That ghost companion is my favorite thing about all three games. Her name is Katarina, she's wonderfully voice-acted, is the best character in all three games, and she is snarky, funny, and great to have around for gameplay purposes, as she has three separate skill trees and levels up on her own. You can boost everything from boosting your hero's critical hit chance, to your Magic Find (item drop quality), to her own damage output, to her own HP, etc. She takes scenes that would be boring in any other game and injects personality and humor into them which make them either enjoyable or less unenjoyable than they would be without her. I cannot properly express how much I like Katarina. If I were given heaps of video game characters to pick from and could choose her, I dare say she would be in my overall top 10 favorite video game characters list.With Katarina out of the way, the environments in the first segment of Van Helsing I are all outdoors, looking nice with rocks, grass, snow, swampland, trees, etc. It wasn't horribly exciting, but the sheer competence of the combat for a ""Diablo clone"" took me by surprise. The maps were huge with plenty of monsters to fight, loot to pick up, hidden treasure and a fair number of side quests. By the time I finished the first big leg of Van Helsing I, I was getting a little tired of the outdoor areas. So what does the game do? It goes full-on steampunk. The guns and a few clockwork-soldier-looking-dudes in the wilderness had that vibes, sure, but I never expected a steampunk city with Van Helsing as the hero, but a ghost sidekick, monster allies, and scientist villains. It was cheesy and the vampire ally is practically a cartoon character, but it was all so lovable and fun. There were a significant number of references to movies, film, games, etc., but they never felt like ""too much"" to me, and added some levity to the game. The third act was more steampunk city, but the classier end of town, so it felt fresh.The final boss to Van Helsing I was pretty easy, but I'd rather have easy than insufferably hard, because I'm here to have fun, rather than prove something to myself or others. The ending is a to-be-continued sort of thing, but not a cliff-hanger by any means. I thoroughly enjoyed Van Helsing I's original release, and the version you can find in the Final Cut version of the game appealed a bit more to me, thanks to the new skill trees, though that's a matter of taste which could vary from player to player. I cannot speak of the co-op in the original version as I have not tried it, but if it is functional, then I would imagine it's quite fun as it was in the Final Cut version. This is a very good game, though depending on the price, you may wish to grab the Final Cut, even if only to play through the Van Helsing I segment and then quit the game without continuing due to the dip in quality from the sequels.

												Well, I have found that after choosing many games by the good reviews that reviewers tend to be a very picky lot. Many of the games that have great ranking are simply awful. the ones that get between 70%  and 80 usually find me at least liking them. It turns out after many years of casual gaming I dont like most of the games that are highly rated. This game is charming, fun, doesnt take itself to seriously, and has in my opinion very good characters and gameplay. Rotten tomatoes gave it a 72% I think, I give it a 9.5. its a fun game! like games should be.....good guys and bad guys, none of this always bad against worse guy.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is one of a number of games released in the last few years that succesfully tackles a popular but well-worn genre, and manages to be both faithful to the genre style, whilst streamlining the experience, leaving it feeling both new and deeply nostalgic at the same time. This game is one of the more fun isometric RPGs I've played, and I'd call myself a harsh critic of the genre. This and Torchlight 2 are probably my favourites, and share a lot in common in terms of updating and streamlining the experience. TIAVH is generally a well-made game, and despite some issues with player-character pathfinding, I can't really fault the production quality. It has wonderfully schlocky voice acting, humourous dialogue, lovely visuals, a deep, deep skill tree that you'll never completely discover in one playthorough, a streamlined inventory, tonnes of enemy types, plenty of wonderful locations, and LOTS of loot. The game also rewards you regularly with achievements, which keeps you pushing forward. With that being said, it doesn't reinvent the wheel, meaning that some of the clunkier core mechanics of the isometric RPG classics remain intact. Expect repetition, a relentless onslaught of enemies, lots of useless loot, and sharp, frustrating spikes in difficulty, particularly towards the last 25% of the game.While this does stick to a classic (and some might say tired) formula, the depth of the skill trees, the frequent validation by achievements, and the sheer personality of the characters and the world keep me playing onwards. Even with any gripes I have towards genre, I'd recommend this for full price, as the sheer depth of content will surely leave you feeling satisfied with your purchase. I hear that the sequel is even better, and I can't wait to play it!			"

												This game is indeed pretty incredible, both in its amount of bugs (many still being patched as of when I played through it, and the devs are very willing to patch in fixes to busted save files and such if you ask on their boards), and how fun it is. It's basically an indie Diablo clone, but focusing much more on story and banter between the main character and his ghostly companion than is typical for the genre. To some degree, it ended up reminding me more of Dragon Age than a normal action RPG.I really enjoyed my playthrough with Umbaglo and would highly recommend this to anyone who likes action RPGs and is willing to put up with its slightly wonky design and the mass of hilarious bugs it suffers from. It's not super long (15-20 hours) and not as focused on playing through the same content 3+ times as many action RPGs, as well, so it's also not a huge expenditure of time to play through, while still being a satisfying length.

												This game. Buy it. It's worth the full asking price - and that's high praise coming from me. The story is fantastic, drawing you in and making you want to play more just to find out what comes next. The music is soulful, and haunting; the graphics quite good. The game itself plays like Diablo and Torchlight, so if you've played either, you shouldn't have any problems with the controls and skill trees. The references to memes, other games, and popular culture are wide spread in this game. Everything from Ghostbusters to Portal and many more are alluded to here. The only gripe that I have about the game is that the end boss was too easy to beat. I had more difficulty beating a lower level boss than I did the final one. But then, I did play single player and on easy difficulty, which probably affected things a bit. My next play through will be multiplayer and on a higher difficulty setting, so it should be a bit more challenging the next time through. Again, this game is highly recommended.			"

												It's a fun game by itself but once you start comparing it to other ARPGs, Van Helsing doesn't quite match up.  The single player can be fun and monsters challenging but there are only so many play styles that will work.  With online co-op mode you might be able to specialize, but that is if you can even get online to work. Co-op frequently disconnected even after configuring everything.  If your looking for more diversity from a cookie-cutter dungeon style ARPG, look else where.  The limited abilities/spells also takes away from what this game could be.  For the price it's hard not to compare it to Path of Exile, and come up wanting with Van Helsing.tldr; Buy it for the single player, not the co-op, but don't spend more than $5.			"

												This game is a decent time killer and worth a sale price of about $5, but not really more than that. I'm gonna mark it as ""Not Recommended"" only because even though it is fun, has some decent comedy, and has very good intentions, there are just too many little issues to recommend someone buy this:1. The game has a massive bug with newer operating systems that causes it to crash every 15 mins of gameplay. There are workarounds (which I used) to avoid the crashes but it involves editing Windows Services. So if you are not comfortable with that avoid the game entirely.2. Some bugs remain even nearly 4 years after release date. It's sad because the developers seem active in the community, but are either unwilling or unable to fix glaring issues in the game. Nothing game-breaking, but definitely frustrating.3. The loot system is not very well balanced. It just tosses GOBS of loot at you constantly and you have to figure out which piece is good for your build. It's not perticularly hard to get anything you need ... in fact you'll probably find 12 copies of what you are looking for in any given outing. The ""Go Shopping"" option for your companion also doesn't help matters cause it means, unlike other ARPGs, you don't even have to prioritize what you pick up and what you leave behind. Just grab EVERYTHING and send your companion to sell what you don't want for you when you are full.4. For all the options they give you in character building the actual process of creating a survivable character is pretty linear. You could try and mix up the abilities but in the end you have some key things you will need and not enough points in an average playthrough to get that AND the other stuff that might be fun.5. Repetitive. Not much more to say here. ARPGs in general are repetitive, but I found this one even more so. Act 3 has some great base defense stuff added in, but it takes too long to get to that point and most people will be bored before that.Overall it is still a fun game and if you like ARPGs, have played all the better ones already, and are just looking for a new one ... then this is a good game for you. The caveat is, expect minor issues and get it on sale.			"

												There is so much incomplete stuff in this game. It's really pity. Nice maps, nice style, lots of monsters. But there are a lots of bugs, poor animation and empty scenario. The first part of the game was really promising. But it's so boring in the second half. Pointless tower-defence minigame, absolutely the same fights with new models of monsters, bad jokes and story about nothing. Critical bugs which make game unplayable. (To be honest developers are constantly fixing game, but even now there are errors.)I was playing for Arcane class, i think it was a mistake. It's DLC class and it's not truly integrated in game. Most items from quests was given for the hunter class, for example.But i don't feel be interested to replay this game with hunter or to open last skills in the arcane skill tree. There was couple funny easter eggs in game but that's all. And you can spend some hours killing monsters and waiting for a new bug, but game isn't so solid as Torchlight 2 or of course Diablo 3.			"

												If you like Titan Quest and Dungeon Siege then this is for you! I will not really compare to D2 as it has no random maps. It is a more static world like Titan Quest. It is a nice game but with a lack of characters. Just 1 in fact unless you buy dlc's but even then you have a total of 3 and that's a little shy... I had fun playing it but it will take a while before i will again. The fact that your character stops leveling at level 30 hurted and leaves no room for advancement even if you play the game again with that caracter. Compared to a Titan Quest having 9 characters that can be combined in many ways kills this one.One thing that is really amazing is Katarina the ghost that fights along your side and is the same compared to the pets in Torchlight. She is so funny, I love the humor they have put in this game and is welcome to see more like these in future.Overall it's a good game with still bugs to fix and things to add like playable characters and much more Unique items or sets. Gameplay and graphics are great and hope they keep it for Van Helsing 2 (and perhaps 3,4 and 5 as announced)But compared to a game like Titan Quest it still lacks many things6/10 "

However it has a better storyline, allows multiple builds of the main character, has cool defense missions, and all these elements combine to make a wonderful game that is a steal at $15.

												Van Helsing is a very enjoyable hack and slash RPG. It may not offer endless replay value but you are almost certain to enjoy your first / second playthrough. So it offers 15-30 hours of fun at a very low price.PS. I do advise to buy the katarina DLC. It helps to keep her alive and thereby make the game more fun to play.+ good pace & difficulty level, lovely world with plenty of humor. Truly excellent item system offering just the right amount of loot to keep you playing just a little bit longer, if the Diablo III loot 2.0 is a bit like this, everybody will have a blast. - The graphics itself are rather decent, but the spell effects are not that impressive. Some games in the genre offer nearly endless replay value, in Van Helsing that is less the case. After 1 playtrough you have the feeling you have seen it all. The only reason to keep playing is the loot.			"

												Totally awesome action RPG. Without revealing too much of the story, you are the son of Van Helsing and aided by your ghostly companion Katarina, you travel to the distant land of Borgovia to rid the evil there. Gameplay reminds me a lot of Torchlight but the level of customization is a bit higher and the skill tree provides some nice upgrades. There is also a perk system which greatly enhances gameplay imo (depending on which perks you choose). Controls can be daunting at first, but as you go along and experiment with different skill sets, you will find the best option  that works for you. As previously mentioned, other classes are only available as a separate DLC, hence you should only buy this game as a full bundle (when it is on sale of course). The other DLCs add some much needed upgrades and modifications to an already cool game. Plus, when you've beaten this game you can import your character into The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing 2 and continue the adventure! :D			"

												This video game is good. It is a top down shooter like Halo and should appeal to fans of the Gears of Duty games. Van Helsing can dual wield guns like Master Chef. The voice acting and writing are superb and highlight what a peace of trash Breaking Bad really is in comparison. There's one part where Van Helsing shoots a wolfman.			"

												Definitely better then Diablo 3 :). It's main pros are dialogues (they're funny and really well fit for the naughty adventure in style of Indy ;)) and difficulty level - it's not so easy as in torchlight sometimes you need to use your head (unless you have firewall skill :D)			"

												Its a dungeon crawler with the lore of Van Helsing, meaing werewolves, sience abominations, vampires, and kobolds. The lore and atmospheric setting of the game is excellent in my opinion. It reminds me of Diablo 2, without rune crafting, which is good since Diablo 2 was an amazing game. The combat sometimes lacks hit effects, meaning if you strike an enemy with just your sword there is a lack of hit effect/animation, however all-in-all the combat feels solid, and many of the spells have awesome animations. If you enjoy dungeon crawlers such as Diablo, Diablo 2 (Diablo 3 is crap), and Path of Exile then you will definitely enjoy this game. For those that do not know about dungeon crawlers, than I still recommend this game as it is very fun and may just be the game that gets you into this genre.			"

												Maybe I haven't played enough of it, but I haven't been all that impressed by it. It's well executed for what it is, but it feels a bit like someone took Diablo and slapped a steampunk skin on it. Since I've never actually been a fan of Diablo-style RPGs, it's not my cup of tea. Of course, since Diablo isn't my thing, either, this may well be a better execution of that style, I just don't know. Since it's not my taste, I don't think it's fair to give it a negative review.  It's very pretty, and the monsters and worldbuilding are very good, I just can't get into it.Edit 5/27/2015:I went and tried it out again, hoping that some time and different perspective would change my opinion. It didn't. I just can't get into it. A whole lot of it feels grimdark for the sake of grimdark, and there seems to be very little story other than ""genocide as many monsters as you can.""Overall, I'm just not impressed. Story is too shallow, too one-sided, and too focused on grimdark. It could stand to be a lot better. The mythology of Transylvania, the Carpathians, and the Caucasus is a lot deeper setting than this, and deserves a more thorough plot than ""kill everything that moves.""Also, why isn't there a female character option? Surely the progeny of the original Van Helsing could be either male or female and still kick plenty of monster butt.Also, I'm probably drunk while writing this edit. I feel that's just making me not pull any punches, but your mileage may vary.			"

												In the world of top down RPG's, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing adds some very interesting gameplay mechanics to the traditional Diablo, Path of Exile, Dungeon Siege style gameplay. Set in the lore of Van Helsing this game provides fans of the fiction a interactive world that they can journey through with friends. While this is just the first part of the trilogy, it holds it's own against games like Diablo III and Path of Exile as a enjoyable adventure. I highly recommend this title to any fan of Action RPG's.Check out our Streams of Epic Adventure Episode 20 for a full look at this wonderful title.

												I had a lot of fun with this. It's somewhat derivative, but what isn't these days. That said, if you've played Torchlight II, then you shouldn't have any trouble with this one. There are some definite improvements, however. The voice acting is a constant source of amusement, while the puzzles were enough to keep me playing. I'd certainly recommend this one.Edit: While I have the Final Cut version as well, I think I'd still recommend playing each episode, individually. There were some changes made for Final Cut that, in my opinion, were not necessarily improvements.			"

												There's not a lot to say about Van Helsing, either good or bad. Despite the pleasing graphics, witty banter and good voice acting, Van Helsing tends to meander on a bit. That said, it's not an especially long game, and the time-tested ARPG system of challenging combat balanced out with a need for loot that works for your given playstyle, makes Van Helsing reasonably addicting anyhow. A good game for its price, held back by its own mediocrity, lack of skill variety, and short length. Still a must play for ARPG fans who want something new.			"

												Being a sucker for top-down action-rpgs, i HAD to have this game on release, and I don't regret it one bit, even if it did take me forever to beat it. This game is a diablo style ARPG complete with tiered loot drops, character stat allocation, skill upgrades, and gems (essences) to put into slotted gear. There is even somewhat of a pet system. It is similar to Torchlight's, except your pet is your female busty-sidekick-follower. She has skills and stat points that you can upgrade, as well as limited gear allocation. There are only 3 Acts, which took me a total of 26 hours to complete on the hardest difficulty. And DAMN was it challenging at times. I experimented with various builds (its easy to respec your character stats AND skills) until I found the right one to deal with huge hoards of mobs. You are going to be dealing with a screen full of enemies for most of this game, and they're going to want to kill you. Combat ended up being me running in to nuke a hoard of enemies, using potions, and kiting back until potion cooldowns were up. Rinse and repeat. It sounds bad, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. IT was only this difficult because I was playing on the hardest difficulty. I prefer games of this genre to be challenging as hell.The story isn't anything spectacular, but the dialogue between the main character and his follower always made me smile. There is plenty humor in their banter, as well as the occaisional referential humor with quests.  I didn't try the multiplayer because I heard it was buggy. The graphics are ok and the music suits the game's style. TLDR: Great game. I recommend it to every fan of the Diablo genre.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is just another adventure RPG, hack, slash and loot game. I’m not a huge fan of inventory management, item optimisation and and choosing powers for that .03% increase in critical hit damage. Regardless, Van Helsing is a hack, slash and loot game that I thoroughly enjoyed, more so than I ever enjoyed Diablo, Sacred, Torchlight, or any other game from that genre that has been released in my memory.The over-complicated combat system isn’t inaccessible, it’s just a little unnecessary. The powers and skills themselves were fun to use and you leveled up at a good pace which means you were never far off your next skill or upgrade. The graphics are very good with some interesting and organic level designs which you don’t get often in these type of games. Though I find that all of Neocore’s games, while having good graphics, always seem to look foggy, like you’re playing the game through a haze.Van Hesling is one of the better ARPG adventure games I've played in a long time, the first one I've finished since Diablo II. It sets up for the sequel nicely, is fast-paced and has enough content to avoid grinding. Highly recommend it for any fan of hack, slash and loot games.For full review, visit:https://icarusreviews.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=984&action=edit&message=1 "

												Finished the story in around 10 hours on Normal with the Tathurmage and also tried to play with the other classes a little bit.Gameplay is a hit and miss. Point is you have to just kill the enemies before they get close, doesn't get any deeper than that. Some skills are OP, some are completely useless. Katarina can't tank because I do all the aggro. Lack of enemy variety. Skills don't feel that they have much impact (read=no flashy visual effect). etc etcThe atmosphere overall is good, though. I like the dialogue, music, and the environment, although don't expect anything close to AAA games' assets, but it's entertaining enough.I guess it's an okay game if you get it on a sale for around 2 dollariroos.Not a fan of ARPGs?

												I was surprised by this title. It is reasonably well put together and enjoyable with great quips from the characters as you meander through the world. The quests are reasonable, although standard and they have a few scattered in the world as well. It is a bit more static than other games of this nature (At least up to the point I played) and I don't find the classes particularly gripping. The melee combat oriented Hunter, particularly, seems wildly unbalanced compared to the fellow wandering around with a flamethrower and his eyes closed and the purple outfit of the mage class just makes it something I want to put away.  It is worth a play, but only really if you're a Van Helsing fan or a regular ARPG type fanatic. "

												This is a solid Diablo-esque hack'n'slash game. Well worth the budget price. My only complaint is it falls victim to the Portal reference plague in the too late for a Portal reference world we live in. It's very misable so I'm not holding it against it too harshly. Surprisingly good humor otherwise going on in this one.			"

												Entertaining writing, an interesting setting and some clever game mechanics (especially the companion system) help this ARPG rise well above the pack. It could explain some of its gameplay a little better, and some aspects don't work quite as well as they should, but the positives far outweigh the negatives.			"

												Okay, another game off my chest. Time logged? 28 hours - roughly 2 days of nonstop gaming. Compared to TL2/D3/Titan Quest, I would probably rank this behind TQ and quite far from TL2 or D3. I spent most of the time doing a few things. Reading the scripts, listening to the music, kiting, checking loot and constantly reading online to understand more on the game. The kiting part annoyingly reminds me of my D3 monk before I quit D3 entirely.Pros:*Script lines that are worth reading from time to time (Katarina and Helsing Jr. was fun to listen to)*Tower/castle defense game was fun and rather cool albeit short (it could be better but oh well)*Music by itself is enchanting and very well matched with the game theme (it comes with the game, I know cause I just copied them out)*Rage points/factor makes the gameplay more interestingCons:*Creeps are not respawned (limiting the farming/looting activities which is very funny considering the game is supposedly about loot and if you really must farm, the developer said that you need to either join a MP game and then go offline or play scenario mode instead)*Lack of explanation on some portion of the game that forces you to Google it instead (e.g. WTF is scenario mode, or what differences does it make if I go online/offline???)*Not much to replay again unless you want to farm achievements or try out the different skill build (which is rather bland/limited if not thanks to the rage usage)*I hate the abrupt ending (developer said that there are future incoming chapters to the game, I say ""You should have told me earlier and you could at least end this chapter on better note"")Summary:Worth the $15 (even better when discounted) but don't expect a TL2 quality type of game, it isn't. A bit glitchy/laggy and I got a random creep stuck halfway in the dungeon = unable to proceed with quest until I went back to kill it. Personal advice, play more on melee too (it will be painful but at least the crowd control is better and you will have more fun).			"

												   One of those rare instances where the zerg rush has been perfected outside of an RTS. The first in a trilogy of games, Van Helsing's Hack and Slash adventure offers some surprisingly diverse game play, witty banter, teeth grinding moments, and an overall good experience in one package.    The game allows for easy switching between ranged and melee attacks. You're ghostly companion is also useful, as well as buffs you. The game itself is well done, with a pletora of items, stats, askills, and abilities to tweak to your hearts content. It also gives you the ability to adjust your stats and skills (for a price) so you don't have to worry about making a mistake in your build. The story is also interesting, with some good humour written into it.   The game itself is a little buggy. Music tends to dissapear at times, and the melee skill habitually dissapeared, very annoying during a fight. Even on normal, enemy density is quite large in some areas, resulting in the veritable zerg rush that can quickly get you killed if your not ready for it. While it does force you to put some thoughts into tactics, it can also be quite annoying at times (waaaaaay too much zerg on the last boss).    The other potential issue, is that the other two classes, and the ability to manually level your companion, have to be acquired via dlc.    Overall however, this was an excellent and enjoyable game that is worth trying if you are into diablo-esque games (though you may want to try and pick it up on sale so you can get the all the dlc at a good price). Looking forward to playing th next two parts in the series to see how the plot will thicken.			"

												If ur a vampire, monster hunter or demonic slayer, this game will give u that, it has a great story line that is well writen and does pull u in and makes u feel as if u are a vampire slayer urself, the game itself holds alot of fun of countless slaying of monsters with a variety of ways to do it. The Vampire slayer Van Helsing is the most badass dude, and like me i am a big fan. I would recommened this game to anyone. I enjoyed playing it to the end and was sad to see it finished, will definatly play the second one and enjoy it as much as this and will buy the DLC's to even open up more for me to play the story again with a diffrent class XD, and also the art and terain and the scenary is amazing, if u are into that type of style which ever century it is from.

												     I really love this game. One playthrough takes about 21 hours if you don't rush and do all of the side quests. There are three character types to choose from. You get a ghost companion named Katarina who follows & destroys enemies with you. It is action packed, has a good plot. There is just mob after mob to get to where you need to go. I would compare it to FATE, except this has way better graphics. It also has pretty good variation in the mosters you battle. There are also side quests that add to the experience. It's different than most RPG's and honestly, especially if it's on sale, you just should try it out.			"

												It is a very fun Diablo-style ARPG with lots of interesting mechanics and a lot of secrets hidden everywhere. It is surprisingly good and it surpassed my expectations. I would give it an 8/10 because it has some flaws which are to be expected in those type of games like dozens of powerful enemies ganking up on you or the feeling of not knowing what your doing. But at least it is a quite forgiving game in some respects which makes up for the little flaws.			"

												Despite a number of issues, this game is well enough. I purchased this game when it was on sale, so I don't have much to regret even if i didn't like it. The enemies are interesting, but eventually recolors. The lack of true screen control makes it hard to see enemies before you just run into them if you are headed south. The powers can be annoying to switch between, but a few interesting functionalities of 'set combos' and Rages save it; even though i never used either i can recognize its usefulness. All in all, i recommend this game for solo and multiplay for those who like top-down hack n' slash. Though, if you do not like the aesthetic of gothic victoria, then i recommend you just move onto torchlight. this game has ntohing to hold you.			"

												Tikrai vertas dėmesio žaidimas ARPG fanams. Tuo labiau žinant, kad jų šiais laikais labai nedaug ir išeina... Platus veikėjo tobulinimas: pačiam galima keisti statsus, kažkas panašaus į ""skill tree"", kuris susideda iš melee, ranged (šautuvai) ir magijos, visokie papildomi active/passive skillai ir beabėjo kalnai skirtingų itemų. Patiko kartais net juokingi dialogai su kitais NPC ar savo kompanjone, kuri yra išties naudinga (taip pat turi savo stat point'us, skill tree). Pirmą kartą įsijungęs nusprendžiau žaist ant HARD, tai galiu pasakyt, kad buvo tikrai nelengva iš pradžių kol pripratau... Na ir dabar nelengva. :D Žaidimas naudoja kiek kitokia skill sistemą nei įprasta QWER ar 1234, bet ją jau pamatysit patys (daug aiškint ir dar aišku nesuprasit nepamatę). :DŽodžiu, šitą rekomenduoju visiem fanam.

												Excellent action/adventure game in the spirit of Diablo II. Solid story, very fun NPC interaction, interesting monsters.  Skill tree is intuitive and combat has lots of options without requiring a massive amount of complexity.  The DLC as not been to my preference, but you should check that out on your own to decide.  The multiplayer really reminds me a great deal of Diablo II.Very playful, fun and very entertaining.  It took about 20 minutes to come up to speed, then 15 minutes to adapt the controls and options to my preferences, and then I was off to the races.  The skill trees are varied enough to allow for multiple character ""classes"" and then the 2 DLC options are also available.  The equipment has a wide range of randomized enchantments, with an additional enchant and ""gem slots"" available.Well designed, the gameplay is fluid and easy without being dull.  The story is strong and compelling, but leaves a bunch of exploration options so it does not feel railroaded.I recommend to anyone who enjoys fantasy action games.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing Complete Pack is a beautiful, isometric action-rpg that provides a challenging experience which has a sense of humor, an interesting companion system, satisfying combat, very buggy controller support, and some noteworthy differences from the base version.There's a lot of quirky referential humor in the game that I do not want to spoil here. Just make sure to explore everywhere and talk to everyone and... everything, especially in the first town. The world is not grim dark; it has a joke or two up its sleeve.Katarina, Van Helsing's companion, is very helpful and has very interesting ways to alter her behavior to fit your play style. She will level up with you and has her own set of skills, two with the DLC. You can also choose three different states for her which include ghost (peaceful), melee, and ranged. You can alter how aggressive she is with enemies. She can also pick up different items of varying rarities automatically according to player desires. I had her pick up all the gold, ignore the white items, pick up the magic items, and fight enemies in melee form. It is a neat feature that is greatly appreciated and should be present in more games with companions/followers.The combat requires you to pay attention and engage its systems if success interests you. The game has a combo system that alters how a skill can be used. For example, Earthquake, a spell that deals damage in a line, has three different power-ups that can be used in a combo: Brutal Stomp which adds 1.5 meters to the skill's width, Intense Shockwave which adds 30% more damage, and Scorching Fumes which burns everything hit for 10% of Van Helsing's Spellpower. You can spend skill points on the ones you want and organize them in whatever order. You stack up to three combos with the a, s, and d keys resulting in a very powerful skill waiting to be used. I went with 90% additional damage for Earthquake with a high critical chance build to great effect. I could have gone with 1.5 meters to width and 60% additional damage. Other skills have different power-ups available for experimentation. You will be working with Katarina to dispose of monsters while using tricks to change the flow of battle. I often used the one that freezes time to give myself a chance to observe the situation and line up Earthquake perfectly, especially when fighting extremely large groups.This game will test the average player's abilities, but the systems it has in place makes it forgiving and approachable. Despite dying a good dozen or so times during my time with the game, I only had to pay a bit of gold to resurrect and continue the battle against evil. There are also special npcs in towns that can refund skill points for both the player and Katarina should you want to try a different build or made a mistake in your allocations.Do not use a controller with this game. Playing this game with a controller resulted in a frustrating battle with the user interface. Looking at the skill power-ups wouldn't work for skills at the bottom of the page and laying down certain traps did not turn out very well. The combat experience works well enough, but the UI problems are severe enough to just stick with mouse and keyboard. The UI for mouse and keyboard results in faster interactions for everything and lets you properly look at all the information available. I spent fifteen hours with this game using the controller until I finally decided to stop torturing myself. The last four hours were blissful.Finally, the complete pack comes with three different pieces of DLC which includes an additional skill tree for Katarina known as Blue Blood and two more classes, Thaumaturge and Arcane Mechanic. The Blue Blood tree has some really powerful abilities that drastically change Katarina's performance. She could rival me in power and I do not know what I would have done without her. Blue Blood allows for major damage, health, and defense increases. It also gives her different passive spells that she can activate based on chance or even death for one of them (big explosion). It even adds an often used Trick called Ghostly Mirage which allows for two Katarina illusions that can deal damage. The two extra classes, basically a mage and a scientist/engineer, have one main skill tree and a heavily modified Tricks tree allowing for a different experience from the Hunter who wields swords and/or pistols with some magic. If the classes do not interest you, I still heavily recommend Blue Blood unless you want an extra challenging experience.The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a good action-rpg that should entertain those familiar with the genre. Again, I am heavily recommending to not use a controller with this game.			"

												Played this game a bit now, got it on sale, but honestly it would have been worth it even if it wasn't. The game maps are expansive, detailed, and fun to run through. There is a good mix of character types and abilities, so you can certainly play to a specific style you prefer.There were some issues, one in particular, is a blank loading screen that occurs when setting the game is set to windowed mode (black screen would load and game would be unplayable). However, the fix to this was simple enough, load the game from its binary (/steamapps/common/<gameloc>) and set back to full screen, and everything was back up and running.Another issue was being unable to change camera angles, being unable to do so, was a bit off-putting but certainly not enough to keep me from enjoying the rest of the gameplay.As it stands I do highly recommend this game, as it is highly enjoyable and by and large well designed – overall, it was certainly an enjoyable experience.

												In a market filled with many games focused in loot and quests it may be hard for some games to get the recognition they deserve and with The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing I can honestly say that it was such a pleasant surprise that I hope it’s not something to go under your radar. As you can expect, you plan as Van Helsing while also having with your ghost friend and companion Lady Katarina. The world from the game is a mix of wilderness in forests, swamps and secret lairs with a combination of cities inspired by the gothic architecture that blends perfectly with the theme of Van Helsing. The Story is easy to follow and it is told in a very casual manner without taking itself too seriously by adding one little joke here and there. As you advance in your main story you will be asked to do another tasks, which, while entirely optional they are highly recommended to do since it will show you different enemies and different worlds. The best part of doing these side quests was that, not once I felt overwhelmed with a ridiculous amount of tasks to do, it’s just about the right amount of content if you just want to play a 20 hour long game without the need to grind by keep killing the same old monsters or soldiers over and over again. With the option to choose between a more ranged or melee approach to kill your enemies, the variety in the customization is also a pleasant surprise. Depending on the style you choose how you want to engage your enemies you can engage them from far or close and personal so it’s really up to you how to tackle them. There’s also a decent selection of Auras, Skills and other powers and abilities for you to explore and learn as you level up. Lady Katarina, your companion, is also customizable and you can even order her on how to approach your enemies as well what to you want her to do. She can attack from close or long range, focus on the weakest enemies or on those harming you not to mention you can ask her to go sell your unwanted loot or even to buy some health and mana potions, saving plenty of time to explore a bit while she’s shopping for you. It’s a very easy-to-follow game and fairly enjoyable. I never felt frustrated or bored and the game did not felt repetitive, something that may be common in these types of games. I had an enjoyable experience from start to finish while listening the pleasant soundtrack and the funny sayings from lady Katarina from time to time.  "

												Maybe I haven't played enough of it, but I haven't been all that impressed by it. It's well executed for what it is, but it feels a bit like someone took Diablo and slapped a steampunk skin on it. Since I've never actually been a fan of Diablo-style RPGs, it's not my cup of tea. Of course, since Diablo isn't my thing, either, this may well be a better execution of that style, I just don't know. Since it's not my taste, I don't think it's fair to give it a negative review.  It's very pretty, and the monsters and worldbuilding are very good, I just can't get into it.Edit 5/27/2015:I went and tried it out again, hoping that some time and different perspective would change my opinion. It didn't. I just can't get into it. A whole lot of it feels grimdark for the sake of grimdark, and there seems to be very little story other than ""genocide as many monsters as you can.""Overall, I'm just not impressed. Story is too shallow, too one-sided, and too focused on grimdark. It could stand to be a lot better. The mythology of Transylvania, the Carpathians, and the Caucasus is a lot deeper setting than this, and deserves a more thorough plot than ""kill everything that moves.""Also, why isn't there a female character option? Surely the progeny of the original Van Helsing could be either male or female and still kick plenty of monster butt.Also, I'm probably drunk while writing this edit. I feel that's just making me not pull any punches, but your mileage may vary.			"

												An RPG, much like Diablo II, which offers another world of Van Helsing, rich in graphic, good in sounds and gameplay experience.A good storyline and talent management. You get a ghost companion (Katarina) who can evolve to battle mode or support mode, interesting. Graphic is really good, love the ambiance. The multiplayer is quite glitched.NB : Just play the normal difficulty so you're not stuck too long in game ~.~Overall : 4/5			"

												Finished the story in around 10 hours on Normal with the Tathurmage and also tried to play with the other classes a little bit.Gameplay is a hit and miss. Point is you have to just kill the enemies before they get close, doesn't get any deeper than that. Some skills are OP, some are completely useless. Katarina can't tank because I do all the aggro. Lack of enemy variety. Skills don't feel that they have much impact (read=no flashy visual effect). etc etcThe atmosphere overall is good, though. I like the dialogue, music, and the environment, although don't expect anything close to AAA games' assets, but it's entertaining enough.I guess it's an okay game if you get it on a sale for around 2 dollariroos.Not a fan of ARPGs? Then don't waste your time.			"

Fans of the Torchlight series should feel right at home here with the pet mechanics, gambling, enchanting, and various secrets (and sometimes surprisingly deep) secrets scattered across the level.  If you can look past some of the early bugs, I'd highly recommend checking this one out. P.S. Thanks steagle.			"

This is what I really wanted out of Diablo III, and I found it at 1/4 the cost. If you are a fan of Action/RPG ala Torchlight, Titan Quest, and Diablo, you will absolutely love this one. It is a steal at the current price, but you just know the Steam Summer Sale is coming soon and it will most likely be featured.			"

												In a market filled with many games focused in loot and quests it may be hard for some games to get the recognition they deserve and with The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing I can honestly say that it was such a pleasant surprise that I hope it’s not something to go under your radar. As you can expect, you plan as Van Helsing while also having with your ghost friend and companion Lady Katarina. The world from the game is a mix of wilderness in forests, swamps and secret lairs with a combination of cities inspired by the gothic architecture that blends perfectly with the theme of Van Helsing. The Story is easy to follow and it is told in a very casual manner without taking itself too seriously by adding one little joke here and there. As you advance in your main story you will be asked to do another tasks, which, while entirely optional they are highly recommended to do since it will show you different enemies and different worlds. The best part of doing these side quests was that, not once I felt overwhelmed with a ridiculous amount of tasks to do, it’s just about the right amount of content if you just want to play a 20 hour long game without the need to grind by keep killing the same old monsters or soldiers over and over again. With the option to choose between a more ranged or melee approach to kill your enemies, the variety in the customization is also a pleasant surprise. Depending on the style you choose how you want to engage your enemies you can engage them from far or close and personal so it’s really up to you how to tackle them. There’s also a decent selection of Auras, Skills and other powers and abilities for you to explore and learn as you level up. Lady Katarina, your companion, is also customizable and you can even order her on how to approach your enemies as well what to you want her to do. She can attack from close or long range, focus on the weakest enemies or on those harming you not to mention you can ask her to go sell your unwanted loot or even to buy some health and mana potions, saving plenty of time to explore a bit while she’s shopping for you. It’s a very easy-to-follow game and fairly enjoyable. I never felt frustrated or bored and the game did not felt repetitive, something that may be common in these types of games. I had an enjoyable experience from start to finish while listening the pleasant soundtrack and the funny sayings from lady Katarina from time to time.  "

												Being a sucker for top-down action-rpgs, i HAD to have this game on release, and I don't regret it one bit, even if it did take me forever to beat it. This game is a diablo style ARPG complete with tiered loot drops, character stat allocation, skill upgrades, and gems (essences) to put into slotted gear. There is even somewhat of a pet system. It is similar to Torchlight's, except your pet is your female busty-sidekick-follower. She has skills and stat points that you can upgrade, as well as limited gear allocation. There are only 3 Acts, which took me a total of 26 hours to complete on the hardest difficulty. And DAMN was it challenging at times. I experimented with various builds (its easy to respec your character stats AND skills) until I found the right one to deal with huge hoards of mobs. You are going to be dealing with a screen full of enemies for most of this game, and they're going to want to kill you. Combat ended up being me running in to nuke a hoard of enemies, using potions, and kiting back until potion cooldowns were up. Rinse and repeat. It sounds bad, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. IT was only this difficult because I was playing on the hardest difficulty. I prefer games of this genre to be challenging as hell.The story isn't anything spectacular, but the dialogue between the main character and his follower always made me smile. There is plenty humor in their banter, as well as the occaisional referential humor with quests.  I didn't try the multiplayer because I heard it was buggy. The graphics are ok and the music suits the game's style. TLDR: Great game. I recommend it to every fan of the Diablo genre.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is just another adventure RPG, hack, slash and loot game. I’m not a huge fan of inventory management, item optimisation and and choosing powers for that .03% increase in critical hit damage. Regardless, Van Helsing is a hack, slash and loot game that I thoroughly enjoyed, more so than I ever enjoyed Diablo, Sacred, Torchlight, or any other game from that genre that has been released in my memory.The over-complicated combat system isn’t inaccessible, it’s just a little unnecessary. The powers and skills themselves were fun to use and you leveled up at a good pace which means you were never far off your next skill or upgrade. The graphics are very good with some interesting and organic level designs which you don’t get often in these type of games. Though I find that all of Neocore’s games, while having good graphics, always seem to look foggy, like you’re playing the game through a haze.Van Hesling is one of the better ARPG adventure games I've played in a long time, the first one I've finished since Diablo II. It sets up for the sequel nicely, is fast-paced and has enough content to avoid grinding. Highly recommend it for any fan of hack, slash and loot games.For full review, visit:https://icarusreviews.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=984&action=edit&message=1 "

												Van Helsing seemed like a pretty unoriginal but promising Diablo clone, but late in to the game tremendous technical issues caused constant CTDs (these are known issues - check the Steam discussions for proof of how common they are) and these literally prevented me from finishing the game. I couldn't have even if I'd wanted to. What's worse is that these are not new issues. These are known problems that the developer acknowledged but never bothered to fix.I will never buy another Neocore product again, not even on sale (which is how I purchased Van Helsing), and I do not wish their studio well. This needed major technical attention that it did not receive.			"

Platus veikėjo tobulinimas: pačiam galima keisti statsus, kažkas panašaus į ""skill tree"", kuris susideda iš melee, ranged (šautuvai) ir magijos, visokie papildomi active/passive skillai ir beabėjo kalnai skirtingų itemų. Patiko kartais net juokingi dialogai su kitais NPC ar savo kompanjone, kuri yra išties naudinga (taip pat turi savo stat point'us, skill tree). Pirmą kartą įsijungęs nusprendžiau žaist ant HARD, tai galiu pasakyt, kad buvo tikrai nelengva iš pradžių kol pripratau... Na ir dabar nelengva. :D Žaidimas naudoja kiek kitokia skill sistemą nei įprasta QWER ar 1234, bet ją jau pamatysit patys (daug aiškint ir dar aišku nesuprasit nepamatę). :DŽodžiu, šitą rekomenduoju visiem fanam.

												If you want more from your regular hack-n-slash RPG than just... well, hack and slash monsters and demons; that is, if you also want some good story, beautiful looking landscapes, and a dense and unique atmosphere, then this one could be for you, since it possesses all these properties. But... who knows for sure? Maybe you want even more than that these days to be convinced, something new from an old genre. Let's see...Well...- How about a good - and we mean GOOD - soundtrack, that perfectly - and we mean PERFECTLY - matches with that said unique atmosphere? Yes?Check.- How about some really nice voice acting (most of the time, at least), with European accent and all? Ok? You know van Helsing's environment is Europe, right? You remember Bram Stocker? Without google, that is. I hope so.Ok, then, check.- How about some little puzzles with ancient, sacred pagan objects in the middle of some frightening bog, infested with demonic beasts trying to tear your hat - and your head inside it - mercilessly apart? How about fighting some blood-thirsty, hellish fiends that jump over you out of the blue, cause you're trying to retrieve some legendary, holy, long hidden relic? How about answering some riddles - yes, we said riddles - from enigmatic NPC's, to which a wrong answer could mean a quick, but no less painful death?Check those.- How about some funny moments that will put a smile on your foolish face: funny references to famous games, books, movies, and characters every now and then?Check this too.You want all that, don't you? Man, then this game is definitely for you! Just grab it now, cause it have it all, you fool!""Then it is perfect?"" you could ask. You know, no game is perfect.""So what's wrong with this one?"" Well... hum... let's see... Ah, yes! Some skills, mainly the melee ones, aren't flashy enough. Yes. That's it. They could be more flashy. Why not? Well, they are useful, they enhance your survivability, and they are fun to use and kill stuff with, but... not enough colourful lights onto the melee skills. The ranged skills are somewhat flashy, but the melee, not so much...Well...If that's not enough to keep you away from the game, then...But, to be fair, there's actually one more issue. Some people who played on easy or normal difficulty and rushed the main quest complained that the game is too short. They say 15 hours or so is too short. But... what game on easy or normal is not too short nowadays. After all, one one-shots almost anything stupid enough to cross one's way on those ""difficulties"". Our answer: stop playing on normal, you brainless cowards, and play games as they are supposed to be played! Your idiotic utterances do nothing but spread misinformation over the world of gaming!Just play The Incredible Adventures of van Helsing in no other difficulty than Heroic, which is the highest one, and you're on for a fantastic and rewarding adventure that will keep you busy for a good while.One more thing. Incredibly, this is an indie game, developed by some little known, small Hungarian group, and it's supposed to be the first part of a trilogy. So, give them your support for their making of this brilliant gem, if you like the game, and show them your interest in the subsequent ones.			"

												Not since Sacred (2004) have we seen a Diablo-esq game of this type. What Van Helsing may lack in overall polish or content, it more than makes up for with an incredibly well-designed combat system and genuinely witty banter between the two main characters. The plot, though incomplete right now, ain’t half bad either.You play as Van Helsing, son of *that* Van Helsing, accompanied by the lovely (and beheaded) Katarina. Even though there’s only one playable class, Van Helsing provides ample customization variety. You toggle between sword-based melee and gun-based ranged attacks on the fly, both styles with their own skill trees and magic spells. All attacks have a kind of “power up” system that lets you add extra oomph to an attack on demand, if you have enough “rage” built up. It would take too long to explain the nuances of the combat here, which is a pity. Katarina is herself, a functional and very useful companion. You decide which skills she learns, when she should be using health potions, if she should pick up items or not, if she should stay ranged or attack up close, and like the pet in Torchlight II she can be sent off on an errand to sell items and buy potions. She acts as a great counterpoint to Van Helsing’s stoicism, throwing barbed insults at the up-and-coming monster hunter, but tempered with a genuine respect and warmth.The world being hand-crafted, everything is placed with purpose. There are plenty of secrets to find, and pop-culture references to stumble across. Monsters have a degree of randomness in where they spawn, but only when returning to cleared areas. This does limit the variety when doing subsequent playthroughs some. The upshot: when loading a previous save, you’re placed exactly where you left off instead of at the start of randomly-generated map, like in Diablo III.  Boss encounters deserve special mention for being imaginative and well designed, something quite rare in the genre.But how is the loot, since that’s what this genre is all about, right? To NeocoreGames credit, they seem to have a firm grasp on the kind of granular itemization games like this need. Items come in all the expected flavours (normal, magical, rare, legendary, set) and house a lot of the kind of stats that assist in build diversity. You might suddenly find an item that makes you consider changing your entire build paradigm, just to benefit from the item’s unique properties. Items may have hidden properties as well, only uncovered once certain criteria are met (damage dealt, enemies killed, etc).Everything is wrapped up nicely in a powerful game engine with an absurd amount of detail settings. The screenshots don’t do it justice.			"

												I had a really good time playing this game. Maybe the second part of this game was a bit different than the first (let's say most of the first part of the game takes place in the rural environment and the second part of the game takes part in the industrial city part of the environment part of the city).It was a really good time playing this game. Since, I recommend this one.			"

												Played this game a bit now, got it on sale, but honestly it would have been worth it even if it wasn't. The game maps are expansive, detailed, and fun to run through. There is a good mix of character types and abilities, so you can certainly play to a specific style you prefer.There were some issues, one in particular, is a blank loading screen that occurs when setting the game is set to windowed mode (black screen would load and game would be unplayable). However, the fix to this was simple enough, load the game from its binary (/steamapps/common/<gameloc>) and set back to full screen, and everything was back up and running.Another issue was being unable to change camera angles, being unable to do so, was a bit off-putting but certainly not enough to keep me from enjoying the rest of the gameplay.As it stands I do highly recommend this game, as it is highly enjoyable and by and large well designed – overall, it was certainly an enjoyable experience.

												One of my favorite games on steam. It's combat is similar to that of Diablo. Your methods of attack are of course Ranged (Guns) and Melee (Swords). The skill tree system allows you to specialize in one or the other but also allows you to mix and match to find a style that find a style that fits your method of playing. The game is pretty long with plenty of side quests and the story is pretty good. The dialog could be better for other characters but the conversations between you and your partner are quite humorous. There isn't any grinding in this game so the game pretty much encourages you to do side quests to make sure that you're at the appropriate level so things aren't to hard. There is some strategy involved in combat so you can't just go rushing into a fight expecting to win all the time. I learned that the hard way. You're ghostly companion can also be leveled up and the game allows you to spend her stat points as you please, so you can make her a tank or an all out brawler. She also has two modes of attack: Melee and Ranged which you can switch at anytime you want even in the midst of combat. She has plenty of buffs you can choose from when you level her up, giving you more defense, attack, etc. The games multiplayer isn't that bad but it's kind of dead so maybe you might want to try and get a friend to play with you. Overall the game is worth the buy even at full price. My personal score for the game is an 8/10 so give it a try!			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is an ARPG. It's a very good, entertaining ARPG. I've had plenty of fun with the game, especially once the online was fixed and I picked up the Thaumaturge. The DLC classes are a bit pricey, especially since they add a bit of much-needed diversity to the game, but the base content is by no means bad. Just a bit limited in your character options, especially for more than 2-3 people.The atmosphere and tone of the game is dark, but at the same time it's not. The dialouge is surprisingly entertaining, but not all that great. The back and forth with Katarina and the hunter is especially amusing. There are a few other humorous characters (like the priest in the village), but no one really THAT memorable.The combat is pretty standard fare for the genre, but it's not bad, or even bland.

												Van Helsing is an arpg fantasy game set in the not too distant past. You play as the son of Van Helsing and, like your father, you have a variety of spells, ranged weapons, and blade weapons at your disposal. The story isn’t great, but it’s also no worse than the stories in other arpgs. Van Helsing, the ghostly companion, and a few other notable characters have decent voice work, but the rest of the cast is plagued by lines likely composed by the programmers themselves. Most of the locations are graphically pleasing, but some appear slightly blurry (idk why???). The-game play is smooth and responsive; the enemies vary in aesthetics and behavior; and the progression system is elaborate and rewarding. Overall, the game at its core is great, but bugs, glitches, and oversights (see comment section) compound to drastically ravage the overall experience.

												Slice up werewolves, then shoot the faces off frog demons. Fun. Appropriately challenging on normal difficulty. Don't try to start on hard (like this guy)! If you seek a challenging experience, start with normal and you'll find challenging enemies soon.It's well written. The voice acting feels right. Characters are interesting. Katarina, your ghostly battle-buddy, chimes in with witty comments or advice at the right times, and these feel welcome (no Navi syndrome here). There's plenty of humor to be found in NPCs. There are plenty of nods to folklore and even historical figures (e.g., Elizabeth Bathory).Graphics and animations look satisfying enough, as of Summer, 2014 standards. Really, nobody should expect triple A visuals from an indie title. It does come pretty close.This hack 'n slash dungeon crawler takes some old elements of the genre: health/mana potions, stat points and skill trees, hordes of enemies, ect., and adds a few new elements. Not too many, though. This is still a dungeon crawler lootfest. Fans of the genre will be pleased. As for shortcomings, I have thus far found minor ones. Few bugs. Pathfinding is a minor issue at times. There is only one class in the default game (2 more with DLCs). Granted, this one class has plenty of customization; you can build Van Helsing mostly how you'd like. You can also customize Katarina's skills and stats, allowing her to cover weaknesses in your build, or to prop up your strengths even further. However, there is no significant tutorial system except a handful of control blurbs. As for how to build your character, you have to figure that out. Thankfully, there are plenty of respeccing opportunities; just pay an NPC some gold.			"

												I picked this up a few weeks ago on sale and so far, have greatly enjoyed it.  It's an action rpg with surprisingly good character chemsitry and voice acting.  The interactions between the protagonist and his ghostly companion are well acted and entertaining.  The companion helps in combat, either through a ranged form, melee form, or passive form that grants you 10% damage resistance.The skill system (for the primary Hunter character) is divided into 4 parts.  Melee, Ranged, Tricks, and Auras.  Melee and Ranged are self-explanatory.  Tricks give you spells that don't require mana but have a timer, that range from healing, to cloning your ghost, to ramming through your enemies.  Auras grant you passive improvements to your character.  One aspect I really enjoy of the skill system is the ability to upgrade your ghostly companion.  You can spec her to have skills that passively benefit you (such as increased magic find or defense) or enhance her damage and survivabilty. Combat is a bit diferent in that you can enhance your skills with adrenaline.  Each skill offers 3 different side-grades that you can enhance your attack with all at once (e.g., +30% damage, +10% damage resistance, +10% length) or dump all of your adrenaline into one for maximum effect (e.g, +90% damage).  The combinations are interesting and even the early skills remain viable throughout the game.  Combat can be irratating because you are constantly being swarmed by gangs of monsters, so the focus tends to be more on crowd control than anything else.  As you progress through the story, some monsters are downright brutal and can kill you very quickly if you are not careful.  The story is on par for the genre and the setting, while appropriately grim, isn't anything spectacular.  There are a few bugs here and there, so be forewarned.  At times, the game will hang, which can be really annoying.  Generally it clears up but I have had to force-quit on at least one occassion.With the vanilla pack, there is only the Hunter class.  While you can spec Van Helsing with all sorts of skills, if you want a pure magic based or technology based character, you will have to pay for them in separate DLC. Bottom line:  If you like action RPGS, you will like The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing.  It's not perfect, but I think it has enough charm to help it stand out in the crowd.			"

The GoodSure, this game is YADC - yet another Diablo clone: you walk around, meet hordes of interesting monsters, and slay them. They drop loot and gold, you pick it up, and either wear it or sell it. A tried-and-true recipe with little to improve on.And yet... they managed. The ghost companion provides for rather amusing dialogue and banter, though her shopping spree quips do get old after a while. The setting is a classic, and well done, at that; the monsters are quite appropriate, and the Eastern-Slavic NPC's got at least a chuckle from me.The BadMaps are pretty much static; while loot drops are mostly random, the only thing that changes are the shrines - not their position, but only their conferred bonuses. It might not be a big deal, but a touch of variety wouldn't hurt.The UglyWithout the DLC's you only get a third of the game: one character out of three. And you still get loot drops for the characters you're missing. So if you're buying, take that into account: whatever the game price, add in the price of all the DLC's.This is not how DLC's should work, much as they often do.			"

Yeah, some hack and slash grinding, and you'll always be able to re-spec your layout, which I found myself doing a couple times until I was comfortable with my build.The music can get a little boring, the graphics are nice, and Spoiler-Free: your ghostly companion is a hoot.Recommended if on sale and/or looking for a fun Top-Down Diablo II Clone!

												THIS GAME IMO:-incredible graphics. (For notebook or low spec pc, dont worry ! It can switch to dx9 or dx 11, and has very flexible graphics settings raging from very low to very high)-Voice acting feels like a movie.-Many, many geeky jokes. (you gotta find them by talking to some npcs, reading some stuff, or passing by some areas)-Katarina is funny as hell. (She is your companion)-You are a descendant from the Legendary Van hellsing the Monster Hunter.-The game has many hidden secret, side quests, voice acting, and lore to find.-You will feel badass progressing through the game and feel more powerful. (not like some other games i've played)-Quests aren't boring and most of them are fun/challeging)-the game is easy as hell on normal and easy settings, becomes normal on hard, and challenging on heroic(which is the one i recommend).-The lore of this game is addictive and hell creative.-Has some steam-punk features which is very well made and adapted to this game.-It is a little repetitive but no exausting.-Quest have multiple ending, so the outcome might be different based on your choice.Conclusion i would give this game a 9/10.The gameplay is very good, nice, smooth and envolving music, good voice acting, great quests, and satisfactory lore(excellent beggining and ending).

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing from developer NeocoreGames is a action role-playing game, in the vein of the Diablo series. While the title's price would suggest it might be a bargain bin title, the actual truth is far different as the game contains an extensive amount of content that is polished and entertaining. While the game's scope might not be as large as other titles in the genre, the content easily consumes hours upon hours of time as gaining new loot and slaying monsters of all sorts is an addictive experience.The game's narrative has players partaking on a journey as the son of famous monster slayer Van Helsing along with a ghost companion named Lady Katarina.  Together you will explore  various locales in the gothic and magic-infused kingdom of Borgovia. Settings range from forests crawling with werewolves to dark city streets controlled by mechanized armies of soldiers. Each chapter provides the player with a hub base or town to buy and sell supplies as well as plenty of quests that require the aid of a monster slayer. While some quests incorporate puzzles and even tower defense elements, the majority of objectives have players slaying endless amounts of monsters.Much of the narrative's enjoyment can be contributed to the great dialogue exchanges between Helsing and Lady Katarina. One-liners and an assortment of sarcastic comments from each make both of them lovable characters throughout the game's narrative. It's not often in action role-playing games such as Diablo or Torchlight that the player's character has much of a personality other than their style in battle. It's a refreshing change that not just the main characters have great personalities in the game, but also much of the characters that players meet in the game's world.Veterans of the genre will immediately feel at home as standard mechanics for the genre are all in place. As you would expect players earn experience from slaying enemies and completing quests for use in upgrading their character's assortment of skills. The skill system is split into melee combat, ranged combat, and magical abilities, each of which contain both active and passive skills that can be leveled. Lady Katarina also contains her own assortment of skills that not only strengthen her combat and defense, but also abilities that aid Helsing both inside and outside of battles.Aside from completing a near endless amount of quests, players can spend their time crafting better weapons and equipment as well as upgrading their base's defenses in the game's later stages. As Helsing's role is a monster slayer, he is skilled in both melee and ranged combat enabling him to switch instantly between a sword and rifle or pistols.As with most action role-playing games, the major draw of battling enemies and completing quests is the drive to acquire more loot. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing delivers up to a degree as the game contains a wide assortment of weapons and gear to loot from fallen monsters. The one lacking area with the loot system is limited customization of the protagonist's appearance as most armor and clothing items differ only slightly from each other. The game doesn't disappoint with its visuals as all of the elements ranging from environments to monsters are both highly-detailed and polished. The variety of monsters remain satisfying through the narrative's course with players confronting enemies from werewolves to magical-based, mechanized soldiers. While the sound effects from exploding enemies to the howls of werewolves aren't anything special, the game's soundtrack sets the tone perfectly with an assortment of memorable tracks. The soundtrack works especially well with various environments in the game's world, which results in the perfect atmosphere for slaying monsters and collecting loot.It's not often that games are released containing such an extensive amount of content in addition to being highly-polished for such a low price. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing offers players both a satisfying and addictive experience over the course of its lengthy adventure. . The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a must-buy for fans of slaying monsters and acquiring masses of loot.			"

												I really love ARPGs and the way they play, that said I absolutely despise this game.I'm reccomending it because despite its major flaws it's still playable and has a great atmosphere, although you're very likely to get fed up with it and uninstall.I'll start this off by saying that all of its problems are caused by too many enemies at once, this game goes completely overboard in that department.Area of effect damage is a requirement, anything that does single target is next to useless here. The further you go into the game the larger the mob of enemies it constantly throws at you becomes, you can't even pick them off from a distance because chances are that the entire mob is going to react and come after you, and another thing to note is that your ranged attacks do not go over enemies which means all those high damage ranged enemies are safe behind the giant wall in your face. And on top of that some of them can heal other enemies, so you HAVE to kill them first.There is a perk that makes you atheral when your health runs out, you're going to find yourself getting a lot of useage out of that one. Along with that you're going to find yourself needing to heal constantly, so cooldown reduction is an absolute must so you can use heal often.I cannot even fathom playing the game class due the fact that there are enemies who drain your mana beyond faster than you can regenerate it even with mana potions, and this doesn't stop being a pain if with other classes, because all of your skills cost mana to use except your default skills.

												★★★★☆Ah, now this was a good game, the story progression is done really really well, the graphics are amazing! The levelling up system and companion all work well with each other. This is a really good game, only negative point I have to mention is that the other classes are DLC and even if you do not have the DLC for them items still drop for those classes -_- so in other words you can get a legendary weapon and be all excited about it and then you see it’s for a class you don’t even own -_- . Other than that awesome game, great side quests and choices that come back at you later on and a decent final boss, I was not expecting to be fighting a ***********-boss in the final battle in a Helsing game. 4/5!!! Good game! Buy now! Play now!!!			"

												This game has its ups and downs, but all in all, it was a good ride.The atmosphere is well-presented, and it goes well with the musical score (which is even better). If you're an older gamer, or a movie aficionado, you're gonna love the ""one-liners"" and references made throughout the game.Now, let's focus on the negative sides of this little hack'n'slash treat. Even though it's been more than 2 years since its release, there are still quests that don't work, the camera is still a bit wonky, and the character pathfinding gets a bit confused from time to time.Oh, and the ending is a bit sudden. :D			"

												I adore this style of gaming and the fantasy theme calls to something within me. So when the game on sale I quickly clicked 'buy' and began my quest as a Van Helsing. So, what did I think (and still do as I have by no means completed it)?I FREAKING LOVE this game! The theme and back-drop to the game is spot on as you wade through hordes of all varieties of mythical monstrosities.  Graphically, the game delivers well and is pleasing to the eye. The voice acting for Van Helsing and Katarina (DLC) is superb. Really well done! The banter between them adds depth to their characters and is a real treat to hear. The musical score/sound effects are brilliant too and again adds to the immersion.Character customisation is varied and gives much choice to the three classes to choose from. Each gives a different way of combating the horrors that await.Loot... oh the loot. Much is to be gathered and acquired as one would expect from a game such as this. The game is fun to play, even more so with friends (or my dad in my case) but beware, the game (for me) can get addictive. I always feel I need to keep playing just to get that next item that will boost my DPS or to see what new enemies are lurking around the corner.For all its pros there are unfortunately some cons. Certain shrines cannot be activated, instead once clicked causes your character to wander trying to find it even though it's right in front of them, denying you an XP/DMG boost. With the Arcane Mechanic class (which I play and love burning monsters with) when I click over an enemy to attack, he wonders off, not knowing where it is. A pathing issue with this and the shrines I'm thinking.The worst issue (for me) is no matter how long I play for, be it five minutes or five hours, upon exiting the game my PC shows a CPU temperature warning. My PC is not old and boasts some high-end hardware so I was quite surprised when the message popped up. Never before have I seen such a message other than playing Skyrim (with mods and graphical enhancements) for almost an entire day straight, which is justified. These issues I have are not enough for me to stop playing, but it would be nice if they were resolved.9/10			"

												A brillaint charming dungeon crawler that does what few Diablo clones do. It uses the relationship between Van Helsing Jr and Katarina to inject some humour into the genre. These two have brilliant chemistry together and makes the game a joy to play. The gamepad support is brilliant, the grpahics are nice and clean and crisp, with very few framedrops. The loot is sensational and the levels and enemies are well designed. The map isn't the greatest of tools and can leave you scratching your head, but the game does have quite a linear desgn when it comes to level design. I would rate this game 7.5/10. A brilliant indie title like torchlight, but with more humour and better character development, but the levels are a bit linear and the map should be clearer			"

												Van Helsing is a stellar representative of the action-RPG genre. Katarina, your constant ghostly companion, is a witty follower you'll be glad to have at your side. She functions very much like Torchlight's pets, and she and Van Helsing engage in frequent, humourous banter. There's a large world to explore which sports a rather steampunk flair, and it overflows with an equally large roster of enemies which take cues from popular fantasy villains, all with a mechanical overlay. (Electric werewolves, anyone?) One of my favorite features that made late gameplay much easier was the ability to reset skill and ability points for both yourself and Katarina. This allows you to readjust your stats for how you've developed your play style. Because I never focused on ranged combat, removing nearly all my points in that ability and pumping up my melee attack made what had become frustrating game time a pleasure again. Unfortunately, most equipment largely looks the same, so your character never appears visually as epic as Torchlight characters. A few times gameplay feels unessessarily stretched with a similar mission repeated or a mandatory replay of an already-cleared area. These litle grieveances aside, Van Helsing is a surprisingly great game. Fans of Diablo and Torchlight need look no further for their next fix.			"

Multiplayer has a ton of compability issues with windows 10 among other major bugs. There is workarounds in the web but who wants to go through them just to get this game working?Other than that it's much like Van helsing 2 and I did enjoy playing van helsing 2 for about 40 hours until it ran completely out of content and loot.

												Well what can I say about this game. It's fun, it's not that long thankfully because the game can get redundant pretty quickly, especially if you have Unlimited Spawn selected like I did the first time I tried and gave up. It was only after a couple of years I learnd about that option (didn't see it the first time in the options) so I went back to play it and I actually enjoyed it much better.This is what I would call a low impact game. For me, something to play to relax and not worry about multiplayer chaos like CS-GO. If you like Neverwinter Nights, it's something like the same style of gameplay. There is a lot to learn about the game but unfortunately I didn't encourage myself to learn the spells and tricks that the player can use in the game. I played straight up, in your face combat. The only thing that I found that was a bit out of character of Van Helsing is that you are not fighting many werewolves. There are not vampires and classic monsters that we all know and love, though the story is based on mechanical monsters aspect. The beginning of the game does give you that vampire hunter feeling, but it doesn't last long. Still, if you are looking for a game to pass the time, this would be good for you.As always, I recommend on buying it on a discount. $5 on a Winter sale I think I got it.			"

												Okey guys. If you like RPG's (Diablo, Neverwinternights, Torchlight, Dragon Age...etc) this game is jsut for you. It has cool story line full of different interesting quests and jokes. And jokes are really funny. + amazing sound + amazing details + cool upgrade system and, of course its gameplay. I did this game on nightmare(or whatever last lvl says), and i got tonn of pleasure. It wasn't so easy to make some quests,but that is all the point - hard game means emotional game. For example one achievement about killing Igor's (don't worry,not a  spoiler) worth a lot. You are trying to kill another ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s,while Igors try to kill you, that's unforgetable. Last time i was so happy after game'd ended - Dragon age 1-st (also nightmare). _______To summ up: buy it,feel it, listen to it. enjoy it			"

												IAVH is a fun, solid game with a few problems that keeps it from rising above a 8/10.The Good:Now with 3 character classes, you are no longer stuck with one guy that does everything half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Classes are still rather plain being the melee, magic and ranged stereotypes. The skills the classes feature are mostly unique, with a small selection of them being repeats of skills other classes have.The perk system is fun and adds a unique feel to your character. Katarina the ghost WAS a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor addition. With all the patches and full dlc I feel she is actually worth putting into combat now. Having her tank damage and aggro for me has been rather effective, rather than before when she was dying in 5 hits while being built tanky. Loot drop rate is still really high, but the loot is much better and I find myself playing just to find the next drop. I've not used the glory system yet but it looks like a decent way to keep higher levels interested in their build.The Bad:Multiplayer community is tiny. You will rarely see more than 25 games during peak time, and as little as none during others. Rarely will the games be hosted in the US region. What this means is basically if you're in the US, you need friends to play this game with. Relying on random people from the internet is merely not enough. If you can get past the glaring lag, there's still many more issues that need to be addressed. As such, I can only recommend that if you pickup IAVH for the multiplayer, get your friends to do so as well, or don't get it at all. There are also technical problems with the graphical engine. Running IAVH on full settings produces BSOD extremely often. Although entirely capable of running the game maxed, I can't because of blue screens. Games released both before and after have no problem being maxed without technical problems. This is something that can be fixed, but there's no guarantee that it will be.Ultimately, I enjoy the game and I think you would too. If you must have multiplayer, but do not have any PC gaming buddies to play with, I'd pass over this one, random internet denizens will just not be enough.			"

The same is true for every load screen (changing zones, etc.). I played it for 20 minutes or so before quitting. The game is super buggy and has optimization issues. It runs like total crap on my computer, which runs D3 at +100 FPS). In short, you can probably skip this one.			"

												This game is a real bitter sweet one. It is both amazingly creative and the most lazy game ever.So lets play the sweet and bitter game. For everything good there is almost something equally bad about this game.This game has some REALLY cool monsters. If you have never seen Teslapunk before you are in for a fun suprise, however it is overshadowed by the excessive use of them and constant combat. I played on the middle difficulty and towards the end there are enemys that just take forever to put down, and they arnt even the ones that do good damage either so you end up kiting one enemy for almost a full minute even if you killed everything else.The Enviroments look amazing. Statues, monuments, temples and even the sewer level look very nice. However the plot makes it so you have to go back and do parts of the map over again to progress the story so you start to sigh as you do a level over again.The voice acting is very well done. The problem are the constant meme, references and pop culture get rather tiring cause you have heard them all before in something with a far better plot. Speaking of the plot the game starts out really interesting then kind of tapers off and then crashes and burns towards the end. I think the best way to describe this is the final boss.When you encounter him you have your confrontations something like this:""We finally have you! Why did you do all this?"" ""Why? Because I am evil! This is what I do. Your the good guy I am the bad guy."" Granted there are tons of 007 references and many other tropy things but that just sort of killed the illusion there had been a plot for me.Overall this game really has no replay value and I cant really say I would reccomend buying it because its just another Diablo style clone.

												The Complete Pack is not complete, they didn't include the Pre-order DLCs, instead they expect us to buy it directly from them.so that is already a big minus, because it can already be called as a fraud.Pro :- Graphics are good enough.- 360 controller are supported (for those that love to use gamepad)Con :- Can't easily switch between gamepad and K+M- Combat are not fluid enough- Poor Optimization.- The game somehow doesn't want to recognize the DLCs that i got from complete pack.- Story is crap- Complete pack is a fraud because not all DLCs are included.- Gameplay felt like a chore- Max Level is only 30, for an ARPG that is a big fail (i'm guessing they want to do Borderland style of level cap, but the game failed to take off).- There is still a lot of bugs (ex : i often had my lady katarina stuck a lot of time, and she can't seem to free herself).Conclusion :If you like chores, then this game is for you, otherwise stay away, but if you really dying to play an ARPG, then this game is decent enough.Overall i gave this game : 5.7 out of 10Reason : some of the cons can be fixed, if the dev willing to do it, but since it seems the Dev have started making the sequel,  chances are high that they are gonna abandon this game.@Dev : if you make a complete pack, include all DLCs, the ""Complete Pack"" = all DLCs included, and why not sell those preorder DLC in steam store too ? why hold it back ? this game is decent, but its nothing special.

												Enjoyable action RPG with many of the same features you would find in Diablo style games.  If you're looking for a good single player story, character customization options, and all around monster slaughtering goodness then this won't disappoint.I suggest getting the full pack that includes all of the DLC as it opens up a number of new classes, features for all of the classes, some new quests/areas, and equipment.  If you've enjoyed Diablo, Diablo 2, Diablo 3, Path of Exile, or any of the other similar ARPG's this is a good one for you!Note, this is not a strong multiplayer game or something you can expect to invest a lot of time into.  You'll enjoy the story, level a character or two, and then be done with it forever.			"

												(Do note I haven't played online) This game is great, plenty of loot, abilities, fun skills, controls and interface is solid, and game can be challenging at times. Before I go into what i didn't like and the final anwser i'll talk about all the positive things. They added variety to the game with the multiple classes and the extendtion for your companions skills, the areas look detailed and urges you to explore. You can build your character in multiple ways because of the way the skill tree is, so You have a melee section, ranged section, tricks and auras as you move further down the techtree it costs more to level the abilities which means you cant just get everything. You have to plan out what kind of character you want to make allowing you to be different from other players characters. This also adds to the replayability to try new combos.After you beat the game you can play 2 other modes that extend the lifespan of a single character, trying to make them the perfect hunter, by playing these gamemodes you get to find better loot and get points to further increase their stats. The max level is 30, I use to think this was bad but as I played it fit perfectly for the content available and with the glory point system in the other game modes you can still make them better.The puzzles and side quests are also a lot of fun since it keeps things interesting.The powerup abilities for your skills also adds depth to how you use your abilities.Now for some negetive points, once in awhile buildings got in my way from seeing what was happening (they wouldn't go transparent) though this was only in a few places it still should happen. Some of the enemy champions (elites) have unfair abilities, the wall is fine since you can shoot it, the drain is fine since you can run away from it, most of them are fine except for 2, grapple is annoying and unfair, it grabs you from so far away, cant be dodged (haven't seen it miss), it stuns you as it pulls you to them, they can all cast it sametime increasing the stun effect. It has gotten me killed on multiple accounts. the other is the skeleton hand that cages you, you have to attack the hand to break free however you cant move and it works the same way as the grapple, it doesn't miss (haven't seen it miss) but these are from my experience there might be a way.The lack of map variety, to what I see the maps are static, not randomized each time.The game has some strange difficulty spikes, one moment its simple and easy, next moment you are running spamming pots cause the mobs are no joke anymore but overall it doesn't happen often.If you accidently forget to complete a quest, the journal doesn't tell you which area the quest is for, so you have to do quite a bit of backtracking to find out which can be a pain.Loading screens, it's not that bad but it would be nice if it was faster, it intrupts the flow of the game.The music is good and the sound effects are pleasing. The graphics are great and the game runs very smooth. The variety of loot, enchanting, using essences, the dialogue, voice acting are all good. the game was lots of fun to play and got my monies worth.I give the game a 8.5/10 for being what its suppose to be, to offer some unique features and have a good pace. But for the lack of replayability because of repeating exactly what you did before and the loading screens with not that great backtracking method, no randomized maps and some inconsistency. It's worth buying and offers enough and some for what you pay for.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing played like any other hack and slash game on the market.  Really nothing new about it.  The game play and progression trees are both just fine.  The story was fairly interesting but again nothing really remarkable.  I enjoyed my first few hours of gameplay but became somewhat bored with the game and set it aside for awhile.  Recently I returned to the game in the hopes of finishing the story and being able to get a full impression of it.  Alas, it was not to be...This game quickly shows it's true colors if you visit the forums for the game.  Many of the quests are broken and need to be reset using console commands to complete them.  This is just lazy on the part of the Dev. team who created a sequel and couldn't be bothered to fix the first one.  You'll also find many people have had problems getting the game to even launch...anyway from my personal experience the game will no longer resume story when I click ""resume story"" just a wonderful crash to desktop.  After spending a few hours verifying the game cache on steam and even going as far as reinstalling the game and following all steps mentioned on the forums to fix the game.  I discovered that my save file was corrupted.  I can start a new character but at this point I'm far to♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and dissapointed in the developer for not fixing all the bugs to the original game before making a sequel that will probably be just as bug ridden.Bottom Line__________________ AVOID THIS GAME.  There are numerous hack & slash games on the market that are far better so don't bother with this game it will just dissapoint and frustrate you.  It's quite unfortunate because I really wanted to like this game and was even planning on getting the sequel after finishing the first.  I doubt that will happen now.			"

												So I bought this game because it was on sale and I'd been wanting it for quite some time. I've unlocked the first two areas and have now hit lv 11 after map completion in both areas. My thoughts so far:The skill system is neither as balanced nor as customizable as I thought it would be, and the combat is what really put me off.Monsters don't level with you (which was to be expected), and when entering an area for the first time, monsters are hard to beat. Once you've progressed through the map and levelled up, it gets easier. However, a big issue I have with the game is that it throws monsters at you in abundance. You really can't help but walk into up to three packs that combine into 10-20 (and sometimes even more) monsters, and even when you are overlevelled for that area, they are often deadly. If the area is crammed and you aren't able to use the ""run away, attack, run away, attack""-method, you're dead. Which makes the game utterly frustrating and on top of that boring, because you keep doing the same thing over and over.I had immense trouble completing the second area and went back to the first one just for fun. I one-shot most of the monsters, and the only trouble I was presented with was large packs forming one giant group of monsters. Managable at this point, but still hard.What really bothers me about this is that it feels like they didn't put any thought into the combat/levelling system and just put a lot of monsters of the same level into an area. There is literally no middle ground between being able to one-shot and running for your life.In the first area I still thought ""this is only hard because I don't have the right set of skills yet"", but after several hours of constantly dying despite a proper build for my Hunter, I have to say I don't enjoy the game anymore. I doubt I'll ever finish it.			"

												This is a very mediocre ""Diablo"" like game.  It borrows mechanics from many games and does them all poorly.  Leveling up isn't very interesting because all your skills ramp down so quickly.  For example, skill point 1 gets you +5% damage (meh).  Point 2 brings it to 7.5%, point 3 bring it to 8.5%, etc...  All skills work like this, so by the time you are level 20 or so, you have all the skills you want and leveling up just seems pointless.The combat isn't interesing either.  You can buff your powers by spending ""rage"" which you generate while fighting. Yet the same thing applies and the effects arn't worth the effort.  There are better games out there.   Titian Quest Gold,  Torchlight 1 and 2, and most certainly Diablo 3.			"

Everything can one shoot you6. Some zones you cant leave you are forced to use town portal7. 60 potions will only last you for about a min8. The mobs have over 5 buffs and mini boses's have over 12... and that was all in the first area... later on they became so fast and area so narrow you cant even kite themDo i recommend this game; yes if you are bored and  got nothing better to dooh and if you think diablo 1 was hard, I recommend you trying this one out It will change your mind.I was playing on casual with a friend( who happened  to wrote his review right bellow me) and the scaling was on hard , and when we tried hard it was heroic... the expirence of hardcore is basicly right click delte save game file, because you will die on first incounter....if you are playing this for the sake of story save yourself time and patience and go watch a playtrough (if  anyone actualyl lasted for 70+h )DONT LISTEN TO THE GUY BELLOW ME  OR EVEN ME PLAY THIS GAME AND EXPEREINCE  THIS AMAZING ADVENTURE OF GLITCHINES!

												The game is a moderately amusing Diablo-style single-player romp through a ruchly stylized world filled with entertaining characters.However, the amount and magnitude of bugs in the game renders it anywhere from frustrating to completely unplayable, and for every bug they fix, two more seem to take its place. This is the biggest reason that I really can not bring myself to recommend this game to anyone, even on sale.			"

The Incredible Adventures of Van HelsingRating: 7 / 10Fun Action-RPG in a nice and detailed steam-punk world. Maps are a bit big and pre-filled which makes the pace a bit slow as you cannot 'run' though these levels. Lots of interesting loot, lots of upgrade options for skills and abilities. Halfway an interesting twist as you have to defend and expand your hideout in a tower-defence like way. Shops could be better and the gameplay is a bit too linear for my taste. Still a big thumbs up for giving me a great time. (Not finished yet)			"

												Fun but very short (took me 12 hours). The entire experience is hand crafted meaning no mob respawns ensuring you're at the ""appropriate level"" at all times. I know some form of endgame has been added since I beat it but can't speak to the value. I wasn't inspired enough to play through it again due to limited character building options compared to something like Torchlight 2 (I assume DLC helps this but again, can't personally say).			"

												You like Diablo? You want more? Then you'll probably enjoy this game too.Is the game better than Diablo (2-3)? No. It is good enough and a worthy Diablo clone? YesWhy is it good? What a Diablo clone needs is a good balance in loot drops, skills and enemies. Van Helsing has handled this pretty well. So it has nailed the most important part of the game. It also has an interesting steampunk/fantasy setting. But other than that, it doesn't really stand out much. People had a few complaints about this game. I'll address them here:BugsThe release was buggy, but with the December patch things are running more smoothly. I've tried both singleplayer and co-op and it works fine.Only 1 ClassThe game features only 1 class: the hunter. Very meager, but the DLCs adds 2 more interesting classes. Still not a lot, but it has enough differences; each class is unique in skills and style.			"

The mobs have over 5 buffs and mini boses's have over 12... and that was all in the first area... later on they became so fast and area so narrow you cant even kite themDo i recommend this game; yes if you are bored and  got nothing better to dooh and if you think diablo 1 was hard, I recommend you trying this one out It will change your mind.I was playing on casual with a friend( who happened  to wrote his review right bellow me) and the scaling was on hard , and when we tried hard it was heroic... the expirence of hardcore is basicly right click delte save game file, because you will die on first incounter....if you are playing this for the sake of story save yourself time and patience and go watch a playtrough (if  anyone actualyl lasted for 70+h )DONT LISTEN TO THE GUY BELLOW ME  OR EVEN ME PLAY THIS GAME AND EXPEREINCE  THIS AMAZING ADVENTURE OF GLITCHINES!

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing played like any other hack and slash game on the market.  Really nothing new about it.  The game play and progression trees are both just fine.  The story was fairly interesting but again nothing really remarkable.  I enjoyed my first few hours of gameplay but became somewhat bored with the game and set it aside for awhile.  Recently I returned to the game in the hopes of finishing the story and being able to get a full impression of it.  Alas, it was not to be...This game quickly shows it's true colors if you visit the forums for the game.  Many of the quests are broken and need to be reset using console commands to complete them.  This is just lazy on the part of the Dev. team who created a sequel and couldn't be bothered to fix the first one.  You'll also find many people have had problems getting the game to even launch...anyway from my personal experience the game will no longer resume story when I click ""resume story"" just a wonderful crash to desktop.  After spending a few hours verifying the game cache on steam and even going as far as reinstalling the game and following all steps mentioned on the forums to fix the game.  I discovered that my save file was corrupted.  I can start a new character but at this point I'm far to♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and dissapointed in the developer for not fixing all the bugs to the original game before making a sequel that will probably be just as bug ridden.Bottom Line__________________ AVOID THIS GAME.  There are numerous hack & slash games on the market that are far better so don't bother with this game it will just dissapoint and frustrate you.  It's quite unfortunate because I really wanted to like this game and was even planning on getting the sequel after finishing the first.  I doubt that will happen now.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a great hack and slash ARPG. It's from a Hungarian developer company called Neocore Games. The game has beautiful graphics, lots of customization and varied enemies to face off against. The early builds of the game were less stable and quite unbalanced, but the final build is very good. There are a lot of easter eggs and it has multiplayer so you don't have to play alone.			"

Dialogue for other NPCs is also stellar.   Animations are spiffy.    Creature design is spot on.    Varied levels keep the gameplay fresh.     The Dev tried a lot of different things & succeeded for the most part. Cons:   Ending is a little disjointed.    Closing cinematic & on screen action don't exactly jive.    Crafting system isn't well explained.     Still, it's quite entertaining taken as a whole.Bring on the Sequel!!!			"

												An all around wondeful game.It has a dark steampunk kind of atmosphere, with a decent story and good replayability, especially since two new characters came out.I wholeheartedly recommend getting the complete pack as it's a great value.The gameplay is really good, the maps are big open wide environments, except some areas seem a bit too crowded and you risk getting overwhelmed easily.The tower defense mechanics don't seem forced on and are really fun to do.The only flaw for me is that you are restricted to 2 spells only(with a recent patch you can use the 4 bottom slots as well,but still having a nice hotbar would've been great!).Play this with a friend(or two) and you have a great game at a great price!

												Van Helsing is a fun 20 hour campaign. The story is interesting and the strained relationship between Van Helsing and his ghost companion makes for some often funny dialogue.  The music is excellent, the mouse & keyboard controls work well and the animation is well done.  The only gripe I have is the replay value is somewhat limiting since you're tied to a melee or a ranged character.  Buying one of the two optional DLC characters helps fill out the game with more skills.  For people like me who like to explore and clear out maps, there are tons of treasure chests sprinkled everywhere.  Plus there are special ""trophy"" monsters to fight which give you an achievement and extra loot. Finally, you can continue a completed campaign in what is called ""Never Ending Story"" mode with increasingly difficult monsters.  Characters over level 30 can be imported into the sequel.I think Van Helsing is an underrated gem and I recommended it to Torchlight fans and action RPG fans in general.  Don't take my word for it, though.  Neocore Games released a playable demo so you can try it out for yourself.			"

												I always loved the Diablo type of games but it's actually pretty hard to play any other of them after trying Van Helsing because the interface, controls and general comfort of this game are just so good that you'll always want to go back to Van Helsing when you play any similar Action RPG. Be aware 'tho, that it's a pretty much a single player game since the multiplayer part is very buggy. If you don't mind and just want to have some solo fun definitely pick it up when it's on sale! The dev is working on Van Helsing 2 which will let you import your Character from the first game and by then the multiplayer will hopefully work as well ;)			"

												Having finished Van Helsing in Heroic Hardcore with melee orientated setup, I can only say that it has been a worthy and enjoyable fill to my Diablo 2 addiction. The Blue Blood DLC helped a lot to clear up later levels which previously I found too hard (completed it by only reaching lvl28). Single playthrough took about 35 hours completing about 75% of achievements (could have been higher but gave up on achievements after aiming for the ""But they are so cute! one by not killing any Igors at all, until the very end when one died by accident having forgotten to switch Katarina to ethereal). Enjoyed the good graphics, very funny dialogue and a lot of action. My only disapointment was the let down felt once completed, with only a 30sec cinematic ending the game. TL;DR: I would highly recommend ""The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing"" to anyone that is a fan of Diablo 2 type of games or anyone looking for an action/ hack and slash rpg adventure. "

												Great game, Good feeling, Just like Diablo 2 just with steriods.However I wouldn't get the game cause of all the reported problems and the Developers do not pay attention to their player base. So right now with the Steam sale November 2013 the multiplayer isn't working. It's ok to say the game wasn't built for the use of multiplayer but annoucing that there is a function for it and then later dropping all forms of support for it really shows that the Developers are not supporting 2 things and that's the players or thier games they produce.Recommendation; Don't buy this game for multiplayer it isn't stable and people say they get disconnected from time to time. (Fixed)Other than that single player is quite fun however some glitches and some performance issues have been reported so watch out.My personal rating for the game is 7.0 being quite good.

												The game is fun, but not that much of a challenge in normal mode. I topped the Max level of 30 before I reached the end scene. There is a ""crafting"" system letting you upgrade weapons and armours with powerful attributes.The environments (maps) are beautiful but not seamless. You use portals to enter/exit each map.I kept my weapons and armour updated and maxed out my primary weapon skills as early as possible and played it through in 20 hours. The campaign wasn't that much of a challenge and the supposed anti climax when defeating the last boss was more like ""what, was this all?""However, after playing the full campaign, a new mode is unlocked that gives more hardcore gaming.Overall, it gave me 20 hours of game play and after the campaign, you get bigger challenges.

												So I bought this game because it was on sale and I'd been wanting it for quite some time. I've unlocked the first two areas and have now hit lv 11 after map completion in both areas. My thoughts so far:The skill system is neither as balanced nor as customizable as I thought it would be, and the combat is what really put me off.Monsters don't level with you (which was to be expected), and when entering an area for the first time, monsters are hard to beat. Once you've progressed through the map and levelled up, it gets easier. However, a big issue I have with the game is that it throws monsters at you in abundance. You really can't help but walk into up to three packs that combine into 10-20 (and sometimes even more) monsters, and even when you are overlevelled for that area, they are often deadly. If the area is crammed and you aren't able to use the ""run away, attack, run away, attack""-method, you're dead. Which makes the game utterly frustrating and on top of that boring, because you keep doing the same thing over and over.I had immense trouble completing the second area and went back to the first one just for fun. I one-shot most of the monsters, and the only trouble I was presented with was large packs forming one giant group of monsters. Managable at this point, but still hard.What really bothers me about this is that it feels like they didn't put any thought into the combat/levelling system and just put a lot of monsters of the same level into an area. There is literally no middle ground between being able to one-shot and running for your life.In the first area I still thought ""this is only hard because I don't have the right set of skills yet"", but after several hours of constantly dying despite a proper build for my Hunter, I have to say I don't enjoy the game anymore. I doubt I'll ever finish it.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a Hack 'N' Slay RPG.You are Van Helsing, a monster hunter.On your site is a hot evil ghost called Katarina.You traveled into a region called Borgova.Something evil is happening there and you have to find out what it is.Your way leads you through cities, forests, caves and many more things just to find the person who is responsible for everything.The gameplay is nice. Its like other Hack 'N' Slays like Diablo or Torchlight but it has a dark steampunk touch.I really like the whole design of the game, beats Diablo and Torchlight in my opinion.There is an incredible amount of weapons and accessoires.The game has a typical level up system which gives you skillpoints everytime you level up.Some items are also only usable when having a certain level.Furthermore there are bonuses for finishing certain quests like killing 100 werewolves or whatever.You can choose some bonuses from time to time.Nearly everything is also supported by Katarina.The enemy varity is pretty much actually. There are several groups of enemies and those have always different levels.Masters are the most dangerous. There are also veterans and others.Also there are some bosses ingame.People in the world might give you quests from time to time, nothing special but gives you a lot of loot.Loot is the best about this game anyway. Its addicting collecting loot.The difficult is higher than usual I think, at least I died several times even with using healing mage and a lot of potions.I played on Normal. I personally skilled myself on far fight. Isnt easy though because the monster approach you very fast.The Graphics are good for a game of that sort, nothing special though.But I really liked the whole design especially of the forest.It will also run on older PCs.I also have to say that the music of the game is really nice.I read that there is a soundtrack avaiable, but only for the second game.Should include the music from the first game too, I read.The game also has some sort of Multiplayer, didnt looked into it until now though.It has Coop which is nice, I will probably try it sometime.I have to say that I didnt awaited a lot of this game but I really started to love it.Its addicting and has a interesting story and design.Definitely a good game for Hack 'N' Slay fans.I will probably buy the second game earlier or later.I will give the game 8/10 points.

												After finishing Torchlight 2 I wanted to play something that looks alike. Finally, I got this game at sale with some friends of mine. At first sight everything seemed to be great: lots of skills and branches, very helpful assistant Catherine that can also level-up and has different builds. The first negative impression came on the first location after the town. My friend couldn’t load. After several changes of lobby leader and re-launching the game, the problem was solved. Ok, sh*t happens, nevermind. After a few hours one of  the characters reached 12 lvl and 99% and then stopped gaining any experience. After re-launching the game its level was 12 and 50%. Okaaay, let’s go forward. We all were 13 lvl, killed a boss on the quest location and…a miracle! Two characters stayed lvl 13 and the third one became lvl 5!

												After finishing Torchlight 2 I wanted to play something that looks alike. Finally, I got this game at sale with some friends of mine. At first sight everything seemed to be great: lots of skills and branches, very helpful assistant Catherine that can also level-up and has different builds. The first negative impression came on the first location after the town. My friend couldn’t load. After several changes of lobby leader and re-launching the game, the problem was solved. Ok, sh*t happens, nevermind. After a few hours one of  the characters reached 12 lvl and 99% and then stopped gaining any experience. After re-launching the game its level was 12 and 50%. Okaaay, let’s go forward. We all were 13 lvl, killed a boss on the quest location and…a miracle! Two characters stayed lvl 13 and the third one became lvl 5! He got 21 skill point and was unable to put on any clothes above his 5th lvl. This time re-launching didn’t help us at all, so after this I’ve lost any wish to continue playing this “fascinating” masterpiece.

												Great game, Good feeling, Just like Diablo 2 just with steriods.However I wouldn't get the game cause of all the reported problems and the Developers do not pay attention to their player base. So right now with the Steam sale November 2013 the multiplayer isn't working. It's ok to say the game wasn't built for the use of multiplayer but annoucing that there is a function for it and then later dropping all forms of support for it really shows that the Developers are not supporting 2 things and that's the players or thier games they produce.Recommendation; Don't buy this game for multiplayer it isn't stable and people say they get disconnected from time to time. (Fixed)Other than that single player is quite fun however some glitches and some performance issues have been reported so watch out.My personal rating for the game is 7.0 being quite good.

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a Hack 'N' Slay RPG.You are Van Helsing, a monster hunter.On your site is a hot evil ghost called Katarina.You traveled into a region called Borgova.Something evil is happening there and you have to find out what it is.Your way leads you through cities, forests, caves and many more things just to find the person who is responsible for everything.The gameplay is nice. Its like other Hack 'N' Slays like Diablo or Torchlight but it has a dark steampunk touch.I really like the whole design of the game, beats Diablo and Torchlight in my opinion.There is an incredible amount of weapons and accessoires.The game has a typical level up system which gives you skillpoints everytime you level up.Some items are also only usable when having a certain level.Furthermore there are bonuses for finishing certain quests like killing 100 werewolves or whatever.You can choose some bonuses from time to time.Nearly everything is also supported by Katarina.The enemy varity is pretty much actually. There are several groups of enemies and those have always different levels.Masters are the most dangerous. There are also veterans and others.Also there are some bosses ingame.People in the world might give you quests from time to time, nothing special but gives you a lot of loot.Loot is the best about this game anyway. Its addicting collecting loot.The difficult is higher than usual I think, at least I died several times even with using healing mage and a lot of potions.I played on Normal. I personally skilled myself on far fight. Isnt easy though because the monster approach you very fast.The Graphics are good for a game of that sort, nothing special though.But I really liked the whole design especially of the forest.It will also run on older PCs.I also have to say that the music of the game is really nice.I read that there is a soundtrack avaiable, but only for the second game.Should include the music from the first game too, I read.The game also has some sort of Multiplayer, didnt looked into it until now though.It has Coop which is nice, I will probably try it sometime.I have to say that I didnt awaited a lot of this game but I really started to love it.Its addicting and has a interesting story and design.Definitely a good game for Hack 'N' Slay fans.I will probably buy the second game earlier or later.I will give the game 8/10 points.

												With the plethora of options available to the modern ARPG connoisseur, Van Helsing finds itself an average product on a shelf packed with fantastic games at extremely reasonable prices. It's unfortunate, because I'm sure this game would've been considered great in 2004-2008. With Torchlight 2, Diablo 3, and Path of Exile easily available - all superior options, and all unique from each other - the generic and mediocre Van Helsing cannot be recommended in good conscience.

												So I bought this game because it was on sale and I'd been wanting it for quite some time. I've unlocked the first two areas and have now hit lv 11 after map completion in both areas. My thoughts so far:The skill system is neither as balanced nor as customizable as I thought it would be, and the combat is what really put me off.Monsters don't level with you (which was to be expected), and when entering an area for the first time, monsters are hard to beat. Once you've progressed through the map and levelled up, it gets easier. However, a big issue I have with the game is that it throws monsters at you in abundance. You really can't help but walk into up to three packs that combine into 10-20 (and sometimes even more) monsters, and even when you are overlevelled for that area, they are often deadly. If the area is crammed and you aren't able to use the ""run away, attack, run away, attack""-method, you're dead. Which makes the game utterly frustrating and on top of that boring, because you keep doing the same thing over and over.I had immense trouble completing the second area and went back to the first one just for fun. I one-shot most of the monsters, and the only trouble I was presented with was large packs forming one giant group of monsters. Managable at this point, but still hard.What really bothers me about this is that it feels like they didn't put any thought into the combat/levelling system and just put a lot of monsters of the same level into an area. There is literally no middle ground between being able to one-shot and running for your life.In the first area I still thought ""this is only hard because I don't have the right set of skills yet"", but after several hours of constantly dying despite a proper build for my Hunter, I have to say I don't enjoy the game anymore. I doubt I'll ever finish it.			"

												I'd like to say in advance, I LOVE Steampunk games, I LOVE Hack 'n Slash, but most of all, I LOVE Van Helsing. This game is, in many ways, a fantastic one. The behavioral settings on Lady Katarina are interesting and helpful, the loot system is ok, the music and environment are great, and the voice acting is one of the best in Indie gaming history. The Drawback, however, is in the actual ""Hack 'n Slash"" part. This games Combat is HORRIBLE. and the reasons are that, one, you hold still and sit there everytime you attack which is annoying for ranged players and downright punishing for melee players. The other problem with combat is the fact that the game attacks your targets for you, meaning I, a ranged player, cannot chose which guy I'm gunna shoot at. Instead the game is gunna make me shoot the wolf instead of the wolf handler, or the boss. So I don't get to chose my targets which hurt melee players even more, because, unless they are lucky, can't Dps the highest damage monster and are forced to sit there and take hits from all the guys while they are stuck hit that Fricking wolf that deals no damage whatsoever. So those are the problems with combat. Other problems include the lack of tutorial on how the inventory and level ups and as well as specail attacks work. It wasn't a glaring problem since I am a Dark Souls player and don't need my hand held, but it took me a frustrating 10 Mins to figure out how to equip better gear. My final qualm is this. Why do I need to set what percentage of health Katarina needs to be at before she is allowed to drink a health potion? Just... why? At first I didn't know what it was so I set it to the max and then gave Katarina some health potions. We get into a fight and she downed all five health potions like they were tick-tacks. She then was complaining about her lack of Health potions and i replied ""Sweetheart, you drank those last five health potions at the speed of light. I'm not gunna give you anymore."" So that sums up why a am not going to recommend this game. As much is I like it and had fun, the glaringly painful combat ruined what could have been a really great tribute to Steampunk Hack 'n Slashes.			"

												Let me start by saying I haven't beaten this game yet, but at level 26, I'm far enough in to give a review. I'm going to list pros and cons and then expand upon them down below. I'm not really going to touch upon the story all that much.Pros:Story is alright (nothing special, but it's better than most of what you'll find these days)Nice level designGame provides a challenge (both a pro and a con, see below)Katarina is a pretty cool character Varied enemiesCons:Framerate tanks to below 30 in some areas if you can believe thatAI partner is uselessGame provides a challenge (both a pro and a con, see below)Very lame skilltree as a mageVoice acting is pretty lame (Van Helsing isn't too bad, Katarina is hit or miss and the rest of the NPC's are pretty bad)Combat is boringTo start off, you play as Van Helsing's son (yea, THE Van Helsing). Something is wrong in this city that your father cleared out years ago and you must save the day. You are accompanied by Katarina, a ghost who is bound to serve your family. She is your partner in combat and can either be a melee or ranged specialist. She also levels up and has her own skill tree.This game does a few things right. Level design is something you will notice upon loading up a new area. The areas you prod around in are generally large and look pretty good. So far I've been through a small village, forested areas, a mine, a sewer, secret laboratories, The Ink (kind of a take on The Fade from Dragon Age) and a big city. Each location has impressed me thus far. Also a plus is Katarina herself. Trudging around the game by yourself would get pretty boring. Her presence, combined with the banter she has with Van Helsing is decent enough to where the game doesn't feel so grindy. Also a plus are the various types of enemies with different abilities. The game groups up different enemies constantly, and some of the battles can be very tough.Unfortunately, for every thing this game does right, there's two things it does wrong. Firstly, the game tanks to below 30 FPS in certain areas. This is on a 4770k with 2x 7870 Myst Editions. It's happened in two areas so far. It's not in one little spot on the map, either. The framerate keeps tanking throughout the whole area. If I leave the area, I start getting great frames again. As soon as I go back in, it tanks again. I guess those areas were just very poorly optimized. Next, combat is weak at best. I am playing as a mage, and combat doesn't feel good at all. None of the spells you can unlock feel good/forceful, and some of them require you to keep clicking your mouse button to charge up a spell, draw a line on the screen for a wall of fire, etc. This wouldn't be such a problem if you weren't fighting 20+ enemies at a time, and if your AI partner was competent. Katarina is utterly useless. I thought setting her up as a melee specialist would let her tank damage and draw enemy aggro as I hit them from range with my spells. Not quite. Enemies run right by her as if she's not even there and book it straight at me. This leads to every battle turning into a StraCraft-esque kite-fest, which gets old, fast. To make matters worse, you cannot command Katarina to attack a target. You can setup behaviors for her where she'll attack your target, the weakest target, the most vulnerable target, or the target that is attacking you (which is all of them), but you can't click on a target for her to attack. This means you have to aggro the enemies yourself. Not a problem if you're playing a sword-wielding badass, but as a mage it's terrible.As I mentioned the game provides a challenge. Some of that is due to good enemy design, but most of it is artificial. Katarina being terrible and enemies running straight for you are the two biggest culprits of that artificial difficulty. Also contributing to this are some of the enemy groups you will run into. For instance, there is a part in a laboratory where you run into 6-7 Champion versions (the enemies have different tiers, Champion being the toughest) of this one enemy that has the ability to raise undead, trap you temporarily, form a temporary barrier, lay down an AOE poison spell, and an AOE spell that just drains your health as soon as you step into it. The fight went something like this. Step into area, trigger aggro on the 6-7 enemies, they cast raise undead to the 50+ rat-like corpses on the ground, use barrier so I can't go anywhere, use trap to hold me in place, cast poison or the other AOE spell on me while the rat things beat on me and I'm dead in seconds. I died 10+ times in that one place, due solely to how cheap the enemies were. This type of nonsense happens every now and again.When it comes down to it, I can't recommend this game. If only the combat matched the pretty visuals...			"

												Van Helsing gets a couple of things right: the atmosphere is great, the graphics look pretty good and remind me of Diablo 2. Having a companion who is always cracking jokes, usually at your expense is also entertaining, I thought the voice acting was done quite well.As an ARPG though, this game is a disapointment. The main campain is rather short, you can easily finish it in 10 hours. Unlike other ARPG's, there is no grinding for better items or skills since there are no areas where enemies respawn and you will have visited almost every part of every area once you finish the game the first time. There is no reason to revisit it since there is no new game+ either.The one aspect of the game that really interested me was the tower defense element. Unfortunately this is also a disappointment as it does not fit into the story well and seems more tacked on, not only that but there are only two short tower defense parts in the whole game and no way to do any optional missions at all.Multiplayer doesn't work well, I've read many reports of people experiencing bugs and I also had a couple of problems when I tried it, quests getting stuck and similar problems. Another problem is that when a person in your party starts a bug you are forced to join after 5 seconds, even if you are in a dialogue with an NPC.			"

												If you really enjoyed Diablo or those type of games, it's worth checking this game out. The developers obviously cared about their finished product.If you're on the fence or you do not enjoy those games, do not try this. The first half of the game is pretty enjoyable, but after a while you either get so specialized and good with your skills that you are ripping stuff apart or it just feels downright repetitive, although that may just be a hallmark of this type of game's combat system.It's about 15 hours long, give or take a few hours depending on how quickly you move through it and how thorough you are. I played the entire game single player, so perhaps multiplayer is a completely different experience. If you plan on playing this alone though, unless you're really in love with this type of game, do not purchase it.			"

Product received for free
												To preface this, I won this on steamgifts.com.It took me about 16 hours to play through the entire game, I found it to be a decent ARPG. The story was very blah, simple. It had a ton of action though, and plenty of different ways I could have built my character. I decided to take a brawn approach with my character (side note... I have been doing that a lot recently... my most recent Skyrim character has been brute force kinda guy and my couple newest DnD characters have been Barbarians). This maybe where I struggled a bit, as I tried to max/min the character to a bit but still tried to get as many achievements as I could. This could have definitely tainted my experience with the game.Overall, I think the game controlled great, never cheated me or anything of that nature, and definitely had a fluid nature. I absolutely adored the fact that I could send my ghost back to town and she would just sell all my crap loot without the need to stop play. I think that is something more ARPGs could handle better, is the amount of loot you attain. But with that being said, I never had that ah ha moment where I just felt like a badass that could slay anything in my path or that I really accomplished anything in general. That with its perceived that it had a shallow system of progression melee or range with a few different types of kickers with the perk system. That's why I would give it a 3/5 stars, but if you are looking for some loot grabbing, enemy smashing, you could go much worse than Van Helsing here. "

												SNAPSHOTAn uninspired Diablo clone that does more wrong than it does right. I wish I had more to say here.OVERALL - 4.5 / 10PROS+ art is actually pretty goodCONS- extremely clunky movement / combat- ability point buy / upgrade system is extremely boring and lackluster- story and dialogue are cringe-worthy- lots of loading- $4 DLC single talent treesDETAILSWhile I really wanted to like this game, overall it just falls flat in all regards. From the beginning, Van Helsing has been fraught with bugs and a lack of anything going right. To start, multiplayer was completely inaccessible for the first 6-7 months after release, and many quests were bugged such that they could not be completed. Releasing an extremely buggy game: strike #1.Supposedly a lot of bugs have been fixed in the past 6 months, but this game was purchased specifically to play multiplayer at release and months went by with other (seemingly less important) bugs being fixed, and multiplayer is still not one of them. I have seen multiple instances of it being marked ""fixed"" in patch notes, only to find it is still as buggy as ever. Even without multiplayer, there are still a LOT of bugs that are easily found that stick out like sore thumbs. On top of this fact, DLC was apparently being worked on for the game starting after it was released, using vital manpower that should have been used to fix bugs to instead leave people that bought the game out in the cold. Focusing on future profits instead of fixing buggy products for current customers: strike #2.Turns out that all of the DLC (at this writing) just adds single talent trees to Van Helsing or the companion, Katarina, for a ""measly"" price of $4. Not only that, but items in the game drop that require the DLC, WITHOUT HAVING PURCHASED THE DLC. Thinking your customers are chumps with bags of money lying around: strike #3.Ranting aside, I can get past my personal issues with the motives of developers if the game is good, but I have to rack my brain for a while to just think of something nice to say. For a Diablo clone, it has about 1/10th of the content and customization of other games: there are no classes to choose from, the default talent trees (all 2 of them, one is a melee tree, the other is a ranged tree) are not viable to split putting points into unless you're playing on Easy difficulty, and each talent tree only has 8 abilities, of which you'll actually only use 3 or 4. There is no real diversity in any of the trees, either, especially since most of the abilities and upgrades are just terrible. The overall impression is that someone put way too much time and effort into making sure no single ability was powerful, even with upgrades, causing the entire combat experience to be extremely diluded. Given that Diablo clones are all about fun combat mechanics and getting loot, that should be enough to stay far away from this game. If that's your thing, though, feel free to keep reading.The gameplay of fighting enemies is in itself a chore: any ability that has any real power to it has a long cooldown, meaning that you'll spend most of your time using a basic attack that has no real flair to it. Combine that with the fact that Van Helsing's movements cause him to spend way too much time standing still when actually fighting and you have a game reminiscent of the time when ATARI made consoles and not just games. What's worse is that the clunkiness could potentially be overlooked if the abilities the player used actually looked good when fighting, but for the most part combat VFX are almost non-existent. Player abilities don’t really stand out from the rest of the world, and are so short lived that the player might wonder if they cast an ability at all. There are very few noticeable VFX from enemies, as well, and if they didn't actually have physical attack animations then I wouldn't even be sure they were attacking. A lot of times the player just seems to take damage when enemies are around, but because you fight almost everything in the game you just know to expect it.Although gameplay isn't everything, Van Helsing doesn't have much more to stand on. The dialogue between Van Helsing and his companion Katarina are terribly hokey and feels forced at all points. The art in the game is actually pretty good, but for the most part it’s all just static environments and doesn’t really engage the player at all, making it loses a lot of the potential it had at really being a “wow” moment. Because of this, some of the environments are actually very distracting and can be annoying to try and find things in, especially if there are quest-related objectives. Sound is never really my thing in games, and Van Helsing does nothing to change that. It is mostly just… there, although the constant dialogue / noises from friends and foes alike detract from whatever potential it had.I think that covers everything, hopefully it gives people a good look at what this game is actually all about. I, for one, will hopefully not be making the same mistake twice with this company, the lackluster game and their focus on money over content has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth.			"

												okay here is the deal. Van helsing is proberly the worst of the diablo games that are out atm. The late game is very broken since mobs do huge amount of dmg and you can only use range weapens for that reason. The last few hours of this already short game, is a grind where nothing new really happends and where you just go around kiting all the time. My advice? Go buy Torchlight 2 or even Diablo 3 Reaper of souls, they are both much better and have many times more play time in them. (Btw your companion Katarina... she is really just more of a totem most of the game since she dies so quickly to anything past the 2nd act.Dont buy it, there are so many better dungeon crawlers out there.

Presently I am stuck and unable to continue due to a well known and not fixed ""Defend the Lair"" bug. I can not recommend the game at this time.

Achievement hunters will take varying amounts of time depending on what difficulty they choose at the start and whether or not they select hardcore mode, but should be aware that several achievements involve a great deal of grinding.  I took around 30 hours to get all of the achievements besides those related to hardcore mode and difficulty and those involving the greatest amount of grinding.SCORE:5 out of 10I happened to start playing this after an update that broke a few aspects of the game.  It took too long for the developers to address these issues and, even when they did, some remained.  For example, the Thaumaturge's blizzard skill is supposed to do a certain amount of damage in a small visible area on the screen, but instead causes massive (fatal) damage to all enemies within 2 screens of the player.  This can easily be abused to make every area and boss a joke.  I also found myself unable to complete a main quest because of a bug that prevents a quest item spawn, yet the only fix available is to actually type a command into the game.  The game has been out since May 2013 and the developers have gone on to make Van Helsing II, Van Helsing III, and a spin-off of the tower defense element of the game.  At this point, there is no excuse for persistent bugs and lazy fixes.Still, if these bugs were my only problem with the game, I would recommend it.  The trouble is that it's not particularly fun.  Gameplay consists of running from one mob of enemies to the next, using the same two or three skills again and again.  The game does feature a unique mechanic called Fury, which is gained by attacking enemies and spent to give skills unique buffs if the player has spent skill points on those buffs.  For example:  if the player uses skill points to unlock the flamethrower skill and additional skill points to unlock one of its 3-5 buffs, flamethrower might do 50% more damage or cause persistent fire damage to enemies if the buff is invoked.  However, the buff is also spent upon activation, meaning fury must be used to ready it again for any subsequent attack.  I found the system rather awkward to use because of all of the key presses involved, but others might enjoy it, so I list it neither as a pro nor a con.  In any case, it didn't change the nature or feel of the gameplay for me.The three unique bosses (one for the end of each act) offer something different, but only because the player has to first run around activating towers, completing a tower defense section, or destroying spawners first to have a good chance of killing them.  The developers apparently thought that the tower defense section of the second act was good enough to turn into a stand-alone game (Death Trap), but to me it seemed to drag on for too long.  It is like Orcs Must Die! (one of my favorite games) in the sense that the player places traps on tiles and is free to assist his traps in killing enemies, who can also target him.  However, the player must gather materials to place traps and also has a limit on how many can be placed.  The trap variety is decent, at least for what amounts to a mini-game, but in the interest of achievement hunting, I followed others' advice and used just one kind of trap:  the werewolf cage.  Perhaps the experience would have been more enjoyable if I had been more adventurous, but I doubt it.  The length of this section and the constant micromanagement with the player character, which I enjoyed in Orcs Must Die! but disliked here, just sapped any fun out of it.  And then I had to do it again for another quest.The story is arguably the biggest disappointment, as it merely amounts to a hunt for a one-dimensional villain who is out to hurt people.  There is no depth, minimal world-building, and no incentive to play apart from an interest in getting better weapons and putting points into skills, neither of which conveyed much of a sense of progression.  The player only gets enough points to max out a handful of skills, most of which both look and feel unimpressive, and the weapons all handle about the same way, with minimal boosts to damage as the player progresses.The cooperative aspect of the game was the biggest draw for me since I have a wife who occasionally likes to play.  Our first problem was getting the game to work:  even though her computer surpasses the minimum requirements and mine surpasses the recommended, we both got stuck on an endless initial loading screen.  Eventually I got it working, but it wasn't long before the next problem.  When we reached the second large map (Gallowsbog), the game lagged too much even on the lowest settings for her to be able to do anything at all.  I was forced to play the rest of the game on my own, without company to distract me from the game's other failures.After finishing the game, I had little interest in buying the next in the series.  After reading some of the reviews and glitch reports for both sequels, I lost what little interest I had left.For the tedious gameplay, poor optimization, unimpressive skills, and bugs that remain unfixed to this day, I give this game a 5 out of 10.

												Just aweful! One of the worst games I have played. Story is great for putting you to sleep. The gamepay is just ""Mob them"" no strategy involved at all. I actually had a group of baddies that mobbed me and I kept respawning in the same spot so it was more of an annoyance than anything to respawn 100 times whilst I wasted wave after wave of baddies. Loot drops are nearly useless, I think every 150-200 drops I got something that might be useful on another character type. Speaking of character types, you only get one unless you buy the dlc... why on earth would you want to have more of this crappy game IDK! If you are allergic to money or just like mindless clicking this game would be great for you, if not don't waste the money.			"

												A standard top down RPG with some things different here and there.From what I've played of it, the normal difficulty is more like ""very hard"" and the easy is more like ""here, take this fancy loot and one shot these bad guys"".And thats just within the first hour of gameplay (between the two respective difficulty levels).  I don't mind a challenge.  On most games I go out of my way to pick the harder difficulty so that I don't fly through them.  But with this game, I've no choice.  The standard difficulty is so damn hard that I find it unplayable (and yes, unplayable within the first 30 mins!).People have had a lot of good to say about this game, so I won't judge just yet.  But the difficulty settings so far have me yearning for something in between a normal setting that rips you appart for not playing like a pro, and an easy difficulty that treats you as a fool.So far from what I've gathered, I'd rather spend my time playing Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2.

												I'm on the fence about recommending this game, as it does have its fun points.  If the game wasn't so riddled with bugs it would be a fun enough, controller driven, Diablo light.A decent game that is severely marred by bugs, and one of the worst inventory management schemes I think I've ever had to use.If you like ARPGs, you may still enjoy this game if you can get it cheap enough.  Being able to play an ARPG on the PC with a controller is the big draw to this game, at least for me.Be warned, there are some potentially game stopping bugs in the critical path.  There do seem to be various work arounds for many of these, but it's a bit of a crap shoot.			"

												If you are someone who plays games on a MAC, do not even bother buying this game. It should not be advertised as a MAC compatible game! Neocore has known about the problems concerning this game for years yet they refuse to fix them. The game looks terrible and is prone to frequent crashing. When changing the settings it is near impossible to see the change. The game will constantly be pixelated regardless of how you change the settings. Along with the blurry images which can be dealt with, the text size is so tiny that it is required for the player to either squint to make out what is being said or turn down the resolution, and even then the situation is barely improved.If you are looking for a new game to play on MAC, you are better off buying diablo, which is ported at a much better quality. The lack of support and seeming care of the development team is obvious. This game is not worth the money and time. I really wanted to enjoy this game but the blantent lack of care has lead me to have a distaste for this game. Van Helsing 2 also suffers from this lack of support, adopting all the problems from this game.Save your money.Don't buy this game.			"

												Good for hours of playtime, but not much else.  The storyline is forgettable, the voice-acting is okay, and the visuals are pretty decent for this style of game.  However, you will die multiple times even on normal, due to the fact that most enemies will simply swarm your character.  Even after lowering the graphics settings, my computer would lag to the point where it simply wouldn't register button presses, hence my character wouldn't use a crucial potion and died.  And died.  After beating the campaign you have the option to complete scenarios (aka, recycled levels from the game) to level up or start a new game with the same character.  I tried the latter and made it a short way into the story before giving up, as the difficulty is much greater on the new game plus.			"

												It is a generic version of Diablo 3, but fun, although a bit repetative. Great graphics, but the sound is oddly low. Great music. The problem is that unlike the other 105 games I have installed, it heats up my system big time, making the fan on my gpu go nuts after about an hour of play. Hotter than even a huge multiplayer game in BF4. And it's a GTX680, so that should never happen. I chalk it up to poor programming and it is no surprise since this game is very obviously not a AAA game.It is a very fun game, but only in short bursts. It gets very, very repetative quickly. Do not expect much when buying games that are cheap, do not expect much from this. However it is not a bad game and I have fun with it from time to time.6.5/10			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing looks like a great game. I was very excited to try this, and when it came up in the recent holiday sale, I nabbed it. Before buying, I verified that the game supports Mac and controllers. These top down games are some of my favorites, and I prefer the game controller to mouse and keyboard for them. Unfortunately, it seems that Mac is supported and controller is supported, but the two together are not supported. So I have not been able to play. I gave them almost four months to patch this issue, but, while other updates have been coming out, no fix for controllers on Macs has been seen. I won't buy another NeoCore game. I find their practices deceptive.			"

												Surprisingly motivating, considering it's just a hack&shoot. Maybe it's the actual existence of a somewhat interesting story, maybe the tons of achievements.The character customization is interesting, too, though.You can choose whether to have respawning mobs or not for single player story.There are weapons that grow more powerful with use and stuff is sharable between your chars.There is some interesting variety in gameplay to shake up the relatively dull hack&shoot a bit.I play it on easy and it's still enjoyable.I got the game in a bundle though, not because I deliberately wanted to have it. Since Valve doesn't allow neutral reviews and I'm focusing on a certain downside that might be of interest to some people, I'll give this a negative one. (Really can't decide.)The amount of loot that drops in this game borders on trolling. There's too damn much loot, and the stats compare is a pain, not only because you have to do it for two characters, but because it's confusing and unreliable. A lot of the gametime tends to be about sorting out items.I think I'm only managing to keep playing it because of the achievements.(The game has a demo, so the rest you can derive from that.)- Terrain scrolling is far from being smooth. Considering the visual quality and my system, it's a bit sad. Fog even causes extreme framerate drops. This engine seems unoptimized.- Fakenook, Twitter and Youtube links on the main screen, hurting immersion. This is about as annoying as Youtubers saying ""like, comment, favorite and subscribe"" all the time.- And now the big issue right at the beginning:Rarely does a game bombard a personal firewall as much as this. It tries to connect to api.parse.com and amazonaws.com and oftentimes every half a second to mail.neocoregames.com (even after startup - it basically bombards your firewall permanently) and if you don't allow this stuff, then the game will freeze for several minutes before you even see the main menu.This is with a set block rule, mind you. And turning off my network is not an option since it's a Steam game. Unless you are willing to not care about the motivational factor of achievements. (Not sure whether they register in offline mode though. The game does have its own achievement UI.)First time it didn't switch to the resolution I selected, and since it can't switch it in-game, I had to wait yet another couple of minutes. I thought that would fix the ugly text, but it seems the game uses a web font without hinting, so even in native resolution text in the menus still looked ugly.Oh and if I alt-tab out of the game while it pauses with futile connection attempts, it might default to 640x480, requiring me to launch it yet again.And don't say ""Just let it connect."". I pay attention to what the software on my PC tries to do, since it's necessary these days.Most games with internet connectivity get the message and don't spam firewall logs like that and stop doing anything. Especially since I already have set a block rule.(Another game that has this kind of issue (even worse) is Super Meat Boy, although there the problem might have resolved itself somehow.)P.S.: The game is a real space waster. Its videos (intro, cutscene, outro) are present in ten different languages, and the difference is really just the audio track and the subtitles. Extremely clumsy way to do that. 149 MB English videos and 912 MB other-language versions. They could have used that space to provide lossless sounds instead of OGG for example.And the map files are present as separate huge versions for low, medium and high detail. Model files too. And both sometimes are of exactly the same size. (Otherwise it would probably be necessary data.)Then again, since this game has all files separately, if you need the space and only play on high detail, you can delete 6.42 GB of terrain data alone. This plus the video thing taken care of and the game has now 11.8 GB instead of 19.1 GB.			"

Voice acting & dialogue are quality for the most part, however a bit cheesy @ times. Storyline is plausibly good, unobtrusive but concise & allows for interesting main characters development. Great tunes & ambient tracks.Quite the surprise coming from a movie-to-game! Fun RPG hack n slash!			"

												It's mechanically a standard ARPG if a little on the simplistic side, you point and click, use potions, and scavenge a ton of loot. What sets it apart from the rest is the setting, style, and good voicework. The scenery is especially nice, a few places I would stop and just gaze at the scenery, even while killing werewolves or villa. The ghost companion Katarina is also nice, she's basically the equivalent to torchlights pets, just with more talking.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, I really did. Positive:-Small development team, who made a playable (not really enjoyable) game. It's always nice to see little dev teams making games.-The starting price of $15 doesn't leave a bad taste in your mouth.-Clever take on Van Helsing, with some cool concepts.-I was expecting a pure text based game, with no voicework, yet I found the voicework to be better than some AAA games being released these days.-It's short and doesn't overstay it's welcome.-Decent replayabilityNegative:-The loading times are awful, they might be the worst loading times I've ever experienced in a game. There's also no loading indicator until 10 seconds prior to the next area loads up. So you're stuck looking at a boring map for 1-2 minutes, wondering if the game crashed.-This games default settings are ridiculous and slow down the game (newsflash the majority of PC gamers don't have crossfire video cards). -I found a few work arounds to speed up the load times to about 35-45 seconds but even then this game felt poorly optimized.-I have a pretty decent rig that can still play Far Cry 3, Skyrim, and Deus EX on high, with my frame rate rarely dropping below 35-45 fps. So why the hell can this game barely stutter by at 5 fps?? I haven't seen a game stutter and drop the framerate this much since my '07 gateway when I played WoW.-Oddly enough, I did find the frame rate to improve if I turned certain specs up not down (seriously).-The enviroments are generic, the same old muddy sewers/forest/foggy forest/cave, you've seen a million times in generic RPGs.-This game takes little to no strategy, I rarely died. When I did die, it was usually do to the screen stuttering and having my character jump across  the scene do to lag or a screen freeze.-The character models are pretty dull, you fight the same spiders/rats/zombies from every RPG. Although they do have some cool looking revolutionary robot soldiers and Van Helsing himself looks alright, even if he is a walking cliché. -Also for some reason the audio cuts in and out.-Gameplay is weird, they try to be so different from Diablo/Torchlight, that they remap certain keys and get rid of others altogether. All I wanted was another hack'n'slash diabloesque RPG, yet this game tries to reinvent the wheel and ends up making a square tire.Bottomline: This game is only worth picking up if it's part of some Humble Bundle or under $2. The forgettable story, boring graphics, frame rate issues, and loading screens will have you uninstalling this monster in less time then it takes to watch a trailer for that lame Van Helsing movie starring Wolverine. 1/5			"

												Van Helsing trys to be serious with its pretty dark and grey steampunk citys. On the other hand you find a lot of humor in the characters. This works very well and gives you a good feeling while playing the game. The length of the campaign is okay with 10-12 hours. I finished the game twice, because the other character you can choose from ( if you own the dlcs) looked pretty interesting to me. Not a WOW game, but recommendable for everyone with a budget, since the game is very cheap. Personal rating 7 / 10			"

But all they have to do is put up a notice somewhere to let OS X customers know before making the purchase. That's it.			"

												It's a good action RPG.Combats are dynamic, many have an epic feel to them.However, that's the entire game - good smasher with no depth or much thought put into it: run around, kill, loot, level up (rediculous max out at Level 25).  (Try Dragon Age: Origins for comparison or Divinity II, to feel what a good RPG should be).More research into and respect toward Slavic Lore, Culture, Tradition, Mythology, and Folklore would make this game seem like it was made by serious and dedicated people, and not like it was made by teenagers whipped by the publisher to get your money.By Kiddies for Kiddies.  Half-baked and anticlimatic.			"

												A quality aRPG that is sure to have gone under the radar of many. A unique story with a follower that levels alongside you, and many of the modern streamlining conveniences similar to Torchlight 2 that have their own added intricacies. Having only one class with others behind DLC is a bit bothersome, but the standard class is versatile on its own and the campaign is a good length. Postgame goes beyond the standard new game+ and adds especially hard challenge missions to the mix.  Overall, a must for the aRPG fan.			"

												BIG WARNING! I hate to write this review. The game itself looks great. The atmosphere and especially the ghost girl Katrina and her antics are soo cute. But what put me off and ask Steam for a refund within 30 minutes of gameplay is severe fps drops and comstant lag in single player mode itself.I am playing on ASUS ROG machine which runs almost any game at high/ultra settings but this 'normal' ARPG is causing pain in the butt. Obviously, the game isn't optimized at all with respect to performance. Even the graphics, its bit strange they look absoultely great when it comes to details but there is something missing feeling. It might have to do with washed out look and fuzzyness. Many times i have to wide open my eyes to read a text or see an item clearly. You won't be surprised to loose focus on your character when he is surronded by hoards of enemies. The shades are so washed out that everthing gets mixedup quite often.If you think the game suits you, buy it by all means and be prepared to ask for a refund incase your pc also has the same problems running this.

												Would be a great hack'n'slash Diablo-clone game with witty banter and storyline if only it weren't for the frustratingly constant CTDs that lose your progress each time they occur.  Forums show many others having the same problem, and turning off Steam Saves did help significantly reducing the CTDs from every single time you made an area transition to once every 3 or 4 times, but that's still far too many CTDs that prevent you from enjoying an otherwise fun game. There were many other bugs that are unfixed in the game as well, but most of those have workarounds to resolve them in the Community Forums. I had decided to try to finish this game before buying the sequel, but never could finish because of the frequent CTDs, which honestly will keep me from buying the sequel. Truly sad because it was rather growing on me despite all the other bugs.			"

												Me and my friend were playing this game together.Often we faced lag,connection issues,bugs or other multiplayer problems.Other than that,the gameplay and animations felt very clunky compared to Diablo3 and Torchlight2 (at that time these two were it's rivals).I also didn't like how everyone has to play just the same character.In other products,you at least choose one of few characters.Only thing that worked for the game was it's setting.Seems like the series messed up more with their later installments.

												While it's fun to hear the dialogue between the ghost lady and your character on certain events, the slaying monster game play is quite boring. Most of the skill tree are auras or passives. There are very few interesting skills, which you can already tell by simply looking at the icon of the skill, the icons are copied and changed a bit for the next ones in the tree. The terrain is buggy on certain place, you're running but not moving. The environment looks nice and fresh however.Exploring the map once was interesting but it isn't worth revisiting after. The two game modes after completing the game are mostly grinding.The combat is definitely the weakest part of this game.If it's on sales and you like RPG get it, play once then forget about it. Otherwise, games like TL2, PoE and D3 are far more superior.			"

												This is a hard game to review. On the one hand they do a lot of right things and on the other a lot of wrong things. The graphics are very nice and the sounds are good. The music is awful and I had to mute it. The music loops and its not very good.  The lore behind the game is original and the quests are fun for the most part.  The things I didnt like is the game is a lot harder then it should be. On Normal your going to be running for your life a lot of the time or least I was. I would say on normal for this game would be like hard or higher on Diablo 3. Mostly its because of the lack of regen on the armor stuff.The casual mode is ok but a little to easy. I wouldnt mind something in between. The skill tree is still in my opinion is all over the place and messy to look at. I would like something like torchlight 2 or Diablo 3 more streamlined. You have auros, tricks, skill sets for melee or shooting and then you have subset skills  whithin the skills that you can activate via rage by fighting things. If that sounds confusing well it is. A lot more then it should. The Co Op seems to work fine for the person hosting more so then the joiner. I had a gambler inside my base the person who joined couldnt talk to him. A fun game but can be frusterating in a lot of small ways.  After playing this for a while I would give it a 7/10 some good ideas hampered by small issues. Just beat the game in Co-Op its a little buggy and there was some lag,  even on a lan? Go Figure.			"

												Van Helsing is a good indie aRPG. I say indie, because if this had been released from a well known publisher it would have been treated as garbage and been on every 80% off sale it could find. Why do I say that? Well first let me just say that I wholly recommend this game! It's very fun and engaging. It presents a decent reward system. The graphics and sounds go along well with the pace of the action. So why call it garbage? I didn't, I said it would have been treated as garbage had it been released from a big company. Van Helsing has bugs... Game breaking bugs wherein you can not complete main/storyline quests. Multiplayer bugs where games will just crash randomly or lag for no apparent reason or even spawn you into places where you are not supposed to reach thereby making you have to quit and return to the game. No tutorial for advanced features. Want to know how to upgrade (socket) items? So do I, go look for a youtube video, because this game honestly never tells you. The sounds, while going along well are somewhat repetative or campy. Also, the graphics, while they look well, enemies have a tendency to blend into the scene making it hard to know if you've killed everyone. It sports a strange control scheme and has no option to evade combat. If you're ranged and you get swarmed you can't run away because clicking in any direction means you're going to auto-attack. Also, if you have a controller plugged in, the game will not allow you to use a mouse and keyboard. You must exit, disconnect the controller, and restart the game.Wooo... That was a long list of dislikes! I'm sorry, but I want you to know what you're getting into if you decide to purchase this title. Van Helsing has issues, BUT the game is fun! There is good dialogue and a story that makes sense. How many aRPG's have a story... and that makes sense!? The action is paced very well and never gets boring. There are quite a few quests to complete and I never had an issue figuring out where to go to complete them. Even though there are bugs the development team is working hard to correct them. Yes there are some instances where quests can't be completed, but until that's fixed, they've released a patch where you can bring up a console and complete the quest you're stuck on. The DLC classes provide more options. I like the Thaumaturge class. I'm very squishy, but I can take down the largest of monsters with ease. So here's my final recommendation: If you like aRPG's and are looking for something to fill the gap between releases from big companies then I say grab this title. You will not be dissapointed. If aRPG's are not in your cup of tea, this game will not change your mind. If you are on the fence, just look over my comments about the bads and the goods. If you can live with the bads I think you'll find a lot of fun to be had here!			"

Doesn't have new game + or anything, only a 'scenario' mode you can play after you beat the game (which is basically some earlier levels with harder enemies).

												Its quite a good game overall. Fairly fun ""diablo clone"" but lacks to much diversity because there are only two classes (with the DLC). But specializing between melee/ranged gives varying play styles and even those can be broken down more due to more spell/physical damage style you can do. I'm only in act 2, but I've seen enough to say I am enjoying the level design and music a lot. Certainly 8/10 and  if more classes were to be added or more skills in general it could easily be 8+For 15 dollar,s you'll get your moneys worth, at least.			"

												Surprisingly good game. It's got a lot of Diablo/Titan Quest kind of vibe but they take away a lot of annoying stuff and streamline it quite well. You're instantly given a permanent pet, and the ability to do both melee and ranged attacks. Meaning that you're basically every class at once. From there you just choose to specialize, better pets, better melee, better ranged, more magical, more physical. Depending on how you specialize is how the game unfolds. It also has a sense of humor which I find refreshing and the voice acting is pretty decent. The plot is a bit weak but the gameplay, graphics and action is fun and impressive. All in all I was caught by surprise by this game and I do like it quite a bit. Fills that niche that Diablo III didn't quite fill.			"

												This action RPG is way better than Diablo 3!  The addition of a ghost sidekick really helps the gameplay as it allows the character to switch from melee to a ranged style without too much fear of being swarmed by enemies.  Moreover, the graphics and audio are a cut above the rest.  The writing is excellent with plenty of hilarity and biting, sarcastic commentary on modern-day gaming.  If you get this, DEFINITELY get the DLC as the thaumaturge (mage) class is sooooooo much fun to play with!!!!			"

												I have to say I really enjoyed my first play  through of this little gem of an ARPG. Honestly my only gripe was the somewhat forced linear progression of some areas and a lack of mob respawning mechanics or procedurally generated side quests dungeons to create a deeper more replayable experience for even a single character. This combined with a fairly short playthrough time left me feeling honestly abit annoyed considering Torchlight 2 when onsale as it so frequently goes and its huge workshop mod community makes it such a modern titant among ARPGs that should be considered by others developing in the genre.The fact you have to pay for various classes as DLC vs again TR2s active modder community and free classes to explore need to be kept in mind by would be rivals. Still I honestly didnt mind grabbing the DLC for this game as it did show enough potential I wanted to try and show all the support I could.The vibes this game gives off are honestly the best of the ARPGs Ive seen for a while. The voice acting, banter from your ghostly lady companion, the story over all has a fun factor I have to admit captured my steam punkish goth nature very solidly.To me the real hidden treasure is the eventual base you get to set up and the handful of defense events you get to enjoy. IMO these needed to be more frequent or something, the system though alot of fun to watch the creatures die in the traps  and think it would of been great to see there be a way to have endless invasion options at the end to add to extending the life of a given play through.Over all if you enjoy the various related genres, the ARPG genre, and enjoy a shorter playthrough game to see the end I totally encourage this game for a easy dif with hardcore on one and done play approach for each class currently out.

												This is a good diabloesque game with interesting mechanics and nice, but not spectacular graphics. It plays well, the combat is satisfying, but... I'm still disappointed. This could have been a cool, dark, gloomy, scary game, but instead, it's pulled down by insipid, childish, failed attempts at being funny. It breaks the mood and the immersion. It isn't funny enough to be a humorous game and it's too frivolous to be a serious game, so it just sits awkwardly in the middle sucking at both. Maybe I've just been spoiled by much better humor from games like Bastion, Borderlands 1 & 2, Saints Row the Third, and others who got it right. But I still have to give it a positive score on technical merits.			"

												This is a hard game to review. On the one hand they do a lot of right things and on the other a lot of wrong things. The graphics are very nice and the sounds are good. The music is awful and I had to mute it. The music loops and its not very good.  The lore behind the game is original and the quests are fun for the most part.  The things I didnt like is the game is a lot harder then it should be. On Normal your going to be running for your life a lot of the time or least I was. I would say on normal for this game would be like hard or higher on Diablo 3. Mostly its because of the lack of regen on the armor stuff.The casual mode is ok but a little to easy. I wouldnt mind something in between. The skill tree is still in my opinion is all over the place and messy to look at. I would like something like torchlight 2 or Diablo 3 more streamlined. You have auros, tricks, skill sets for melee or shooting and then you have subset skills  whithin the skills that you can activate via rage by fighting things. If that sounds confusing well it is. A lot more then it should. The Co Op seems to work fine for the person hosting more so then the joiner. I had a gambler inside my base the person who joined couldnt talk to him. A fun game but can be frusterating in a lot of small ways.  After playing this for a while I would give it a 7/10 some good ideas hampered by small issues.

												If I had to pick an ""underrated game of 2013"" this is it. Beautiful animations, a compelling setting, an interesting AI companion, and an adequate story already set this game apart from its competitors in the ARPG market - and that's to say nothing of character development and the combat mechanics system. A lot of criticisms of this game target the lack of build diversity, since the vanilla version only has one character ""class"" with two build paths, melee and ranged. However, these concerns are ameliorated by the DLC classes, a mage and a trap-setting ranged fighter, which are worth getting if you like the base game. I love the setting, which is somewhere between Mary Shelley / Bram Stoker Gothic and Stephen Hunt steampunk. Katarina, the ghost companion of the player, is well-written and feels useful in combat (but not TOO useful, so van Helsing still feels like the star.)Combat is simple enough to be accessible, but complex enough to reward careful character building. 4 primary stats - essentially Melee, Ranged, Magic, and Critical - govern around 10 secondary stats, all of which are easy to understand. The skill tree is fairly simple but has enough depth that the same class could be built effectively in a few different ways. There is a neat mechanic about managing a resource called Rage, used to enhance attacks with sub-skills called Powerups; so far these seem interesting, but not necessary to play the game if you don't want to worry about them.I got this game on sale for $7, and at that price it's a no-brainer. At the full price ($15 + $5 DLC) it's still worthwhile, but there are better titles on Steam at that price point if you're not an action-RPG fan. In comparison to Torchlight 2, it is a bit less accessible to genre newcomers, but with a more interesting setting and a darker, more visceral tone. TOTAL 8.5/10+ Art style and setting+ Animations and voice acting+ Combat system (Power-ups/rage, balance of skills, diversity of skills and gear)+ Endgame play modes (Scenario and Neverending Story allow players to continue after finishing the game)- Feels limited by production cost (Short story, only a few monster models and terrain palettes)- Some technical problems (occasional, minor bugs that do not crash the game, but get irritating)			"

												Would be a great hack'n'slash Diablo-clone game with witty banter and storyline if only it weren't for the frustratingly constant CTDs that lose your progress each time they occur.  Forums show many others having the same problem, and turning off Steam Saves did help significantly reducing the CTDs from every single time you made an area transition to once every 3 or 4 times, but that's still far too many CTDs that prevent you from enjoying an otherwise fun game. There were many other bugs that are unfixed in the game as well, but most of those have workarounds to resolve them in the Community Forums. I had decided to try to finish this game before buying the sequel, but never could finish because of the frequent CTDs, which honestly will keep me from buying the sequel. Truly sad because it was rather growing on me despite all the other bugs.			"

												Good game to play through once, with the blue blood pack to make the ghost useful in combat;  It's certainly worth the 15$.Just be aware that there's no replayability; No new game +, no starting the campaign again with the char that you finished the game with.There is the abilty to load up in a harder mode that basically lets you go through a few of the more annoying areas again, with higher level enemies; not really fun or entertaining to do that though.There is multiplayer, but it adds very little; Maybe you want to go through the campaign with your friend? You can!			"

												I just beat the game on Heroic HC as a melee tank, then got one shot in the ""never-ending story"" campaign by one of the first quest mobs. There is a lot to like about this game but also a lot not to like. First of all the game is not balanced in Heroic. Even if you want to play melee, you need to start as ranged or you will die. As you skill up and get gear you can go into melee.In the second map I had problems surviving the earthquake mobs as melee, a dev told me not get hit by the charging attacks. The thing is not all the mobs were charging thier attacks like they were supposed to. But after the 2nd map melee was viable.The storyline ends so abruptly you are left wondering if it is over. The only signal that you finished is you have no more quests.There is no real info on a lot of mechanics of the game, nor is there a manual. Does MF on Katrina help the main char? Does Armor on Katrina help her in Ghost mode? Who knows? I think the real unfortunate part of this game is that it is soo close to being really good. But instead of spending a little time on refinement they just moved onto the next game in the series.As it stands now i can not recommed this game in Heroic Hardcore, but if you want to play casual its a decent game.

												Surprisingly good game. It's got a lot of Diablo/Titan Quest kind of vibe but they take away a lot of annoying stuff and streamline it quite well. You're instantly given a permanent pet, and the ability to do both melee and ranged attacks. Meaning that you're basically every class at once. From there you just choose to specialize, better pets, better melee, better ranged, more magical, more physical. Depending on how you specialize is how the game unfolds. It also has a sense of humor which I find refreshing and the voice acting is pretty decent. The plot is a bit weak but the gameplay, graphics and action is fun and impressive. All in all I was caught by surprise by this game and I do like it quite a bit. Fills that niche that Diablo III didn't quite fill.			"

												This action RPG is way better than Diablo 3!  The addition of a ghost sidekick really helps the gameplay as it allows the character to switch from melee to a ranged style without too much fear of being swarmed by enemies.  Moreover, the graphics and audio are a cut above the rest.  The writing is excellent with plenty of hilarity and biting, sarcastic commentary on modern-day gaming.  If you get this, DEFINITELY get the DLC as the thaumaturge (mage) class is sooooooo much fun to play with!!!!			"

												I truly like this game a lot more then i thought i would. It has an interesting environment and story. I'm still learning and putting my hours in so i can't truly make a full review but i believe i have played enough to at least recommend it, specily for it's price. This game type is so much more fun with the use of my controller which i never thought it could be and having a ghost friend to come along on your adventures make's things so much easier to deal with the more frustraiting parts about the genre. (having her collect the gold and potions for you, sending her to the shops, i.e. Torchlight 2) great game and glad i own it... to be honest i think i like it even better then Torchlight games.			"

												I got this as a gift, and even though I'm not a fan of ARPG's, I found this game to be pretty fun. One warning though: last time I tried to play multiplayer it was completely broken, with frequent desyncs. Make sure you check out if it has been fixed before buying if your are buying it for coop. It works fine in single player.			"

												If I had to pick an ""underrated game of 2013"" this is it. Beautiful animations, a compelling setting, an interesting AI companion, and an adequate story already set this game apart from its competitors in the ARPG market - and that's to say nothing of character development and the combat mechanics system. A lot of criticisms of this game target the lack of build diversity, since the vanilla version only has one character ""class"" with two build paths, melee and ranged. However, these concerns are ameliorated by the DLC classes, a mage and a trap-setting ranged fighter, which are worth getting if you like the base game. I love the setting, which is somewhere between Mary Shelley / Bram Stoker Gothic and Stephen Hunt steampunk. Katarina, the ghost companion of the player, is well-written and feels useful in combat (but not TOO useful, so van Helsing still feels like the star.)Combat is simple enough to be accessible, but complex enough to reward careful character building. 4 primary stats - essentially Melee, Ranged, Magic, and Critical - govern around 10 secondary stats, all of which are easy to understand. The skill tree is fairly simple but has enough depth that the same class could be built effectively in a few different ways. There is a neat mechanic about managing a resource called Rage, used to enhance attacks with sub-skills called Powerups; so far these seem interesting, but not necessary to play the game if you don't want to worry about them.I got this game on sale for $7, and at that price it's a no-brainer. At the full price ($15 + $5 DLC) it's still worthwhile, but there are better titles on Steam at that price point if you're not an action-RPG fan. In comparison to Torchlight 2, it is a bit less accessible to genre newcomers, but with a more interesting setting and a darker, more visceral tone. TOTAL 8.5/10+ Art style and setting+ Animations and voice acting+ Combat system (Power-ups/rage, balance of skills, diversity of skills and gear)+ Endgame play modes (Scenario and Neverending Story allow players to continue after finishing the game)- Feels limited by production cost (Short story, only a few monster models and terrain palettes)- Some technical problems (occasional, minor bugs that do not crash the game, but get irritating)			"

												Pros: 1) Interesting story, but it leaves you with the story unfinished, makeing you to buy the second game to see how the story develops.Personal oppinion: it's like diablo 1. You finish the game, but are not satisfied with what you did there...2) Good music.3) Easy to finish the game, here and there it's a little bit hard, but the entire game is quite easy. Cons: 1) Few good spells, imo. I haven't bought the DLCs, perhaps they added something cool there.2) Money is a big problem in this game, from my perspective. Because i could not make my ultimate gear withought farming like a noob.3) Useless legendaryis, from my perspective. You get some legendarys that help you to a certain level, but when you go NG+ the same legendary drops but with the same stats in you first game.			"

												The game is very good. The graphic are very elegant and well done. The enviroment is so beautiful and i cant decrive it with a few words. the enviroment looks like a old time western adventure games with character that are very likeble. The character have personality that are very memorable and their designs matches their personality. Also the enemy are well design and well put in the enviroment.  the game play is good without belive and there are three classes to pick from and the campaign story is worth it.  The power up are beautiful and so powerful that i can not stop killing enemy in this game. this is the game to buy for the story and the replayability.			"

												I picked this up as part of a Humble Bundle and had a couple of false starts at getting into it, primarily due to my lack of familiarity with the character set-up possibilities. I am very glad I had another crack as this is good fun. The mechanics are fairly standard but have plenty of customisation options (although there is the occasional problem with not being able to move when surrounded - best avoided by not allowing yourself to get surrounded!) but it's the very nicely rendered and varied environments and tongue-in-cheek humour that make the game. It's clearly been developed by people that love the genre (both of the game and its source material) and there is a lot of detail applied to enhance the gamer's experience. There are loads of easter eggs, jokes and achievements as well (some very much more obscure than others). Definitely worth a go if you enjoy horror B-movies and/or hacking/blowing up hordes of baddies.			"

Posted: September 23, 2014
												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is an average Action-RPG that is clearly outshone by other games in the genre. There are fair sized skill and talent trees that are hindered by limited hotkeys and level requirements. These trees allow for a multitude of ways to spend skill points and while it would imply replayability to neutralise the fact that there are only three classes, builds are far too restricted by the lack of available skill points and level restrictions. The three available classes are not very flexible in playstyle apart from the Hunter, but even that only has the choice to switch between melee and ranged. The combat has a focus on area-of-effect skills as the game can easily swarm you with monsters at ambiguous and undefined spawn points that can even be on top of you without warning. Loot drops occur too often and has uninteresting basic stat upgrades which taints the experience of obtaining new and better equipment. The plot is uninteresting and written poorly, the voice acting is subpar as they do not portray their characters' intent appropriately. The environments, despite varied, are cliche and does not compensate for the lack of world building that the plot, characters and ambience do not provide. Cooperative play is available but seems tacked on and is the same experience as the singleplayer, but with added players and monster difficulty.			"

												This is a very fun ARPG. The play mechanics are excellent, the maps are huge, the quests are fun, and, for a lower budget game, the voice acting is quite nice. There are two DLCs thus far and for those who have the game, the dev has offered a unique item and an aura as a thank you. Diablo, Torchlight, Grim Dawn, and other ARPG players will feel right at home with this game. There is a LOT of loot, a nice skill tree for your main character plus your ghost companion - she is a blast BTW with her snide and condescending remarks to Van Helsing. But, unlike the annoying companion in Legend: Hand of God, THIS companion is also a potentially gruesome, merciless killing machine. The DLC offers more replayability, but, even without it, you can play through the game again and specialize in different kinds of attacks - the same goes for your companion.This game LOVES to swarm you and enemies will attack in all directions - it's absolutely glorious and at times, loot drops can be almost as crazy as Torchlight II.I hope that Neocore will consider making a sequel. The game would easily compete with the best triple A ARPGs out there. A random map function would really round the game out. Props to the devs who have been VERY responsive and have kept this jewel up to date. I am an ARPG fanatic and The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is one of the most fun I am still playing.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I reallyreally enjoy RPG's of this type, so I thought this would be a good fit for me. The music is decent and the voice acting is straight on for the most part. I found a lot of cliched voicing, though, IE Count Vlados. However, the Romany girl  that you have to get flowers for sure doesn't sound like the other people in her camp. I found myself more than once cursing at the camera angles and apparently, fighting off screen is actually a thing if you're using a ranged character. And speaking of, I tried to melee my character. I really did. I usually play a tank type so it's not like I'm unfamiliar with it . . and. . . I ended up with a gun wielding character because that was the only thing I could find that would actually do damage and take down enemies without Van Helsing continually dying all the time. But because of this, omg, the sheer amount of kiting was amazing. I've never kited so much in a game as I did in this. Overall, the storyline was cliched as well. Mad Scientist, blah blah, Secret Lair (that's apparently not so secret) blah blah. And Easter eggs? Nah, they're fecking everywhere to the point that you actually get ""graded"" at the end of each chapter for how many you found. However, there's a lot of fun ""other game/movie/book"" references that make at least that portion a fun little romp.All in all, I'm giving this a 5/10 due to the negative points above.

												This game is a one of mixed perceptions. Just by browsing through the reviews, you can probably guess that your take on this game will depend very much on your luck of the draw in terms of specs, since this game isn't THAT well optimized and certainly not bug-free.On my first playthrough of the game, I ran into a game-breaking bug where I went into the boss area of the second major area of the game of the first act, but then after the brief dialogue I spawned outside of the lightning barriers that locked in the boss area with no way of opening them. Loading it up on a new system and making a new profile resolved the issue after many months of taking a break from the game, but by the accounts of everyone else on here, there are plenty of other places for this game to potentially crash, break, or otherwise ♥♥♥♥ with you. So its a bit of a gamble on you actually being able to run this stably.If you can get around that, its basically a Diablo clone with some nice graphics, a monster-hunter fantasy story, and some solid gameplay that anyone familiar with the genre will probably enjoy.The story and overall writing is most parody and humorous throughout the whole game. So don't be expecting MUCH seriousness, but I also wouldn't say that its a complete comedy or satire. The banter between Van Helsing Jr. and Katarina is the high point of the game's writing for me. My biggest problem being that the game basically hints at all kinds of other interesting or fun adventures they went on prior to the game's time that I would have liked to have played in this one, but that's a minor greviance.Gameplay is meh. You're going to be kiting A LOT in this game, especially when dealing with swarms of enemies that love to melee you and do massive damage (which with the expection of certain ranged units is I'd say the majority of the enemies in this game), but the enemies don't respawn and dying doesn't matter THAT much in this game since you can buy immediate respawns with your gold that IMO you're not going to be spending on much else anyway. I recommend it, with provisions that in buying it you're taking a chance on it working as intended so I wouldn't buy it for that much.			"

												A LOT better than I originally thought it would be. When it was first released I was not at all interested, it looked cheap, generic, dull and just another fan fiction game with no substance. Damn, was I wrong. The base version only comes with one playable class(?) but with the DLC you can then choose from two more, the Thaumaturge which is basically your mage and the Arcane Mechanic wich is an engineer with cool gadgets. Very different from most birds eye view RPG's I've played, different gearing and gemming mechanics and styles but it does not lack what only some can offer: a fun, changing, new, challenging, mass killing, awesome adventure. The skill system works the same as most other games like this would, as you level up (killing monsteres, completeing quests, etc.) you gain skill poins, later on though you gain more per level but in turn your higher level abilities require more and one skill point (1, 2 and some 3). You have your main ability skills, (mostly activated and damaging abilities, some passive) Your Tricks ability page (special abilities that change or enhance game play [Thaumaturge can slow time for every thing around him, Arcane Mechanic can summon turrets, and other fun abilities]). And last are your Aura skills, you can have 2 auras on at a time that increase mana regen, critical damage boost, elemental damage increase, etc. The game play, design, UI lay out and the game mechanics are very user friendly. One thing that most games lack is undoing skill point allocation. In this game you can remove points from skills one point at a time (for a fee, of course) so you don't totally throw you build out the window, you can instead make samll tweaks to it, which I love. You can do the same for you Ability points: Body(STR equiv) Dexterity(AGI euiv) Willpower (INT equiv) and Luck (magic item find, crit chance, dodge change modifier). Your follower, Katarina, is a sassy spectre that helps out in battle but also adds a sense of humor to a seemingly bleak dark world. She has her own seperate Skillys and Abilities and you can change how she attacks and behave (Melee, Ranged, Passive while adding boosts to you). You can have her pick up items, and gold if you want, send her to town to do your shopping and she will back talk you the entire time. Different and weird at first, but she is a valuable asset to your goal of evil eradication. There's a lot to say about this game, but you will just have to play it for your self to experience the fun and actually quite enjoyable graphics. There are some zones that feel laggy and I did have to tweak my video settings for it to be a little less glitchy at times (Running with two GTX 670 vid cards, i7 3.4Ghz, 16Gb RAM, 1 TB HD with a 240Gb SSD) my computer is more than capable of running any game at max graphics setting but I still experienced lag at times. Like any game, there are glitches and bugs that can some times even progression imparing, check the forums, the game has a built in repair function if a quest stops working or something similar, nothing major but it can be frustrating at times.My over all verdict 8/10. Worth buying? Yes. Better with friends? Yes. I'ts a fun game and I have thoroughly enjoyed playing it.			"

												I used to be just like you... a poor soul who didn't recognize how AWESOME the INCREDIBLE Adventures of Van Helsing truly is. Now I know. And I hope one day you can too.This game is a pretty classic realtime RPG, complete with a box inventory section. It's got four levels of difficulty, complete with a permadeath option. I made the mistake of enabling permadeath my first game around, and sent the world into an everlasting oblivion. There are different classes for different playstyles, and items that, frustratingly, can only be used by a particular class. The sense of humor built into this game is priceless.Can money buy happiness? Now it can.			"

There are some problems but not that bad;- crashed about 10x times as i played but the backup save it has it's good, you only lose like 5min  although if you find some good items i don't know if you lose them or find it at the same location- your companion is kinda useless sometimes, but not all that bad- the tower defense part was very anoying- i didn't try the multiplayer, donno if it's all okI loved the option to stop the respawning of enemies, i want to clear an area and not feel like i did nothing and everything is back like when i started, imagine if you take the trash out or wash dishes andwhen you come back they are there again, nooooo way. :Di give it a 7/10 .

												This game is a one of mixed perceptions. Just by browsing through the reviews, you can probably guess that your take on this game will depend very much on your luck of the draw in terms of specs, since this game isn't THAT well optimized and certainly not bug-free.On my first playthrough of the game, I ran into a game-breaking bug where I went into the boss area of the second major area of the game of the first act, but then after the brief dialogue I spawned outside of the lightning barriers that locked in the boss area with no way of opening them. Loading it up on a new system and making a new profile resolved the issue after many months of taking a break from the game, but by the accounts of everyone else on here, there are plenty of other places for this game to potentially crash, break, or otherwise ♥♥♥♥ with you. So its a bit of a gamble on you actually being able to run this stably.If you can get around that, its basically a Diablo clone with some nice graphics, a monster-hunter fantasy story, and some solid gameplay that anyone familiar with the genre will probably enjoy.The story and overall writing is most parody and humorous throughout the whole game. So don't be expecting MUCH seriousness, but I also wouldn't say that its a complete comedy or satire. The banter between Van Helsing Jr. and Katarina is the high point of the game's writing for me. My biggest problem being that the game basically hints at all kinds of other interesting or fun adventures they went on prior to the game's time that I would have liked to have played in this one, but that's a minor greviance.Gameplay is meh. You're going to be kiting A LOT in this game, especially when dealing with swarms of enemies that love to melee you and do massive damage (which with the expection of certain ranged units is I'd say the majority of the enemies in this game), but the enemies don't respawn and dying doesn't matter THAT much in this game since you can buy immediate respawns with your gold that IMO you're not going to be spending on much else anyway. I recommend it, with provisions that in buying it you're taking a chance on it working as intended so I wouldn't buy it for that much.			"

												Fairly enjoyable game, except for the ridiculously long loading times and having different classes sold separately as DLC. Note here that you have to pay only to unlock the classes, as they are already in the game - the content is already implemented since there are already item drops for them.Because of this I give it 5 out of 10 stars and a BOOOO to the developers.

												It's like a Diablo clone, but without proper Blizzard's polish.Quests are quite monotonous and all the same, doing all the side quests is dead boring. Storyline is hard to follow, you just run and slay hordes of enemies for almost no reason.And resource consumption is totally unoptimized. I've been playing every other game on medium or high settings without any problem and lag, but this game not only runs slow on low-medium settings but makes my monoblock PC trumpet like a plane taking off.

												What's with all them people recommending abysmal, amateur games lately? Stop feeding me this pig grub and making me spend money on trash titles that only waste my time.Van Helsing is basically a shovelware title made only to generate income for the least possible costs possible. It's your standard, soulless, mediocre-but-annoyingly-bad-at-the-end hack'n'slash. Everything in this game screams with lack of creativity, the lack of any ultimate point of this title being even made besides ""people will buy anything at steam sales"" logic.Yeah, let's take an interesting theme and turn it into another uninspired shovelware. I fiddled around a little with characters, progressed a little into the story but the fundamentals of the gameplay, controls and the balance (that ranged class was a total afterthought, it's so underpowered and limited compared to the hunter) turned out to be terribly implemented and got me ultimately bored on hard difficulty. There's literally nothing of interest in this game, everything was done before and better. But the worst part is that killing enemies is fiddly (targeting is a chore, especially with the ranged character) and absolutely unrewarding, which means it's unsatysfying. Even putting down boss enemies turns into running in circles taking that HP bloat down for some crappy loot worse than anything you get from a vendor. Oh, yeah, how about tying difficulty level with number of enemies? That can't go wrong, can it? Yeah, it can and it did, because the only thing it changes is forcing the player into doing more circles kiting enemies until they all go down. How about♥♥♥♥♥♥voice actors on the top of that? Apparently some people liked them generic characters with terrible va - and terrible dialogue lines in this game are being described as ""humorous"". What? Straightforward terrible references and unfunny lines are ""humorous"" now? Seriously?Hard to see a good h'n's lately. Just get Torchlight 2 which is better in everything from Van Helsing. Even if it has arguably worse esthetics.			"

												If you've played Torchlight 2, you'll know what to expect.  The common root is Diablo, but The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing *is* Torchlight 2, to the extent that it feels like a rather underdone mod rather than a game in its own right.That's fine, of course - inbreeding and cheeky rip-offs have always been rampant in the games industry.  It doesn't matter if a game resembles another, what matters is what it brings to the table.  Van Helsing comes up very short, sadly, and the best that can be said about it is that it'll remind you of better games from time to time.Functionally it has everything you'd want from a game of this type, although it is a little buggy and nowhere near as configurable as it should be, but it feels like the work of people who got their game engine roughly working without any passion for the game they'd make with it.   It kind of pulls the right moves, but nothing really clicks.  Enemies are never exciting challenges, they're just pests who are either overpowered or underpowered, and combat is a constant annoyance.  A *constant* annoyance, as it never lets up - outside of safe town areas, fresh waves of enemies will always flood at you, which means that attempting to navigate the unnecessarily fussy character sheets, or even your inventory, will often result in death.You will die often, but it'll rarely be the result of something you have or haven't done.  Sometimes it will be down to the nice but confusing art style that makes your character impossible to find on the screen, but generally it's down to this game having absolutely nothing to do at any turn other than a weak sigh and 'eh, throw more enemies in there?'It's porridge floating in bathwater.  It's a game designed by people who don't understand games.  It's like eating a roll of wallpaper.  It is - and I don't say this lightly - perhaps the most tedious game I've ever played.  I go back to the Spectrum era, so I've seen some stinkers.  There's nothing here for anyone other than boredom. "

If you're looking for a Diablo like game, well, it's kind of like it in some ways, but it doesn't get even close to the Diablo gaming experience. Not in game mechanics, not in graphics, not in sound or voice acting, I don't know about story telling becasue I din't bother to keep playing it.

												Pretty much the same thing everyone else has been saying. The game has terrible mechanics, bad skills and customization, monsters don't level along with you so they're WAY too hard and OHKO you. It's a grind-fest with bad voice acting and honestly just terrible. If you like any other ARPG like Diablo, Torchlight, PoE, anything else... this game is NOTHING like it. I wanted to enjoy it but I just couldn't. My recommendation? Go get Victor Vran. It's everything this game should have been.			"

												This game looks worth it, till you actually play and find how broken the quest lines are if you want to play multiplayer. Not only have the dev's not released a patch to fix probs over 2 years old !  They then expect everyone with broken quests to send their saves to them for a fix ! Not at all good enough ! These quest line probs should have been addressed with a patch ages ago ! So has turned me off this game for good will be asking for a refund !First time i have !  Will not be getting the other games in this series as i hear there are similar probs with them too !Fix your game Neocore !!!! I will be treating anything with neocore attatched with caution in future !Game would be great if you could play with friends without bother !        Ok if you want to play sinle player !			"

It has a huge skill tree for both characters and the DLC add-ons are totally worth it. A lot of love went into this game and it shows. It is truely a diamond in the rough. For the low price I had gotten it for I, honestly, was not expecting this much fun. Great game. Looking forward to playing TIAoVH2.			"

												I grew up on a diet of late night monster movies and bad scifi flicks and if there's one thing I retained from those days, it's the knowledge that Van Helsing is the most bad♥♥♥♥♥monster hunter there is.  Well...some of the Van Helsing's are.  You see, in history, there's like 912 different Van Helsing's out there.   I think they're all related too, but I'm not 100% on that.  Some are kick♥♥♥♥♥ some are not.  The Van Helsing in this game though is clsoer to the kick♥♥♥♥♥end of the scale. Even though I'm 40, I stil dream of being a monster slayer when I grow up.  It's probably never going to happen though, so having a monster slayer simulator is pretty nice.  This Van Helsing game pits you against large waves of monsters and let's you feel like Peter Cushing in a Hammer flick as you go to town with your dual swords, blood flying left and right and monsters falling like chumps.  (Two swords are always cooler than one sword, or a rifle you amateur)  As far as Action RPG's go, Van Helsing's a weird hybrd sandwiched between the buns of Diablo II and Torchlight II.  You get some min-maxing of stats on items, but not enough to feel like a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥lord, plus a limited amount of skills that make you actually think before you plunk your points down so that you don't wind up with a Van Helsing with a limp sword arm.  Plus, the environments are pretty nice and gothic with a creepy atomsphere, again like a Hammer flick so it plays well to horror nerds, such as myself. The game can be pretty tough, you're going drink potions like an addict and you're going to swear at your monitor a lot, but making up swear words is a fun part of being a gamer.   it still feels rewarding to be able to come up with a combination of wepons strenth and skill points to be able to kick the snot out of that werewolf that's been having it's way with your hind parts.   There's two downfall's to Van Helsing, one being that it's a one and done playthrough, meaning you're not going to play through it obsessively seven times to become the prettiest princess with the shiniest breast plate, but it's pretty fun for that one play through.   The other is that one of the things I enjoy in ARPG's the playing dress up with your toon to be the prettiest princess, finding the coolest looking.  Van Helsing's getup isn't going to change a whole lot throughout the game, but he still looks pretty cool to start.  He looks cooler than Hugh Jackman did as Van Helsing at the very lest.			"

												Well it can be fun to play and the writing isn't terrible the game can be somewhat unstable, may just be certain setups that run into instability but it can get rather annoying, as it has a demo available I heavily advise running the demo for at least a few hours before considering buying.The defaulting to gamepad if one is plugged in may annoy some as might the kb/m UI which is all over the place, the gamepad UI is slightly off no matter what on my 16:10 setup so I thought a bar in a cetain mission was full when it had a bit left.I personally have had several instances where it stopped registering my gamepad as plugged in and would't accept any input requring alt-f4-ing (luckily it saves frequently), when reforging items I've ran into a lot of crashes.Outside all the bugs/crashes and other issues the gameplay is decent for a diablo-like or whatever that subgenre is called, the voice acting isn't terrible and the story works.You spend most of the game running around murdering hordes of enemies in search of ever slightly better gear with that minor stat increase you need to kill them that bit faster.If you've played diablo or any of the games like it you know what to expect from the gameplay more or less and it's not anywhere near the worst of its type.So yeah, it's a fine game if you're lucky enough that it isn't completely unstable for you.

												It actually crashed my computer, I had to restart. Thr graphics aren't anywhere near as good as they should be for such a massive file size, and even at low graphics I'm getting FPS drops. I had to stop playing before I could really get going because it was like trying to dryhump a brick wall in an awkward attempt at getting it wet. The voice acting was painfully bad, but that went along with the Mary-Sue writing. ""I am the son of the greatest hunter in the world and constant get drawn into magical situations oh and I have a partner and she's a ghost but that doesn't matter.""Come on now.  "

												Excellent production standards in all areas make this one of the best ARPGs around. The story is engaging enough that you will play this to completion and some of the voiceover work is hammy in such a way as to make it amusing without being painful. Take a Diablo clone, inject a touch of Witcher atmosphere and this is pretty much what you get. The ONLY gripe I have is that area transition load times seem inordinately slow. Some have complained that it is too short but I would argue that it is more than worth its initial asking price. 90%			"

												I tried a couple of times but I couldn't get into this game... the graphics aren't bad at all but somehow they are still very unattractive. The starting classes are somewhat different to the classic rpg rogue, warrior, mage choices, but still they aren't really interesting. On the character creation screen, you pretty much gotta choose between the guy in the hat, the masked old man and the bald guy, no customization whatsoever. The game is boring on the lower difficulties and unforgivingly difficult in the highest difficulties. The gameplay is bad, when hitting enemies either by basic attacks or skills, it doesn't feel like you are actually hitting anything.Overall this game is dull, boring and not worth playing. I love the genre but I have to thumb this one down.			"

												Would have loved to play this game but despite my machine exceeding the listed OSX requirements, it would not play. I tried several methods others had reported working to get it to load (including renaming a file) but to no avail. I did not disable SIP as I do not feel a game is worth disabling system security protections so if you feel otherwise maybe you have other options that would work. Until the devs get it working for OSX, it should be removed as an OSX game. I can't recommend it specifically because it does not play for users who meet listed requirements.			"

												Score: 6/10Pros:- Good story.- Funny/Interesting companion.- Good skills/talents with varying visual effects for most.- Torchlight/Diablo 3 gameplay style ?Cons:- Story is short and leaves us on a cliffhanger.- Bit buggy, slow loading times and hardware intesive at higher graphics settings.- Requires farming for the same 4 levels once you reach the end in order to get better equipment.- Multiplayer is buggy.- No controller support ?

												Before I get started with this review, I'll go ahead and point out that I'm not an expert. No really, loot-based action-rpgs aren't really my forte. Sure I've spent hundreds if not thousands of hours on titles like Diablo 2 and its ilk, but I couldn't tell you a dang thing about any of them. Go ahead and ask me about Diablo 2, all I recall is Tristram run after Blood run after Baal run after run after run after...bleah. I fried my brain on the genre years ago so I have just a little understanding for ""strategy"", ""proper-builds"", and the inner-workings and mechanics of what makes this genre function. I still play them though because they're addictive as hell. Now then, what can I say about Van Helsing? Well, for starters the characters are a bit more amusing than most. This is one of the benefits of having a game where the main-characters stay the same no matter the class. Despite his appearance, Helsing is a good-humored dude, and isn't always deadly serious about his job. His ghostly partner Katarina always has a cutting remark ready for the vampire hunter. As a duo they're far more memorable than most loot-clicker casts. I went with ranged-build, mostly relying on the spread-shot for crowd-control. Kat was built to violently explode upon ""death"" for great damage. It worked out well enough I suppose. I played on hard difficulty and didn't run into many problems (didn't beat the game, more on that later).Van Helsing plays out much the same as any other loot-clicker. You have your equipment, your rares, your skills, and your build. Either through happenstance or a guide you find your build, you choose the right skills for it, allocate the appropriate stats, then just kill stuff for appropriate weapon upgrades. For some gamers, that's compelling enough on its own, but it's preferable to hunt for something more. Where Van Helsing falters is mostly in the map-design. Each area is largely uninteresting. Some areas (like the ink realm) are visually inventive, but that's about it. The maps in this game are largely just a lot of space filled with packs of enemies. Nothing really changes as you progress. In the forest you'll run into packs of wolves, somewhere else there will be packs of soldiers, or packs of demons, and so on. When monsters are grouped together like that the game becomes stagnant. After you've found your build you're not likely to use more than the same or 2 or 3 skills at all times. Variety isn't just fighting different monsters, it's fighting monsters that approach in different ways. Some should ambush, others call for help, hell maybe they're just wandering around. In this game, they just wait around in organized groups for a vampire hunter to come fight them. One particular area is also aggravating because it is split into two sections, which leads to several minutes (slight exaggeration) of wandering back to square one if you go the wrong way. I will give credit to one area in that portions of it are separated by chasms, so enemies can take pot-shots at you as you try to cross. Sure it's headache-inducing, but at least it's inducing a feeling of something more and not just ""oh look. All these monsters are standing around for the thousandeth time"" mediocrity....But I didn't quit the game yet.A real frustrating aspect of this game involves the hit mechanics. More precisely, when enemies attack, what constitutes a hit? When I see an enemy wind-up to attack -- pull their fist back, hold an axe over their head, etc. -- I should be able to move out of the way to dodge it. Loot-Clickers..no...Action-RPGs in general have dozens of stats, even a dodge rating. All the same, there should be an incentive for players to avoid attacks through direct-input, not just their number > the enemy's number. Van Helsing flicks a toothpick at that idea, and it is a consistent source of annoyance for me. Even when I'm clear out of the way of an attack I'll still take damage. But that's not why I quit the game.After a certain point Van Helsing is given control of a resistance base, and he can outfit it as he sees fit. This is basically the tower defense portion of the game and THANKFULLY it's largely optional. I put the emphasis on THANKFULLY because I hated it that much. I'm going to change subjects ever so slightly and talk about a PS2 game called Shining Force Exa. In this game there is a fortress that is regularly attacked. While one character is questing, the other holds down the fort (so to speak). When you strip enough elements away from tower-defense you're left with nothing but ""protect this thing"". However if the core of the game is entertaining enough, that doesn't really matter. I actually enjoyed these battles in Exa because they focused on the core. A lot of monsters were thrown at the player and that was the extent of it. Van Helsing has this whole set-up where you can buy traps and place them all over this corridor-abundant dungeon. The waves of enemies are too frequent, come from too many angles, and due to the way the dungeon is constructed you'll never reach them in time. You have to approach these battles almost entirely with a tower-defense mindset. This isn't what I signed up for when I started playing Van Helsing. To be fair, tower-defense was a hardly a thing when Exa came out, but really who wants to play that crap when they pick up an action-RPG?...But I didn't quit the game at that point. After all the tower-defense stuff is largely optional.No I didn't actually quit Van Helsing until I was maybe one or two dungeons away from the final boss. When Katarina had reached her level-cap, and Helsing was maybe one or two levels away from his, I quit. Yes, of all the things to quit a game over it's due to hitting a level-cap. Or maybe the real reason is because it dawned on me that this is only part one of Van Helsing's incredible adventures. I'm sure if I picked up the second game I'd get to continue leveling, to continue fighting in seemingly endless repetitive encounters, using the same skills I mastered hours ago, dealing with the crappy mechanics, and there'd probably be even more tower-defense garbage. I didn't think myself capable of stomaching another 15-20 hours of a sequel to this game, so I quit.I'll give credit where it's due, Van Helsing managed just enough in getting the basics down to keep me playing. I'm an exceptional case though, I play a lot of loot-clickers regardless of quality, so maybe my judgment isn't always sound. If I see yellows, purples, and golds dropping at a decent enough rate there's no telling what games I could be tricked into playing. It's only when the end of the road is in sight do I realize that maybe this game isn't for me and move on. This is where Van Helsing lies. It's not particularly bad, but it gave me reason enough to quit as soon as I shook out of its icy grip.			"

												Can't review the entire game because it crashes every 10 minutes (no exaggeration). My play time is close to 40 minutes and the game has crashed 4 times on me. I have the latest Intel processor (kaby Lake), with 16gb Ram, and an SSD. Minimum spec requirements is Intel HD4000 which is from 2013. I have that covered well. I've ran other games comparable to this one (e.g. Darksiders, NFSP Hot Pursuit, even Strider runs on this machine at very low fram rates, but it didn't crash). The best thing I can say for this experience is that I didn't pay full price; however, I should never have bought this game. It seems broken.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing represents a solid action role-playing game, based on Bram Stoker’s legendary vampire slayer. It has a charming atmosphere in combination with an interesting storyline and lovely characters, set in a gothic–noir universe resembling the 19th century Eastern Europe, that is filled with original monsters, magic and weird technology.

												I have just recently purchased The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing - Complete Pack for £14.99 from the store. The main problem is that the game keeps crashing every 5-10 regardless of what I am doing. The specs for my pc are as follows: Windows 10 Home x64, Intel Core i5 4460T @ 1.90Ghz Quad Core, 8GB of DDR3 RAM, Intel HD4600 built-in. The screen is running at 1920 x 1080 @60 FPS. The settings are turned down to medium for most things and yet it still crashes for no apparent reason. With this in mind if this is not resolved I will be seeking for a complete refund.			"

												The game is kind of a mixed bag. The npc dialogs really great and funny. There is a LOT of easter egg references to other games and movies in the game wich i find great. Graphics are avarage, nothing too facy but it does its job. But the asthetics are way above avarage, the game has a certain uniqe style wich i find really great. Where the game really lacks is in the core gameplay mechanics. The fights are really booring and simple. You just left click and wait to the enemy health bar slowly disappear or just kite the enemies to defeat them wich is lame. There are not many skills or abilites wich can put you off from the combat wich by reaching toward the end will be sickenly boring.  Many times i found graphical gliches and camera bugs where i only can saw the roof uncovering my charater in combat. Overall its an OK game, not bad but not good either.Personally i dont recommend this game. But! It was discounted soo many times by now for dirt cheap it can really worth a shot for the dialogs and easter eggs alone. /killer rabbit best rabbit :) /			"

												Hideous controls playing it on PC with movement and 2 main attack spells being on mouse buttons so you probably need gamepad. Also thought perk/talent/skill system is unnecessary complicated. After each level up you have to put silly amount of skill/spell/perk etc points to urself and ur companion.Spell choices themselves seemed kinda awkward and a lot of them felt like offering to choose the visual instead of different playstyle.Liked that every quest is voice acted and the relationship between main character and his companion was also pretty entertaining.

Anything harder than Normal is basically just a grindfest so you have an excuse to enjoy every single mob, drown yourself in potions, and make your game time last three times longer.Respecing comes early and is relatively cheap, so that ends up being the main use for gold.Go ahead, play it.

PlotFelt that the plot wasn't too pronounced during the entire gameplay experience, was quite confused at the end. It felt more like no-brainer progression. Adding onto that, the ending was quite abrupt and unexpected as I expected more but it's continued on on part II in which I haven't tried yet (and I don't really plan to due to its negative reviews)GameplayMovementGameplay was very smooth in general, felt that movement is rather odd if you were to move with a mouse as you can't really move and shoot at the same time, which makes attacking + defending quite choppy.CombatHowever, to make up for that, I appreciate the over the top swarms of monsters that can be slain through 1 single AOE attack which makes the experience quite satisfying.CompanionQuite liked the companion option as it allows you to stay behind a tank if you're planning on a ranged character (I played range). Adding onto that, companions allows you to sell items (almost) anywhere in the battlefield with the drawback that you give up her presence for 60 secondsInventoryFelt that the inventory management was pretty dang good considering it automatically optimizes inventory space as you collect more items, it even has a manual sort button there just in case. Your companion also helps in clearing up your inventory space by having a separate inventory space of her own (in which you can send her to sell items too)SkillsFelt that skills were a bit lackluster as compared to games nowadays, felt that they could expand more on the skill tree but I think it is just barely enough for completing the gameEnchantments/UpgradesSimilarly, quite lackluster, the enchantments and upgrades were... not too appealling, it's mostly basic upgrades like HP+, HP Drain, MP Drain, Elemental Damage etc. It doesn't really explore into more experimental elements that a hack & slash game could go with, but as I've said, the basic enchantments/upgrades should suffice for a basic game like this.BalanceContext: I played on Casual which is the defaultThe game scales to ridiculous difficulty amounts at further levels (found that after level 20 it becomes annoyingly hard to progress). Though there's a mode for you to farm equipments on with respawning monsters, you can only access it at levels higher than 27 (I believe). Kind of a bit too far away from the point where you'd normally get really frustrated.One example would be a monster that shoots a bomb, as a ranger, you'd expect yourself to have very little health if you weren't expecting these monsters; it deals immense damage, close to 80% of my health as a ranger and it basically OHKO's you at higher levels if you don't have (very) good armor and health.Well if you're a ranger can't you just shoot him down at long range?No, the problem is that, the area that the game lets you hit the monster is exactly the range of the monster, so you'd have to shoot and run. With the sloppy movement I find it really hard and annoying to kill these monsters, and I don't really even want to go into dealing 2 of these at the same time.Camera AngleOne of my biggest issues would be the camera angle.First of, the game doesn't allow you to rotate the camera at all, so you're kinda stuck with this 45 degree camera view all the time. The biggest problem is that there will be enemies coming at you from the bottom of the camera (in which is a blind spot), you wouldn't know what's hitting you until you go really close to them or you take a detour. As a ranger, it was a horrific experience most of the time.AudioVoice ActingVoices were on point, think it is better than that of most games even. The contents of the dialogue were well balanced in comedic value and seriousness, not too much of any in which I feel is a good composition.Sound EffectsComparing to games nowadays, sound effects here are subpar, if you're very picky in audio, you might find these a bit of a nuisance, but I managed to get over them.MusicMusic was decent, felt that there were some mastering errors here and there (some tracks felt quite muffled for some reason) but it is okay in potraying the mood at their respective positionsConclusion/TL;DRThough The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing has its better days in the past, it doesn't have the better perks of other similar games that are out right now.Think Torchlight II or Path of Exile would be a significantly better choice than this right now, Path of Exile is even freeAs of now, wouldn't really recommend it			"

												Becomes too boring after one Playtrough, also especially if you want get all Achievements its boring and there are not enough Enemy to kill, thats why i spend 177 Hours with this Crap to finally reach the 500'000 Kills.Because i was really bored already, i used a Wrench on the Controller to hold the Button down, positioned the Character to kill endless respawning Monsters in Front, for almost 24 Hours to reach the 500'000 Kills also because the Game became slower and slower because the Bodys was not removed, i was forced to use an Attack that desintegrate them, Boring, Boring, Boring!So i can only recommend it partially for one Playtrough, but there is no Replayvalue other than boring Grinds for the boring Achievements probably made only to artificially lengthen the Completion - BORING!Did i already mention this Game is Boring?Also the most Boring Thing is limited Storage, its only 4x your Inventory Space(with Perk), so you will spend alot of Time with boring sorting out good stuff to replace it with a little better stuff.I can't recommend it because i can't stand limited Storage in Games where Loot is a Core-Component.I hardly managed to put all my Epics i got into the Storage and there was no Duplicates, so Storage is defintely too small. Period.And Games with limited Storage like this, will get an automatically ""Not Recommended"" by me, from now one. Period.Also there is another Thing that made it even more boring, there was a Sort of Badass-Points Thing like in Borderlands, where you was able to spend Points in and those Buffs would then be for all Characters - a Thing that would mean some Replayvalue after all, but, but ... but they removed it in an older Update, so it doesn't worked anymore by the Time i got the Game, and so there is also no Replayvalue anymore. Period.Also there are Bugs, it says full Controller Support, but this isn't true!Some Skills, Auras and Stuff can only be set with Mouse and this means you have to unplug the Controller and restart the Game to set the Skills, Auras and Stuff and then plug back the Controller and restart the Game again - soooo Boring!!!It should really be called: The Incredible Boring Adventures of Van HelsingAnd because i also got both of them in a Pack, i have to finish the other too, hope it's less Boring to finish it else it's the last Game from Neocore i bought for sure.

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing or Great Expectations (game review) - Hello, fellow hunters!!! As for me I was looking forward to the date of Van Helsing release with great expectations and even pre-ordered it on Steam. Frankly speaking I motivated by two things: I had already walked through Torchlight 2 several times (choosing a new character class every time) and I generally liked the videos the developers placed at Steam, Youtube and Facebook. So I bought it about two weeks before the release date. And finally I have downloaded the game and played it. I can say I have some mixed feelings about The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing.  As for the plot it is rather simple and can't boast of some depths. I mean if you happened fortunately (or unfortunately – it’s up to you to decide) to have a name of Van Helsing and your prominent father was a prominent vampire hunter – what are you expected to do and earn your living and reputation? Naturally, to kill vampires and other (numerous) various monsters. So our character goes to some imaginary country of Borgovia where something is going definitely wrong. As you guess Van Helsing is to put the situation to rights. By the way he is helped by Katarina – a ghost who has her own abilities and skills. But generally it is not the storyline that disappointed me. I never expected it to be exciting. What I wished was exciting gameplay.Read more at http://www.viewforum.net/gaming-dept-171/incredible-adventures-van-helsing-great-expectations-game-review-3359/ "

												I do not reccomend this game on the basis of the boss fights, everything else is good in my estimation but as for the bosses there was far too much kiting required even early on and that put me off the game (made it to the drill worm).If you like ARPGs and being swarmed by countless minor enemies while trying to get a few hits on the bosses now and again I reccomend the game, if not, don't get this game.

												This game should be called The Incredible Adventures of DLC Hell-sing. The first thing you come across when creating your first character are three classes - two of which are, of course, disabled unless you have bought the additional DLC. Fine, you select your hunter (as if you had ever wanted to play a guy with a tin can on his head) and venture forth into this wonderful world! You kill a few creatures, kill a few thugs and ding! - you have leveled up. Imagine the joy when you open the character tree and see that - is it even possible? - even some of the hunter's skills are disabled. Unless you've paid even more money for the game, that is. Yeah, no.			"

												I could tell you so many things about this game.How it is charming, funny, addictive and actually has combat that is satisfying and weighty.I could tell you how this is the anti-Torchlight and anti-Diablo 3 in that it actually improves the ARPG genre by its mere existence.  That it isn't a cashgrab and it harkens back to the days when games were actually designed and had love and care put into them.How it is neither an ""evolution"" or ""revolution"" of the genre (or any other buzzword for that matter), but just a damn good game for once.But the only thing I need to tell you is that Abed from Community is the final boss.Happy hunting.  Best $20 you'll spend on Steam.			"

												My bf and I played this game as long-lost twin brothers Helsing van Helsing and Juan van Helsing accompanied by two 3sassy5us lady-ghosts. We enjoed this game sooooo much. It has qool mechanics, lots of diffrent ways to build your character and nice world (I loved ink locations).But one day... Almost at the end of the game... All story NPCs in the Secret Liar disappeared and there was no way to fix it. We tried to play on my bf's save but portal to the next location crashed. So... that was the end of our playthrough. We weren't even angry or something. We were sad.I'll play Van Helsing 2 or 3, but I can't reccomend Van Helsing 1 when bugs prevented me to finish it. Twice.			"

THis game  could have easliy been a lot better. One of the silly mistakes that they did is they have 3 classes to choose from But they are all Van Helsings just in different clothes.. They Might as well have stuck with one character and given him a tree allowing he to learn everything..In my opinion this game is  like a budget Diablo 3 But no where near as good. I will compare it to Diablo 3 throughout this review to give you a gadge since you have most probably played Diablo 3. Only really one character to choose from with a different skin and different item & skill setsIn Diablo 3 there are about 5 or 6 charactors to choose from The graphics are no where near as good as Diablo 3.The game gets boring a lot quicker the Diablo 3 did. As you can see I only have 1.7 hours on record.. That is because I  really could'nt be bothered playing any further Because its not a good game.Even if I try to justify it not being at the same level as Diablo 3  By saying this game only cost $14.95 and diablo 3 is $90, there are still better free options like path of exile and much better options at simular prices like Torch light 2..  I took a chance on this game because I got it for a $1 from HumbleBundle.com in one of their weekly sales so I dont feel bad about buying this game. But I would feel a but annoyed if I had paid $14.95Therefore I can not recomend this game.   If you really want to try it even after reading this review maybe buy it if it pops up again in one of the charity bundles or goes on sale at the steam store for 80-90% off or something.But don't pay full price for this or you will be disapointed "

												Now I know I may have given this game a thumbs down, but there is no “Meh” rating to give and I certainly wouldn’t give a whole hearted thumbs up.Let me start off by saying, I knew this game was going to be badish. I fully expected this game to be pure crap, but was pleasantly surprised that it was just slight crap. The voice acting, wow, its just so bad. Like they hired three people based on the number of silly voices they can make bad.I did however purchase this game Wanting to hear bad voice overs and just see how bad this game could be. So in that respect I was not disappointed.I do have to say the game functions just fine. There is nothing technically wrong with the game, the gameplay is boring and repetitive the same as the quests and missions. They crammed in some sort of tower defense game that seems a bit out of place. I purchased the expansions as well. The mage (or whatever they are calling the mage) seems ok, but if you are doing it right you will always be a glass cannon. If you spec into more durability then you wont do nearly enough damage to kill stuff and you end up taking more hits so it’s a wash.The engineer seems fun and has a flame thrower or ice thrower and lots of robot pets that run around attacking stuff.The loot however seem to be mostly geared toward the default vanilla character. Im not sure if it was just my experience or not, but it seem like most of the items dropped are geared towards the hunter class. Oh well at least my annoying ghost has a wide range of things to wear and use while she constantly talks and annoys me.Ultimately I liken playing this game to watching cheesy B minus movies, a guilty pleasure, but ultimately it will get old and you will long for a better experience.

												Okay, I can't really decide whether I for or against this game and I have valid reasons for that.First of all, as soon as you start the game there is already a in-game microtransaction thrown in your face (actually two of them) and this is if you want to change you character class (mage, hunter etc.) and I don't agree with that at all, you should be able to choose what class your character is without having to pay for it (DLC).The second thing about this game is the voice acting, It may or may not just be me but the voice acting in this game infuriates me, it's not that it's bad, it's just that there is clearly no effort put into the voices nor the dialogue, it is barable but that it one of the main reason why I stopped playing this game and requested a refund (I know it's a stupid reason but every player has their critism about a game and each player is different).Also, this game, oh my, it is UNBELIEVABLY hard, even on the 'normal' difficulty or I may just be complete♥♥♥♥♥♥at this game lmao..Another thing, the mechanics. Now i've played a few MMORPG games, such as, 'Path of Exile' 'Diablo 2-3' and I know what to expect when it comes to in game mechanics. The movement of your character is clunky, boring, slow and just confusing, controlling your character isn't as smooth as you'd like it to be and the skill tree, points, leveling system are absolutely rubbish. The game doesn't explain them in enough detail for you to completely understand them, basically throws you right into the deep end expecting you to understand it all as soon as you start playing. Now on to the good things about this game, the storyline, meh, I wouldn't say it's bad but it isn't the best MMORPG storyline I've ever played, gets really boring after about 1hr and a half and the combat system is great, exactly what you'd expect from an MMORPG game such as this. That's practically it, this game isn't worth the full price of £10.99, I got it in the sale at £2.74 and I still don't think it is worth it. If you're thinking about getting this game, check out 'Path of Exile' it is pretty much the same game but with a different aspect..also, it's free ;)!So unfortunately, i'm going to have to give this game a thumbs down, some people may or may not agree with my review but I think a lot of people do.

BUYERS BEWARE! There are alot of issues and bugs with this game, in terms of technical status, it IS unfinished.I really wanted to enjoy this game, I really enjoyed Victor Vran so I was interested in The Adventures Of Helsing, despite the recent horrible reviews, I decided to give it a shot anyways. Boy, am I sorry I did! From te moment it booted up and I went to the video options to configure everything, I noticed that the most common and standard resolutions (1080p to 4k) were missing when using Direct X11. However, when I switched to Direct X9, those resolutions were suddenly available. Theere are 'guides' to try to find a 'solution', by creating CustomResolution.Cfg text file in the games local files, however none of things have worked for me or other people who have had this problem with the game. Actually it made the game worse, now textures were missing and the bugs within the game seemed to be magnified.Since that didn't work, I was told that I had to re-install Dirext X11, so I did. Nothing happened, perfmormance stayed the same, next the dev told me to try it on a different monitor to see if that helped so I ended up trying it on 3 different monitors and 2 different pc's, both pc's being pretty strong in specs. Nothing changed, I think the developer knew that none of tis would really help... as others before me seemed to have this problem and never got the issue resolved.Finally, I reached out to the community, someone told me that the problem wa son my end, which is pretty ignorant considering that (a.) I rarely have any problems with games - when I do, they're easily fixed (b.) Other people are having this problem, not just me. THen they told me that I should re-download the game 3 times - as if the game had some sort of superstitious ritual to make it work correctly. Let's look for a second at how ridiculous this is getting.Needless to say, I refunded the game and won't be trying it again... ever. I spent nearly an hour of trying to fix this game and running in circles like a chicken with my head cut-off. I've done .ini and compatability altering for games before, so I knew what I was doing, but this... GETTING THIS GAME TO WORK WAS THE REAL MONSTER I WAS TRYING TO SLAY! The poor optimiaztion and lack of ease of use made this a bad experience. I couldn't recommend this to anyone, even at the low price of $3.74, save your money for a game that actually works the way it should and supports your desired resolution.Yes, I know that it works right for some of you fanboys out there but there are far more people having problems with this game and I'm not just talking about the horrible Mac build, I'm on Windows! Git gud developers or go home!			"

I like the concept, the clips on steam are nice. But for me, it's useless so far. Sure would like any suggestions anyone has on getting this to work. Support is useless of course, since they treat everyone like they just learned how to turn a computer on prior to asking support a question. Then, I might change my opinion.			"

												There's really nothing incredible about this game... It should be renamed to the mundane, boring, been done before adventures of some guy who looks like Van Helsing. It's been patched more times than Diablo 3 and D3 is still a much better game than this... which is a sad thing to even admit.Near the end I had to just stop playing it because it turns from a Diablo clone ARPG to a lame tower defense game that completely sucks the life out of you...

												It's not the game for me. Not even worth the $6 I paid for it, and the DLC. I don't understand why it has such a positive rating. Yes, the hours on record are correct. I only gave it half an hour's review.Edit: I played the game for half an hour. That's all I needed to determine I didn't enjoy the game. The max you can play a game before asking for a refund is 2 hours, I believe. I didn't ask for a refund. I didn't ask for a refund because, as it's been pointed out, I didn't research the game before I purchased it. That was my mistake, and I paid for it ($6). But my use of this feature is not improper. Had I done research, I wouldn't have liked the game anyway. It wouldn't have changed that. And I would have told people 'I don't like this game'. Since I did buy the game, I have access to this feature, and I used it. There are no facts here, this is opinion. Whether or not a game is good, is subjective.			"

They asked me, what platform im using and That´s all... That´s END from DEVS. Already im waiting around 39 days and still nothing, no fix no solution. I payed 10 euros for this game and no really i will not play this game in singleplayer. Well Im so angry already and probably this is  last game from NEOCORE DEVS. I can´t believe them. These guys are not the right Devs. Just my opinion, 39 days and still i must write them to they did something already. Summary:Lazy Developers= Broken game. Thumb down for me.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a mildly fun medieval style RPG that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Call me a ""filthy casual"" if you will, but that sort of bugs me because it takes me out of the game a little bit. For example, the town portal system is called a ""wishing well"" a.l.a. Harry Potter with their magical fireplaces. So they make a joke about it saying that it is a fake & they should just call it a teleporter. I'm trying to get really into my medieval fantasy world here, guys! Why would you crack these little inside jokes like that. I get sort of a campy ""Monty Python comedy sketch show"" vibe from it. That is not a bad thing but it's just a different mentality I suppose.A positive aspect of the game is that it is sort of along the lines of Diablo II or Diablo 3 but is set in 1700's Transylvania, instead. That is well & good but for a guy who has a couple hundred hours into D2 & a hundred or two into D3, that doesn't cut anything & doesn't seem impressive or convincing in the least. Basically this game is a disappointment if you are looking for some sort of alternative to the Diablo franchise of RPG games from the company Blizzard, Inc, but better. I suppose it is ok for what it is. Not a popular game.Final conclusion can be summed up thusly: ""Meh, it's OK."" Not really a showstopper or barnburner or ""game that changed the WORLD forever"" or anything like that. The graphics are a bit dated. I haven't played a whole lot of the game. 6/10 would buy but only if it were HEAVILY discounted & there was nothing going on on a Saturday afternoon or Friday evening after working the ol' day job. It does go good with a Starbucks Latte, so that's something I guess. On second thought, save your money. DON'T buy the game reviewed here!			"

												Relatively uninteresting Diablo clone.  The visual look is unappealing. The game play is clunky, with response to my XBox 360 controller erratic. For a 2013 game it feels 10 years older.  The colors are dull, the design uninspiring.  It's using almost none of the capacity of my GTX 1070.  This is too bad, the backstory in particular is interesting - an alternative European history mixed with steampunk tech.Ultimately uninspiring - especially compared to Diablo III.			"

												Hunter is a decent class to play, but early on, the Thaumaturge, even on normal, is really boring, and difficult.. Slow single target spell casts, fighting packs of 5+ enemies.. The main attack can take 3 to 5 hits to kill each enemy.. The hunter on the other hand, has the ability to melee, or range.. Default melee swings, or gun shots.. I enjoyed the game playing as the Van Helsing iconic class (Hunter), but really dislike how the Thaumaturge (spell caster) plays..There also arent that many abilities that you will be able to use.. There is an overly confusing, andf cumbersome Rage meter, that is used to enhance each ability at the click of a button, for a single use.. Each ability can be enhanced with  up to 3 boosters, and are activated by pressing spacebar.. Its just too much to try to deal with in the heat of combat, and ive never used them.. They take up precious ability points in the skill tree, and even when i tried speccing into them, never used them at all.. You initialise the boost, then click whichever ability you want boosted (and which boosts you want), and its used in the very next ability.. Can be reinitialised until rage is empty.. Its just too cumbersome, and the button layout is pretty bad as well.. It is customizable atleast, but once in game, youll see what i mean.. Its soo many keys to hit.. I think each class has like 9 abilities to choose from, a dozen of so tricks, and some auras.. All of which require the same ability points to rank up, and you must start at the top of the trees, and work your way down.. You will be aquiring skills whether you intend to use them  or not, to get to the more powerful ones below.. The music is almost non existant, and the ambient sounds are your basic birds chirping, etc.. The lack of sounds also adds to the dull atmosphere, inevitebly putting you to sleep..I wont get into the ""story"" as its pretty pathetic, for what could have been amazing.. Its Van Helsing, afterall, and this is so generic, and this ""Ink"" just makes it worse.. I really dont have much good to say about this series.. I really would pass on it..Is really badly optimized.. Im far above recommended specs, and the game gets below 20fps often.. Skimming through the discussions, theres dozens of people asking for help with the same issue..It really pisses me off that i have to turn off all the deent settings to play this game, which isnt really great looking to begin with..All in all, i would say pass on it, unless you are a di hard arpg fan, and absolutely need another title... Because theres not enough of them apparently, lol..  Poor performance is the killer here..			"

												let me start by saying that this game is loaded with issues. This game uses all of the mechanics of torchlight... except that theres only one class unless you buy all the dlc. That said the single player drops loot for said dlc classes even when you arnt playing them, half of my epic drops were for the other two classes. Next although you can respec all your attribute points and skills there is no way for your to respec perks, and you dont know if you should wait because they are unlocked at certain attribute levels. they give you an ally but i found it best to put them in passive mode and suck up a third of the damage i took, as they die pretty easily even on the lower difficulties. the skill system encourages you to get only two active skills and put the rest into passives, auras, and tricks. by the end of the game i was a walking pile of passives with a single target ability, an aoe ability, and a heal. the game starts off a little boring, and continues that way until you reach the end, which luckily isnt very far as this game felt pretty short as i found myself skipping most enemies in the later levels just because i wanted it to be over. they added a rage system then discouraged me from using it by giving me buffs when i was full rage so i ignored the entire system which says that it was a bad system. in short this game is a bad copycat of torchlight with dumbed down skill trees and classes that you have to pay for. skip this game and go play torchlight.

												Not bad overall, but gets boring after a while. Diablo clones are hard to do right, because its all about balance. Balance between amount of items dropped, amount of monsters encountered, etc. Van Helsing almost nails it, but still lacks a few touches. For instance, the amount of monsters is just ridiculous! Some skills tend to be useless, while some are overpowered. There is nothing to tell about the plot. Its a huge cliche with cheesy Holywood lines. Waste not your time if your after it. There are some nice innovations - the tower defence mode in which hordes of monsters come is ingineous addition. Also, lVan Helsing is a solid choice for those who like Diablo clones, but not if you're not into the genre.			"

												Characters and the game world of Van Helsing are beautiful and quirky immersing one in a fantasy world which feels alive with mystery horror and almost romantic if they had pushed it in that direction. Graphics are excellent and beats anything that has come out for this specific genre of Nox and Diablo style gameplay.  Sound effects are thrilling and action packed with whopping bombastic obliterating death at every turn.  Supernatural creatures of legend such as werewolves, ghosts, fiendish steam punk monstrousities are handled wonderfully giving a feeling of being in a horror movie or ghastly story by Mary Shelly.  Dialogue is one of the most fun I have had the pleasure to listen to since probably TWINSEN'S ADVENTURE way back in the 1990s. It really gives a realistic feel am talking to a living breathing being and not just game code. Very comedic and full of personality. The Incredible Adventures Of Van Helsing a magnificent work of gaming artistry and even more amazing is the incredibly low price they are offering for this hours upon hours of gaming joy.  Buy THE INCREDIBLE ADVENTURES OF VAN HELSING and let the gaming world know you support Developers who put all their effort and heart into creating something of intense fun and quality!			"

												This is a great game with great characters, soundtrack and story. This is a classic hack and slash style game with different skill trees to improve your character in different ways. Unfortunately there is only one base class which is Hunter, and to get other classes you need to buy the DLCs which is a pain. Yet this doesn't take away the level of fun because there are different ways to play this one class. You want to go range? Upgrade your gunslinging skills and fire away. Melee? Upgrade your blades and hack and slash your way through the game. There is a down-side, you will die A LOT and it costs A LOT to revive. Maybe its because I'm a noob, but I advise you that you will be swarmed with enemies. So really your going through the entire game shooting explosive rounds until they die. Your ghost partner in the game isnt all that useful. You will find yourself walking along then suddenly Katarina attacks something and you get swarmed with bad guys. Yet this game is great, I love and I just can't get enough of it. I advise you to buy the other classes because they come with different skill trees and weapons. The other classes consit of the Thaumaturge which is basicly a mage and Acane Mechanic, which gives you big♥♥♥♥♥guns that shoot electricity.  "

												[D] not as nice as it looks: few maps, levels and monsters, also boring attacking skills as you are limited to use like 1 or 2, i havent bought dlcs so i dont know but this game is not that nice. if you like killing a lot of stuff without caring about anything other you might like this, then look for it if its like 25% off+awesome looking maps+balanced gameplay-too few content-simple animations-buggy-expensive additional characters			"

												The biggest drawback is the sound effects. I didn't feel like I was doing much damage (regardless of my class) to the enemies because all I'd hear is a minor swish during a cleave attack. Or something menial during a supposed big attack. The art style may be great and they bring up a different battle system but I lost interest in this really quickly. Now that there's a sequel, I'm still reluctant to buying it.			"

The most time i play games I'm just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of by this damn dialogs I have to read but in this case i love them. :-)The only thing that's sad is that it's over very fast.There isn't much to accomplish since you've finished the campaign, because you can't get better stats after lvl 30. The only reason to play further is to get a better equip.Got it for 5€ and i still think it's worth more than twice this price!			"

												Gostei:1. História: bom trabalho de roteiro;2. Grágicos muito bons;3. O personagem pode ser evoluído do modo que bem entender (skills e atributos);4. O NPC pode ser configurado para colher itens que caem no chão automaticamente;5. O sistema de comparação de itens sendo utilizados e no inventário é excelente, no melhor estilo que já vi;6. As batalhas são bem feitas;7. Há conversas entre o personagem e o NPC, depois de um tempo fica um pouco repetitivo, mas gosto mesmo assim.8. Há momentos no jogo que o jogador só podefazer uma escolha correta se explorou detalhes de placas ou papéis com texto em parede (perguntas feitas por wisps), podia até aparecer um pouco mais;9. Boa variedade de monstros em cada nível;10. Não há uma base disponível logo no início do jogo, se chega a ela depois.Não gostei:1. Não tem cliente nativo para o Linux;2. Mapas são sempre iguais e não gerados ao criar o jogo, e pior: ocupam a maioria do espaço em disco utilizado pelo jogo, vários gigabytes;3. Demora bastante para carregar os mapas;4. Há somente uma base principal, eu acharia mais interessante se houvesse mais bases intermediárias;5. Máximo de somente 4 jogadores em modo multiplayer;6. Não se pode controlar ao mesmo tempo do teclado/mouse e do joystick, aliás, se o joystick estiver ligado, não há opção de usar o teclado;7. Ficou um pouco curto. Não cada fase, os mapas tem um tamanho bom, mas ficaria melhor com mais mapas.Não gostava mas modificaram:1. Agora os monstros de fases já completas voltam ao começar um novo jogo, antes não voltam;2. O suporte a controle era muito falho, agora está ótimo exceto por não poder mudar para teclado/mouse se este estiver ligado no momento que o jogo é iniciado. Ainda assim acho mais fácil teclado e mouse devido a maior facilidade e disponibilidade de configuração e comandos imediatos.Conclusão:O jogo é legal e vale seu preço, cerca de dez dólares.			"

												THE GOOD:FANTASTIC voice acting and writing  (Absolutely one of the highlights of this game)Characters actually feel like characters and not like bricksmusic is greatKatarina is AWESOME, totally fell head over heels for her  (useful in combat, witty companion, can be sent shopping)crafting system is easy and simple to useControlls are all fine, no issues that I could noticePlenty of abilities/skills, room for progession and making your own skill setUI is easy to navigate, standard fare for anyone who's played an ARPGPerfectly pretty to look at unless you're a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥some fun little easter eggs, classic indie easter egg attitudeart style fits Van Helsing pretty well, COULD be a bit darker but it's fine***fits that need for an ARPG for someone who's not into Diablo 2 and needs something less ""hardcore"", the loot collection is perfectly fine/great for the people I'm talking about, and the style of diablo 2 and path of exile is depressing for me and it's very hardcore compared to this, this game is more for everyone who HASN'T gotten into diablo 2 (not touching on 3, havn't played it and heard it's very different than 2)THE BAD This game has a VERY abrupt ending when I still felt like I was ready for a lot more of the game (NOTE:this will be partly influenced by how much you like it, but it's still short regardless)There are a good number of enemy types, but at a certain point around halfway or so through they start to blend together a bit cause they're all mutants and stuff, sort of felt like they were a little too similarsome screen tearingthe tower defense mini game is ""allright"", maybe ""good""you might feel a bit unattatched to the story, feels a little limp cause the game's so short. ""Hear about bad♥♥♥♥♥♥in the city, go there to take care of any evil business, fight stuff to get to the evil scientist doing it all"" might not cut it for you but part 2 should flesh it out a bitonly 3 classes and 2 of them are dlc, didn't bother me but I'll list it as a negative just to let everyone knowMORE OBJECTIVE SCORE :  7.5/10PERSONAL SCORE : Had a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of fun with this, about 100 hours, gasped and said ""OHO♥♥♥♥♥♥"" and preordered immediately when I saw part 2 is coming later this month, 10/10 would absolutely recommend if you're looking for an ARPG and don't judge the genre with Diablo 2 or PoE as a benchmark  "

												This game I picked up on a whim, and it turned out to be one of my, if not my absolute, favorite dungeon crawlers ever! The combat is visceral and has loads of impact and tons of play styles. Creature designs are interesting and varied. The loot system rains equipment upon you as frequently as the gore of your fallen foes.Graphically, for a 3/4 view dungeon crawler, this game looks fantastic! Character models are noticeably detailed and the environments look great. I'd say they are on par, and in some places, better than Diablo 3. Sound design is fantastic as well. The voice acting, while sometimes almost purposely cheesy, is very well done. The music, while not memorable, is not BAD. It just often gets drowned out by screaming and explosions. Story is decent as well. Not the games strong point, but no one plays dungeon crawlers for the story. However, I will say the story is significantly better than most I've played.Has several multi-player modes, but I haven't had the opportunity to play them, so I can't say how they are.The game has 2 glaring down sides, neither of them deal breaking:1 - I don't know if the game is optimized poorly, or what, but when you start the game, there is a very long pause, almost as if the game has frozen. There is no indication that anything is loading. After the first time it isn't an issue, but initially, it's jarring.2 - A similar problem happens with the loading screens. It takes quite a while for the loading ""bar"" to start to fill and the whole screen just reeks of ""frozen game"". I've nearly Alt+F4 many times because I assumed it had frozen.Only other bad thing I can think of is the game is pretty short. A max level cap of 30 and a 10 hour campaign feel prematurely ended. I wanted more of this game very badly, but for $15, I can't complain to much. I will definitely keep an eye out for Neocore games in the future			"

												let me start by saying that this game is loaded with issues. This game uses all of the mechanics of torchlight... except that theres only one class unless you buy all the dlc. That said the single player drops loot for said dlc classes even when you arnt playing them, half of my epic drops were for the other two classes. Next although you can respec all your attribute points and skills there is no way for your to respec perks, and you dont know if you should wait because they are unlocked at certain attribute levels. they give you an ally but i found it best to put them in passive mode and suck up a third of the damage i took, as they die pretty easily even on the lower difficulties. the skill system encourages you to get only two active skills and put the rest into passives, auras, and tricks. by the end of the game i was a walking pile of passives with a single target ability, an aoe ability, and a heal. the game starts off a little boring, and continues that way until you reach the end, which luckily isnt very far as this game felt pretty short as i found myself skipping most enemies in the later levels just because i wanted it to be over. they added a rage system then discouraged me from using it by giving me buffs when i was full rage so i ignored the entire system which says that it was a bad system. in short this game is a bad copycat of torchlight with dumbed down skill trees and classes that you have to pay for. skip this game and go play torchlight.

												Not bad overall, but gets boring after a while. Diablo clones are hard to do right, because its all about balance. Balance between amount of items dropped, amount of monsters encountered, etc. Van Helsing almost nails it, but still lacks a few touches. For instance, the amount of monsters is just ridiculous! Some skills tend to be useless, while some are overpowered. There is nothing to tell about the plot. Its a huge cliche with cheesy Holywood lines. Waste not your time if your after it. There are some nice innovations - the tower defence mode in which hordes of monsters come is ingineous addition. Also, lVan Helsing is a solid choice for those who like Diablo clones, but not if you're not into the genre.			"

Fast action, lots of cool monsters and a fun story filled with great voice acting and amusing dialogue both from the main character and his trusty side kick the ghost Katarina. This game has a lot of great style and the soundtrack is AMAZING! Very fun game.			"

												Though this game appears to be perfect from the outside, i was severly dissapointed with the memory loss that occurs during multiplayer.

We looked up online soonafter to find other people having the same bad experiences with the data loss.  Do not buy this game unless you are willing to only play the solo story mode.♥♥♥♥ this game, waste of money, waste of time, and unneccessary frustatration.

												If you want Diablo with personality, then look no further. The characters and world are interesting enough, and the back and forth between the two protagonists definately entertains. There are also a select few ""role playing"" moments where you make decisions that affect the outcome of quests. But don't expect a very deep experience on the interaction front. This is a very scripted Diablo clone. Much like Diablo 3.However if you just want to jump in and kill things, you may be slightly let down. The character stat and skill building is interesting and unique, and quite fun. But you have to buy DLCs in order to play multiple classes, and the combat itself becomes a mindless ""grind and run away"" excercise quite often.If you want world and characters, this is great. But if you want FUN, your money is probably better spent somewhere else. Namely, Torchlight II.However I still recommend this title if you're tired of Torchlight, Diablo, or Path of Exile.			"

												For what it is it is...meh.  From Torchlight to Diablo to even Wildtangents Fate series there are just better options.  The story is interesting but begins to drag very quickly and once you make it to the second act the game is money juggling for resurrections.  If the class DLC had been included up front and it had tiered difficulty where you could carry over after you finish on a lower difficulty then I would mark it better but as of now it's being uninstalled and I recommend people demo or play at a friends before considering buying this game.

												This game has pretty stunning visuals, and before starting I had a lot of high hopes for it, and expected gameplay to complementary the beautiful graphics very well. And sadly, it doesn't exactly. Combats don't feel very exciting, and so far it's pretty much the typical RPG grindfest for gold (well what was I expecting?). The existence of decent equipment from shops  and the exorbitant prices isn't a very nice design touch, as it creates shallow treadmill goals that encourage mindless grinding.An upside though is that with that price this game is quite a steal. Not as good as I expected, but I don't regret the purchase. I will most definitely explore the game some more. If you're a newcomer of the genre and looking for a great WRPG/ARPG experience to get your feet wet then I think this game isn't really for you. But if you've hard into the genre then this game is quite a decent one and worth trying for the price it's asking for.			"

												Characters and the game world of Van Helsing are beautiful and quirky immersing one in a fantasy world which feels alive with mystery horror and almost romantic if they had pushed it in that direction. Graphics are excellent and beats anything that has come out for this specific genre of Nox and Diablo style gameplay.  Sound effects are thrilling and action packed with whopping bombastic obliterating death at every turn.  Supernatural creatures of legend such as werewolves, ghosts, fiendish steam punk monstrousities are handled wonderfully giving a feeling of being in a horror movie or ghastly story by Mary Shelly.  Dialogue is one of the most fun I have had the pleasure to listen to since probably TWINSEN'S ADVENTURE way back in the 1990s. It really gives a realistic feel am talking to a living breathing being and not just game code. Very comedic and full of personality. The Incredible Adventures Of Van Helsing a magnificent work of gaming artistry and even more amazing is the incredibly low price they are offering for this hours upon hours of gaming joy.  Buy THE INCREDIBLE ADVENTURES OF VAN HELSING and let the gaming world know you support Developers who put all their effort and heart into creating something of intense fun and quality!			"

												Much better than the rating shows.  Van Helsing is a ARPG that actually delivers better than Path of Exile or Diablo III.  For the price, this is a must have.  The gameplay is very good and similar to either PoE or DIII, but what sells this game is the dark atmosphere, playful banter between Van Helsing and Katarina, and a fun storyline.  It is great when you have consistent voice acting throughout the game.  Even little side quests result in conversations with characters that aren't too long, yet keep you engaged in the title.  The skill system, while not as good as PoE, still allows you to customize your character to fit your style.  The customization is not limited to Van Helsing and also allows you to compliment your skills with that of your companion (Katarina).  Overall, if you are a fan of ARPG games, this is a must have and probably the most enjoyable experience I've had since Diablo II in this genre.			"

												So here is the deal... this is a 9 out of 10 game that currently only gets a 7 out of 10 on the Mac due to an abundance of memory leak crashing bugs that make the game rather frustrating at times, especially around Gallowsbog and the Abandonded Research Station areas.  Luckily the game autosaves very regularly and I have not had to repeat alot of sections after each crash as in other games.  This means if you grin and bear it you can get thru the troubled sections fo the game and then it seems to stabalize and play very well.  Truth is, it is a very fun game and at least for me was worth the effort to get thru the bugs.  While I hated Diablo 3, this game built on their game engine is a blast filled with steampunky goodness and very much worth a play... and get the DLC, the Arcane Mechanic is exceptionally cool.			"

												Gostei:1. História: bom trabalho de roteiro;2. Grágicos muito bons;3. O personagem pode ser evoluído do modo que bem entender (skills e atributos);4. O NPC pode ser configurado para colher itens que caem no chão automaticamente;5. O sistema de comparação de itens sendo utilizados e no inventário é excelente, no melhor estilo que já vi;6. As batalhas são bem feitas;7. Há conversas entre o personagem e o NPC, depois de um tempo fica um pouco repetitivo, mas gosto mesmo assim.8. Há momentos no jogo que o jogador só podefazer uma escolha correta se explorou detalhes de placas ou papéis com texto em parede (perguntas feitas por wisps), podia até aparecer um pouco mais;9. Boa variedade de monstros em cada nível;10. Não há uma base disponível logo no início do jogo, se chega a ela depois.Não gostei:1. Não tem cliente nativo para o Linux;2. Mapas são sempre iguais e não gerados ao criar o jogo, e pior: ocupam a maioria do espaço em disco utilizado pelo jogo, vários gigabytes;3. Demora bastante para carregar os mapas;4. Há somente uma base principal, eu acharia mais interessante se houvesse mais bases intermediárias;5. Máximo de somente 4 jogadores em modo multiplayer;6. Não se pode controlar ao mesmo tempo do teclado/mouse e do joystick, aliás, se o joystick estiver ligado, não há opção de usar o teclado;7. Ficou um pouco curto. Não cada fase, os mapas tem um tamanho bom, mas ficaria melhor com mais mapas.Não gostava mas modificaram:1. Agora os monstros de fases já completas voltam ao começar um novo jogo, antes não voltam;2. O suporte a controle era muito falho, agora está ótimo exceto por não poder mudar para teclado/mouse se este estiver ligado no momento que o jogo é iniciado. Ainda assim acho mais fácil teclado e mouse devido a maior facilidade e disponibilidade de configuração e comandos imediatos.Conclusão:O jogo é legal e vale seu preço, cerca de dez dólares.			"

Albeit a bit clunky at first, if you can look past beyond that, then this game is definitely one to go for if you're a die-hard ARPG fan such as me. The settings and scenario that the game offers is quite unique, and each area has its own personality to it. The monsters themselves are quite challenging even when on normal, and I'm finding that ARPGs with challenging aspects such as this is something that some ARGPs are lacking. The character level-up design is quite straightforward and isn't too challenging to understand, especially for people who recently are into the whole ARPG scene. Again, this game is one of the better ARPGs I've played. I recommend playing this first before going into the sequel.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is an action role-playing video game Diablo clone that focuses on the trials of young Van Helsing and has nothing to do with the movie of the same name. It is set in a fictional gothic-noir steampunk 19th-century Eastern Europe.Graphics wise, while it will not be taking any awards, it is still pleasing to look at, and quite atmospheric looking especially when portraying the haunted misty looking fictional eastern european forests. The character models however look quite crude. In short, the graphics is serviceable, but unremarkable.Gameplay for the main campaign will take about 13 hours depending on your playstyle and is basically the same as most other Diablo Clones. It borrows alot of the mechanics and ideas from other games especially from the Torchlight series in its use of Pets. Instead of having pets in this game however, you will have a female ghost companion called Lady Katarina who not only helps you sell items like the pets in Torchlight, you can actually level her up as a very formidable helper who is surprisingly very useful in the game.Another interesting part is a mini tower defence game at the later part of the game, which I thought was quite refreshing as I have not yet seen any Action RPGs that adds this mode yet. While it doesn't really add much to the game, and only serves as a side distraction, it is a nice addition.Music consists mostly of slow and sombre pieces which complements its setting very well, and is competently done. Voice work for both Van Helsing and Katarina is competent and i enjoyed their witty banter with each other. The voice work for the other NPCs however feels like they're overacting most of the time, trying very hard to fake that Eastern European accent.Now as for the downsides, the backstory of the game is very unremarkable and completely forgettable. While other games of this genre also suffer the same issues storywise, for some reason, I just cannot immerse myself into this game. Maybe its because the game doesn't take itself seriously or maybe its the fact that for a game called ""Van Helsing"" you never actually get into a combat with a single Vampire, not even the last boss is a vampire. (Actually there is only 1 vampire in the entire game, and he's only a friendly NPC.)Enemy AI are also very simplistic, and most of the time, the game's only challenge is to simply throw lots of creeps in huge group at your face forcing you to kite 90% of the time.Loot is very bland and lacks in variation visually. It seems that there are only a very limited selection of items that visually alters your characters and most of them just look the same as any other.The other bad point is unfortunately the overall play control which is especially bad because play control is probably the most important aspect of any Action RPGs. While this game allows the use of WASD movement via keyboard (probably one of the rare ones that allow this), the execution is just downright terrible. Example: Lets say if you were to try to move in one direction, then press the Shift key to stand in place and attack incoming mobs, the next time you release the keys, you may actually find the character automatically continue to move forward on his own and can only stop when you press the corresponding movement key. More then once this caused me to die unnecessary deaths because I simply couldn't move away from mobs when they start swarming me. This bug also seems to happen if you use only mouse clicks to move, and is extremely frustrating and almost destroys what enjoyment i had from the game. There is also a Co-op mode, but I haven't had a chance to try that with a friend so I cannot comment about if it functions well or not.Overall Rating: 6.0 / 10An average Action RPG, while not as polished or as refined as the Torchlight or Diablo Series, does show some promise. Its worth a look if you can get it at a cheap sale. The movement bug I mentioned in the review is really very frustrating and I hope that they can get it resolved soon.			"

												Was the Diablo series one of your favorite games in the early 2000's? Do you like steampunk? Gothic monsters? Parodoxical references to literature and pop-culture? If any--or, especially, all--of these questions have a positive answer, this game is for you. It features witty voiced banter between a monster hunter and his ghostly companion, levels of damage that could be considered ""Too Damn High"" and quite an array of interesting monsters. The main storyline is about 15-20 hours long, depending how effecient you are at killing things, filled with traditional hack-and-slash murder, plus a couple tower defence scenarios. While the story is a bit short, there are scenarios for higher-level players, with bigger and better loot, and also a never-ending story mode, which starts you back at the beginning, just with tougher monsters, better items, and even moar damage.If you're looking for a ARPG with good replay value, decent mechanics, and some cool gimicks, this is the game for you. (Even more so because of its price tag. $20 for the game +all dlc)			"

												Remember back in the 90s when you would still discover new things about the characters you played halfway through the game? The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing takes you back to those days. The skill-and ability systems are layered and complex and will require you to think them through and test them out thoroughly. Even on normal mode, this game is a challenge, even more so when you are joined by friends. For some players this complexity will be a turn-off, but for others it will be a welcome challenge.Great design, over-the-top but funny voice-acting and a nice challenge for those who wish it.			"

												Wonderfully designed ARPG video game which could give other games in the same genre (like Path of Exile) a run for the money, if improved upon on a grand scale. Relatively limited in multiplayer potential due to its single player-intended audience, indie nature, and lack of population (as of current).Gameplay is great. The learning curve in the beginning is slightly difficult due to the extensive multitasking involved (in addition to two main attack skills bound to your mouse buttons, their upgrades, and health and mana potions, you must also use supportive skills, called Tricks, totaling four different elements you must consider at all times).However, you are given a unique AI companion called ""Lady Katarina"", who has a uniquely designed AI that is well-balanced and serves as if it were a real partner playing in the game with you. Luckily, she only requires minimal maintenance and guidance, as she can handle herself perfectly fine.Some conveniences offered are the ability to pause the game (in single player), and switch to and from multiplayer at any time. Progress is saved regardless of which mode you choose, and you can toggle the option for the game to create a new instance (respawn all enemies) at your own discretion. The game is incredibly optimized, and ""alt-tabbing"" occurs instantly, without screen load.Unlike other similar games, where 'scrolls' are necessary to identify items or warp back to home, Van Helsing offers them for free, unlimited, and at any time (item identification is generally limited to 'Unique' items and 'set items', which are an uncommon drop in themselves, and there is a Town Portal button placed on your screen for convenient escape at any time). The Town Portal button is also convenient to have in times the game truly does glitch and you are unable to get out.The game is limited in scope due to the availability of only three kinds of characters, two of which are unlocked from DLC purchases (I purchased a Humble Bundle, so these were already included). These kinds are essentially melee, magic, and ranged, and characters are incapable of utilizing equipment from other classes.Although post-game continuation is implemented in the form of ""Scenarios"" (essentially ""challenge missions"" often seen in other games), and ""Neverending Story"" (known familiarily as ""New Game +"" to most gamers), the introduction of its sequel has since reduced the desirability of it in this game.There are many other pros to be said about this game, but I will leave it to you to try it yourself. It is definitely a recommend, and it is definitely worth the money (especially if you fetch it on sale). Overall, I would give the game an honest 7.5/10 for being superbly solid (based on an pseudo-IMDb rating scheme, where 9-10 is beyond excellent). It doesn't quite reach an 8 as it has its flaws, but it cannot be given a 7 as they are insignificant to the overall game.			"

												Awesome Diablo/Torchlight clone, great atmosphere and backstory and it is PACKED with easter eggs. References are made to a certain game that is similar.....very funny too..However i have one issue with this game; Level caps at 30, which is kind of strange. The maps are not procedural, maybe that is why, i dunno. .The skill tree is set up in such a way as to make you think you'd get to about level 50-80, It just seems way too short. I barely managed to work my way half-way through *some* of the skills. Once you get your character to level 30 it's pretty much game over unless you want to fight progressivly harder monster but remain at the same level while trying to improve your gear.... Thing is though, the gear you finish up with is usually about as good as it gets anyway. and the fights are exactly the same, same monsters, same maps, just takes longer... for virtually NO reward. .This is a single play-through game. Once you finish it you will probably put it aside. Great game though for what it is.			"

												It's like Diablo 3 but you play a badass vampire werewolf zombie hunter. You even get a ghost AI to play co op. I use her as a tank and play DPS but you could also focus on magics, be the tank yourself, or you both just go rambo and shoot them all with dual pistols.			"

												well i mostly recomend this game, but not for MACs users, simply because of poorly  optimization for that platform.Overall game have more troubles with technical parts than with gameplay part. But what use of gamesplay if you actualy cant enjoy game (cant kill boss, cant loot, and have lags)The game it self prety descent and have few interesting ideas, like hiden lairs -your ""home"" where you can upgrade defense traps and forge, and yes mobs will attack you Lair, so trap will do thay job. Or you can be thrown on hostile area when try to telepotr somewhere (it happens random).Also game have fresh atmosphere of steampunk world (nice breath from all the phantasy themes). But there is some parts i dont like here. Firstly all skills have addition powers that trigers after you charge energy during fight, the more energy you charge -more strong effect triger. So this looks abit silly for me, cos game have setting for auto using this powers. Also game have setting for autodrink potions. I dont like thos options in games if you ask me. It looks abit unfair and actualy gives you easy times with killing mobs. Second part i didnt like -is poorly made addition classes, like Helsing mage and Helsing engineer. I dont know how about others but for me thos two charracters dont look so cool like original helsing with 2 pistols or sword. I think mage animations must be more descent, but not standing like a tree and simply point hes hand toward enemy...Also big part of game for me me make visual joy from my char wearing epic items(comparing classic Helsing and mage, engineer types): huge sword -i would say YES! awesome pistols -YES! coold looking Helsing hat- YES!; gas mask and  fire extinguisher - EHM....not sure here...; helloween bird like mask - definately NO!So mostly game enjoable but i dont sure about DLCs and with alot of patches.

												For the genre of ARPG this game stands out among those like Path of Exile and Torchlight as the spiritual successors to Diablo 2.   What makes this game more unique is its story, and its skill system.   It takes the story of Van Helsing and throws you into the very midst of a gothic era where monsters rule the landscape.    With only the basic class to choose from unless you get DLC there isn't much variety in the terms of classes, but in my opinion the DLC is worth the price because it gives you two other, very unique classes to play that give a very distinct flavor to the game with each class you play.  With a full fledged multiplayer system, friends make this game even more enjoyable as you go on a monster hunting romp through a forest with your buddies.All in all, 8/10. Would Play.			"

												Wonderfully designed ARPG video game which could give other games in the same genre (like Path of Exile) a run for the money, if improved upon on a grand scale. Relatively limited in multiplayer potential due to its single player-intended audience, indie nature, and lack of population (as of current).Gameplay is great. The learning curve in the beginning is slightly difficult due to the extensive multitasking involved (in addition to two main attack skills bound to your mouse buttons, their upgrades, and health and mana potions, you must also use supportive skills, called Tricks, totaling four different elements you must consider at all times).However, you are given a unique AI companion called ""Lady Katarina"", who has a uniquely designed AI that is well-balanced and serves as if it were a real partner playing in the game with you. Luckily, she only requires minimal maintenance and guidance, as she can handle herself perfectly fine.Some conveniences offered are the ability to pause the game (in single player), and switch to and from multiplayer at any time. Progress is saved regardless of which mode you choose, and you can toggle the option for the game to create a new instance (respawn all enemies) at your own discretion. The game is incredibly optimized, and ""alt-tabbing"" occurs instantly, without screen load.Unlike other similar games, where 'scrolls' are necessary to identify items or warp back to home, Van Helsing offers them for free, unlimited, and at any time (item identification is generally limited to 'Unique' items and 'set items', which are an uncommon drop in themselves, and there is a Town Portal button placed on your screen for convenient escape at any time). The Town Portal button is also convenient to have in times the game truly does glitch and you are unable to get out.The game is limited in scope due to the availability of only three kinds of characters, two of which are unlocked from DLC purchases (I purchased a Humble Bundle, so these were already included). These kinds are essentially melee, magic, and ranged, and characters are incapable of utilizing equipment from other classes.Although post-game continuation is implemented in the form of ""Scenarios"" (essentially ""challenge missions"" often seen in other games), and ""Neverending Story"" (known familiarily as ""New Game +"" to most gamers), the introduction of its sequel has since reduced the desirability of it in this game.There are many other pros to be said about this game, but I will leave it to you to try it yourself. It is definitely a recommend, and it is definitely worth the money (especially if you fetch it on sale). Overall, I would give the game an honest 7.5/10 for being superbly solid (based on an pseudo-IMDb rating scheme, where 9-10 is beyond excellent). It doesn't quite reach an 8 as it has its flaws, but it cannot be given a 7 as they are insignificant to the overall game.			"

												Well this definitely wasn't Incredible.And for a lack of a better pun it could be just as well renamed to Van HELLsing.First of all - I nearly ruined my mouse on this pointless hack-n-slashery.Second - too many traits and skills and you STILL have a snowball's chance in hell of surviving.Third - often the enemies swarm you so densely, that the whole thing turns into one big ugly clusterf**k.Fourth - You have to pay a subscription fee or whatnot to get better drops and toughen up? Excuse you, but that's just dumb marketting if the game is unentertaining to begin with.Fifth - Let's not even get started on the wannabe-witty story and dialogue.Sixth - woo graphics. However, the gorgeous setting and design gets outweighed by crappy gameplay and everything else.Seventh - savepoints/checkpoints are far between. If you need to stop playing sooner for any reasonable reason, everything respawns and you can start all over again.Eighth - A game shouldn't motivate you to hoard ALL the items dropped just to sell them off.Ninth - When you get repeatedly swarmed and cannot survive a full 10 seconds upon entering a new location that's poor level design.and last - don't. waste. your. money.

Not just sit at a ""System Requirements being measured"" screen for god knows how long, only to figure out you've been waiting for over 4 hours for it to load. Point is, it doesn't work. I've tried it on not one, but two different computers. BOTH with the requirements to play it, and it just crashes at the first screen. I've asked for help on forums, and no one has a decent mindset to give me feedback.

												This game I picked up on a whim, and it turned out to be one of my, if not my absolute, favorite dungeon crawlers ever! The combat is visceral and has loads of impact and tons of play styles. Creature designs are interesting and varied. The loot system rains equipment upon you as frequently as the gore of your fallen foes.Graphically, for a 3/4 view dungeon crawler, this game looks fantastic! Character models are noticeably detailed and the environments look great. I'd say they are on par, and in some places, better than Diablo 3. Sound design is fantastic as well. The voice acting, while sometimes almost purposely cheesy, is very well done. The music, while not memorable, is not BAD. It just often gets drowned out by screaming and explosions. Story is decent as well. Not the games strong point, but no one plays dungeon crawlers for the story. However, I will say the story is significantly better than most I've played.Has several multi-player modes, but I haven't had the opportunity to play them, so I can't say how they are.The game has 2 glaring down sides, neither of them deal breaking:1 - I don't know if the game is optimized poorly, or what, but when you start the game, there is a very long pause, almost as if the game has frozen. There is no indication that anything is loading. After the first time it isn't an issue, but initially, it's jarring.2 - A similar problem happens with the loading screens. It takes quite a while for the loading ""bar"" to start to fill and the whole screen just reeks of ""frozen game"". I've nearly Alt+F4 many times because I assumed it had frozen.Only other bad thing I can think of is the game is pretty short. A max level cap of 30 and a 10 hour campaign feel prematurely ended. I wanted more of this game very badly, but for $15, I can't complain to much. I will definitely keep an eye out for Neocore games in the future			"

												This for me was one of the highligts of the last sale, very competently done, good dialogue, very impressive and well detailed backdrops, a decent variety of things to kill and a competently done Diablo 2-esque control and combat system. The main star of the show in this game for me is the setting, a steampunk inspired continuation of the story of Van Helsing. There is even a little off colour humour from your companion, and this is even played just right so it doesn't become overbearing.Another pleasant feature is the depth of the world, there's loads of little side missions you can do that you discover during your travels, they don't affect the main plot but they add so much flavour to the world.  The game does have its downsides however, it can vary greatly in difficulty in places, varying from very, very easy to punishingly difficult, this isn't too much of a problem though and can be easily overlooked. There is also a tower defence section, while optional I really don't like tower defence and found it kind of tacked on and unnecessary. Yes it's all been done before but does that make it any less fun? I don't think so, I'd give it a 8/10			"

												I love this game, I beat it with the original hunter class but right now I'm going through it with the Tharmaturge class, and might I say it is the best DLC I have ever purchased, although it should have been in the game in the first place. I love the combat and the balance to the games items, giving you just enough power in the new guns, swords, gauntlets, ect... You feel like a total badass after you have your favorite setup throughout the skill tree, powers, auras, and perks. For instance I have both of the Ice and Lightning skills maxed out (which is simple but effective), I have a dash to get away from danger since as a Tharmaturge I am easy to kill and the secondary power allows me to expend all of my mana in order to do a significant amount of damage. Almost everything in this game, I love, the only bad thing to me is that the second part isn't going to be out for a little while. So Neocore please make the game soon and if possible have to where if we played the first one we can bring over our character, oh and add some randomized dungeons, more customization options and more character classes i.e. Frankenstein's monster, Werewolfs, and Vampires. (They all exist in the lore) As you can see I love this game, and do I reccomend it, HELL YA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you want to play with me send me a friend request we can play.			"

												Overall, it reminded me of Diablo 2 with updated Graphics... Definitely mimics many aspects of the iconic game.Graphics were nice, and there were many extra events that just popped up that kept the player on his toes (for example... teleporting through the warp gate... only finding yourself stuck in some random location to fight out of).Maps were pre-planned and not randomly generated, which was nice for the casual player, however the replay-ability of the game is quite hampered by this.The drop system and the stats randomization/drop was perfect. It really felt that you and your follower got stronger as the game progressed.The stat system was intuitive and was taken from Diablo2. For the 'mage' class, skills leveled up in an obvious path, and the progression to get stronger was intuitive when picking skills.Downsides: The game loads extremely slow, between maps as well as starting the game (every single time!!!).There were times of stuttering and it seemed like the auto-detect for my video system somehow told the game to leave all the dead bodies lying about.. which made my game stutter.Some quests were not very intuitive such as finding X of some item, sometimes the quest required you to flip over corpses... which weren't highlighted and even worse sometimes blended into the background. Hated running through an area twice to look for a specific corpse to turn over.I would give this a game 8.9/10... but due to those graphical and quest bug/decisions... this game is a 7.5/10, a steep drop.Looking forward to the sequel though.

												Pros and cons in that order:-Simple quests and followups-Easy to learn enchantments and gear modifications-Good storyline-Great dialogues with puns and jokes all the time-The music is godlike-Semi-god pathing , sometimes interferes with playstyle due to the simply terrific level design-Areas not too large but not too small either with great fillers / side quests|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||-Too few skill options, the class i played (mage-like) had too many lategame channel spells-Hard to distribute attribute points when the items provided give proper stats towards your class but can't scale into lategame with that alone... Basically glass cannon isnt an option really because you'll end up eating pots whenever they are off cooldown so you're forced into playing a hybrid , except for the engineer who has turrets to aggro / tank-Cannot build follower the proper way you'd want her to be. I.e. tanky-Very repetitive monster abilities, nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to champion - elite mobs-Would've liked a few more skill points and a not so forced skill tree-Late game abilities with the mage are pretty much♥♥♥♥♥unless you build tanky but then you will lack the spellpower to do any damage so not really sure how all abilities are meant to be channeled in the lategame.All in all I enjoyed the game. The feel it had and the fun I had with the characters outweighs the cons so in my book it is a game worth playing through (storywise) but I doubt that I will return to it to grind some more. The multiplayer didn't seem very interesting so I didn't play it too much but like I said, overall it is worth your time and money ( in my oppionion ).I played a Thaumaturge going for some max Ice Shards followed by Ink Jump, Control. Basically using those with Mirror Image which has pretty nice single target dps while I went for CC and AoE. Worked fine to 30 but like I said, would've loved to try some other builds.Focus for anyone working on the game would be breaking the barriers of having to rely on your companion and make the items abit more unique and rewarding, especially on higher levels otherewhise noone will bother playing after max level. Also needs more Ink portals efter max level with unique bosses in them in order to have proper fights testing your gear and skill and award the player with items he will use and seek to upgrade.Cheers for reading, now go slay some monsters !

												I had never heard of this game prior to it being bundled in part of the last Humble Bundle.  From what I have played so far, I can make the following observations:1. It has similar controls to Diablo 3 (some skills have power ups that you buy using skill points you receive when you level up, some of these power ups need to be manually activated rather than an add on)2. They borrowed heavily from Diablo 3 in that gold, potions, quest items, and essences (gems/item enhancments used in socketed items) are automatically picked up3. Huge emphasis placed on gear4. Leveling up is closer to Diablo 2 than Diablo 3. Every level you gain 5 attribute points to distribute among body (combination of str and vit), Willpower (intellect), Luck (magic find, gold find), and finally dexterity (important for ranged attacks), plus you gain 3 skills points to use in a skill tree. This can be used to level up your current skills, unlock new skills, or purchase the add on abilities mentioned previously5. There is a reputation leveling system (seperate from your character's leveling up) that is similar to the system from Torchlight.  When your reputation gains a level you can unlock a new perk (an example is one of them gives you a +50 to poison resistance and increases the effectiveness of potions by 10%)The game's setting is easily described as steampunk, you play the titular character Van Helsing (well his son, who carries the Van Helsing name) in an eastern European country.  All of the enemies have names that are Slavic in origin, and overall the game has a very late 19th century to early 20th century vibe.  In fact playing through the game reminds me of the Leviathan book series and almost like a Diablo version of Arcanum (ie less emphasis on RPG and more emphasis on hack and slash) in an odd way.  I have been playing as the mage class, and my only gripe is that you are incredibly underpowered at the start of the game. As the game progresses you will obviously gain abilities to clear enemies faster, but for the early and mid game you may feel over whelmed in no small part due to the lack of an effective AOE. "

												Had a lot of fun playing this game. If you like RPGs, this might fit your tastes very well. It only took me and my friend 15 hours to finish it, but the time was worth and so was the effort. The characters are sometimes funny which makes this game even more satisfying to play. Story: 8/10.

												Well this definitely wasn't Incredible.And for a lack of a better pun it could be just as well renamed to Van HELLsing.First of all - I nearly ruined my mouse on this pointless hack-n-slashery.Second - too many traits and skills and you STILL have a snowball's chance in hell of surviving.Third - often the enemies swarm you so densely, that the whole thing turns into one big ugly clusterf**k.Fourth - You have to pay a subscription fee or whatnot to get better drops and toughen up? Excuse you, but that's just dumb marketting if the game is unentertaining to begin with.Fifth - Let's not even get started on the wannabe-witty story and dialogue.Sixth - woo graphics. However, the gorgeous setting and design gets outweighed by crappy gameplay and everything else.Seventh - savepoints/checkpoints are far between. If you need to stop playing sooner for any reasonable reason, everything respawns and you can start all over again.Eighth - A game shouldn't motivate you to hoard ALL the items dropped just to sell them off.Ninth - When you get repeatedly swarmed and cannot survive a full 10 seconds upon entering a new location that's poor level design.and last - don't. waste. your. money.

												while the dialog between you and your sidekick is quite funnly and setting is quite interesting i really cant recommend this game since the attack animations are really weak. Unlike diablo or torchlight your attacks seems to have no meaty animations. To be frankly most of the time i really cant tell my attacks are hitting the enemies or not.Also another really big major issue is the size of the mana and health indicators. They are too small for comfort, you have to actually take your eyes of the combat and check your hp and mana. There is a auto drink hp potions option on the menu but since i liked managing my potions myself i really didnt enjoy the game when this option is turned on.			"

												The game plays similarly to other ARPG's such as the Diablos and Path of Exile. The story is unique in the sense that it draws strongly from the Van Helsing lore and the steampunk styling of it doesn't appear in many other ARPG's. The game is still quite buggy as there are many skills that quite inbalanced (looking at you fire pillar and electro ball) and some classes are definitely better than others but it seems that the developers are still actively pushing out updates and fixes. Definitely worth getting and playing through if you're interested in the styling of the game, the story, or are a big fan of ARPG's but don't expect it to be a perfectly polished product.			"

												This Van Helsing game is great...if you look pass the bugs, that areas lag when you start them up because there're so many monsters in there (lag reduces as you kill them off), wierd glitches with your character (lag based once again), that certain quests doesn't work and you sometimes can't progress forwards and needs to type something in console 'cos the developers released a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game.Ok I might be a tad too harsh, 'cos really, they're fixing alot of bugs every second week or so, but it really reduced my positive experince to more of a ""meh"". I played this game 'cos I didn't want to play Diablo III, and to be fair it can be alot of fun (massive amounts of monsters, overwhelming sometimes actually, that you have to shoot/cut your way through, VERY satisfying, nice enviroments etc), but all the bugs, the lag, and lack of optimisation really gets to ya after a while.So final verdict: If you want to slay a billion monsters whilst also being tactical about it (or you get swarmed!), this is the game for you. If you want the game to run super smooth whilst doing it...nah, prepare to adapt. To me this game is a 5.5/10. Cheers!			"

												Very fun Diablo/Path of Exile style game but with a few things that improve on that. The control you have over your companion is beautiful. You can set them up to fight melee or ranged style combat and even switch stances on the fly. You can also have them pick up loot for you and even decide which kinds of loot and quality level of the loot. Graphics are very good with big chunks of body parts flying when you explode them and building pools of blood if you fight in same area for a battle. Very original and fun storyline with great bits of humor thrown in.			"

												Not a bad game, much like Diablo 2 and similar style games, complete with tech/skill trees - my one big issue is that instead of fighting a couple tough monsters at a time, you fight a horde of wimpy ones most of the time.  I find that boring and it requires less strategy, it's more of a click-fest  than I'd like.  Still, for 15 bucks I can't expect TOO much and the game isn't bad so far.			"

												I started playing this game because I didn't really feel like playing Diablo 3, and all in all I'm pretty happy with my choice.Story:I was expecting the game to be a Diablo-clone in most ways, so having the big bad be a  instead of a  was a pretty nice surprise. Fighting robots(?) in a steampunk-ish world also felt a bit fresh compared to fighting the same old demons and mythological creatures (some of which do appear in this game as well). The basic story is of course the good old ""hack your way through a bunch of enemies to defeat the big bad trying to take over the world (or country?)"", but there's nothing wrong with that.Gameplay:If you have played Diablo or any other ARPG you will probably recognize the play style right away. You use your mouse and a couple of buttons to dash out various spells while keeping an eye on your health and mana. The addition of rage, which refills when you kill a creature and can be used to power up your spells, was a nice touch. It gives you an extra thing to do during fights, as well as more ways to personalize your skill tree, so an extra plus there.Graphics:The graphics were fine. Not great, not bad. Some creatures looked pretty good, some looked pretty bland. The same can be said for the environment. Personally I enjoyed the city zones more than the nature zones. The (few and short) cut scenes were pretty meh, especially compared to the Diablo cut scenes, but that's acceptable.Music:While playing the game I thought that the music fit the mood pretty well, but as soon as I stopped playing I forgot the soundtrack right away.The voice acting in this game... At first I thought that the voice acting was just really, really bad, and almost lol'ed a couple of times during the first few hours of the game. But then I realized that that was what they were going for (probably?). Sort of cheesy, over-the-top voice acting, that when you get used to it fit the game really well, and was sometimes just really funny (in a good way!). Some of the comments from both Van Helsing and Lady Katarina were just hilarious, although by the end of the game Katarina was becoming quite annoying.Overall:Overall I enjoyed this game, even my second playthrough, which was a little unexpected. I don't really want to call Van Helsing a Diablo-clone, since there were a couple of things that set it apart from Diablo, so let's just call it a decent option if you like ARPGs. I recommend this game, even at full price if you don't want to wait for a sale, however I do have a couple of warnings:1. There are some bugs in the game, the most common being corpses stuck in walls or terrain that can't be looted. I also found a couple of chests that I couldn't open for whatever reason. The biggest bug I faced was a door leading to the next zone being closed, forcing me to start over with a new character. (Luckily this didn't happen with my hardcore heroic character.) There was a fix posted on the developer's forum to fix this, but that fix didn't work for me. On July 2nd 2015 they added the ""Mantis Bug Tracker"" to the game, which should help fix more bugs, but I wasn't able to test this out myself.2. If you care about achievements you can get most of the achievements by playing through the game twice. None of them are really that hard to get, as my first playthrough was on hardcore heroic difficulty (=perma-death), and I only died four times, so the game is fairly easy. However, there is one achievement that is just plain stupid. It requires you to get 500,000 kills, which is a lot, seeing as you only get about 10,000-15,000 kills per playthrough. Luckily there is a way to make Lady Katarina afk farm kills for you, which she is doing for me as I am typing this, but just be aware that there is this one really annoying achievement if you (like me) want to clear the game 100%.But all in all, a really good game.

												I don't want to compare it to Diablo II beyond the fact that the game play is nearly identical (is that a bad thing?). The game itself is completely different in any other aspect (atmosphere, art, music, dialogue). I have almost 20 hours clocked with this version, I completed it and I have exactly zero complaints. If you like the point and click attacking, crafting weapons with bonuses, quest type games like Diablo or Torchlight, you need to add this to the list. The developer has proven themselves as far as I'm concerned.			"

												TL;DR - It was amusing and fun, but the multiplayer problems are beyond irritating.  If you're planning on playing with friends, pick a different game.First the positives:- anachronistic pop-culture references are amusing.- sarastic chatter between the protagonist and his side-kick- decent sound track and art- distinct play styles between melee, ranged, magic, etc.- Katrina can sell your loot for you, so you don't have to return to town.- Easy comparison of equipment, though it seems off at times.- Great voice acting.Then the negatives:- a bit repetitve, but that's hard to avoid in this genre.- a bit too easy, even on Hard.- tons of dropped loot, most of it is garbage.- sometimes game events don't trigger and  you can't progress.- sometimes achievements aren't awarded.And for the deal-breaker: - Multi-player.  It's broken.Feel free to work around it by creating a virtual LAN for your remote friends via VPN or connect everyone to the same switch if you are local enough.  Either way, it's a pain, the work-arounds don't always work, and it shouldn't be necessary.			"

												Van Helsing is a precious gem. What hooked me in the game is how funny it is. It's quite shameless in poking fun at the tropes and motifs, referencing gaming and fantasy memes and being highly and delightfully tongue in cheek. Thankfully, the gameplay delivers as well. It's fast, the skills are interesting (it took me some time, but playing the Thaumaturge is a blast) and the power-up system works great. Loot drops in metric tons, and while sometimes it is weirdly balanced (I kept my lvl 6 Mask until level 26 or something) it is generally valuable enough to rack up your cash at least.Second of all, the game is magnificently optimised. With all the enemies on screen I hardly ever experience any decrease in framerate and my laptop isn't anything to write home about.All in all, the game is excellent for the price. Funny, charming, and with satisfying gameplay. Definitely worth buying.			"

												Finished the game on heroic.A fun game to pass the time but not much else, compared to Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, Diablo 2/3 i would rank this the lowest. That doesn't mean it's bad though it just not balanced enough to be comparable in quality. This is one of those ARPG's in which there are a few abilities that you should just use because they are the strongest ones. This is also the kind of game in which you have hundreds of thousands of gold and upgrades sometimes cost a questionably small amount, which is also what I meant by it being unbalanced. It also suffers from typical arpg stuff with very strong enemies that are then grouped up and become nearly impossible to deal with. Like PoE you should sometimes just have a little luck in getting the right items to be able to match the monster's strength, or otherwise you are stuck to grinding. (Pretty much applies to heroic though)The game feels like it was a really nice idea that turned out okay but could've been alot better if some thought went into things instead of just increase damage/life here make this cost that much bam done. In the end the game wants you to either play a scenario to be able to kill monsters above level 30 (the max) or do the game over again, which isn't that outrageous but i just don't really feel compelled to do so because the only thing I will get from it are glory (some sort of diablo 3 paragon-ish system) and better gear instead of levelling and new skills. Something that i do find outrageous though is that the other characters classes are DLC, yes you read that right. You have to pay in order to play as something/someone else other than Van Helsing himself. I guess they have to make money somehow right, but I think this should've just been included who's f-ing idea was this?But if you like ARPG's? then for 15 euros you could definitely have some fun with this game, and I feel like the game should be pretty easy for a seasoned ARPG player on difficulties below heroic. So you could also just casual through it.			"

Once you setup a hosted game it gives you a red cloud in the bottom lefthand corner and there is nothing out on the net on what causes that.  Then if you have a friend host it give you the message pinging with nothing happening or it does not come up in the list of games.  If you try to send an in game invite it gives you the pininging message.  If you want to play multiplayer I would hold off on buying this game as it needs major patching.			"

Lots of secret places, objects and achievements here as well.Challenging game and a tough, fun and rewarding final battle.

												I really liked the game when I started playing it, but after the first chapter it got a bit boring. The setting in the city of Borgova is not captivating as the forest seen at the beginning, plus the game got a bit unbalanced. I play on hard difficulty settings cause I am good at hack'n'slash games, but I think programmers did not test it at higher difficulties. Enemies get tougher and they come at you in multitudes, the only thing you can do is kill as many as you can, die, respawn and start killing again. You can't plan any strategy, even if you choose ranged attacks. Ranged enemies WILL HIT YOU you no matter what, there is absolutely NO WAY to dodge projectile attacks, which are by far the most dangerous attacks in a Hack'n'Slash. Plus, without the add on pack, you will be allowed to choose just one class, but you'll keep finding items for the other classes that you did not buy. The graphics are pretty good, but the animations are always the same, they sure could have put more effort in the skill sets animations because it is a bit boring to see the same 2 animations throughout the whole game. I had to quit the game when I was near the final boss, because it was getting too damn boring: die, respawn, kill some enemies, die, respawn, kill again, loose money. Not good. Even on hardest difficulties settings, a good game should always give you a chance to plan some strategy. I really hope developers learn from their mistakes, because they did quite a good job on some points. I recommend it only if you play on NORMAL diffuclty, but if you really dig this genre, get Torchlight 2 or Path of Exile (which is for FREE). Peace			"

I got hooked into the game easily. The game has great mechanics to make it a simple but fun to play. The narration of the characters are well designed and the graphics are good for this type of game. However, the game is lack of cinematic to escalate this with strong story and hence you will not be immerse into it storyline. Nevertheless, the game excel as a simple hack n slash with good mechanics, graphic and gameplay.			"

												For my ARPG playing friends, one of Steam's Midweek Madness items is Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, a steampunk Diablo clone set (very loosely) in the world of the over-the-top 2004 Stephen Sommers movie. Is it perfect? Of course not. But it is one of my favorites of the current generation of Diablo clones. Almost as much wander-fight-loot-level-up fun as Torchlight II, with a much more focused plot and storyline, and a setting that is NOT one more dragons, castles, elves and such Standard Western Fantasy World (tm). AND, it has a downloadable demo, so you don't have to take my word for it - try it, and see if YOU like it. If anyone is wondering - if you do pull the trigger, YES, spend the extra $1.70 (or how over many groats or whatever it is overseas) for the Complete Pack with the DLCs. Yes, they are, basically, making you pay money to get access to ALL the ""character classes"". Think of it like Diablo II's LoD expansion - maybe it SHOULD have been in there to start, but it wasn't, and it DOES make the game much more interesting.			"

												A surprisingly solid action RPG. It reminds me a lot of Path of Exile or Titan Quest, along with the original Diablo 2. The skill trees have a moderate amount of depth, along with a torchlight style companion and reputation system that allows you to select special perks to benefit your character.. Skill trees are basically split into your standard magic, ranged and melee skills, plus 2 active ""trick"" abilities and 2 passive ""tricks"". My only gripe about the skill system is that you only really get to use 4 abilities at once (thought you can swap them out on the fly), so that may be dissapointing to those who like long  action bars of skills. The loot variety is fairly good, though you'll be sticking with greatswords, dual swords, pistols and long-barreled guns. Armor/weapon appearences also change as you get different gear, which is always nice. At the moment it sounds like the developers are going to be adding a lot of new content, with a new level 30+ scenario mode added for players who hit the level cap of 30, along with coop (already in) and future content planned such as a New Game +. Overall I was pleasantly surprised with this game, I haven't finished it yet at this time, but I've so far enjoyed the hours I've put into it, both with a ranged character and a a melee build.			"

If you are a fan of games like the Torchlight series, Diablo, and what not then you are gonna love and hate this both because frankly its too short. The story is brilliant, the graphics are crisp and detailed and yet feel slightly muted to match the story, and the characters are exactly what you expect and want both from a Van Helsing game.Add in the occassional tower defense to sake things up and it makes for a really great game, again its sadly short. I'd love to see some DLC in the future that lets you play through the intro story or adds on to the end (frankly the intro story could be its own game and 'd buy it XD)			"

												A great love letter to anybody who loved Diablo I & II: satisfying combat and loot system, nice story-telling and great interaction between you and your companion; moreover, the graphics are really nice and so are enemy and character design, all set in a fantastic steampunk world.A must-have if you are into (or want to try) hack 'n' slash.

												A good old fashioned dungeon crawler, with large amounts of loot to gather, quests to do, and ugly things to kill. Pretty fun, though it can turn into a bit of a grind. I've played single player exclusively, probably more fun when you and your buds are panicing together when the behemoth WILL NOT FREAKING DIE, and then you both get wasted.			"

												I have to say my first impression of this is just 'decent.' The UI is pretty good but feels a tiny bit disjointed here or there, the gameplay is by no means a far step from what one would expect fro a top-down. The weaponry and skill choices are fairly limited - two swords, a big sword, two guns, a big gun, and that's about it. The skill trees focus around that and have a few magicy things, so not too exciting. I have to say that standing on that alone, the game doesn't really bring a lot of excitement - that said, the voice and story seem a step above normal, especially for a more small/indie dev team, so if you dig the setting and background then that may be enough to kick it up into the 'buy' category for you! Or if you just have a hankering for clicking on monstres and gathering loot, it likely won't disappoint.			"

												I love this game, I beat it with the original hunter class but right now I'm going through it with the Tharmaturge class, and might I say it is the best DLC I have ever purchased, although it should have been in the game in the first place. I love the combat and the balance to the games items, giving you just enough power in the new guns, swords, gauntlets, ect... You feel like a total badass after you have your favorite setup throughout the skill tree, powers, auras, and perks. For instance I have both of the Ice and Lightning skills maxed out (which is simple but effective), I have a dash to get away from danger since as a Tharmaturge I am easy to kill and the secondary power allows me to expend all of my mana in order to do a significant amount of damage. Almost everything in this game, I love, the only bad thing to me is that the second part isn't going to be out for a little while. So Neocore please make the game soon and if possible have to where if we played the first one we can bring over our character, oh and add some randomized dungeons, more customization options and more character classes i.e. Frankenstein's monster, Werewolfs, and Vampires. (They all exist in the lore) As you can see I love this game, and do I reccomend it, HELL YA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you want to play with me send me a friend request we can play.			"

												A surprisingly enjoyable hack n' slash aRPG experience. Steals many of the best ideas from the Diablo and Torchlight series, and adds its own unique twists. It's from a Hungarian developer, and shows some obvious signs of its n0t-astronomical budget: some janky animations and snaggy terrain textures, terrible voice acting for minor characters (caveat: the voice work for the main characters is actually quite good), and a rough looking (and feeling) UI. However, the game redeems itself with its creative combat and level design, surprisingly good art direction, and plot/dialogue which vaccilates from serious to snarky to self-effacing. An aRPG that takes itself seriously, but not TOO seriously. Worth a playthrough if you're fond of the genre.			"

												If you like ARPGs, you can't go wrong with this game.This game is a well done, ARPG. Katarina, your companion throughout the game, is extremely useful and a valuable tool. The game has three classes, but I've only done the basic hunter class. It was a pretty fun experience. I played on heroic though, and some times it could be very difficult. Since when is that a bad thing though? However, I found myself stuck at a few points, having to grind for better gear or level up more, just to advance the story. For someone who doesn't have the patience, that can be a draw back. Graphics are great, sound is great, dialogue and story is ok, though the twist with science gone mad is pretty neat.7/10			"

All the UI is scaled down and the texts are almost impossible to read, making the game unplayable.I have been patient, asked for updates, stalked the support threads looking for any updates and posted my own issues there.

												It's a good RPG for the price, but overall I do not enjoy playing it. I see people comparing it with Diablo, Torchlight, Titan Quest.. but is way below them. Don't get your expectations that high.I should also state that I played it only for about 3hours(co-op with another friend) and I don't feel like playing it anymore.Some things that I liked:- New theme, always wellcome when 90% of hack and slash RPGs are fantasy wizzard/knight/orc/trolls based- Has some new things in gameplay for skill ussageWhat I didn't like:- Monsters placing on the map didn't make any sense at all.. walking around between trees and everywhere there were packs of monsters, sometimes like 50 of them. Really. We ended up lots of times just running around with 30 monsters on our tail trying to kill them off few at a time.- Graphics look good at first sight, but it has a strange feeling of ""Low budget""..- Skills were not that interesting, most of them you don't even realise when you use them. For mage, the ""AoE"" spells have area of effect of a creep. so it's not really that ""AoE""			"

												This is a pretty fun game to play if you're a fan of action hack n' slash RPGs like Diablo. I really didn't know what to expect when first playing, but I was pleasantly surprised. Coming from playing too much Diablo 3, I was glad that the game had more customization to your character. You are free to add points to your attributes and skill points in a skill tree.As far as the gameplay goes, it took a little bit for the game to take off for me. First, each class has a rage bar that goes up during combat. You use part of the rage bar to activate extra effects to your attacks, like stunning enemies for 2 seconds to your electric attack. You have a primary left and right-click attack, followed by 1-4 key press ""trick"" abilities, like healing. You don't level really fast, so to start getting new skills took a bit of dedication to the game. Stick with it, and you will enjoy your adventure with your ghostly companion. As far as difficulty goes, the game was nearly impossible for me on the highest difficulty. I suggest playing on the next level below that if you want a challenge that's do-able.I do like the that game has decent voice acting, since your characters will talk a lot during your adventure. When you fight monsters, you will generally be fighting a LOT at once, which really causes you to stay on your toes. It has the same feel as Diablo, fighting champion packs and elite monsters. And of course, the loot which ranges from basic non magically items to epic/set.			"

												Bottom line:  fun little top-down monster-slaying adventure.  Think ""Diablo meets Castlevania.""  Then cut whatever you would pay for that game in half, and don't pay any more than that for this game.  It's fun, but not worth going broke to play it.This game puts you in control of the son of the great monster hunter, Van Helsing.  He's a tough guy with a funny-looking hat.  And you have a ghost for a companion, who can help you by attacking enemies or providing defense boosts for you.  She can also pick up treasure scattered around the ground.  And if you're too busy or too lazy to go back to town, you can put all your useless items in her backpack and send her to sell them (and buy some potions) at the shop while you continue to travel and slay monsters.The ""vanilla"" game lets you use ""hunter"" equipment, which means guns and swords.  You also get to learn a few magic spells but the bulk of your arsenal will be physical attacks.  As you progress in the game, you earn points to boost your stats (strength, dexterity, etc.) so that you deal more damage or gain more health or mana.  You also gain separate points to learn new skills and spells.  You can even spend those points to learn special perks to add damage or special effects to some of your attack skills.  You also find stronger weapons and armor the further into the game you go.  About halfway into the game, you will acquire an underground hideout and you can build and set traps in the tunnels around it, for a tower-defense mission.  Mostly though, the game is a top-down monster-slaying adventure.  The plot and the locations you visit are VERY LINEAR; this is not an ""open-world"" game in any way.  It sort of reminds me of Diablo but instead of going down into a series of dungeons it has you wandering through forests and swamps, and exploring an ""ink world"" with floating rock platforms that exists just below the surface of the ""real world.""  In addition to the main quest, there are a few side-quests that you can choose to accept or refuse.  Those are mostly fetch quests but some of them have you slaying a special boss-type monster.  In addition to the stat growth and skill system, this game is very loot-driven.  The magical effects on the loot you find scattered around the world will be the main thing you focus on when you are trying to upgrade your equipment to deal more damage and survive longer.The DLC will let you play as two additional characters:  the Thaumaturge is purely a magical attack specialist, and he uses slightly different equipment than the Hunter.  The other character you can choose (sorry but I forgot what it's called) uses a cannon and is a ranged-attack specialist.  You get to lob grenades, set mines, and use flamethrowers instead of swords and rifles.  The two DLC characters each have a couple of unique side-quests that the other characters are not allowed to complete. "

												Its a nice game, worth trying. I played alot of ARPGs and this one definitely isnt any worse than most of them. Has also some humour in itself, and the atmosphere is kinda nice aswell. Playing this one on Hardcore Heroic was way harder than the hardest hardcore difficulty on any other ARPG game. It is a big hell right off the bat, but later into the game it gets balanced, however, still hard. Probably a must-buy of all hardcore ARPG fans out there seeking for a challenge, and also for regular players that want to enjoy some fun.			"

												Far to buggy. It had some interesting ideas and game mechanics but overall was simply very one dimensional, incredibly hard, and buggy. If the bugs were cleared up this game could be good and overcome the difficulty due to the mechanics actually working.I would recommend this game, but a year after this game came out, they put out Van Helsing 2. So clearly they arent caring about this game at all, and the focus is new games and content, not making the game work properly.			"

												Pretty good Diablo clone with a an amusing storyline and sometimes witty dialog. A bit too many cheesy movie quotes/puns for my taste but satisfied my craving for a good hack and slasher. Decent graphics but a bit repetitive on the enemy types. Not enough boss fights, but the ones they do have are pretty good. The rest of the game is just mob swarm after mob swarm, pretty much every time you reveal a new part of the map.			"

												I wanted to like this game, I really did. But its flaws are very blatant and ruined the experience for me. It's the UI. You have different inventories for types of items E.G Hats,Weapons, Armor ETC. And overall it's clunky and confusing.Another glaring issue are the controls. you NEED a gamepad to play this. or get ready to rebind everything. It's an ARPG on PC and Neocore missed the core ease of controls for this genre.  Point and click controls. They could have implemented. The classes are interesting and the setting is unique. Combat is solid, but at least for me it didn't matter what settings the game runs at it looked the same. Framerate is capped by default to 30fps but this can be turned off (thankfully). VO is average if not a bit corny. The game just isn't cohesive in terms of mechanics. Do yourself a favor and download Path of Exile, It's free and WAY better then this. Or Diablo, Or Torchlight. Really any ARPG on pc that gets things right!			"

												So, this is a diablo clone. Alright. It is what it is, and for what it is, tt's fairly polished. The monsters, being selected from slavic myth, are interesting, the dialogue between Van Helsing and the ghost is moderately entertaining, but...it's just lacking some of the intangibles that make diablo work.Also a couple of tangibles, like being able to retreat from an optional dungeon if you find out it's beyond your abilities. There are things like that, but really, it's just missing that special something that made the diablo games work. Even Diablo 3 had more of the old magic than this, unfortunately.			"

												This game features the timeless wisdom of Professor Toad alongside other charming, surprisingly entertaining banter between Van Helsing and ghostly companion Katarina.  Engrossing and fun with an interesting narrative to keep along where most games of this genre tend to get very boring fast.  Endearing voice acting, competent mechanics, interesting character options and neat set-pieces all help make this a little gem.Multiplayer is a little peculiar, since any present are all Van Helsings -- but this can be compensated by having a contest among yourselves on who can present the most stylish headwear.  I'd originally taken a stab at this singleplayer and had a good time, but revisiting it with a friend proved to be the most fun in my opinion -- since the two of you can develop your respective Helsing sibling down opposite paths to compliment one another nicely.Thanks to the Gentleman Unknown Hinson for originally gifting me this game, he is a swell guy.

												For as cheap as it is (around 13 bucks last I checked) this is a fun, competently made Rogue-like ARPG. It's about 12-15 hours in length assuming you aren't rushing through it. It definitely scratches the itch now that there is a void left by Diablo 3 and Torchlight 2. While the synergies between skills, passives, and perks don't really work particularly well, it is an enjoyable single play through. There won't be much in the way of replay value (no New Game +, either), but I enjoyed it enough to recommend to people who liked Titan Quest or the Torchlight series. Thumbs up.			"

You get the right amount of XP per map so you're never underleveled for the next zone.  Amazing, more games should consider this. Grinding doesn't equal gameplay.			"

Another thing I don't like is the fact that the games forces you to have a ""pet"" (Miss Always-in-front-of-your-balls Katarina); a feature i really don't like.In the end-If you're interested in an easy adventure story, buy it.-If you like Hack n' Slash/RPGs like Diablo or Titan Quest and you like farming to get a crazy build, avoid this like a pestilence.

												The Incredible adventures of Van Helsing is a great RPG that i would definetly recommend .The narrative is intersting , the dialogs are well written , the graphics are pretty good but the environment is really what made me love this game . My brother bought it for me so we could play together which we did but my computer couldn't handle it and i got bored quick . But when i got a new computer i re-installed steam and the game , that i was finally able to play in full quality with 60 FPS and i really got into it , i finished the game on my own ( turns out me and my brother didn't make it really far) and i like the game so much that i bought the dlc characters and finished the game with them aswell . The game really reminded me of my favorite RPG to this day : Champions of Norrath that i used to play on PS2 with my brother and that's what i really liked about it , the talent tree is very complete and there are many ways you can customise your character ( style , items , skills , talents , and of course same goes for lady katarina ) I would reccomend the game (i liked it even more that Diablo 3 for a reason still unknown to me , maybe the nostalgia factor ) but only if your PC can manage to make it run smoothly , because there are plenty of loading screens that can get frustrating if it takes you 30 secs to load .

Plenty of options, tough foes, super hard bosses, and what makes the action rpg setting good. It runs smoothly, looks very nice, and uses the titan quest style approach to your skills. All good points. The nature of perks, adds some nice options, innate aura's and spells to adjust or not, as you want. All and all, this is a well done action rpg, its nothing new, but it makes sure what is fun, what is good, is polished and smooth for gameplay.			"

												I can say after giving this game and it's sequel the old college try that I cannot recommend this game. At first, the game was light and funny, but the big aspect of this game (what with being a diablo clone) is combat, and if you are lacking in that aspect, then the rest of your game is going to suffer; and that is almost exactly what happened to this game. The game is quite laggy almost all the time, and the game swarms you with so many enemies with so much health that fighting them feels like trying to knock out a mountain with nothing but a toothpick. I'm not saying that fights should be easy, but even on normal mode, trash mobs take way too much damage before they go down, and more attacks should have more effective AOE.I chose to play as a ranged character after giving the game a few early tries, and found I was nothing but frustrated. Enemies which were basically living artillery were able to instakill me as soon as they saw me, and I found myself running around like a madman taking 5-8 shots to take out a single enemy which had 20 others just like it right behind. In brief, combat was long, tedious and I would see future mobs coming at me not with the glee of popping their heads off, but with resignation as they were just another obstacle between me and my final goal. An obstacle which, I had wiped out at least 12 of in the past play session.In short: Even after putting all my skillpoints into body and dex, I still didn't have enough health to survive encounters, or enough damage to make fighting monsters not feel like a chore. In Diablo, I can wipe out a dungeon in 15 minutes on high torment levels. In this game, I'd be lucky to wipe out a map section in what feels like three times that.And as a final tip to the developer: writing achievements is fine, but DO NOT make an achievement that says ""Don't kill a monster type"" in a game where you have been patting my back for killing everything that moves, then putting that monster type all over the map, then having them attack me with flamethrowers doing an insubstantial amount of damage, and when I do kill it not allow me to go back and un-kill that monster. Same goes for that ""Fight the final boss without destroying any spawn towers"", because I sustain Fulmugati will be almost indestructible if you don't. "

												I decided to play The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing after viewing the trailer, and getting some exhaustion from Diablo III and Torchlight 2. This one seemed to be a decent Hack & Slash, with a nice twist regarding the setting of central Europa and possibly legions of blood-sucking foes.In this game, you play a single character, Van Helsing, who is followed by a ghostly teammate, Katarina. You don't have to choose a class before playing, and just develop your character along the way, using several skill trees.Basically, you can eradicate a significant amount of monsters by using either a sword or a gun. Each weapon has its specific skill tree with numerous styles of slashes and shots. Each one can be leveled up, or customized with additional powers, triggered by Rage. Also, you can wander in the side of magic by learning strikes blending physical and magical damage, even pure magical damage. If not enough, you can learn passive abilities and active spells, that can take advantage of some specific situations or simply save your butt - leaving you with a fair amount of combinations to craft.The amount of damage you do or can endure is proportional to basic weapon and armor stats, plus the different levels of your character stats and skills, combined with the multiple bonuses you can get from gear. Very similar to Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2. So don't fall in love with that particular weapon or gear if the next one is seamingly up a notch, the impact could be tremendous.On top of that, your translucent female sidekick is not only witty, but can be used either as a melee fighter, a ranged shooter or a decent support. She also can level up and has her own gear and skill tree to become a tactical partner or a stat multiplier.At this point, it's pretty clear that this game targets an audience that loves to analyse how hundred skills relate to each other, carefully crafting the most badass character possible, something like ""hit once, obliterate many"". It's a good thing to have a significant amount of depth that way (remember Titan Quest !) but for me it was just like ""too much"". So I decided to focus on a restricted number of skills, low enough to keep me focused on the actual map cleaning.The game is linear, with some quests on the side. The levels are not really beautiful but varied, and the enemies compensate lack of intelligence by sheer number. Luckily, the dialog between Van Helsing and Katarina are funny so you can have a good time playing them.Something that kinda puzzled me was the introduction of a micro-game of Tower Defense. Not that it wasn't interesting or refreshing, but it seemed that the developers decided to put everything remotely cool in the game, thus pushing it in the Land of Blended Genre where chances of survival are slim. Luckily, the Tower Defense micro-game is nicely done, but too much thin for consideration. Overall, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a good Hack & Slash, that can satisfy seasoned players, but could be daunting to newcomers.			"

												Okay starting with the basics, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a action role play game where you play the role of a demon hunter that is no less than the son of Van Helsing to stop the evil plans of a mad scientist, you will be able to choose between diferent classes that will define your combat style while fighting the forces of evil, this game will definitely provide you with a good experience for those looking for games like Diablo or Torclight, it has a very good environment that fits very well with the background music, depending the difficult that you choose before starting the game you may either be whining about how easy the game is or crying frustrated because of the hardcore difficulty, though the game lacks a bit of story since is the classic generated storyline, you will often find yourself in a conversation 1 minute long and then 1 hour killing minions, then another 1 minute conversation and killing again, some may say it is still a nice opening for the second game,  also it has  funny situations that makes you want to play more and more, and there's a talking cow!!! it's definitely worth your time as it was with mine, wana know if I'm lying? try it yourself.I hereby give permission to play this game as it passed the test. Abraham I'll give you a 7+/10			"

												I will say the early versions were pretty buggy and I had one that wiped my save and bugged the DLC forever. Just recently I will say I reinstalled and everything seem to be working as it should. Gameplay wise it great, with a awesome mini-tower defence game that shakes things up, esp if you don't own D3 or don't like PoE. Haven't tested multi to see if that's still bugged or not, but i'd say a 3.5-5 only due to the DLC feeling more microtransaction like than dlc really. Bu then again we live in a era where DLC is spelled MICRO...			"

												If you're into rpg/adventure games, especially point&click w/gamepad options, then you're in for a treat. Been playing the storymode for over 10 hours still in the early/mid stages of the game. So far, I like the upgrades, & cusomization of your characters, weapons, items, & abilities. Just expect to have some patience in this game, because you may die alot! :( In certain areas or levels like ""Gallowsbog"", you'll be swarmed by a horde of enemies trapping you at a deadend, surrounding you, even chasing you which is kind of ludicrous, but I like the challenge. I've recently played a Van Helsing(Xbox)game based on a movie starring Hugh Jackman, which I enjoyed but never got to finish. But IMO, this game is alot better with more modes, & co-op/mp. For those who have played the Diablo Series, WarMech, & League of Legends, this is highly recommended!! :)Gameplay: 4/5, Graphics: 4.5/5, Story: 4/5, Replay: 3.75/5, Overall: 4.5/5			"

												VH isn't amazing but it's a solid old-school ARPG - one I finally finished after a few abortive attempts - and one you'll probably enjoy too.It's not without flaws tho - be aware that the difficulty is all-over-the-place, the upgrade trees aren't amazing (lots of ineefective stuff) and your sidekick is mainly useful for selling the TONNES of junk you'll find Good News is that the story/design is fine and once you find a build which works for you (clue: ignore ranged completely) you'll have fun.If only the sequel refined this instead of leaving all the bad stuff as-is and spoiling the other bits - hey ho			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is not a long game, about 15 hours or so all up to complete the storyline, but it is time well spent in my opinion.  In a nutshell, you are the son of the famous monster hunter and vampire slayer, who answers a call for help (sent to your father) from the fictional eastern european country of Borgovia.  Van Helsing travels with the Lady Katarina, a ghost bound to the family's service and it's the byplay between these two characters that I extremely well done.  While Katarina assists Van Helsing in combat with her abilities (which can be upgraded and new ones learned as the game progresses), she also has a number of things to say about Van Helsing's actions (as guided by the player) throughout the game.  There are some wonderful lines she comes out with that made me laugh.  There are also a number of references to other things (Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy being one of them), all of which are neatly tied into the narrative.  The game does finish on a cliffhanger after you confront the mad scientist, so if this game does appeal, you will probably want to invest in the second and third installments to continue the story.   As for mechanics, it's pretty simple and straight forward.  I used a controller and for the most part had no issues though there is one thing that I feel was badly designed.  The D pad has 4 functions, down to bring up the map, left and right to use a healing or mana potion and up to teleport to the current ""home base"".  The first time I teleported I had no idea what I'd done (or that I'd managed to hit up on the D pad).  Once I'd worked out what was happening, it became a bit of a bugbear in the middle of combat - go to drink a healing potion, miss and next thing you know you've teleported back to base.  While at times it got me out of a nasty fight, it was frustrating, so it's something to be aware of and you may want to investigate changing the keybind to either the Left Trigger or Bumper.Overall I really enjoyed The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, it had a good mix of environments, an engaging narrative with good characters, particularly Katarina who is think was just brilliant.  There aren't any puzzles to tax your mind, but if you are looking for something where you can check your brain, hack and slash your way around Borgovia and have a ghost pick on you, then I highly recommend it.

												I started playing this game because I didn't really feel like playing Diablo 3, and all in all I'm pretty happy with my choice.Story:I was expecting the game to be a Diablo-clone in most ways, so having the big bad be a  instead of a  was a pretty nice surprise. Fighting robots(?) in a steampunk-ish world also felt a bit fresh compared to fighting the same old demons and mythological creatures (some of which do appear in this game as well). The basic story is of course the good old ""hack your way through a bunch of enemies to defeat the big bad trying to take over the world (or country?)"", but there's nothing wrong with that.Gameplay:If you have played Diablo or any other ARPG you will probably recognize the play style right away. You use your mouse and a couple of buttons to dash out various spells while keeping an eye on your health and mana. The addition of rage, which refills when you kill a creature and can be used to power up your spells, was a nice touch. It gives you an extra thing to do during fights, as well as more ways to personalize your skill tree, so an extra plus there.Graphics:The graphics were fine. Not great, not bad. Some creatures looked pretty good, some looked pretty bland. The same can be said for the environment. Personally I enjoyed the city zones more than the nature zones. The (few and short) cut scenes were pretty meh, especially compared to the Diablo cut scenes, but that's acceptable.Music:While playing the game I thought that the music fit the mood pretty well, but as soon as I stopped playing I forgot the soundtrack right away.The voice acting in this game... At first I thought that the voice acting was just really, really bad, and almost lol'ed a couple of times during the first few hours of the game. But then I realized that that was what they were going for (probably?). Sort of cheesy, over-the-top voice acting, that when you get used to it fit the game really well, and was sometimes just really funny (in a good way!). Some of the comments from both Van Helsing and Lady Katarina were just hilarious, although by the end of the game Katarina was becoming quite annoying.Overall:Overall I enjoyed this game, even my second playthrough, which was a little unexpected. I don't really want to call Van Helsing a Diablo-clone, since there were a couple of things that set it apart from Diablo, so let's just call it a decent option if you like ARPGs. I recommend this game, even at full price if you don't want to wait for a sale, however I do have a couple of warnings:1. There are some bugs in the game, the most common being corpses stuck in walls or terrain that can't be looted. I also found a couple of chests that I couldn't open for whatever reason. The biggest bug I faced was a door leading to the next zone being closed, forcing me to start over with a new character. (Luckily this didn't happen with my hardcore heroic character.) There was a fix posted on the developer's forum to fix this, but that fix didn't work for me. On July 2nd 2015 they added the ""Mantis Bug Tracker"" to the game, which should help fix more bugs, but I wasn't able to test this out myself.2. If you care about achievements you can get most of the achievements by playing through the game twice. None of them are really that hard to get, as my first playthrough was on hardcore heroic difficulty (=perma-death), and I only died four times, so the game is fairly easy. However, there is one achievement that is just plain stupid. It requires you to get 500,000 kills, which is a lot, seeing as you only get about 10,000-15,000 kills per playthrough. Luckily there is a way to make Lady Katarina afk farm kills for you, which she is doing for me as I am typing this, but just be aware that there is this one really annoying achievement if you (like me) want to clear the game 100%.But all in all, a really good game.

												Van Helsing can be quirky at times, and Neocore's support can definitely be lacking, but at this point I'd say the game is worth the $ and the storyline if you're a fan of Isometric Action RPG or Hack and Slash genre.   The skill/class system works a bit odd as you're limited to 2 skills on the hotbar at a time.  It makes taking multiple skills in the class tree feel punishing as you wont be able to use them all.  It also feels like there are way too many possibilities for the secondary skills that would be nice to get, but because they use the same skill points as your main class skills the tradeoffs don't seem to make sense.  Overall the Class progression could have been done much better, but the value here is in the price and the amount of time to play through the storyline and try a couple different character builds out.

												Van Helsing is Adventure Action RP Game what hold player from all beginning. Comparing this game to two most know HnS games Van Helsing have real graphic with normal guy who attacking like normal man with sword(s) or gun(s) using spell time to time.In game is a perks system what giving to us different bonuses like: +10% to dmg while our rage is max, bonuses to hp, skill points, ability and moreWhat I mean ? That Mr. Van Helsing (as character in game) can use 2 weapons types: Swords what can be two handed slow attacking one or two one-hand ones what are faster and guns on the same rules.All the time we have a companion - ghost of Lady Katerine who can support us in 2 different ways. She can or attack (directly or on distance) or support us in passive (ghost mode) by giving to us 10% resistance from any dmg, this make passive mode most useful so far. Her skills giving to us auras like faster attack speed, bigger damage, transfer some dmg what we receiving to her etc.. what make our partner very valuable to us.Action happening in times of steam where guns using gun-powder and technology is steam-punk like. And that we are normal guy make that game that fun, we cant attack with swords faster than from machine guns, a slightly over 2 attacks with swords per second is max. Using Area of Effect spells also giving so much fun. Exploding from critical hits enemies ... this never get boring (mostly if those exploding in amount 20+)In one moment of game there is also Tower Defense, very good one, only if creators could put a man next to entrance to allow players to play this more. This will be so awesome.And the worst thing about this game.... there are levels limits...Van Helsing max exp level is 30Lady Katerina is 25Numbers of perks what we can get is 10(Now I remember there was veteran mode what I didn't checked before because was locked. Maybe now is unlocked and allow me to level more)So after reaching that continue gaming on this save do not have any sense if we cannot make our character stronger. But we can start game from beginning on hardest difficult and with Hardcore mode so one dead and game is over.Saying shortly - Game is that fun is worthy get it because I still want playing it.			"

												I've never been so pleasantly surprised by a game before! Top-down RPGs aren't generally my thing, but I'm having a blast. The skill combinations result in some pretty sleek and/or carnage-filled playstyles, and all the easter eggs, references and humour are super entertaining. Be careful about your dialogue choices, and you might find that some clever bonuses or really nifty items come your way. If you're in between more serious/thoughtful/stressful games, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing a fun way to fill the time.			"

												Before you start I want to get it out of the way. I am a fan of ARPGs. One of my first PC games (other than those free games that came on my dad's ""Software of the Month club"" discs was Diablo). I have played most (but somehow missed Titan Quest). I love the style and have spent far too many hours in these games over the years. So if you do not like the genre, skip the game. This is definitely not a ""best in genre"" type game.That said, I found this game competent and even fun. I liked the aesthetics of the game. The loot felt fun and interesting. I admit that the combat as a caster focused character was hard at first but got better towards the end. The story was cheesy and some of the mechanics (the psuedo tower defense sections) didn't click with me. There were bugs at launch. And there have been valid complaints about DLC pricing during sales.BUT I still think this game is worth a try. Especially when it goes on sale. Katarina is like a pet from TL2 but with a fun an interesting personality (the bickering between her and Van Helsing was sometimes my favorite part). The combat was challenging but didn't feel too much like the fantasy equivalent of being a bullet sponge. Loot was more fun than my time in Diablo 3 but not quite up to TL2 or even D2: LoD levels. The progression was simple enough and ... it has been a while... but I seem to remember a respec option.If you are a fan of ARPGs, watch for this to go on sale. If you want to try the genre out this is not a bad first game but there may be other options (a certain popular free to play game) to see if you like the style. But keep those expectations in check. It is fun and can be enjoyable but, to me at least, is middle of the road for ARPG.			"

												A fun and decent looking steampunky ARPG set in an Eastern European country of Borgovia - think Transylvania/Romania with various beasties from Slavic/Balkans folklore. Curiously for Van Helsing and the location - there are almost no vampires.There are some interesting innovations (lair defence instances, configurable powerups for attacks...) and the DLC actually improves and enriches the gameplay. Blue Blood DLC is a must for ranged/glass cannon Van Helsings as it allows two more melee Katarinas (three in total) for tanking the neverending mobs.The story and the voice acting are mostly awful but that does not diminish the overall enjoyment in the 16-20 hrs. long campaign. A good first effort from the Hungarian developer.7/10.			"

												If you're a fan of the Diablo or Torchlight franchises it will be a safe bet that you'll enjoy this game, and franchise. The story playthrough will give you around 10-14hrs of gameplay depending on your skill level and how thorough you play through. Regardless, most people can't resist but to go through with a second character! The playablitity just makes it hard to put down.Any complaints? If I had any it would be that the level cap is 30. They do attempt to make up for it by adding alternate ways to play such as, scenario mode or endless mode. These alternatives add a glory lvling system comparable to Diablo 3's glory lvling system. My opinion though, they are simply just not as good as the story playthrough itself!What's the verdict? I recommend this game! Even if you're on the fence about it I suggest waiting for it to go on sale, so you can potentially get it for super cheap!			"

The voice acting is also wonderful, and actually made me interested and invested in Van Helsing and Katarina's story, really ambitious for the price it is sold for, definitely worth a buy.Want an alternative to Torchlight II? With more story? Then this game is a great choice, and there's multiplayer when you want to bring your friends!			"

												Gostei:1. História: bom trabalho de roteiro;2. Grágicos muito bons;3. O personagem pode ser evoluído do modo que bem entender (skills e atributos);4. O NPC pode ser configurado para colher itens que caem no chão automaticamente;5. O sistema de comparação de itens sendo utilizados e no inventário é excelente, no melhor estilo que já vi;6. As batalhas são bem feitas;7. Há conversas entre o personagem e o NPC, depois de um tempo fica um pouco repetitivo, mas gosto mesmo assim.8. Há momentos no jogo que o jogador só podefazer uma escolha correta se explorou detalhes de placas ou papéis com texto em parede (perguntas feitas por wisps), podia até aparecer um pouco mais;9. Boa variedade de monstros em cada nível;10. Não há uma base disponível logo no início do jogo, se chega a ela depois.Não gostei:1. Não tem cliente nativo para o Linux;2. Mapas são sempre iguais e não gerados ao criar o jogo, e pior: ocupam a maioria do espaço em disco utilizado pelo jogo, vários gigabytes;3. Demora bastante para carregar os mapas;4. Há somente uma base principal, eu acharia mais interessante se houvesse mais bases intermediárias;5. Máximo de somente 4 jogadores em modo multiplayer;6. Não se pode controlar ao mesmo tempo do teclado/mouse e do joystick, aliás, se o joystick estiver ligado, não há opção de usar o teclado;7. Ficou um pouco curto. Não cada fase, os mapas tem um tamanho bom, mas ficaria melhor com mais mapas.Não gostava mas modificaram:1. Agora os monstros de fases já completas voltam ao começar um novo jogo, antes não voltam;2. O suporte a controle era muito falho, agora está ótimo exceto por não poder mudar para teclado/mouse se este estiver ligado no momento que o jogo é iniciado. Ainda assim acho mais fácil teclado e mouse devido a maior facilidade e disponibilidade de configuração e comandos imediatos.Conclusão:O jogo é legal e vale seu preço, cerca de dez dólares.			"

												This is a fun diablike that has some fairly interesting skills and ability combos that keep the game interesting the whole play through while leaving you still wanting to try another character or two before putting it back on the shelf. The most appealing thing about this game is certainly the humor and the atmosphere. Even during my second play through I was still laughing at the same comments, particuraly those of the sexy spectre Katarina. Music is also amazing. Would rate this game as a wooden block out of six. Would certainly play.Overall Rating: 8/10			"

												Because there was only two recomendations for the game, yes or no, i couldn't express a mixed view. A good game but there are some really anoying element to be aweare of. The first is you can't have a break from the game half way through a level. If for example you exit from the game half way through the level, switch off the comp and them go back to it later then all the monster you've killed are back there again. It means you're pratically starting the level from scratch and that is very annoying. All your previous good work gone to waste. Second. Some of the protals, actually most of the portals, drop you right in the middle of a horde to monsters and you usually get slaughtered because there are so many. This is partially caused by the provious problem but could be solved by not having any monsters around the portal.The third. It takes so long for VanHelsing to regenerate HPs that you spend a fair amount of time waiting to heal before going to your next fight. You could remady that problem by using the command cheats some say but i have them and they don't seem to work. So it another 10 minuites for the HP gague to fill up.			"

Voice-overs are ok, not bad but not too great either.  Worth the play if you are an ARPG/Lootfest fan.  Lots of carnage and mindless killing.  Game has a unique charm dispite its flaws.

												An enjoyable 'Diablo-eque' game starring a growly, macho-goth Van Helsing, clearly inspired more by the Hugh Jackman interpretation than that of Bram Stoker. The visuals are attractive, a sort of steampunk / magic vibe that actually reminded me a lot of the classic Arcanum (think automatons, gargoyles and electricity-suit wearing werewolves). Van Helsing can be played as a ranged shooter (flintlocks, yes please) or a close-range sword-wielding dervish. Additional content unlocks the 'Thaumaturge' - a sort of turn-of-the-century illusionist - and the 'Arcane Mechanist' - your summoner class (fight using an army of clockwork spiders). Both add nice variety, but the game dialogue has clearly been written for the moody standard character and sometimes it sounds out of place playing as one of the DLC characters. There are minor problems throughout, but these are often easy to work around. Some are control based (unresponsive clicks) others are gameplay based (allies not doing what they are supposed to) but compared to other ARPGS like Titan Quest or Torchlight these issues are inobtrusive. As Neocore continue to update and fix the game it continues to improve. Neocore are a responsive company and frequently comment on forum posts and respond to technical issues quickly.Ultimately I'd recommend this to ARPG fans, or fans of steampunk / neo-gothic artwork. The plot is gibberish, but the vibe is there and all credit to Neocore for that. Having completed a Heroic Hardcore playthrough, I'd rate this as 8/10 - genuinely enjoyable, deep character development and a good post-game adventure mode.			"

												Let's get the negative over and done with. This game is a little glitchy, and some of the voice acting is comical.Still with me? Good! Because the world is interesting, the interplay between Van Helsing and Lady Katerina is entertaining, the missions relevant, the weapons powerful, and the nooks and crannies to find treasure numerous and the loot lootable!I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys action RPGs!

												This for me was one of the highligts of the last sale, very competently done, good dialogue, very impressive and well detailed backdrops, a decent variety of things to kill and a competently done Diablo 2-esque control and combat system. The main star of the show in this game for me is the setting, a steampunk inspired continuation of the story of Van Helsing. There is even a little off colour humour from your companion, and this is even played just right so it doesn't become overbearing.Another pleasant feature is the depth of the world, there's loads of little side missions you can do that you discover during your travels, they don't affect the main plot but they add so much flavour to the world.  The game does have its downsides however, it can vary greatly in difficulty in places, varying from very, very easy to punishingly difficult, this isn't too much of a problem though and can be easily overlooked. There is also a tower defence section, while optional I really don't like tower defence and found it kind of tacked on and unnecessary. Yes it's all been done before but does that make it any less fun? I don't think so, I'd give it a 8/10			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is one of the best ARPG I've ever played. Why? Let's start with the graphics. It looks beautiful. In my opinion, it's the best looking ARPG I've ever played. Finally some ARPG that overcome Titan Quest in this part. The soundtrack is also very good.I also like the enviroment. The game takes place in a country called Borgovia. It's similiar to the one you've seen in the original Van Helsing film. The nature and the village you will visit seems to be inspired by medieval Hungary and Romania. In most of the cases, the enemies you will face in the country will be monsters- wolves, spiders, but also Rusalka, a beast from Slavic myths. The situation will change once you enter the capital city, Borgova. The city contains more steampunk elements, e.g. robot soldiers or mutants, than the countryside. Some of the buildings there are inspired by buildings from our world. What I like the most about this games is the humour. In addition to the easter eggs, the dialogs between your character and Katarina are also well written and amusing. There is also a tower defence minigame. In this minigame, three waves of enemies would like to get into your base and you must stop them. In order to do that, you can put traps on the way to your lair. It can be a platform that will activate once an enemy will step on it. Or you can place various towers next to the path leading to your base. And of course, you and Katarina will also take place in preventing your enemies to get there.What I don't like very much is the fact that skills needs mana and they also have cooldown time after you've used them. I think it is not necessary. If you ask me, I believe that only one of those should be used. I would rather use only mana, like it is done in Torchlight. And also the fact that you can shoot enemies that are below or above you is not very good, in my opinion.			"

												This is a pretty fun game to play if you're a fan of action hack n' slash RPGs like Diablo. I really didn't know what to expect when first playing, but I was pleasantly surprised. Coming from playing too much Diablo 3, I was glad that the game had more customization to your character. You are free to add points to your attributes and skill points in a skill tree.As far as the gameplay goes, it took a little bit for the game to take off for me. First, each class has a rage bar that goes up during combat. You use part of the rage bar to activate extra effects to your attacks, like stunning enemies for 2 seconds to your electric attack. You have a primary left and right-click attack, followed by 1-4 key press ""trick"" abilities, like healing. You don't level really fast, so to start getting new skills took a bit of dedication to the game. Stick with it, and you will enjoy your adventure with your ghostly companion. As far as difficulty goes, the game was nearly impossible for me on the highest difficulty. I suggest playing on the next level below that if you want a challenge that's do-able.I do like the that game has decent voice acting, since your characters will talk a lot during your adventure. When you fight monsters, you will generally be fighting a LOT at once, which really causes you to stay on your toes. It has the same feel as Diablo, fighting champion packs and elite monsters. And of course, the loot which ranges from basic non magically items to epic/set.			"

Better graphics, Better Interface (e.g. you can do the inventory management  faster via lots of keyboard & mouse combinations), Better companion. Playing TL2/Diablo3 after you have played this one feels like playing Dune2/WC1 after playing SC2. They are not bad, but this one is better!You can feel that they are pushing the genre forward in the right direction!			"

												This game is pretty cool and has a very fimiliar style to torchlight 2 with some new elements.The problem with this game is in its buggy design, the load times are outrageous and if you have a controller plugged in it's a nightmare toggling it off. Me and 3 friends played and we all had different problems I coudn't stand the load times, one of us kept freezing/crashing and then one of us was stuck using a controller and was troubleshooting when we played.It's alot of fun but clearly it has technical problems, we all actually quit playing because of them.EDITit's been more than a year and the patches came through quite well. we came back and enjoyed this game it still has minor issues but nothing like before. good game.we're considering buying #2 now.

												The Adventures of Van Helsing is great for what it is.  It has a quirky and humorous storyline and a graphical style that I enjoyed (especially the outdoor environments).Beyond that, though, it doesn't have a ton to offer.  There aren't any real game-breaking mechanics (some might enjoy the rage feature) and only modest replayability.The skill tree is nothing short of a nightmare.  Very few skills are actually viable and the progression of skill to next skill makes little sense.  Often they feel arbitrarily attached.  The DLC tried to address some of this lack, as did the second game, but all have failed pretty epicly on this front.  As barebones as VH1 is, VH2 is oversaturated and suffers from the same arbitrary requirements.This game should really only be picked up for the story and for APRG enthusiasts that are currently bored with other games.  Its low price makes it more than worth the purchase.  The storyline of the second game was ATROCIOUS, though.  So, if you fall in love with VH1, I recommend you take a peak at my VH2 review.			"

Great combat and really awesome setting. The best feature has to be the expansive skill-trees. This really is the perfect game for stat monkeys. Just one thing I have to add: Buy one of the DLC Classes, cause the standard-one gets boring really quickly. This game also has an online aspect to it but I mostly played it offline so I can't tell if it's good or not. If you are looking for an alternative to DIABLO pick this one up!			"

												Picked up the complete pack of the game this week during its sale for around $6.00, it looked decent enough, so I thought I'd try it. Oh. My. God.The game is amazing in near every way. Stunning visuals in the scenery, as well as highly detailed enemies are everywhere you turn, and the combat is well implemented as well. The skill trees are a bit scant, but they do more than well enough. The gear is amazing as well, and you can enchant your weapons and armor and install essences/gems into them as well (granted they don't do much, but this doesn't ruin the game at all). The voice acting is also pretty good, and the banter between Van Helsing and his companion Katarina is quite entertaining as well. I still haven't beaten the game yet, only towards the end of Chapter II I believe, but the game gives hours of fun and gameplay, and the DLC even adds a couple more classes to try. Honestly, the game beats most full price releases from the big companies, and it's from a small little indie developer. One of the best ARPGs out there in my own opinion. For the price, it's definitely more than worth it.			"

												Top down action games are not usually something I choose.  However, every time I saw this game, it seemed intriguing to me and I must admit that I really like the cover art. (Not a reason to buy a game, I know) When I read some reviews to try and find out what it was like, it seemed that everyone was disatisfied with it.  However, when I finally got it and started to play, I find that I really like it a lot.  Plus, no suprise, but everything that those reviewers didn't like, I like.  They complained about the leveling system, how convoluted it was and that most of the skills were meaningless.  Well, anyone who has played the later FF games will feel right at home here. All of the skills and perks are interesting and well balanced so that you really have to think about what you want to choose or level up.  The game did seem really hard at first.  But, once I learned to play it properly (meaning to use all the tools I am given) then it became much more engrossing and fun.  Another reviewer complaint was the humor in the game.  There is a lot of really dry, tongue in cheek banter between Van Helsing and his ghostly companion.  I really like it and it never reaches annoying levels.Finally, there is a lot of detail in the game and you can zoom in far enough to actually be able to appreciate it.  Visually, all of the locations are exceptionaly well created.  The level designs are also well laid out with huge amounts of detail.  There are a mondo amount of items that can be used, exchanged, modified, crafted and so on.  So, as you can tell, I really like it a lot.I have not really found an engrossing story yet, but I feel I still have a lot to play.  Also, sometimes, the other voice actors can be pretty extreme.  But those two things are really minor as far as I am concerned.So, you might pick it up when you are in the mood for that kind of game.			"

												I'd say this game is a pretty solid title for the first run-through, but replayability is lacking.  Rather than follow the Diablo model of allowing the player to re-play the original game from any unlocked portal point, you are instead given a small handful of scenarios, and none of the Boss monsters.  That portion was incredibly disappointing.However, if you just happened to pick up some rather ""Epic""-looking weapon with stats that cater to an entirely different playstyle and build, you can fully re-spec with ease and a little extra coin, which is fairly easy to obtain.

												This game is a shame. It starts quite well, but as soon as you are progressing through the game, the flaws appear very clearly.The maps are very small and therefore, instead of creating more areas, the devs have favored the overfilling of the few maps with thousands of monsters. Yes that's true it's a H&S, but in this game the maps are literally overcrowded by unimaginative packs of monsters.Second disappointment is when your realize that the game mechanics are botched up : adding strength also add life (good for melee fighters). If you choose to play as ranged characters, you'll have to split your stats between dexterity (ranged) and strength (for not being insta-killed by the endless swarms mentioned above), and therefore preventing your ranged character to dispatch efficiently the monsters (who are packed tight).Therefore the game is heavily favored and unbalanced at best. Combat versus the final boss is also a freaking pain to play : you have to run around in circles for literally 20 minutes (check the videos on youtube), praying that the boss and the sarm of werewolves-on-steroids will not one-shot you, as you can't save during this combat.Avoid this game by all cost, this deceiving game is not worth your trouble.

												The incredible adventures of Van Helsing is a hack and slash type game and a very good one in my honest opinion. It does seem to be a bit heavy on the hardware side and to be fair it is not bad on the graphics side. It has a wide variety of skills to choose from, and where it really gets a plus from my side is the ability to choose between ranged and melee combat depending how you distribute your points. The game has a nice difficulty not too easy and not too hard and I quite enjoyed myself completing it. It does have multiplayer, which I have not tried out yet, but I could imagine it only gets more fun playing with friends.Story wise it is not perfect but it is all right and a nice gimmick is the tower defense based game you experience in the game.All in all a solid game that does what was intended and it has a buttload of DLC if you want expand on it.Buy it you will not regret it...

												Pros: Very fun gameplay. Tight, funny, flirty companion dialog. Action-packed fighting, and loads of loot. Decent graphics and effects.Cons: Lame story, the ending was disappointing and abrupt. Not too much feels cohesive. The main plot seems to be a device to get you from one location to the next.Recap, if you like playing a game for the mechanics, it's an enjoyable ride. The character and story development is weak, the quests are bland, which is a shame because this could've been easily a fantastic game with a little more help on the writing side. Still a fairly fun game, just unsatisfying ultimately.7/10			"

												I decided to play The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing after viewing the trailer, and getting some exhaustion from Diablo III and Torchlight 2. This one seemed to be a decent Hack & Slash, with a nice twist regarding the setting of central Europa and possibly legions of blood-sucking foes.In this game, you play a single character, Van Helsing, who is followed by a ghostly teammate, Katarina. You don't have to choose a class before playing, and just develop your character along the way, using several skill trees.Basically, you can eradicate a significant amount of monsters by using either a sword or a gun. Each weapon has its specific skill tree with numerous styles of slashes and shots. Each one can be leveled up, or customized with additional powers, triggered by Rage. Also, you can wander in the side of magic by learning strikes blending physical and magical damage, even pure magical damage. If not enough, you can learn passive abilities and active spells, that can take advantage of some specific situations or simply save your butt - leaving you with a fair amount of combinations to craft.The amount of damage you do or can endure is proportional to basic weapon and armor stats, plus the different levels of your character stats and skills, combined with the multiple bonuses you can get from gear. Very similar to Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2. So don't fall in love with that particular weapon or gear if the next one is seamingly up a notch, the impact could be tremendous.On top of that, your translucent female sidekick is not only witty, but can be used either as a melee fighter, a ranged shooter or a decent support. She also can level up and has her own gear and skill tree to become a tactical partner or a stat multiplier.At this point, it's pretty clear that this game targets an audience that loves to analyse how hundred skills relate to each other, carefully crafting the most badass character possible, something like ""hit once, obliterate many"". It's a good thing to have a significant amount of depth that way (remember Titan Quest !) but for me it was just like ""too much"". So I decided to focus on a restricted number of skills, low enough to keep me focused on the actual map cleaning.The game is linear, with some quests on the side. The levels are not really beautiful but varied, and the enemies compensate lack of intelligence by sheer number. Luckily, the dialog between Van Helsing and Katarina are funny so you can have a good time playing them.Something that kinda puzzled me was the introduction of a micro-game of Tower Defense. Not that it wasn't interesting or refreshing, but it seemed that the developers decided to put everything remotely cool in the game, thus pushing it in the Land of Blended Genre where chances of survival are slim. Luckily, the Tower Defense micro-game is nicely done, but too much thin for consideration. Overall, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a good Hack & Slash, that can satisfy seasoned players, but could be daunting to newcomers.			"

To that point we just did not even know that it were attempted jokes, that made the dialoge so awful.TL;DRMove along...			"

												I bought Van Helsing on launch day. Let that settle in. I absolutely wanted to believe this would finally bring all the lore of Van Helsing to the principles of a great action game and it hit the nail on the head. Yes, there were teething problems on Day 1, coop was broken and it was clear that if you wanted to join someone else's game you had to be prepared to either move forward or backwards in your own solo campaign, however the action, the fantastic campaign, and the fabulous NPC companion  was just what I was looking for as an alternative to Diablo 3. I say alternative as I love Diablo 1 & 2 and lambasted the notion of the third on the basis of the auction house and the draconian DRM out of, what I can only assume, was Blizzard's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ised view of the PC platform and their need to feed the greed train. If you want the fantastic action of Torchlight 2, with the grinding of Diablo with the wonderful dialogue of Dragon age do yourself a favour and get this game. It is WELL worth the money.EDIT: Now with the edition of controller support this will look and play fantastic on NVidia Shield.			"

												You know what'd be great? If I could play the game. That's an aspect you need, right? To be able to play the game? Not just sit at a ""System Requirements being measured"" screen for god knows how long, only to figure out you've been waiting for over 4 hours for it to load. Point is, it doesn't work. I've tried it on not one, but two different computers. BOTH with the requirements to play it, and it just crashes at the first screen. I've asked for help on forums, and no one has a decent mindset to give me feedback. So I'm gonna come out and say if the community sucks so bad they can't give a nice response, I can't imagine how it must be in-game. So, if anyone has a nice helpful response, I'm open for it.			"

												Wonderfully designed ARPG video game which could give other games in the same genre (like Path of Exile) a run for the money, if improved upon on a grand scale. Relatively limited in multiplayer potential due to its single player-intended audience, indie nature, and lack of population (as of current).Gameplay is great. The learning curve in the beginning is slightly difficult due to the extensive multitasking involved (in addition to two main attack skills bound to your mouse buttons, their upgrades, and health and mana potions, you must also use supportive skills, called Tricks, totaling four different elements you must consider at all times).However, you are given a unique AI companion called ""Lady Katarina"", who has a uniquely designed AI that is well-balanced and serves as if it were a real partner playing in the game with you. Luckily, she only requires minimal maintenance and guidance, as she can handle herself perfectly fine.Some conveniences offered are the ability to pause the game (in single player), and switch to and from multiplayer at any time. Progress is saved regardless of which mode you choose, and you can toggle the option for the game to create a new instance (respawn all enemies) at your own discretion. The game is incredibly optimized, and ""alt-tabbing"" occurs instantly, without screen load.Unlike other similar games, where 'scrolls' are necessary to identify items or warp back to home, Van Helsing offers them for free, unlimited, and at any time (item identification is generally limited to 'Unique' items and 'set items', which are an uncommon drop in themselves, and there is a Town Portal button placed on your screen for convenient escape at any time). The Town Portal button is also convenient to have in times the game truly does glitch and you are unable to get out.The game is limited in scope due to the availability of only three kinds of characters, two of which are unlocked from DLC purchases (I purchased a Humble Bundle, so these were already included). These kinds are essentially melee, magic, and ranged, and characters are incapable of utilizing equipment from other classes.Although post-game continuation is implemented in the form of ""Scenarios"" (essentially ""challenge missions"" often seen in other games), and ""Neverending Story"" (known familiarily as ""New Game +"" to most gamers), the introduction of its sequel has since reduced the desirability of it in this game.There are many other pros to be said about this game, but I will leave it to you to try it yourself. It is definitely a recommend, and it is definitely worth the money (especially if you fetch it on sale). Overall, I would give the game an honest 7.5/10 for being superbly solid (based on an pseudo-IMDb rating scheme, where 9-10 is beyond excellent). It doesn't quite reach an 8 as it has its flaws, but it cannot be given a 7 as they are insignificant to the overall game.			"

												Awesome Action RPG, sort of in the vein of Diablo and Torchlight. Don't get this thinking it's just like those games though. There are a lot of differences, such as a much different skill system that might take you a while to get the hang of. I bought the normal game and all the DLC, so obviously I enjoyed the game a lot. Basically it's just a complicated, unique ARPG in a giant sea of more casual ARPGs. Definitely give it a shot though, since it's relatively cheap for how expansive it is. Also, they're making the sequel and it should be out later this year.			"

												If you like Torchlight or Diablo, Van Helsing is right up your alley and you won't be disaapointed with this purchase especially for the price. It also has Coop as a plus and the combat is fun. The devs here seem to have looked closely at what Diablo and Torchlight did well and merged them into one. All it needs is some character diversity and these guys will be on the right path to the next AAA title giving Blizzard Entertainment a run for their money. Quite honestly its so well done, it begins to make you wonder how Blizzard was even able to charge full price for all the problems Diablo 3 had since its release and is currently still working to correct.

												A legitimately fresh look at the genre, with all the upsides of recent advancements and few of the flaws. Skills are varied and scalable, and can be modded on the fly to whole new ends. Passives are valuable, abilities easy to use, weapons fresh and fun. Your companion is equippable, has her own skills and passives, and has an AI you can customize to any style. Combat can be difficult, not fake difficult but truly hard. And the visuals and audio are good... Although the music can get slightly repetitive. All in all, one of my favorite new games of 2013, especially at this price point.			"

												The incredible adventures of Van Helsing is a hack and slash type game and a very good one in my honest opinion. It does seem to be a bit heavy on the hardware side and to be fair it is not bad on the graphics side. It has a wide variety of skills to choose from, and where it really gets a plus from my side is the ability to choose between ranged and melee combat depending how you distribute your points. The game has a nice difficulty not too easy and not too hard and I quite enjoyed myself completing it. It does have multiplayer, which I have not tried out yet, but I could imagine it only gets more fun playing with friends.Story wise it is not perfect but it is all right and a nice gimmick is the tower defense based game you experience in the game.All in all a solid game that does what was intended and it has a buttload of DLC if you want expand on it.Buy it you will not regret it...

												I decided to play The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing after viewing the trailer, and getting some exhaustion from Diablo III and Torchlight 2. This one seemed to be a decent Hack & Slash, with a nice twist regarding the setting of central Europa and possibly legions of blood-sucking foes.In this game, you play a single character, Van Helsing, who is followed by a ghostly teammate, Katarina. You don't have to choose a class before playing, and just develop your character along the way, using several skill trees.Basically, you can eradicate a significant amount of monsters by using either a sword or a gun. Each weapon has its specific skill tree with numerous styles of slashes and shots. Each one can be leveled up, or customized with additional powers, triggered by Rage. Also, you can wander in the side of magic by learning strikes blending physical and magical damage, even pure magical damage. If not enough, you can learn passive abilities and active spells, that can take advantage of some specific situations or simply save your butt - leaving you with a fair amount of combinations to craft.The amount of damage you do or can endure is proportional to basic weapon and armor stats, plus the different levels of your character stats and skills, combined with the multiple bonuses you can get from gear. Very similar to Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2. So don't fall in love with that particular weapon or gear if the next one is seamingly up a notch, the impact could be tremendous.On top of that, your translucent female sidekick is not only witty, but can be used either as a melee fighter, a ranged shooter or a decent support. She also can level up and has her own gear and skill tree to become a tactical partner or a stat multiplier.At this point, it's pretty clear that this game targets an audience that loves to analyse how hundred skills relate to each other, carefully crafting the most badass character possible, something like ""hit once, obliterate many"". It's a good thing to have a significant amount of depth that way (remember Titan Quest !) but for me it was just like ""too much"". So I decided to focus on a restricted number of skills, low enough to keep me focused on the actual map cleaning.The game is linear, with some quests on the side. The levels are not really beautiful but varied, and the enemies compensate lack of intelligence by sheer number. Luckily, the dialog between Van Helsing and Katarina are funny so you can have a good time playing them.Something that kinda puzzled me was the introduction of a micro-game of Tower Defense. Not that it wasn't interesting or refreshing, but it seemed that the developers decided to put everything remotely cool in the game, thus pushing it in the Land of Blended Genre where chances of survival are slim. Luckily, the Tower Defense micro-game is nicely done, but too much thin for consideration. Overall, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a good Hack & Slash, that can satisfy seasoned players, but could be daunting to newcomers.			"

												This game is awesome, really, it's very much like Diablo but fun. I haven't played the multi-player just the single player story. It's engaging, it is full of random film references the fights are challenging without being unfair and there is plenty of hidden content to get on with.It also has a tower defense element to it later in the game where you have to defend your base against swarms of enemies by placing traps and fighting off the horde. OK you only have 1 class to play (Van Helsing) and a skill tree which means you will either specialist in Melee or Ranged with a bit of magic thrown in. If I was honest, this is a much better game than Diablo 3, it doesn't force you to play and complete the game 3 times just to get to the challenging levels. A worthy purchase.			"

												A disclaimer: I have only attempted to play this game in co-op.So far this is a tale of two things:1) A very enjoyable ARPG which brings a very good set of monster smashing tools to the fore, and then inhibits your ability to enjoy them with a non stop loot lottery which takes considerable time to manage.2) Bugs. Bugs. Bugs.  Trying to play in co-op has been so incredibly painful with crashing, failed connections and myriad other inconsistencies it feels very much like an early beta feature.  This is very disappointing because point #1 spurs my friend and I to play and then point #2 rears it's ugly head and smashes all that desire down.Overall, if you are planning to play solo, I recommend the game to any fan of ARPGs.If you were hoping for a co-op smash with your friends?  Come back in a few months.			"

												This is a great game. Some of the things I like: controller support so I can sit back with my XBox 360 controller, plus with the Blue Blood DLC your companion becomes a very effective tank. It also works well with nVidia 3D but the text becomes a bit hard to read. The game is very well balanced (and frequently patched). I am working on a mage build. A couple of things I don't like is having to buy classes as DLC, also Town Portal is broken. You can town portal out of combat - even with bosses. Also when you return back from a town portal, you are likely to be mobbed by every enemy in the area - very painful if you exit the game after clearing an area out and then restart it.			"

												This game I picked up on a whim, and it turned out to be one of my, if not my absolute, favorite dungeon crawlers ever! The combat is visceral and has loads of impact and tons of play styles. Creature designs are interesting and varied. The loot system rains equipment upon you as frequently as the gore of your fallen foes.Graphically, for a 3/4 view dungeon crawler, this game looks fantastic! Character models are noticeably detailed and the environments look great. I'd say they are on par, and in some places, better than Diablo 3. Sound design is fantastic as well. The voice acting, while sometimes almost purposely cheesy, is very well done. The music, while not memorable, is not BAD. It just often gets drowned out by screaming and explosions. Story is decent as well. Not the games strong point, but no one plays dungeon crawlers for the story. However, I will say the story is significantly better than most I've played.Has several multi-player modes, but I haven't had the opportunity to play them, so I can't say how they are.The game has 2 glaring down sides, neither of them deal breaking:1 - I don't know if the game is optimized poorly, or what, but when you start the game, there is a very long pause, almost as if the game has frozen. There is no indication that anything is loading. After the first time it isn't an issue, but initially, it's jarring.2 - A similar problem happens with the loading screens. It takes quite a while for the loading ""bar"" to start to fill and the whole screen just reeks of ""frozen game"". I've nearly Alt+F4 many times because I assumed it had frozen.Only other bad thing I can think of is the game is pretty short. A max level cap of 30 and a 10 hour campaign feel prematurely ended. I wanted more of this game very badly, but for $15, I can't complain to much. I will definitely keep an eye out for Neocore games in the future			"

												4/10Szóval hol kezdjem ....A játék ""jónak"" indult a grafika nem nagy szám de megfelel nem anyira látványos de ezzel nincs bajom ezér meg kapja a 10 pontból az első 2-et. Szóval haladjunk sorjába. A játék elmeséli a történetet bár közel sem anyira látványosan mint ahogy gondolnánk pár kép kocka 30 perc duma és kész.. a történet elmegy ""egész jó"" de semmi egyedit nem kecsegtett de + 2 pont jár neki ami igy már 4/10 . Most jön a kérdés..: akkor mi a helyzett? 4/10 és a többiről nem is beszéltél.. akkor most mivan? Ezt a játékok nagyon túl becsülik. kezdetben 1 karaktert készíthetünk amit különbözőképpen építhetünk. Testreszabás lehetőség kimerül a 10 féle színű ugyanolyan ruhából. +2 karkter fizetős dlc-ből jön. Ez nagy pofátlanság máshol alap a minimum 4 karakter itt meg 3 van és abból is 2 fizetős.. (hozáteszem maga a 2 dlc drágább egyenként mint a maga a játék),Nem baj mindegy lehet ettől még jó nem? hát nem, következő hibák 2013 ban megjellent játék-ban nehogy már netudjanak egy-egy szörny/ember/valami -ből legalább 3 fajtát csinálni.. szégyen jön 2millió ugyanolyan ember Klón megölni egy harcban. Pazar az a tény is hogy minimális animációk vannak 3 féle ütés + 6 féle varázslat.... ÉS a Magyar fejlesztésű játékba nem fért bele Magyar szinkrón de MÉG EGY NORMÁLIS MAGYAR FELIRAT SEM. Anyám elnézést de mi az hogy félig magyar félig nem ??? a szöveg közepén angol az előt meg utána meg Magyar?? Úristen, a játék elvileg online Játokot is tudd de ezt felejtsük el mert azon kivül hogy néha müködik néha bemongya a halált ,... ha még is sikerül elindulni akkor is ROHADTUL BUGOS, Igy 2 év távlatában is amikor megvettük 2 -en a haverommal a 3 . küldin nem tudtunk tovább menni mert a bug nem engedte ,,, az adott szőrny csoport amit lekellett volna kaszálni mindig újá éllet és az ami előidézte meg 3 millio HP-ja volt. (akkor még kb 20-akat csapsz) Singleplayerbe tovább lehet menni igaz.. de multiba nem és ez nem mentség .. és amikor kikerültük külön-külön singlibe ezt a buggot akkor meg egy másik jőt. Az online funkció ""Uslees"" . Singlibe is rengetek bug van az átvezetők elcsusznak mintha tört játékkal játszanék.A karakter fellet a a felirat elcsuszik a kamera fekete kockákat mutatt -- olykor nem látn isemmit. Azon kivűl egy - egy pozitivum ,hogy az Angol szinkron király és a párbeszédek sem rosszak.. de ez egyszerüen nem elég. Vannak secretek de azok inkább unalmasak mint érdekesek. Már javítani tuti nem fogják szóval ezt érdemes hagyni. A 2. résszel nem játszottam azt hallotam az nagyon jó lett . De ezt az élményt kihagytam volna. Még ugyis hogy mind össze 5 dolláromba azaz kemény 1000 per száz FT-ba fájt a game. hiába Magyar fejleszésű egyszerüen ez sajnálatos... Nem értem miért vagyok én az első aki ez leírja..			"

												I actually like this game much more than Diablo 3. I feel it is much deeper in function and I prefer the story material in Van Helsing over D3.There are some performance issues with my laptop. but on my gaming desktop, it runs amazing and looks pretty good. Just make sure you have some semi-decent hardware, and you will be good.All in all, if you liked D3, you would probably love this game.			"

Lady Katarina your ghostly companion injects some great humour into the game her AI and abilities are great. She also has some very useful functional settings such as collecting loot and how she will fight (which you decide, set and can change on the fly in battle). This game is very similar to the torchlight games so if you like those you will probably love this. Highly recommended. 10/10			"

												For the genre of ARPG this game stands out among those like Path of Exile and Torchlight as the spiritual successors to Diablo 2.   What makes this game more unique is its story, and its skill system.   It takes the story of Van Helsing and throws you into the very midst of a gothic era where monsters rule the landscape.    With only the basic class to choose from unless you get DLC there isn't much variety in the terms of classes, but in my opinion the DLC is worth the price because it gives you two other, very unique classes to play that give a very distinct flavor to the game with each class you play.  With a full fledged multiplayer system, friends make this game even more enjoyable as you go on a monster hunting romp through a forest with your buddies.All in all, 8/10. Would Play.			"

												While the story writing isn't the worst and some of the banter is amusing...this game is really just not all that fun unless you very much enjoy the mindless repetition of hack and slashing over and over with giant packs of enemies that require little to no strategy to defeat with the right build. The biggest downside and the reason I wouldn't recommend it, is it crashing frequently. To each their own, the game itself wasn't too bad, it just didn't manage to keep my attention.			"

												I had my eye on this game for a little while and like several Steam games before it, I wish I'd known how great it was sooner.I picked it up on the Halloween Sale and found it to be a new PC favoriteIt has a feel of the older style of games with gameplay slightly reminiscent of Gauntlet with an almost dungeon crawl feel.The maps are expansive and the exploration is very fun.The combat is smooth and simple to pick up and unlike most games that give you mana and health potions, this one requires you use them; too often any type of hack and slash or RPG style game bogs you down with so many potions but often also gives you such power or ability that it makes the entire system moot, not in The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, you can expect to be swarmed by enemies and need every last health potion to get free and survive, it adds a nice element of challenge to the game and keeps it from being boring.The graphics are good, while I've never been the type to say that great graphics make a great game, I do feel that a game that is great can also have great graphics, this game has well designed characters and beautiful scenery.The dialogue and voice acting is well written, sarcastic, humorous and at times a bit morbid but it all fits in perfect for this monster hunter universe.If you haven't played this game yet, you need to buy it.I would recommend this game for anyone.

												A surprisingly good ARPG, with high production value for an indie. The writing is sometimes funny and quirky, but too often falls into tired tropes and old memes. The game looks great, with solid sound design backing it up. The powers are varied enough to try a multitude of builds, and cheap respecs and ample equipment encourage trying a few out. Most of the powers feel great too, lightning bolts have a thunderous retort, and sword slashes feel quick and deadly. Sadly only the basic (But highly adaptable) hunter class is included, the other two classes are DLC. They have fewer skills but are more focused on particular play styles. If you decide to play the game, I strongly suggest you play on the hardest, 'heroic', difficulty; the game isn't very difficult and you will get much better loot.			"

												TIAVH isn't a horrible game, but it's not quite up to par.  If you picked this up in a bundle or on a deep discount, it'd be worth spending some time with, but otherwise, I wouldn't drop my money into this game.The environment's graphics are decent, but the UI is horrible, with very little explanation in the beginning of the features of the UI.  While the basics of the UI are easy enough to determine, much of it is not intuitive at all.  There is a tutorial popup system, which attempts to help you out, but it seems to only point out those parts which are intuitive.The gameplay isn't bad at all, but unfortunately the targetting system is horrible here.  you can almost not aim for specific mobs unless they are on their own.  At least the game highlights the target that you are aiming for, but unfortunately line-of-sight issues mean you're often shooting an object or another enemy that's in the line of fire instead.			"

												I've played many games of this type, each with it's own merits and snags. But The Amazing Adventures of Van Helsing takes the cake, for being the most enjoyable ride of them all. For starters, no game of this type has made me die because laughed at the NPC banter during a fight xD. ""Join me Van Helsing, and together we can rule Borgovia!""...I'm sure you can guess the pop culture reference! Your very own companion, a ghost called Lady Katerina has her tongue firmly in cheek, and is never shy of a poking comment on any range of matters, or joking that she stole your money when you send her to town to clear your inventory.Moving on to actual game play. Right from the start you have a few choices on how to build up your toon. These range from all out gun slinger, to melee brawler, with or without the addition of elemental damage. You can further tweak your gameplay with additional spells, that heal, or that multiply your companion, stop time, boost damage etc. You can switch weapon skills around. As well as give them a rage bar fueled bonus. With all this at  hand there are several builds that work well, meaning you can actually play as you find comfortable as opposed to cookie cutter buids. Untill you get the hang of things (especially if  you start your first game on Hard), you might find TAAVH rather challenging, but you find yourself welcoming that as you find your feet! All in all The Amazing Adventures of Van Helsing is right up there as one of my favourite games. Infinitealy more charming than Diablo 3 and more fun than Torchlight 2.Personal Rating: BUY IT ALREADY OMG! Percentage Rating: 95%. Epic Fun and a good challenge!			"

PLAY The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing? MAYBE - Depending on how much you are intrested in the Universe and are COMPLETELY BURNED OUT on other Diablo-clones. Pros:+Inexpensive+Potentially high replay value due to Scenario mode and replays.+Good looking ""Cheap"" indie game. Fire spells can burn grass and enemies react to world physics like Titan Quest+Robust behavior system for your Companion - define how she battle and retrieves loot+Great voice acting and humorous banter between player character Van Helsing and companion Katarina+Frequent developer updates+Has online multiplayer+Scratches the ""Hack and Loot"" itch+Enjoyable adaptation of the Van Helsing universe.Mids=Glory System that can't be used until after game completion or end game=Interesting and semi-unique tower defense quests. Think Orcs Must Die meets Diablo II=Great looking interface, but small font size used in most of UI.=Good, Fitting music, but has limited tracks.=The game is about Van Helsing's son, not Van Helsing. Should this not be called ""Son of Van Helsing""?Cons:-Repetitive combat-Numerous reported bugs/crashes - inconsistent among player base-As of writing, no players were online and players aren't on often (11-3-2014)-Limited hotbar/keybindings based on Console friendly game development-Secondary Tab Hotbar inefficient for combat-Artifact Forge used to generate random gear based on gear you input into the system often results in junk.-I have tons of Essences (Gems) and can only use a small portion of them-Unfair combat encounters whilch lead to me qutting the game.Full ImpressionOn the Surface, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is a pretty good, solid indie ARPG. It's inexpensive, often on sale, has great graphics and voice acting for an indie game, and scratches that loot, level up and kill itch these games tend to do. TIAVH borrows elements from Torchlight II including limited class selection, an activatable rage mode to use spell power ups and a companion that can engage in combat,collect loot, store loot and buy potions from town stores. The gothic/steampunk UI looks sharp and fits the world perfectly. Gear has a nice, unique, though sometimes slightly annoying ehancement system called Essence - so instead of having Gem slots/sockets, gear has a limited capacity of Essence Pieces that have a varying effects and Essence points. There is a perk system that allows the player to choose a permanent buff every time they level up in Reputation. Another unique mechanic of the game is the optional Tower Defense style combat sections. There's also a Scenario mode that lets you play special maps and earn permanent buffs to your account, much like Badass Points from Borderland 2, provided you reach level 27, which unfortunately, I have not. For the most part, the core gameplay is pretty similar to any well recieved ARPG.IssuesUnfortunately, while the core is solid, the exterior is damaged by various problems that eventually ended my enjoyment of the game.CombatMany players reported the combat being a little repetitive. While I think there are enough varied enemies with an array of different attacks, the end result of each encounter was almost exactly the same - Find a horde of 10+ enemies that swarm you in a instant, requiring you to infinitely kite them around spamming the same 2-4 spells/tricks. This didn't bother me, even up to my final moments with the game, but it is something to note if the repetition sounds annoying to you and is a problem in this game due to a limited hotbar key assignments - likely a symptom of the console cross-platform development (this game was developed for Xbox 360). However, the lack of an extended hotbar meant that I could only reliably use 6 total skills and meant that I didn't bother with getting new ones, since they couldn't be used efficiently. While you do have a second hotbar with the Tab button, this doesn't work well in practice as you may lose access to some of your more helpful skills (like slowing time or a heal spell) to make room on a second bar with skills that you don't use often (which in turn are probably weaker because you didn't invest ability points into them). Torchlight II had a similar mechanic, but it still let you use 1-0 instead of 1-4. I understand that the design means I don't have to jump my hands all over the keyboard like other ARPGs, but it also meant that I had less usability and mostly relied on the same couple of skill the entirity of the game.DLCYou are also stuck with one class, the Hunter (Warrior type), unless you by DLC for The Thaumaturge (Mage) and/or Archane Mechanic (Summoner, maybe Ranged/Rogue as well). However, there a variety of spells and potential builds for each class and the complete package and DLC are often on sale. I bought the package before even realized that the other classes were behind a paywall.StabilityOne of the biggest issues are bugs, which tend to vary quite widely depending on the player.  Minor bugs I ran into where graphical gltiches with my mage spells and sometimes, I don't think all the math on gear adds up quite correctly. My biggest bug is where I had a four enemy boss battle which never activated after the cutscene, so the enemies just stood their not attacking and could not be harmed as well. I had to use a console command to remove the quest from my Journal, but I still couldn't kill the bosses. I've stopped playing after that point and came back to the game many months later and it still was not fixed. The devs do appear to update the game quite frequently and they deserve credit for that, but technical issues are reported often on the forums. Laregely, nothing was game breaking besides that one boss battle and I was still able to play a large chunk (maybe the majority) of the game before I quit with out other major issues.Rage QuitThe nail in the coffin for me was the fact that once I reached Old Town, I died WAY to frequently. I died relatively often in this game before because I was playing Hard difficutly with a glass cannon mage, but despite even pushing more Attribute points and gear to increase my health and defense, I would often die to one hit kills and my ""Glass cannon"" build didn't have a reliable AOE attack or way to survive - most enemies are too fast to outrun and if we couldn't kill them, we died. It was more like a ""Glass Rifle"" build. While this problem is possibly due to my difficulty and build, the idea in these games is that any build should be viable in this type of game, and since my only possible strategy was kiting enemies that were too fast for me, there was nothing else I could do to advance (short of abusing the respawn system to advance) and I lost interest. Thank goodness I didn't play Hardcore.ConclusionThis game is a prime example of why Steam reviews needs a ""Maybe"" recommendation option. There is a lot of good here that I spent 20+hrs with, but utimately rage quit the game which most likely eliminated my chance of buying the sequel. it is worth noting that the developers still seem to update this game, but it has been out for a 1.5 years and I encountered major problems that weren't fixed. I can much reccommend Torchlight II, Path of Exile, Titan Quest, Diablo II/III, Darkspore and potentiall Grim Dawn over this. I REALLY want to add TIAVH to that list of good ARPGs, but my experience was ruined and it comes at a difficult recommendation. If you are looking specifically for this type of gameplay, then play the other games I mentioned. If you are more interested in the Van Helsing universe and setting, then this and possibly the sequene are probably the best video games you will get based on the world.			"

												""The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing"" is way more than a well done Diablo III Clone.Although the Story is linear with few sidequests (less than 30), it is told refreshingly humorous. The interaction with Van Helsings follower Katarina is peppered with snide comments and fits well to his grim, ""try to sound controlled"" theme.The alchemy system is helpful and versatile from the second quest on until the lategame.All in all great game with huge replay value, keep on hunting!

												Wonderfully designed ARPG video game which could give other games in the same genre (like Path of Exile) a run for the money, if improved upon on a grand scale. Relatively limited in multiplayer potential due to its single player-intended audience, indie nature, and lack of population (as of current).Gameplay is great. The learning curve in the beginning is slightly difficult due to the extensive multitasking involved (in addition to two main attack skills bound to your mouse buttons, their upgrades, and health and mana potions, you must also use supportive skills, called Tricks, totaling four different elements you must consider at all times).However, you are given a unique AI companion called ""Lady Katarina"", who has a uniquely designed AI that is well-balanced and serves as if it were a real partner playing in the game with you. Luckily, she only requires minimal maintenance and guidance, as she can handle herself perfectly fine.Some conveniences offered are the ability to pause the game (in single player), and switch to and from multiplayer at any time. Progress is saved regardless of which mode you choose, and you can toggle the option for the game to create a new instance (respawn all enemies) at your own discretion. The game is incredibly optimized, and ""alt-tabbing"" occurs instantly, without screen load.Unlike other similar games, where 'scrolls' are necessary to identify items or warp back to home, Van Helsing offers them for free, unlimited, and at any time (item identification is generally limited to 'Unique' items and 'set items', which are an uncommon drop in themselves, and there is a Town Portal button placed on your screen for convenient escape at any time). The Town Portal button is also convenient to have in times the game truly does glitch and you are unable to get out.The game is limited in scope due to the availability of only three kinds of characters, two of which are unlocked from DLC purchases (I purchased a Humble Bundle, so these were already included). These kinds are essentially melee, magic, and ranged, and characters are incapable of utilizing equipment from other classes.Although post-game continuation is implemented in the form of ""Scenarios"" (essentially ""challenge missions"" often seen in other games), and ""Neverending Story"" (known familiarily as ""New Game +"" to most gamers), the introduction of its sequel has since reduced the desirability of it in this game.There are many other pros to be said about this game, but I will leave it to you to try it yourself. It is definitely a recommend, and it is definitely worth the money (especially if you fetch it on sale). Overall, I would give the game an honest 7.5/10 for being superbly solid (based on an pseudo-IMDb rating scheme, where 9-10 is beyond excellent). It doesn't quite reach an 8 as it has its flaws, but it cannot be given a 7 as they are insignificant to the overall game.			"

												This is a really nice game.I personally love arpgs, but more the fantasy atmosphere and the fact that you are a hero in a story. I don't care to finish a game more times to get better loot or to play it online. And this game is really good with the single player campaign. The story is simplistic like in other similar games so kill the bad guy, save the world, but here the story is always present when you play. You got feedbacks from it consantly. In a lot of games of the genre the story is a background and you just grind without knowing what happens really. I liked as well how the side quests were offered. It is not necessary to complete them, but they are in correlation with the main storyline, so completing them you enrich the story itself. So it was very enjoyable playing it. Also the action is good. Not easy, sometimes frustrating, but it is really not enough to just click and tank. You need to use strategy anyway you die even in normal. Some enemies are strong but not fast, so you need to attack them from behind or from the side, or shoot them. The ranged enemies hit you hard, so you need to kill them first anyway you are dead. So using strategy is essential, and it is very good that you need to think a bit while clicking.The humour is a great factor in the game, it is nice that it doesn't take serious itself.A lot of people criticises the voice acting. I think it was also okay, the borgovian npc-s speak english with an eastern european accent, it is not bad as Borgovia is a fictional eastern european state. I recently rewatched the movie, and Kate Beckinsale who is actually english, acted with a horrible eastern european accent, because she was a transilvanian (actually a romanian or hungarian) princess.So I really enjoyed the hours with the game, but there were some frustrating factors as well.It is a good thing that if you kill a pack of enemy it doesn't reborn in the stage, so if you killed everyone you can search for hidden things. It is great, I don't like continous grinding, maybe this is the most boring thing in an arpg, but if you exit the game and restart, the system remembers until where you arrived so you don' need to reexplore the place, but the enemies reborn. As the fighting is really intense and hardcore, it is really frustrating to arrive to the place where you finished earlier as the groups are more difficult to finish than in other arpg games.So if you have just half an hours to play it is really not your game. It will be very frustrating for you, as the stages are huge. It is better if you can dedicate some hours to play for it.There were some minor bugs in the grapichs sometimes, but it was not so disturbing.And for concluding you play with Van Helsing. It's cool as hell :) Recommend this game.			"

												Remember back in the 90s when you would still discover new things about the characters you played halfway through the game? The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing takes you back to those days. The skill-and ability systems are layered and complex and will require you to think them through and test them out thoroughly. Even on normal mode, this game is a challenge, even more so when you are joined by friends. For some players this complexity will be a turn-off, but for others it will be a welcome challenge.Great design, over-the-top but funny voice-acting and a nice challenge for those who wish it.			"

												The Incredibly Long Title of Van Helsing is a fun 10-12 hour (main campaign) hack and slashy romp. What's there is good, though the melee could use a bit more... oomfph.The skil tree is a bit shallow and some of the abilities don't scale too well at higher difficulties. While the power up system is a unique gimmick, it boils down either feeling too clunky to use on the fly or becoming an automated left or right click with the auto option turned on.The humor is very tongue-and-cheek and often breaks the fourth wall. Voice acting is pretty good overall with hilariously stereotypical vampire and mad scientist voices. Environments are well used. Even though you spend half your time in a forest, each one feels unique.The inventory management and itemization in this game is one of the best in this genre. A simple thing like automatically reorganizing if you pick up something and logically have the space to do so if not for one stupidly placed sword is a godsend.Overall if Van Helsing had a deeper and more complex skill tree along with a Newgame+ instead of just a pure endgame, this would be a worthy competitor to the big ARPGs. As it is now, it's still a decent romp for its price.			"

												The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing (Nth Review)This game is better than Diablo 3. Okay, that was too easy...This game is better than Torchlight 2. There you go!And indeed I like it much better than TL2. The world of ""Helsing"" is a steampunk-ish one with a little bit of the old classic Diablo gothic horror atmosphere, combined with many throwbacks to horror classics in film and literature. The graphic style reflects that very well, being less cartoonish than D3 and TL2, while still being colorful enough to avoid monotony. The sound and voice acting are very good, just not outstanding.The story is nothing special, but avoids being too generic via its strong characters and some interesting side quests. Especially the humor of this game is brilliant with a lot of jokes within the world, as well as on ARPGs and games in general.In terms of gameplay this game delivers a big chunk of ARPG goodness with different playstyles, an interesting NPC partner (a ghost!) and lots of customisation for your gear and skills. The monsters require different tactics and the balance is very fair, but can be hard sometimes.Rating: Very recommendable!			"

Szóval haladjunk sorjába. A játék elmeséli a történetet bár közel sem anyira látványosan mint ahogy gondolnánk pár kép kocka 30 perc duma és kész.. a történet elmegy ""egész jó"" de semmi egyedit nem kecsegtett de + 2 pont jár neki ami igy már 4/10 . Most jön a kérdés..: akkor mi a helyzett? 4/10 és a többiről nem is beszéltél.. akkor most mivan? Ezt a játékok nagyon túl becsülik. kezdetben 1 karaktert készíthetünk amit különbözőképpen építhetünk. Testreszabás lehetőség kimerül a 10 féle színű ugyanolyan ruhából. +2 karkter fizetős dlc-ből jön. Ez nagy pofátlanság máshol alap a minimum 4 karakter itt meg 3 van és abból is 2 fizetős.. (hozáteszem maga a 2 dlc drágább egyenként mint a maga a játék),Nem baj mindegy lehet ettől még jó nem? hát nem, következő hibák 2013 ban megjellent játék-ban nehogy már netudjanak egy-egy szörny/ember/valami -ből legalább 3 fajtát csinálni.. szégyen jön 2millió ugyanolyan ember Klón megölni egy harcban. Pazar az a tény is hogy minimális animációk vannak 3 féle ütés + 6 féle varázslat.... ÉS a Magyar fejlesztésű játékba nem fért bele Magyar szinkrón de MÉG EGY NORMÁLIS MAGYAR FELIRAT SEM. Anyám elnézést de mi az hogy félig magyar félig nem ??? a szöveg közepén angol az előt meg utána meg Magyar?? Úristen, a játék elvileg online Játokot is tudd de ezt felejtsük el mert azon kivül hogy néha müködik néha bemongya a halált ,... ha még is sikerül elindulni akkor is ROHADTUL BUGOS, Igy 2 év távlatában is amikor megvettük 2 -en a haverommal a 3 . küldin nem tudtunk tovább menni mert a bug nem engedte ,,, az adott szőrny csoport amit lekellett volna kaszálni mindig újá éllet és az ami előidézte meg 3 millio HP-ja volt. (akkor még kb 20-akat csapsz) Singleplayerbe tovább lehet menni igaz.. de multiba nem és ez nem mentség .. és amikor kikerültük külön-külön singlibe ezt a buggot akkor meg egy másik jőt. Az online funkció ""Uslees"" . Singlibe is rengetek bug van az átvezetők elcsusznak mintha tört játékkal játszanék.A karakter fellet a a felirat elcsuszik a kamera fekete kockákat mutatt -- olykor nem látn isemmit. Azon kivűl egy - egy pozitivum ,hogy az Angol szinkron király és a párbeszédek sem rosszak.. de ez egyszerüen nem elég. Vannak secretek de azok inkább unalmasak mint érdekesek. Már javítani tuti nem fogják szóval ezt érdemes hagyni. A 2. résszel nem játszottam azt hallotam az nagyon jó lett . De ezt az élményt kihagytam volna. Még ugyis hogy mind össze 5 dolláromba azaz kemény 1000 per száz FT-ba fájt a game. hiába Magyar fejleszésű egyszerüen ez sajnálatos... Nem értem miért vagyok én az első aki ez leírja..			"

												I'm posting this review after I've just finished the game in Normal mode. Yeah, this is not a review for those Professional/Hardcore gamers who want difficulty at every step.TL;DR Good Hack and Slash Game. 7/10 . But buy this game during sales. I bought it at $5.09. In my opinion anywhere below $10 is worth it. Above it, not so much. Broader Explanation:I personally view these Hack and Slash kind of games as either of the two things:a) A tool for some excellant story telling.orb) Stress relief where I'm simply entertained after playing this game.The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is pretty good at both of these categories.Not a bad story line with decent continuity and fun enough game on the destroy-everything-in-sight front as well.A few points:Story line and Ambience is Good- 7/10Re-Playability is lower than that of Torchlight II. Meaning its average- 5 /10Item Complexity, enchanting, Visual effects of items- 6/10Skill Points, Ability Points and general Magic/Ability in-game- 6/10Graphics/Visual Ambience- 5/10 in some parts and 7/10 in some parts. Satisfaction- 7/10So I would put this game on a solid 7/10			"

												This is a pretty fun game to play if you're a fan of action hack n' slash RPGs like Diablo. I really didn't know what to expect when first playing, but I was pleasantly surprised. Coming from playing too much Diablo 3, I was glad that the game had more customization to your character. You are free to add points to your attributes and skill points in a skill tree.As far as the gameplay goes, it took a little bit for the game to take off for me. First, each class has a rage bar that goes up during combat. You use part of the rage bar to activate extra effects to your attacks, like stunning enemies for 2 seconds to your electric attack. You have a primary left and right-click attack, followed by 1-4 key press ""trick"" abilities, like healing. You don't level really fast, so to start getting new skills took a bit of dedication to the game. Stick with it, and you will enjoy your adventure with your ghostly companion. As far as difficulty goes, the game was nearly impossible for me on the highest difficulty. I suggest playing on the next level below that if you want a challenge that's do-able.I do like the that game has decent voice acting, since your characters will talk a lot during your adventure. When you fight monsters, you will generally be fighting a LOT at once, which really causes you to stay on your toes. It has the same feel as Diablo, fighting champion packs and elite monsters. And of course, the loot which ranges from basic non magically items to epic/set.			"

I feel it is much deeper in function and I prefer the story material in Van Helsing over D3.There are some performance issues with my laptop. but on my gaming desktop, it runs amazing and looks pretty good.

												I was sceptical as in to buy this game or not in the start but once it went on a sale i rushed to buy it...and it was definetely worth it!!PROS~ Great visuals and audios~ Many options in the abilities trees allowing you to follow what it feels better to you ~ Interesting story with very good dialogues between lady katarina and van helsing (lady katarina is awesome)~ Interesting bosses and a variety of enemies with special attacks and passives~ AMAZING loot and very ncie weapon and armor designsCONS~ The game was kinda short ~ The areas could get boring~ THe end boss fight wasnt as hard as  someone would expect it to be (i found it kinda easy) but you can increase diffficulty i guess :DANd thats all i can think about :DOverall the game was fun , exciting and really made you play more and more and more to slay those monsters and get that shiny loot :).Definitely worth buying.

												I really wanted to like this game.  It has a very setting being in the Van Helsing Universe. As well as great production value. But the core mechanics of the game are very lacking.  Every time I engage in combat the frame rate drops rather considerably despite what setting it is on. Also the combat lacks a tactile feel to it making it feel rather shallow instead of engaging. The menues are not as well developed or organize then they need to be.  And I find the map and quest design to be somewhat generic. I  don't find this game very enjoyable because of these faults. Maybe the sequal recify these problems that I have but this version dissapointed me. :(			"

												I have to say I really liked this game when I first played trough it a few months ago. Impressed by the good humor and references as well as fairly solid gameplay.HOWEVER the gameplay does get fairly repetitive starting at roughly a third of the game, when you begin to notice that all quests are essentially merely fetch quests or quests to reach a destination with predictably a lot of monsters in your way. However most of these monsters are not memorably in any way and there is barely any variation in how you need to defeat different enemies.In addition to this, DLC has been introduced in the aftermath of the release. While normally this isn´t a problem the DLC behaves VERY intrusive. There are three classes to pick from only ONE of which is aviable without DLC. This magnitude of initial content to additional to be bought content is usually only found in free online games - not games that you already bought! You will find that the blue blood related skills are present in the skill trees informing you that you need to buy more DLC to access them. Furthermore enemies regularily drop items that can only be used by the 2 DLC classes. The game contains a very big deal of loot, and finding the right setup is often a lenghtly task, now all the while you will be taunted with dozens of items that you are not allowed to use, if you refuse to buy extensions of the game.Within the Hunter skill tree (the one that only costs you the money of buying the game itself) there is not enough variation to really justify playing the game several times, while this might be different for the other two classes, this game did not convince me that it deserved another 4 Euros for a slightly varied second playtrough			"

												Great game. Im not just saying that ether if your into games like Torchlight, Torchlight 2, Diablo etc. Then this game is a great buy. Somthing that i really find amazing about this game is the amount of skills you can choose from im talking at least 100 diffrent abilities to pump points into and you can even stat out your pet depending on you class. Of course like all game this game does have bugs im only in the first area and the second i enter this cave my game totally ♥♥♥♥♥ the bed and when i exited to the menu the menu was acting them same way but taking that out of the picture the game really does bring alot to the field as far as RPGs go. Also the game even in the start is very difficult and im comparing it to games that i mentioned earlier. Another feature is mulitplayer i have yet to try it but ive seen previews and it looks as if you can go through the game (story) with multiple people. So if your who thinks this game looks fun and your on the edge of buying it let me just push you off that edge and ask you what are you waiting for?			"

A bargain at it's base price of $15 and an absolute steal at the holiday sale price. The graphics, game mechanics, and progression system are well polished.The one downside is the relatively weak voice acting of all npcs aside from your companion but the gameplay makes up for this and more. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this game. And I will definitely keep an eye open for future titles from this developer.			"

The monsters seem extremely varied and drops seem to come quickly and effectively with little of the issues about not getting anything for your class.Your ghost companion is actually a decent character both from what she does and her ability to fight beside you.

I recently encountered my first boss battle and I can tell you that it's no walk in the park (kiting is a must). If you love games like Diablo and Torchlight then you really have to pick this up.

A Fine AdventureOne of the most memorable moments in this adventure was the interaction between Van Helsing and his companion Lady Katarina. I really enjoyed teh dialogue between these two characters.The story was linear, but in the end it worked out okay.The gaming mechanics are really rough. Most of the monsters encountered were usually in clusters or packs. That was true thoughout the whole game. Packs can be very frustrating when they are difficult monsters with extra effects. I can imagine a ranged character having a lot of trouble.The boss variety was not really there. They felt like regular monsters, but with ten times the amount of health.The enviornments looked great, but the animation department needs more development. Using skills did not feel very satisfying and the skill tree layout was very basic. Since most of the monsters were in clusters, I found it hard trying to make different builds because I am only limited to AOE skills.Overall, this game is a great start. A lot of polishing is needed.			"

												Played the game on hard mode.The previous reviews pretty much summarized the good sides of this game:- Well designed world.- Some really nice background music (definitely getting game OST if there is one). - Attractive graphics.- Highly customizable settings (could play this game on my laptop).- Some interesting references to pop culture (really liked Baggins dude!).- Good voice acting.- Decent storyline.But all in all I would advise you to avoid this game. Here is why:- If you do not buy DLCs then there is only one character class you can 'choose' from. The character can do both melee and range attacks, however, due to horrible difficulty balance I had to specialize only on one attack type. The result is there is not a lot of variation in the action. - Except very rare short conversations, the sidekick ghost lady is useless. She dies really fast and eats up all the health potions. I have ended up keeping her in a ghost form all the time. The result is the game would not change much if she was removed completely.- The game gives you impression of customization, but it actuallly punishes you for doint it. After mid point of the game, customization becomes really expensive and you can end up spending all the gold and still not getting what you want.- The essense system (aka gems and gem slots) is useless. Items where you can put gems are rare. If one is found then usually it does not have enough essense capacity to put useful essense. You can use an essense to increase the capacity but during my 27 hours of gameplay I had collected only 3 capacity increasing essense. Finally, there is not a lot of variation in essense types. I had collected only 20 or so different essense types during the entire game!- The fighting becomes really repetitive quite fast. There are many enemies that look different, but really just a skin deep difference. All off them can be categorized into melee enemies that charge in mass, melee enemies with hooks and ranged enemies. There is no interesting behavior from AI. More challenging enemies have simply 1) more HP and higher defense points, 2) just attack in bigger numbers, or 3) have more HP and defense and attack in higher numbers. It is not possible to use interesting tactics. Most of my gameplay consisted of repeating two things: have a short skirmish and then running away to use potion before having another short skirmish. Bullet spongy enemies just killed all the fun for me in this game. Most annoying are the enemies with hooks. It is not possible to predict or avoid hooks using your skills. The hook animation is instantaneous. The problem is, at least on higher difficulty, if you get hooked then you are basically dead.- Horrible camera angles. It is not possible to control the camera. Did I tell you about enemies with hooks? Well many times I was hooked by enemies I could not even see. I am not even talking about number of times I was shot at by enemies outside of the screen.- Bad character controls. There is no keyboard-based movement control. Mouse is used to click on a place where you want to move your character. Sounds good enough right? Well not. Combined with horrible camera angles and enemies swarming everywhere you will end up in many situation where you cannot find a free space to click on and move your character. I ended up more than dozen times dead because my character refused to move. The complexity of the surrounding world makes the situation even worse because it is not immediately obvious where you can and cannot click.If you are looking for a good ARPG then go for Path of Exile. PoE is superior to this game in everyway. Plus, PoE is free, and there is no DLC nonsense.			"

												Though in the beginning especially in the first level it is a quite enjoyable and well done game, it gets soon boring and you get the impression that the developer wanted to finish this game quickly, so towards the end of the game, the gameplay lacks depth.Building your own hidout is a nice idea but poorly executed and not fun at all.It could have been a great game, but I think maybe the developer wanted too much features for the game, so none of the features feel completed.

												If you're a fan of the Diablo or Torchlight franchises it will be a safe bet that you'll enjoy this game, and franchise. The story playthrough will give you around 10-14hrs of gameplay depending on your skill level and how thorough you play through. Regardless, most people can't resist but to go through with a second character! The playablitity just makes it hard to put down.Any complaints? If I had any it would be that the level cap is 30. They do attempt to make up for it by adding alternate ways to play such as, scenario mode or endless mode. These alternatives add a glory lvling system comparable to Diablo 3's glory lvling system. My opinion though, they are simply just not as good as the story playthrough itself!What's the verdict? I recommend this game! Even if you're on the fence about it I suggest waiting for it to go on sale, so you can potentially get it for super cheap!			"

												Summary: Guide Van Helsing the famous monster-slayer through a tounge and cheek adventure killing baddies and looting corspses.Time until completion: 15 hours.Pros: - A pretty game.- Controls well. KB/M or gamepad.- Servicable enough story that doesnt take itself too seriously.  It even throws in some pop culture references i giggled at now and then.- Loot.- Fun skillsCons:- Camera. The camera is static and the geometry never becomes transparent in the slightest if your character goes behind it. - Crafting. While you can combine runes to make new runes or slot runes in weapons, it in no way tells you what you can or cant combine. It just leaves you constantly trying combinations until something works.  This made me basically just never use it.- Skill tree. While the skills themselves are fine, the max level is 30 and you have to have certain skills to unlock others. Because of this, there is simply no way you can diversify your skills if you want to be effective by the endgame. It seems like the max level should be almost double so you can actually use all the skills. You can reset them and re-allocate them, but you are still limited to so many points going into all skills.- Difficulty spikes.  Probably my biggest complaint.  There were so many times i would just be almost 1 hot killed going into a wave of enemies. It never seemed like there was an alternative way to approach these situations.  You simply die and re-start at the last checkpoint (or base) and keep hacking away at the same group of enemies until they die. This seemed silly. I thought I would be recommending this, but I find it hard to with the difficulty issues in particular. You would be better off playing Titan Quest or another APRG that is better balanced.Overall, I would give this a 60% or so.  The few issues I have really impacted the game too much.			"

Pretty well polished as well, though I would recommend setting it to hard difficulty as it is way too easy on normal...much like Torchlight I and II.			"

												Pretty solid ARPG, Steampunk feel to the interface and story line. It isn't anything groundbreaking.  ARPG's are pretty much click on this, use this ability, use a potion, backpeddle when you get swarmed, and move on.  There is a tower defence game mechanism for two ""zones/levels"" of the story to break it up.  Honestly I could have done without it but hey it wasn't that big of a deal.  In the end it's a good game to log in and have some mindless ARPG fun.			"

												At first, it feels like a Diablo-like. Then, you add in some Tower Defense stuff. Then, you add some new content.It is quite a discovery for me. The scenario is not the best in the videogame world, but neat for a diablo-like, the graphics are good enough, and you can switch playstyles quite easily.I've found myself creating 3 different characters to change the gameplay feeling, and they each feel very different.The classic hunter is your jack of all trades, with melee weapons and a gunslinger style.The mechanic class is your pet/tank class, with some steampunk goodies (flamethrower, mines, spiderbots, etc.)The thaumaturge is your wizard/range DPS, fireworks everywhere.I've played the hunter on the first run, then the mechanic (flamethrower!), and created a thaumaturge for completion's sake.An account-wide chest is available to store and exchange between your characters epics, legendary sets, leveling items and whatnots (except gold afaik).Features:- Account-wide chest- Tower Defense mini-game- Side quests- Online Coop- Online Scenario mode (more difficult)- Endless-until-you-drop mode- A nice storyline- Custom skill trees- Nice quotes shared between Van Helsing and his bodyguard, many times with references to the geek culture.

												Gostei:1. História: bom trabalho de roteiro;2. Grágicos muito bons;3. O personagem pode ser evoluído do modo que bem entender (skills e atributos);4. O NPC pode ser configurado para colher itens que caem no chão automaticamente;5. O sistema de comparação de itens sendo utilizados e no inventário é excelente, no melhor estilo que já vi;6. As batalhas são bem feitas;7. Há conversas entre o personagem e o NPC, depois de um tempo fica um pouco repetitivo, mas gosto mesmo assim.8. Há momentos no jogo que o jogador só podefazer uma escolha correta se explorou detalhes de placas ou papéis com texto em parede (perguntas feitas por wisps), podia até aparecer um pouco mais;9. Boa variedade de monstros em cada nível;10. Não há uma base disponível logo no início do jogo, se chega a ela depois.Não gostei:1. Não tem cliente nativo para o Linux;2. Mapas são sempre iguais e não gerados ao criar o jogo, e pior: ocupam a maioria do espaço em disco utilizado pelo jogo, vários gigabytes;3. Demora bastante para carregar os mapas;4. Há somente uma base principal, eu acharia mais interessante se houvesse mais bases intermediárias;5. Máximo de somente 4 jogadores em modo multiplayer;6. Não se pode controlar ao mesmo tempo do teclado/mouse e do joystick, aliás, se o joystick estiver ligado, não há opção de usar o teclado;7. Ficou um pouco curto. Não cada fase, os mapas tem um tamanho bom, mas ficaria melhor com mais mapas.Não gostava mas modificaram:1. Agora os monstros de fases já completas voltam ao começar um novo jogo, antes não voltam;2. O suporte a controle era muito falho, agora está ótimo exceto por não poder mudar para teclado/mouse se este estiver ligado no momento que o jogo é iniciado. Ainda assim acho mais fácil teclado e mouse devido a maior facilidade e disponibilidade de configuração e comandos imediatos.Conclusão:O jogo é legal e vale seu preço, cerca de dez dólares.			"

Aided by your companion, a ghost named Lady Katarina, the two of you work together to try and find out what causes such strife in the land of Borgovia, and how you can solve the issues of the folks there plagued by dark horrors.Do not buy this game for the combat, graphics or anything like it.

												Let me start off with by telling you what type of game The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is; its an ARPG. This is similar to  games such as Diablo and Torchlight. So essentially, top down camera, lots of monsters, and most importantly lots and lots of loot. So why should you get this game. Van Helsing takes elements from many different sources in the fantasy and science fiction genres. The includes everything from Lord of the Rings to Monty Python for fantasy and Star Wars to Hitchicker's Guide to the Galaxy for science fiction. This is a game that knows its target audience very well and caters to them, but not so much as to take away from the actual game. Still you will notice nods to different things and they fit within the theme of the game very well. The gameplay is very solid, but it may take some getting used to if you don't play this game very often. It still uses WASD just not for movement, you use only the mouse for movement and attacks. However it is pretty intuitive and takes no time to get used to. The mobs you fight are a bit of challenge and you will die quite often in the early stages but its enjoyable to get better as the game progresses. To summarize this game was made with the thought of the player in mind and it really shows in the final product. There are some bugs here and there but the developers, Neocore Games, is very responsive to player issues and timely with patches. If you are on the fence about getting this I would reccomend this game to anyone who is up for a good adventure.			"

												I had never heard of this game prior to it being bundled in part of the last Humble Bundle.  From what I have played so far, I can make the following observations:1. It has similar controls to Diablo 3 (some skills have power ups that you buy using skill points you receive when you level up, some of these power ups need to be manually activated rather than an add on)2. They borrowed heavily from Diablo 3 in that gold, potions, quest items, and essences (gems/item enhancments used in socketed items) are automatically picked up3. Huge emphasis placed on gear4. Leveling up is closer to Diablo 2 than Diablo 3. Every level you gain 5 attribute points to distribute among body (combination of str and vit), Willpower (intellect), Luck (magic find, gold find), and finally dexterity (important for ranged attacks), plus you gain 3 skills points to use in a skill tree. This can be used to level up your current skills, unlock new skills, or purchase the add on abilities mentioned previously5. There is a reputation leveling system (seperate from your character's leveling up) that is similar to the system from Torchlight.  When your reputation gains a level you can unlock a new perk (an example is one of them gives you a +50 to poison resistance and increases the effectiveness of potions by 10%)The game's setting is easily described as steampunk, you play the titular character Van Helsing (well his son, who carries the Van Helsing name) in an eastern European country.  All of the enemies have names that are Slavic in origin, and overall the game has a very late 19th century to early 20th century vibe.  In fact playing through the game reminds me of the Leviathan book series and almost like a Diablo version of Arcanum (ie less emphasis on RPG and more emphasis on hack and slash) in an odd way.  I have been playing as the mage class, and my only gripe is that you are incredibly underpowered at the start of the game. As the game progresses you will obviously gain abilities to clear enemies faster, but for the early and mid game you may feel over whelmed in no small part due to the lack of an effective AOE. "

												This game has pretty stunning visuals, and before starting I had a lot of high hopes for it, and expected gameplay to complementary the beautiful graphics very well. And sadly, it doesn't exactly. Combats don't feel very exciting, and so far it's pretty much the typical RPG grindfest for gold (well what was I expecting?). The existence of decent equipment from shops  and the exorbitant prices isn't a very nice design touch, as it creates shallow treadmill goals that encourage mindless grinding.An upside though is that with that price this game is quite a steal. Not as good as I expected, but I don't regret the purchase. I will most definitely explore the game some more. If you're a newcomer of the genre and looking for a great WRPG/ARPG experience to get your feet wet then I think this game isn't really for you. But if you've hard into the genre then this game is quite a decent one and worth trying for the price it's asking for.			"

												I'd highly recommend this game if you're looking for some quick ARPG Hack-and-Slash action. Albeit a bit clunky at first, if you can look past beyond that, then this game is definitely one to go for if you're a die-hard ARPG fan such as me. The settings and scenario that the game offers is quite unique, and each area has its own personality to it. The monsters themselves are quite challenging even when on normal, and I'm finding that ARPGs with challenging aspects such as this is something that some ARGPs are lacking. The character level-up design is quite straightforward and isn't too challenging to understand, especially for people who recently are into the whole ARPG scene. Again, this game is one of the better ARPGs I've played. I recommend playing this first before going into the sequel.			"

												At first it seemed that the game is quite interesting. After playing a few hours we understood that to play becomes not so interesting, as the game was boring, the same type of rpg, where quite small select skills and absolutely no character classes, except for those that just need to buy. Finally , I would say two and a half points out of a possible five...			"

It's essentially a steampunk action rpg (diablo style) with a nice sense of humor. Graphics and sound are great and the enemies are difficult w/o being too annoying. One of the final missions is a bit glitchy, but beyond that, a great game.			"

												Wonderful game! About 25 hours and 30 levels, but for $15 it offers more options and choices than some other H&S wanna-bes at much higher prices (cough*D3*cough). The art design is gothic, the sound effects creepy at times, the music is wonderful and the dialog is fun. The banter with your sidekick is interesting. And you can level her up as well. Better attacks and such.All-in-all, if you are a fan of the genre, you can't go wrong with this game!			"

Still, a very fun game to play on your own, thanks to the gothic environments and the engaging banter between the hero and his ghostly sidekick.			"

												The Incredibly Long Title of Van Helsing is a fun 10-12 hour (main campaign) hack and slashy romp. What's there is good, though the melee could use a bit more... oomfph.The skil tree is a bit shallow and some of the abilities don't scale too well at higher difficulties. While the power up system is a unique gimmick, it boils down either feeling too clunky to use on the fly or becoming an automated left or right click with the auto option turned on.The humor is very tongue-and-cheek and often breaks the fourth wall. Voice acting is pretty good overall with hilariously stereotypical vampire and mad scientist voices. Environments are well used. Even though you spend half your time in a forest, each one feels unique.The inventory management and itemization in this game is one of the best in this genre. A simple thing like automatically reorganizing if you pick up something and logically have the space to do so if not for one stupidly placed sword is a godsend.Overall if Van Helsing had a deeper and more complex skill tree along with a Newgame+ instead of just a pure endgame, this would be a worthy competitor to the big ARPGs. As it is now, it's still a decent romp for its price.			"

												I was a little iffy about buying this but then it was on sale so i thought why not. I,ve always really love ARPGs and this one is one of my favorites. There is a bug in one of the levels where a boss fight is supposed to commence but it doesn't, The combat could be better but still cool. It can get really difficult at times you get huge numbers of enemies thrown at you but its nothing a few health potions can do. Your companion can be really helpfull but when shes fighting shes kinda useless but you can get upgrades that make her very helpfull. A.I. is good I really didn't find any issues with it, The skill tree is ok i wish there were more, But the perks are cool you unlock them for doing certian things my favorite gives you an extra inventory space. The graphics are crisp and nice if you max them out, No real frame drops for me and it's so intence. I strongly advice you pick this up if you like ARPGs.Verdict - 8/10			"

												Yes, I'd reccomend this. Really awesome one liners, fast gameplay, cool skill combinations and amazing references. And I must say that, Van Helsing's companion, Lady Katarina, is really the girl I'd like to hang out with. Dialogues are masterpiece BUT and this is a big but, near end of the game and after ending is dull. I finished the game before a high level and I used Katarina's explosion skill to deal damage rather than my pistols' low damage (yep, I was a hunter). It's like overkill, she dies quickly if I don't help her, when she dies she explodes with a gigantic area damage (It took 4 times to kill the last boss). And after the ending, no new dialogues, no 'thanks van helsing, you saved the day"" not even a simple thank from any resistance member.Apart from my little critic, I must warn you about something, this game is much, much better than the movie. Also DO NOT EAT THE FISH! If you caught a fish, don't eat it! Just search on the google and enjoy the joke :D			"

												Van Helsing is 90% (if not more) hack & slash RPG and 10% tower defence (you will have to help towers tho).Scenery is nice, graphics are good-looking without overdemands for PC.There is a variety of places to fight, anf they grim without beeing totally dark.Quality of zones differs however. While first town is life-like further swamps (and some other areas too) feel like grossery shop with meat waiting for grinder.Leveling is fun, but working builds are few.Bottom line - decent bargain if you catch it on sale, otherwise one in line of many others.

The company puts out, they've already released Van Helsing 2 and are working on the 3rd installment.

												!!!!!Posted without DLC!!!!!Extremely addicting Action RPG. You play as Abraham Van Hellsing, son of the famous Vampire Slayer. The non-DLC game is extremely interesting as you have 2 different sets of talent trees, that not only supply you with abilities that you can unleash upon the myriad different enemy types, you also have a set of auras that increase your combat capabilities, as well as tricks(spells) that have a variety of different effects. At it's core, this is a simple Action RPG, you kill monsters, you complete quests, and you get gold/gear so that you can ruin the day of the next monster that crosses your path. The overall atmosphere in the game is quite refreshing, Van Hellsing isn's some armored knight for justice, he's a monster hunter, pessimistic, sarcastic, and interesting to play. Your companion/pet in the game is a ghost called Lady Katerina, with her own unique talents/spell combinations, she is a very good compliment to VH's grounded sense of gun/swordplay.Reccomend this to any fan of Diablo or Torchlight, as they play almost exactly the same. The trees are more expansive then Diablo 3, at least imo, but  not quite the same llevel of customization as the trees in Torchlight. VERDICT: Good Game. I enjoy it tremendously.			"

												Pros:If you were a fan of Diablo 2, but were disappointed by Diablo 3 because of its lack of stat distribution, its straightforward skill system and its auction house, and were a bit put off by the cartoony art style of Torchlight (it doesn't really fit this genre in my opinion), then you will enjoy Van Helsing, because the mechanics are pretty close to Diablo 2.Cons:Once you complete the game, you realize there is no variety in it, and no replay value. There are only 2 types of melee weapons and 2 types of ranged weapons (fast & slow), and the skills are pretty boring and not really apparent, you basically use mana and rage to make your attacks more powerful, and that's about it. At the beginning of the game, it looks like there are many skills to choose from, but then you realize there are only 4 legit builds: tank melee, spellcaster melee, DPS ranged and spellcaster ranged.So... it's still a great game if you like action RPGs, but don't expect anything near Diablo 2 or you might be disappointed. I'd give it an 8/10.			"

												A surprisingly good ARPG, with high production value for an indie. The writing is sometimes funny and quirky, but too often falls into tired tropes and old memes. The game looks great, with solid sound design backing it up. The powers are varied enough to try a multitude of builds, and cheap respecs and ample equipment encourage trying a few out. Most of the powers feel great too, lightning bolts have a thunderous retort, and sword slashes feel quick and deadly. Sadly only the basic (But highly adaptable) hunter class is included, the other two classes are DLC. They have fewer skills but are more focused on particular play styles. If you decide to play the game, I strongly suggest you play on the hardest, 'heroic', difficulty; the game isn't very difficult and you will get much better loot.			"
