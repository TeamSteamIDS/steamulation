												Ok, I bought this game for 14 cents and I'm gonna write a serious review and not ""bought the game, sold the cards, earned a cent, profit"".Pros:+Many options, you may change resolution and keys and sounds etc.+Difficulties - you can play it on 3 difficulties.+Reminds a PS1 game (for those who had one)+Keys are comfortable to play+Detailed tutorial+Controller support+Has cards+Combat is pretty good+Community made levels (?)+Many save slots+Cheap (even in full price)Cons:-No story at all-Needs achivements-I said in the 'Pros' that the combat is good, but, you can't stand still, or you die-Enemies do too much damage-Graphics aren't too good and the character's face is scary-No background music-Enemies are pretty the same-Enemies that get hit just turn red again and again until they explode, it's cool for the first minute but then gets boringNeutral:~Dash after level 1 is imbalancedBottom line:Recommended with a score of 6/10			"

												Despite the dated graphics, this game can be great fun in short bursts.  Playing around with the terrain, running at super-speed up vertical cliffs while machine-gunning energy bolts at mite-like things chasing you, dodging projectiles and then capping it off with a super-high jump that lands you hard enough to deform the ground?  That's a sort of rush that doesn't really appear in a lot of titles, let alone one with system requirements as relaxed as this.  The weapons are pretty unbalanced and you'll only be using one or two once you get them, but that's not really a problem given that competitive balance is a non-issue here.I only wish they'd given you more opportunities and incentive to use the terrain deformation powers to your advantage, in ways that would make you feel that same exhiliration.  It does lack variety and interesting strategy, which is sad.  Community support and quality custom levels and stuff would make this so much more worthwhile, given the core gameplay conceit, but even as it is, it's got a charm to it.  When it's bad, it's dull.  When it's good, it's that kind of game that's fun for the first few days, then you forget about it for a while, and then you pick it up again and relive the magic that hooked you the first time.  It's worth a buy, especially if it goes on sale.			"

												To be entirely clear, Caster is pretty terrible. It’s also a ton of fun, in large part because it’s only just barely holding it together and doesn’t really give a damn if anything makes sense as long as it’s entertaining.Everything about Caster is more than a little insane and nonsensical. It’s always trying new stuff just because it can, and though this means the whole game feels like a crash course in engine experimentation, somehow it works. It really has no business being as fun as it is, but something about running around as an immensely overpowered MegaMan-reject is so stupid I was barely able to keep it together while playing the game.I have no doubt Caster would be a huge chore if it insisted on imposing any restrictions on you or ever became an actual challenge (though a few moments in the second half begin to weigh the game down), but for the most part it lets you do whatever you want. It doesn’t matter if it unbalances the game or even breaks it in places, you’ve been put into this sandbox to blow stuff up and run really fast and that’s about all I needed.Caster might be barely competent but I can’t help but admire how little it cares or tries to pretend it’s anything but a bit of super dumb fun. I can’t stress enough how stupid everything here is and how delightful I found it. So, sure, I could tear it apart as an ugly piece of garbage, but apparently I was in the mood for something so-bad-it’s-good and Caster more than fit the bill.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Caster is an average third person shooter that does not contain any notable qualities, aside from the ability to destroy terrain and perform ridiculous map-crossing leaps.Your objective in each level is to either kill every enemy or do a generic fetch quest (there are a few other missions with different objectives but they're uninteresting, for example; shoot a tree). Every level is incredibly short, and even on my first time, each one averaged no longer than a minute. Speaking of game length, the entire thing isn't longer than an hour. The game abruptly ends with a ""To Be Continued..."", and despite being released in 2009, there has been no continuation, and it seems the website does not hint at anything of the sort either.Enemies are all very generic, and each one of their attacks can be easily avoided by just sprinting around or jumping. Even if they do manage to hit you, they deal hardly any damage, and they are easily dispatched; even more so with the weapon upgrades. The story is uninspired, and unless you've never heard or seen the ""It's humans against aliens, you're our only hope!"" plot, then I doubt you'll be interested. As I stated earlier, the game ends at a very unexpected random point with sequel bait. A map editor is available, but I did not use it or download custom maps, so I cannot comment on that.I did not find Caster to be particularly interesting in any way. Terrain destruction and super speed can be fun and worth it if you paid 0.14 cents, but beyond that, there's not much else that the game offers.			"

												I bought it for $0.14. If I'd know it would have been this good I would have happily paid $5. This game is a fantastic indie gem. It really gives me hope that not ALL the indie games on Steam are awful trash.PROS:+ Terrain deformation is fun and quick but doesn't feel gimmicky or normally required. It frees you up to play with things as you like.+ Running and jumping is smooth and handles well.+ The few enemies the game has are varied and interesting and also deform the terrain.+ Finding the hidden collectables isn't compulsory (it would be very annoying if it was) but makes for a fun extra goal to lengthen the game a little.+ The game doesn't stretch itself longer than it should be. There's not enough content here for 10 hours of gameplay so they didn't make that much.CONS:- The game is short, very short. There's probably more that could be done by adding a few more enemies and a few more levels.- Little problems with all the weapons. Not game ruining, just minor gripes:  > The blaster's crosshairs don't line up perfectly with its ostensibly straight shots. This only becomes apparent at extreme range.  > The eruptor is very hard to aim as it doesn't have a light effect or cast a shadow and just appears as a distortion on the screen. It's very hard to tell where one is in 3D space (how close/far). This also makes enemies that shoot it odd to fight.  > The homing shot has a very hard time hitting enemies. It flies around in circles and ends up slamming into terrain about 75% of the time.  > The shield attack is a neat idea but doesn't have an applicable purpose.- Very few enemies in the game, both in type and actual number. The game would benefit from a little more crowded levels. Some very large levels only have like 6 enemies in them.Final Verdict: Buy this game.If you see it on sale BUY THIS GAME.			"

												Caster is a third person platformer shooter with slight RPG elements. Basically, this is a mission based game. You select levels and get missions upon entering them. Missions are generally things like, collect all the orbs or kill all the enemies. Although there are more complicated missions, especially later. As you go through the first set of levels, you'll learn the basics, get new weapons, and collect in=game currency. You use the in-game currency to buy upgrades between levels, such as boosting your natural abilities and powering up the weapons you have collected. You can walk around, jump, and shoot for basic controls. However, you can also hit jump again and hold the button to do a super jump, which can help for dodging enemies and clearing distances and obstacles. The other special ability is a dash, which allows you to run quickly. This can help run up slopes and across water. Combining these two special abilities can make for some great techniques. There's also an interesting mechanic of being able to destroy and build up the land with your weapons. This can make tough situations easier depending on what you choose to upgrade and when. There are three sets of levels. The first set are there to help you learn the basics. The second set will make you use your abilities in more interesting ways. The third set will challenge your skills. It's a simple design that has lots of potential. The art is very colorful and pretty, even if I had to run it in minimum settings for my old worn out computer. It still looks really nice, and the music is alright too. It also has a low level of story investment. What I mean by that is... there's only vague story connections from mission to mission, and they don't have much to do with an overall plot. Also, not everyone will be thrilled with the graphical style, as it is dated in terms of modern games. Plus, the level selection method may turn away mordern minded gamers, as well as the simplistic gameplay. The third set of levels are made by the community and aside from the fact that they are very difficult, they're just a bit of a hassle to get. They aren't included with the game download, nor are they available through Steam workshop. To get the third set of levels, you need to go to their site, download the levels, and place them into the correct folder. It's not complicated, but it's a hassle that I'm guessing most won't bother to do, even though it's worth it for more levels. And you'll want more levels because the second set of levels, designed by the developer, is unfinished. There's one mission that, when selected, simply says to be continued. This game, according to the Steam store page, came out in 2009... and it's still not finished. This leads me to believe it's not going to be finished, or if it IS then it's going to have to wait until the developer isn't busy with other projects, which is a shame because this game has lots of potential and I'd sure like to see it through to the actual end to see know what it has been building up to.Still, Caster is tons of fun if you're into platforming third person shooters. It's kind of like a 3D Mega Man if they had done the Mega Man Legends games differently I guess. It has simple rules that create so much potential for cool and interesting levels and missions. While it's not complete yet, it's still worth the 3 dollar asking price. I got it on sale thinking I'd hate it, but it's actually a lot of fun. You could wait for a sale, but it's worth the money anyway. Just make sure you get those extra levels for some more fun. Caster gets a 7/10 for being a very fun third person platformer shooter similar to those a few generations ago.			"

												It's a quirky and fun, fast paced game where you have to destroy creatures called ""The Flanx"" because they are evil.To defeat these Flanxers, you can sprint really fast, jump super high and can use 6 weapons, all with their own abilities.One weapon, destroys the landscape and one weapon adds land. This makes terraforming a great part of the game.However, it would be wrong in this case, half of the weapons are pure ♥♥♥♥ in terms of usability. Even in the levels where you get a new weapon, you can easily use another. I've, for example, never used the Stun weapon and just blasted and destroyed so much land, that I bet I would get Greenpeace or such at my back.The campaign is also really short unless you really want a perfect score but what would that even be?You could be finished with the first campaign in about 30 minutes to an hour. There are 2 campaigns and possible even user-made content.Additionally, half the levels are pretty repetitive.Does this all makes the game bad? No. It's a nice game if you want some quick action and when it's on sale, it's certainly nice to possibly buy. Just don't expect something big however.			"

												QUALITY ""I AM A GOD!""POSITIVES:-Soundtrack, Length, Variety The gameplay is in hyper drive, but it doesn't feel nauseating or unmanageable.The initial controls are awkward, but the reset is easy. NEGATIVE:-the visuals. It hurts to be taunted with all the high quality concept art in comparison to the highly polished but outdated 3d graphics. This is one of the best examples of a game that was held back by the creator's & the hardware's limitations.But the game is still great regardless. Every little details adds to the epic all powerful thrill.Suggestions: -Update graphics, more character options, and release the soundtrack. oh and btw, this is what a Sonic game should feel like!

You can attack enemies in six unique and cool ways with two playable characters. Best part of this game is terrain deformation which allows you to change the structure of environment.

												I paid 14 cents for this game so my expectations were extremely low, I figured if I got 10 minutes of gameplay I got my money's worth.What I ended up getting was a delightful Sonic the Hedgehog/Megaman hybrid, in a 3D 3rd person setting that harkens back to the N64 PSX days when 2D platformers were first experimenting with the 3D style, except Caster's mechanics work fine.  You go from level to level, which for most of it is a choice as to which level you take on.  Each level has different objectives, there are about 3-4 different styles each with the occasional story sequence thrown in.  There are plenty of weapons to choose from, my favorite is the seeker, you probably should upgrade that first among the other weapons.  Performance wise I haven't ran into any issues, this game despite being made in 2010 knows I have a 144hz monitor and caps at 144 fps.  Major credit for that.  You would think this game would be great for a controller, but on default settings the camera control on the right stick is all messed up, best to just stick with the keyboard and mouse for this one.In conclusion, for 14 cents it's a no brainer, buy this game.  It's regular price is $3.00 I really don't think that is asking for too much for this game either.  Plus this game supports modding so it's worth it just for that.  I should also mention that the soundtrack is pretty awesome too and is worth the money alone.For the low price, and for what it is, with the inclusion of mod support, I give this game a 4 out of 5.

												If you want to become god and kill everything and jump across maps with the speed of sound. This game has it covered.But let's review the description of the game.- ""Massive terrain deformation!"" - Making the terrain go up or down is not massive.- ""Use strategy to destroy hordes of bugs with a variety of unique behaviors and attacks"" - Not really. Just get and upgrade missiles and stun and everything becomes a joke.- ""Bring trees back to life and collect energy to purchase upgrades"" - Bring trees back to life? How's that a feature.  - ""Upgrade your skills to run on water and jump hundreds of feet into the air"" - Pretty much the fun part of the game, which is the movement since some maps are pretty big. Running on walls could have better controls.- ""Pulse pounding music by Trance Emerson"" - Music is pretty nice but nothing to brag about. How you like your music is your own taste and opinion.- ""3 levels of play (Casual, Normal, and Extreme)"" - Even on extreme its easy if you upgraded your sprint. If nothing can touch you whats going to kill you? If you guessed lava, acid and sorts. You're right. Enemies suck.- ""2 playable characters"" - It's pretty much the same character but with a different gender. They both have the same abilities and whatnot so there's nothing different from one another. It's pretty much if Mass Effect said theres 2 characters but one is male Shepard and female Shepard.- ""6 unique attacks"" - I wouldn't say unique. 3 attacks are lasers which 1 goes foward, the other you can cast multiple and the last its a homing laser. 2 change the terrain and the last one stuns enemies.It's not amazing and the graphics are meh. Don't get me started with the player models and the enemies. Jesus how did that go so wrong. (The fact that the concept art was pretty cool and interesting).Crosshair is a lying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The camera controls, I really don't know what to say about it. It's just wrong.Apart from messed up lazy models, the messy controls and camera. On and all, I had fun. I think it's a game where you can easily spend 2 hours on it without feeling bored or stressed out. Get it on sale thou. "

												keep in mind I paid 20 cents for this. Very simple, rough around the edges, and fun. The weapons: are pretty cool overall. And when you select them you change color like megaman... added bonus. Most weapons are useful, i thought the seeker and the yellow guns could use some fine tuning. but the fact that there are 2 weapons that raise and lower the terrain is very cool. The levels: small, very rough around the edges, looks like one of my first farcry maps. But at the same time the basic design of each level is pretty in its own way. It is easy to get where you want to, whether it be running up a giant vertical wall or jumping 500 feet over it.Game Mechanics / physics: Superfast, it is a reflex based game when it comes down to it. Again REALLY cool to jump super high like matrix / Hulk and land with a shockwave. Once you get the dash and jump leveled up it becomes a bit more fun. Most of the weapons fire satisfactorily. Music and SFX: Good Electronic soundtrack to go along with the fast-paced gameplay, pretty much house music. Sound effects are also good. People have compared it to Sonic and Megaman. I agree, I would also give it a comparison to flower because of the healing trees with your gun fire thing going on not to mention the short levels. Game is not finished... you feel like you are 75% done and it just ends abruptly. Hope they finish it! Maybe add some moves to it, you end up flying through the air a lot at the end of the game with no way to land if you jump to far besides holding the opposite direction which slows you in mid air. Maybe a mario ground pound or dive bomb to give you a swift landing. Could use some more interaction with the environment, vines to swing on, wall jumps, something else to do besides shoot and jump all the time.  "

												So, I played this game for roughly 5-6 missions or so and I got a decent bit of feeling for the game. This is what I have to say:~====~Graphics~====~This game is good for what you are into when it comes to gaming though the graphics aren't the best which is fine, but sometimes if someone would want to have the best graphics on because they are used to it or they just want full graphics then this won't be the best for you. The characters are a bit blocky which is also fine, but in ""This day in age"" we aren't used to seeing super blocky characters unless the whole game is made like that. For example, Minecraft is made to be a blocky game so that you can enjoy the building aspect in it to it's fullest extent, though when you play this game you would assume it to be a bit more adjusted to the kind of graphics we see today. The animations are pretty good and the game has a lot of potential in this category but for now I give it this:~Not the Best but hopefully be improved upon~~====~Combat~====~There isn't much to talk about in regards to combat in this game but, the combat in this game could be a bit better and also a bit less repetitive in it's own way. Basically, you spawn into the mission, you're given an objective to do then you do the objective and the mission is done. The objectives aren't all too complicated but they do get repetitive after a while of playing, I know I have only played for 35 minutes or so but that's because I don't feel like going through the same stuff constantly. So I would give the combat this:~It gets Repetitive after a while~~====~Story~====~I am not gonna lie but I didn't pay attention to the story all that much, I started the game and I was given a black screen with text explaining the story. After about a minute or so I realized I had to click the mouse to continue the text scrolling so I kept reading a few more messages. After I read a bit more, I figured that this would just show me millions of text boxes to read so I just skipped through them so I could actually play the game. So, I would give the story this:~Possibly Good if you take the time to read~~====~Final Verdict~====~This game isn't really worth to buy unless you get it on a great sale like I did or you really like these kinds of games. I would check out videos by players about it to get a better feel for the game before you buy it.			"

												The premise is clear: the Flanx have invaded Middon, which is short of experienced mages, and you, a noob Caster, gets the job of owning the bad guys.Right away, you’re put in this action shooter game that has a remind of a 3D Megaman. You’ll be dashing, double jumping and collecting  several diferent weapons that will by fired by your arm and many of which can be charged before firing. Among the arsenal you will find from energy blasts and bombs to seeker missiles and a stunner, including some kind of gravitational gun that will deform the terrain increasing its height. If it was not enough, you can actually deform and destroy all the terrain by all your attacks, which also spices the combat mechanics.You will face from cockroaches and flying beetles to giant worms. Each enemy is very different in all aspects starting by the models, and including their weapon and combat approach. You should even be prepared for enemies lurking out from the ground and find yourself running while saying ugly words. What is a bit strange is that, having put the time in differentiating the enemies so much, most, if not all, of them just use the same weapons available to you just colored differently.The game packs 15 short levels and the progress is quite fast. You will start with just an energy gun and the ability to do some small double jumps and dashes and a small health bar. However, in each level you will collect energy by killing Flanx and healing trees, which then you will be able to spend upgrading yourself. There are also some weapons that you will have to find -not that it is hard- to unlock them, and your character will even change color when changing weapon -what does that remind you of, again?-.Caster can be completed in a couple hours, maybe a little longer, although you won’t be able to upgrade everything -and I mean everything, your jumps height, dash duration, health level, weapons power…-, which may take an extra hour replaying some levels. However, if you really want to play more, you can find mods in the game’s website that will give you some extra content. And you will probably want to play some more, since it’s one of those games where you’re just telling yourself after each level ‘Only one more level and then I walk the dog’ and more soon than later there is no one more level.About the soundtrack, I should mention it’s not constant. It packs some tracks that you won’t notice to be there and some others that will really pick your attention because they’re actually good.Overall, Caster is one of these very beautiful indie games that also packs good controls and gameplay and will leave you a taste of wanting more.

												This game is like megaman but in free 3D world.3rd person shooter game when you just run, shoot and dodge while completing the mission.What aspects of the game that makes this game fun?Run and dodge the missile like attack from the enemies lol.Pro :+ Low spec game and low capacity+ Free movement and easy control+ Just shoot them all + Run+ Dodge+ Good for killing timeCons :- Low graphic quality (What did you expect with low spec game dude?)- Makes you bored in long run- Some minor bug with mouse movement when you hold your left-click mouse- There is no solid storyline, just doing some missionsDon't buy with full price, because i think it's not worth with full price, if it gets discount, you can consider to buy it.Be sure to play moderate or extreme difficulty, because the easiest one is way to boring.And I recommended to play it in extreme difficulty and see how could you dodge those incoming missiles lol.8/10 would run and dodge those missiles.

												the gameplay is surprisingly really fun. multitude of different enemies and attacks. you also have a dash that you can upgrade so you can run up walls and over the surface of water (or lava that wont damage you when you are sprinting over the surface. very useful, though if you stop sprinting, then of course you fall in and take a lot of damage.there are additional maps after you beat the first. the first map dosent take very long. luckily there is more, just go back to main menu then load to see the new area available. the game is rather easy, if you play it on hard mode it gets a good bit more challenging, especially on the second map, really fast paced moving and shooting to keep from getting killed. I recomend playing it on hard.			"

												As I see the only real reason for so many positive reviews is some kind of PS1 (and others from that era) nostalgia. But I still cant understand it. Good PS1 games made 15-20 years ago had much better composed graph and animations, more interesting gameplay, worlds, overall design. In the late '90s this game would be mediocre at best. Two decades later its simply bad.Good games remain good games even after decades. This one is far from catching up with them.			"

What's bad:Still unfinished, 6 years after release. Poor visual quality with short fog distance, basically looks like something you'd find on a demo disc for your PS1.  Very basic gameplay, pick up orbs and destroy enemies. The worst gamepad control layout I've ever seen.  (Left and right on your right thumb stick to look up and down, oh and it also fires your weapon, SERIOUSLY?).  Pretty short game, 22 missions, many of them only take a couple minutes to finish.What's good:And yet, its strangely entertaining to play.  There's a good sense of speed when you sprint and super jump around the maps, and the terrain manipulation, while often not needed, is a cool gimmick.  It also controls great with mouse and keys for a third person game.Worth getting?Even if its a bit short you can still get some hours of reasonably entertaining action here.  So yes, there's far worse things you can do with your €3 than getting this game.  I've also seen the game discounted so deep, that putting the trading cards from it on the market basically pays for the game as well.			"

												I really enjoyed my time with Caster.  This is a 3d combat platformer.  Most importantly the game is just fun.This is a good example of a game that excels without having top end artwork.  The art is decent, and they really like using particle effects.  But, the textures and models are dirt simple.But the GAME.  The game is great.  Controls are tight.  That is super important in an action game.  Your super jumps and dashes FEEL really powerful.  The animations are smooth.  And there are a decent number of options to customize your experience.Play follows through a number of stages.  After each stage, the amount of energy balls you pick up allows you to purchase upgrades for your character, thereby allowing you to specialize your strengths to fit your playstyle.  I also really liked the music, YMMV.  Don't overlook this one.9/10			"

I highly doubt it will be continued considering the game is almost 6 years old but i digress.It also has mod support and you can get extra, community made levels from the games website. The soundtrack is good and compliments the fast-pace of the game very nicely.Also, as i'm writing this, it costs 20 cents, so why the hell not?Pick it up, its pretty fun.			"

												THE GAME IS FUN. But I wouldn't recommend it to an average gamer with an average tolerance on games. Here's why.> World is too dull and the designers were obviously lazy.> It has dialogue but no story/plot.> Levels are too easy. > You can easily max out upgrades without even really trying on the game.> Environment gets too ♥♥♥♥ed up when you use the other guns.> I don't mind boxy models but this is too boxy even for an indie game. There are plenty of people who would do you a model of one character with a bit better quality for free.> Mods... I'm expecting custom characters and all but all I get is more lazily designed maps.> Terrible interface and main menu.

												Extremely repetative and simple score attack shooter. No story or anything to take you along.If oyu like running and bullet hell in 3D this is your game. But I wouldn't recommend if you are looking anything more than hour's worth of gameplay.There isn't much here, specially at the start to keep you interesting and the good, but few in selection, of songs only keep you interested for a while.The weaponry is interesting and allows manipulation of the polygon based environment, but other than that will not offer anything else.Enemies come in 3 variety, Fast, Stationary and Bullet hell. The simple graphics allow you to view some cool effects of the weapon but other than that, doesn't offer anything to look at, bland textures, boring level design. Having low production value doens't mean it is bad, it is just way blander than it should be.There was extreme amount of potential at show.			"

												While Caster can be fun some of the time, there's really no other value there. If all you want to do is spam overpowered weapons while sprinting around at mach speed, this is probably the game for you. But if you like your games with actual value in them, actual story, playability, difficulty, challenge or what have you, then look elsewhere, because Caster lacks all of those and then some. The graphics are very outdated and the textures/models can be glitchy as they clip a good amount, but even if they don't they're still not pleasant to look at. The character isn't even aesthetically pleasing and that's the one thing you have to stare at the entire game. Not to mention his/her face is just down-right creepy at some angles. The balancing is dreadful, as you get a game-breaking weapon at about level two, and the difficulty spikes up and down more than a heart monitor. Also, once you max out your health and sprint ability (which can be done very early game, mind you), you can just sprint back and forth to avoid every projectile, while spamming you're broken weapon that shoots as fast as you can click (and if you're like me, that means it can be spammed at speeds that will melt bosses in no time). So there's no balancing and the graphics are bad, what else? Well, the story is worse than both of those cons combined. The easiest way to describe the story is by saying that there just isn't one. You're a new recruit and you're sent on missions to combat what seems to be an evil creature-empire that's expanding and trying to take over the world(?). You go place to place and just clear each level, there's no more objectives than that. Also, there's only like two themes of levels, and they're repeated over and over. Later game you run into a few levels that are almost impossible given the game's engine, where you have to keep a small ship out of the water even though it goes way faster than you can terraform the ground in front of it, and a boss battle that just drags on so long no matter how much damage you deal per second, and you just have to spam and dodge for like five minutes straight. The game is also very short. And last but not least, the developer decided to incorporate a destructible environment... everywhere. Weapons that deal a little bit of area damage will also chip away at the ground on every level, so if you max out your weapon and you're spamming like hell (as is the custom) the ground will basically meltdown out from under where you're aiming. It breaks the map and it breaks the game, even though it was already broken from all the other previously mentioned problems. When it's all said and done, I would not recommend the Caster to- well, anybody. The only reason it's not getting a 1/10 is because sprinting back and forth at mach speed while spamming your blaster like you have some sort of turrets is actually quite enjoyable in a weird way. So because I ran into a little bit of fun there, I give Caster a generous 3/10. That being said, do not buy this no matter what, not only because you'll waste money, but mostly because you'll just waste your time. I got it on sale for pocket change and I feel like I still got ripped off.3.4/10			"

												Hi dear developers! I am not gonna lie, I bought this game becuase it was the first 3D game on Steam when ordered by price (and I am drunk as ♥♥♥♥ writing this review too). I  enjoyed this game more and played it more than I though I would. I think it is like Dark Souls if you start on Expert and don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on. Ps.: Good luck on future projects!RegardsGizdaMan			"

												Fast paced action game with destructable terrain, although few modes (Kill all enemies, collect energy orbs or uninfect a tree). The graphics are very good for a 3D indie game. I had experienced a few bugs on one of the levels although it was very minor. The fighting style makes for a nice change compared to the current standards, and it is always nice to see such a good game with low resource usage.			"

												Once you go Blast, you never go back.As in you only need like, one power to basically sweep all the enemies in this game. However, I do enjoy playing this game, even if there isn't any real story. But its practically this (I'm assuming):In this world these insect beings known as the Flanx have been destroying the environment, as well as people. Humanity rises up to this challenge by calling for the help of people known as Casters. Casters, having vast amount of magical energies can run fast, kill Flanx with lasers, and restore trees to their natural beauty. Now its up to one caster to defeat the Flanx and restore the land.That's the ""story"", imagine Megaman and Sonic like someone else said in the review section :)7/10			"

												Caster is a fast paced 3rd person shooting game that has a lot of interesting ideas that don't really pan out properly. They give you multiple interesting weapons to use but you only need one to beat the game and two to make it even easier. There's also a nifty upgrade system that maxes out too quickly and leaves you feeling way too overpowered very early on in the game. That being said I still had fun with the game though it is disappointingly short and the story doesn't make much sense since there's a lot left out of context. I bought this game for $0.14 and am happy with what I got but if I had even paid the regular $2.99 amount I probably would have been much more upset with this game and wouldn't have been able to enjoy it as easily. The developer seems to still care for this game and I hope that with some constructive criticism and their continuing to approach this game in a creative way it can get better over time and I can recommend it for the full price that they want.

												My review for ""Caster""Pros-Cheap when on sale (currently 93% off for 20c)Good ability upgrade systemSuper jump and sprint allows movement to be a lot easierDownload takes under a minuteCons-Not worth the price when not on saleTutorial barely explains anythingCharacter customization allows minimal changes Terrible graphics for everythingGame doesn't explain how to pass levelsTutorial looks terribleWhen passing one level, 2 other ones unlock, leaving the player confused on what order to play them inUsing the mouse to look around is slowLevels become extremely easy and are not challenging one bit when you figure out what to doTerrain is extremely bumpy and uglyTotal Score: 2/10Not worth buying, has potential, but I don't reccomend buying it. Even if it was free, I wouldn't download it.			"

												READ NOWThe thing is:This game hasn't actually been abandoned as some people say it has, the creator (Elecorn) has been working on and off on a massive update for a while now and he's probably going to comeback with a big bang on this game at some point, thats why its starting to get a bunch of PROMOTION SALES in the past 18 months or so. Anyway, My review:I'll start with the bad things about this game:- When i first played through the game, it left me a bit downhearted because i enjoyed it, but then this message pops up saying it hasn't been finished yet and to check a website for updates, WTF (this was at that moment anyway) i mean this game was released quite a while ago (Release: 2009) and it hasnt been finished past two chapters? (Disapointment filled my heart)- The Gameplay: Extensive in terms of moving around the environment, however extremely limited to what powers you use, The enemies constantly appear and are very repetetive to fight against, and it feels really wasteful as to understanding what it is you are supposed to do, makes a game feel rather pointless, especially if it isn't visually amazing either.- And I feel that this game could beso much better with a certain amount of... satisfaction in terms of succeeding, this could have been introduced by introducing achievements or special in-game rewards that add to the exxperience, but this isn't such a big deal.THE GEWD STUPH:- Potential! Potential! Potential! : I dont give a s hit if this game was made over five years ago, knowing the future may probably hold a great deal of gameplay is good enough for me, like i said, it hasn't been abandoned and there is hope for this game.- As awkward as the graphics were, it was also very creative, this game is certainly a unique and creative piece of unfinished work, the terrain is potenitally extensive and could be editted a fair bit more, but the concept is very exciting.- As limited as your options are in terms of fighting styles, there is no denial in the fact that it is extremely accreting in the sense that it makes you feel superior to the world you are being introduced to, this goes along the lines of games like Forced Unleashed and Prototype as a listed ""Badass simulator"", it just feels awkward because the developer hasn't 100% succeeded at creating it yet, I certainly hope he will finish it.Stylisticly (even when finished) this game isn't going to be appealling to a fair few people. BUT if you think about how much this game may or may not evolve from here, you could be finding your ideal game that will extend your feel for the indi-game genre, and besides, there isn't really anything to waste, i mean, the amount of sales on this vary between      10-50 cents, i mean come on, thats cheap af.Realistically (for all the Stiffs out there) Rating: 5/10, buy anyways, its cheap.Optimistically (For sick-dawgs to support there fellow gamer/dev) Rating: 8.5/10, BUY NOW, because the opportunity in this could go from what it is to a great stylistic game introducing a new genre of gaming as well as bringing out thing like possibly multiplayer or even more stylistic traits. ;) "

												The game may be great to others, however I found the game play dull and the graphics were unforgivably bad. The ""weapons"" are just different colored versions of each other.

												I only bought this game because at the time it was 9p or something. So played it to get the trading cards. Its so strange and cheap and weirdly fun!? Don't play with a controller unless you enjoy insanity. Keyboard controls are so much easier and work quite well.The game doesnt make sense and its all a bit of a mash up graphics wise. There is something there though that once youve been playing it a while (desperately hoping that the last trading card gets added to your inventory so you can stop playing) becomes quite fun.Maybe if this game was released 25 years ago itd be awesome but it wasnt - its poo!

												Absolutely sensational quality content. The integrity displayed overwhelmed me with three main points; the divinely hand crafted atmosphere most games lack, the unassailible and limitless ways to share your victories with others, and the enticing graphics to draw you straight into the action.Without doubt, the setting portrayed throughout the stages perfectly inveigled me into the story like no other have I experienced. The peachy skies and flawless earls encrusting the curiosity held in deep under the covers. I would suggest one to visit the profile of yours truly, to absorb the scenery in the screenshot photography I specialise in.Many a time, I would be left alone in other games, a lonely tension in the air. Fear not, for caster consumatley fulfills this hunger for companionship one so desires. To quote Nicholas Sparks:  “She was struck by the simple truth that sometimes the most ordinary things could be made extraordinary, simply by doing them with the right people...”  I would highly encourage this lively experience for anyone sociable or not.In most cases with mainstream games, one would be marketed to a particular audience, focusing on one factor such as story, gameplay, or graphics, etc. Caster? nop. Caster is a game that is truly extraordinarily well blended, like a single malt Glenmorangie fitted in a round bottomed dummy, dohdoh, or binky (Pacifier for the uneducated). The immense effort put into the adrenaline pumping, delicately balanced partition in the clouds that this piece of artistic genius presents can only be summarised by a quote from Barry himself:  ""Every day should have its golden moments, it's the diamond standard"".

												Let's say something honest about this game.This game makes me sad. Not because it is mediocre (just mediocre though, not utterly shameful), but because it tries and fails.Caster has a few features which got me entertained for some time despite the poor overall quality of the game. The character movements are well-done and it's pleasant to jump n' run around with actually quite much fluidity. The entire terrain deformation feature also made me have a bunch of fun at it's well-included in the level design (I'd even say this is pretty much the only thing that keeps the lev-des acceptable along with the variety of the environnements).BUT.The first thing which will strike you is the graphics. Jesus. I know it's Elecorn's first game, but the game came out in 2009 and I felt like I was playing an early PS2 game. The textures are low-res (giving by the way to your character the face of an eternal suffering) and the models are quite polygonal.While I'm at it with the general graphics, the particle and pyrotechnic effects are horrendous. When you cast an attack, you really don't have a feel of empowerment because they just look so weak and unimpressive. Some fire and explosions would be welcome in order to take these pew-pews to the next level. Even the attacks from your ennemies are looking unthreatening, while they in fact at medium defficulty deal a good bunch of punch. This seems like a detail, but that will make the boredom come at you in an even shorter time.Now 'bout the the gameplay. Like I said, there are a few interesting things which brings some spice to your adventure. But the gameplay is seriously too repetitive. There are tens of levels and the objective is always the same. Either kill all the ennemies, pick up some energy balls or make a dead tree come back to life. And it's a shame, because this game has potential. There could've been much more things to do, especially with the pleasant movement system and the different attacks to gather along the game.Oh, yes, the attacks. There's a total of six attacks which are, like I said, pretty unimpressive, but fun to use for a little time. You have a basic pulse laser attack, a charged blast attack which deals great damage to both the ennemies and the environnement, an ability to raise the level of the ground, seeking missiles, stunning lasers and a (quite useless) shield.Not only they look pitiful, but their upgrade system is too classical and bulky, and you just gather these attacks by approaching spheres which are spread in the in-game world. You don't acquire them by defeating bosses or gathering an out-of-the-ordinary object, nah. You just encounter 'dem spheres and yoohoo, magical attack learning. That is and will remain too simplistic and it totally does not give any feeling of accomplishment.I could bash this game for a longer time, but this is just sad to look at. There's been effort and you can feel it. And I don't want to be too harsh on somthing that's been the output of many hours of work. So I just hope Elecorn will learn from its failures of the past and make us a neat Caster 2 in the future. Because they really seem to have good ideas, and good ideas leads to potential.C'mon. You can do it, guys.			"

												I do not understand the negativity surrounding this game. I bought it for 16 cents and sold the trading cards for 18 cents. This alone should give reason to buy it. However, there is so much more. The game is amazing. Sure, the graphics are terrible, and sure, there's no story. But the gameplay is stellar. By the time you've fully upgraded every power, you feel like a god among mortals. Heck, you only have to upgrade dash and jump to enjoy the game. You can easily earn more money than you spent on this game, but even at full price it's a steal.			"

												Well, i have beaten the game on medium difficult and i seriously didn't have that much fun, the game has an interesting concept but that's about it. This is more like a prototype, a ""test"" from the developers and it does have some interesting mechanics. Music was great, loved it. Graphics not so much, it is too much ""meh"", they look like some sort of graphic that a ps1 game would have, which not necesseraly makes it bad, but there is simply nothing unique about it, it doesn't catch your attention, it has absolutly no proper style. And the gameplay, oh the gameplay, so much mixed feelings about it... First of all, it is quite fun to search for all the weapons, but after you got all of them (about halfway through) it absolutely doesn't make you want to continue. As you upgrade your gear you start becoming OP, very early in game i maxed my normal gun and a few moments later my dash and my jump, it wasn't very hard to do this and yet, i became a monster. Max Dash+Max jump = saints row 4 flying mechanic. Max laser gun = Continuos beam of death. What irritates the most is that the developers though they could fix this by making the enemies even more OP. Bosses are bullet sponge, flying mosquitos are almost impossible to kill and do WAY too much damage. Plus, minus 1 point for that freaking Toxic cloud. After all, it was a short game, a interesting concept, a very nice music and that's about it. Worth 2 dollars? I don't think so, you probably will just keep in your steam library and never play.Want to buy this game on sale so you can sell the cards and ""win"" money? Good luck, i have beaten both campaings and won a single card. "

												Works brilliantly on my modest and old laptop ( A HP G7000 ) and is really great fun to play despite it's graphics being lacking by today's standards. The concept is very different from the norm, and the closest thing I can think of is the mini games in the Sega Genesis/Megadrive sonic the hedgehog where Sonic (The main Character) would run on a globe covered in red and blue spheres and your goal was to collect all the blue spheres without getting any of the red ones. Essentially this game seems to similar;  to collect power orbs while destroying the monsters that will try to stop you.It's very simple but it has me hooked and will be something I will be playing a lot on my laptop and maybe even on my main pc lol xD			"

												Caster is a 2009 game that would have been a big hit on the Nintendo 64. I'm talking about the good old Rareware quality before Microsoft turned it into just plain Rare. In spirit the developer should earn a Miyamoto award! I think the developer was a senior programmer at Hidden Path Entertainment, they are known for games like CS:GO and Defense Grid 2.Instead of writing a long review (which I may semi-do anyways ;P) I'd like to show some gameplay footage. From this hopefully you can deduce things like how quickly you can pass Caster and level of fun.

			I play four maps. No particular reason for selection. There are a few maps with some interesting features and slight variations to spice things up.		

The game directory contents is quite interesting. It uses SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and some other familiar DLL files. The assets are open to look at. For example the levels consist of two image maps. One for depth and one colour coded that represents the actual design. Essentially you could just create a level in Photoshop or Paint.The biggest problem with Caster is that it freezes my PC randomly. It may have something to do with the graphics since the game works fine in safe mode. The only thing you can do is press the reset button on your PC when it happens since Ctrl + Alt + Del won't even work.			"

Caster isn't a deep game. Caster isn't really a pretty game. But Caster IS a fun game.The meat of Caster is using your energy powers to blast giant bugs to hell. You have 6 powers you can unlock (With additional abilities for running, jumping and shield regen):  Pulse (Basic projectiles) Orbit (Defensive orbs form a shield that is also used as a weak attack) Seeker (Guided missles that go for all available targets) Stun (Does exactly what the name implies) Blast (Modifies the terrain by blasting it down) Eruptor (Modifies the terrain by blasting it up)Though Eruptor and Blast could have easily been a single power, and Orbit is basically useless, the powers are all fun to play around with. Especially when fully upgraded, which is done simply by purchasing them in the menu by using points obtained after completing each level. You can get more points by killing all enemies on the map, finding all the large power orbs, picking up all the small power orbs dropped by both enemies and trees aftter ""healing"" them (shooting them with your powers). The levels themselves are fairly large and sparse, perfect for the breakneck pace you'll be running and jumping after upgrading your basic abilities.The bugs, your enemies, have a few interesting designs. But by a few I mean a few since there is little actual enemy variety in this game. You have swarmers, shooters and grabbers. Bosses are more or less bigger, badder versions of the basic enemies.Graphically the game is no better than an early PS2 title, which just adds to the charm. That said the article effects look pretty damn good. The only thing I can say looks outright bad or ugly are the character portraits which look like they're right out of someones DeviantArt account from 10 years ago.Music is enjoyable, no annoying tracks to be found but nothing too memorable either.tl;dr if you want a fun little arcade-y game where you're super OP and go ham on hordes of enemies then play this game "

												While I liked what I've actually played of this game, I honestly cannot recommend it even for the 3EUR, or whatever it is in your country, right now.For one thing, the game looks like, well, s**t. And I'm no graphics w****, but this game just looks... really, really bad. Mind you, I don't really care, but if graphics are something you care in any way about, this game isn't for you.Of course, other problems include level design, which tends to be completely generic and uninspired at its best, and just s***e at it's worst. One level is just a bunch of squares arranged in rows, like so________|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |Well. That's the closest thing I can get with ASCII art, anyway. Others can be a bit more interesting, with mountains and stuff, but the game's level design is nothing special.Of course, the real problem with this game is how hilariously unbalanced it is. It's not long before you can throw around mighty balls of energy that deform the landscape at will, are capable of jumping hundreds of feet in the air, running around faster than Sonic on steroids, etc. etc.And while some of this is alleviated with the fact that some enemies have huge amounts of health or are capable of one of your mighty super-move-esque blasts, it's not nearly enough.To be honest, something I felt the game could have really benefited from is some multiplayer, because that could genuinely be interesting, with groups running and jumping all over the place, deforming the landscape at will and attempting to hit each other, but alas, it was not to be.So there you go. That's my opinions, based on what I've played. Might've missed some things that somehow magically fix all this, but the game lost me before that if that's the case.			"

The combat demands skill, something even AAA games lack and is kept interesting. There is no story however, just more levels with different enemies.			"

												Wow where do i even begin? Well, I do reccomend this game because i enjoy it, You will too if you have a mind like i do, and if you have a mind like i do, then god bless you..., anyway the Catagories for this game is going to be: Weapon and Tool Use, Origionality, fun, Enemy Style, and the final rating, well without furthe- ♥♥♥♥ its been ""Ado"" this whole time...Weapon and Tool Use: Between 5.2 and 9.710:The weapons, themselves, arent that detailed or arent very well thought out, However, what the weapons do, and what impact into the environment it makes, its a tough call, i have very mixxed feelings about the WeaponsOrigionality: 11/10:Holy ♥♥♥♥, there has been no other game like this (That ive played) Its bat ♥♥♥♥ cray, And thats coming from me, Its balanced crazy though, just enough to enjoy.Fun: 8.7/10:I get bored slower than other games, and its weird, because all it is, is look, shoot, look shoot, jump, look, shoot But it works for me, its so weird..Enemy Style: 9.1/10:Whoa, what.. What is it with this game being crazy!? The enemys are completely different from what ive seen in any game, the use of weapons on enemys and the way they (Sometimes) blend into or go with the environment.Overall rating: 8.3/10:This game is Totally out of my comfort zone inside gaming, and im SO glad i pushed the boundries. I got this game on sale, but for me, full price is a ♥♥♥♥ing steal. I will be playing this game quite a few times, and love it every time.Thank you SO much for reading, And remember, POWER TO THE PIGGLEZ! :D <3~Pinchypoo			"

												I'm not even going to lie, I bought it because of the Steam cards. Once I opened the game it just looked like another generic ♥♥♥♥♥♥ low-priced videogame that people buy because profit, but just for good measure I started playing it. I was shocked because of all the options it has, quite impressed to be honest that in a game like this you can change the depth of field, resolution, shadows and so on and so forth. The gameplay is actually pretty well designed, the combat is a little bit repetitive not going to lie but you do have a quite variety of weapons to chose from if you so desire, even though the balance in this game is ABSOLUTELY disgusting. You can kill the final boss of the first campaign just by freezing the damn thing and shooting it with your basic attack. The dash ability is ridiculously Overpowered as well as the super jump which at this rate might as well be called flying because that's exactly what you end up doing, flying through half of the map, stay on the ground for a few seconds and then take off to get to the other side of the map.Another thing that bothers me is the fact that the game doesn't actually encourage you to complete all of the stages without taking any damage other than the 2,000 bonus credits you get that are incredibly useless once you are fully upgraded (at last in the part of the game I stopped playing). Guns are too powerful, enemies are the same and predictable and the game is way too easy, I literally just finished the first campaign using two weapons and the others just to pick up the Energy Orbs when needed. Nice game it is worth the price just needs more attention on the balance side of things.			"

												I think this is my first indie game on Steam I liked (though I am new to them). Caster is a well-designed game with very tight controls and unique enemies that can change the way you play levels for a very fun experience. The story isn't the most well put-together and neither is the main character, but it serves well enough to get the game rolling. I think the levels are built very uniquely and not only cater to Caster's abilities and need for space when fighting enemies but also show how large and empty the world that Caster lives in. And while the Middon levels were fun, I think the ones in Lydonia were the more superiorly designed levels, though I hope the creator ends up making that last level, because that was a bit of a harsh slap to the face after having played so many engaging levels. This is definitely a game I recommend you don't pass up.			"

												Works brilliantly on my modest and old laptop ( A HP G7000 ) and is really great fun to play despite it's graphics being lacking by today's standards. The concept is very different from the norm, and the closest thing I can think of is the mini games in the Sega Genesis/Megadrive sonic the hedgehog where Sonic (The main Character) would run on a globe covered in red and blue spheres and your goal was to collect all the blue spheres without getting any of the red ones. Essentially this game seems to similar;  to collect power orbs while destroying the monsters that will try to stop you.It's very simple but it has me hooked and will be something I will be playing a lot on my laptop and maybe even on my main pc lol xD			"

I like the way the game controls for the most part. I liked the dashing and double jumping. The shooting was easy, and the weapons were at least varied enough to actually all be interesting to see what they did. I mean, I probably won't play this game to its end, but I mean, it has some good parts, and some bad. The levels felt open and barren, but each one was at least somewhat unique for as far as I played. The graphics could use a bit of work in my opinion, but I mean, I think for the sale price, I'm not really going to complain too much.I only really recommend this with the sale price, I mean, 3 bucks for this wouldn't be too bad in my opinion, but I mean, I probably wouldn't have picked it up myself at this price.

I really didn't expect it would be fun when i bought it but hey, it is, however, although this game has fun game mechanics, the level design and graphics are awful. It looks like the developers just spent 1 hour creating each level. That makes this game seem so cheap. I want to reccommend to the developer that if they created some amazing levels, i would consider this quite an amazing game. Take the map of Skyrim for example, or titanfall. The map/s in those games are detailed and amazing. Something similar in this game would have made it even better. I would have also preferred voice acting. So in conclusion, it has fun game mechanics but horrible level design and graphics. They could have upped the texture res a good bit at least.			"

												I got the game gifted to me while it's only 14 cent. The game is very simple and 'What you paid is what you got' saying can be applied on this game. Don't expect anything great out of 14 cent.Pros:+ The game itself got an interesting game concept. + A good detailed tutorial.+ And of course, has cards that you can sell to make profit.Cons:- Lack of Story.- Mouse Cursor Control not responsive.- Graphic aren't better than most of PSone Games.Conclusion:If this game on sale, buy it.

												Now let me tell you, this game is fun. It's fun for all the wrong reasons however. Upgrade your jump all the way in the first few levels and you can just ignore the rest of the game. What's that kill the enemy? nah, I'll just jump him and the next few continents. This game made a mistake by giving me a weapon that allows me to lower and raise the ground. What was supposed to be a cool canyon maze quickly became the envy of all salt flats. A level in which there were lakes of lava, no worries, raised all the ground now it's a resort. Oh? The enemies die in water then allow me to get rid of all that silly land.Tl:drJump higher then you ever have before and play god.			"

												I think this is my first indie game on Steam I liked (though I am new to them). Caster is a well-designed game with very tight controls and unique enemies that can change the way you play levels for a very fun experience. The story isn't the most well put-together and neither is the main character, but it serves well enough to get the game rolling. I think the levels are built very uniquely and not only cater to Caster's abilities and need for space when fighting enemies but also show how large and empty the world that Caster lives in. And while the Middon levels were fun, I think the ones in Lydonia were the more superiorly designed levels, though I hope the creator ends up making that last level, because that was a bit of a harsh slap to the face after having played so many engaging levels. This is definitely a game I recommend you don't pass up.			"

												Reminds me of Prototype because of super speed and high jump, and it uses the sound from Prototype.Reminds me of Serious Sam because it has wide levels, and uses the menu sound from Serious Sam.Reminds me of Mega Man because of the design, but does not actually use any sounds from it.Damn worth 14 cents (It's not even 14 cents if you sell the trading cards right away).

For example, in one of the later levels there are a bunch of little flies everywhere so you have to use your stun weapon in order to stop them, then you have to use your homing missles to take them out.

												Caster is a 2009 game that would have been a big hit on the Nintendo 64. I'm talking about the good old Rareware quality before Microsoft turned it into just plain Rare. In spirit the developer should earn a Miyamoto award! I think the developer was a senior programmer at Hidden Path Entertainment, they are known for games like CS:GO and Defense Grid 2.Instead of writing a long review (which I may semi-do anyways ;P) I'd like to show some gameplay footage. From this hopefully you can deduce things like how quickly you can pass Caster and level of fun.

			I play four maps. No particular reason for selection. There are a few maps with some interesting features and slight variations to spice things up.		

The game directory contents is quite interesting. It uses SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and some other familiar DLL files. The assets are open to look at. For example the levels consist of two image maps. One for depth and one colour coded that represents the actual design. Essentially you could just create a level in Photoshop or Paint.The biggest problem with Caster is that it freezes my PC randomly. It may have something to do with the graphics since the game works fine in safe mode. The only thing you can do is press the reset button on your PC when it happens since Ctrl + Alt + Del won't even work.			"

												Well, it was on sale for 17 cents. I expected absolutely nothing and got a bit more than that. All in all, it's a pretty good game... It's strikingly evocative of a sort of slightly-crappy but still ""Cult classic"" PS1 game, from the visuals to the early-2000s-esque techno music in the background- Which might turn some off, but honestly, it's exactly the sort of game I feel I would have rented at the video store growing up.The gameplay's fairly simple and straightforward: Run around at high speed, shoot at enemies, rinse and repeat. The first weapon you get shoots rather slow-moving lasers- Brings back memories of the golden days of fast movement speed tied with non-hitscan weaponry, at least for me. As you progress through the levels, you pick up more abilities for your suit, as well as upgrade the abilities you already have, eventually ending up basically flying around the map at the speed of sound spamming homing missiles that kill everything on the screen pretty much automatically. The game has one of those really early terrain deformation systems, where you can raise or lower points on the map to your heart's content (After acquiring the weapons that let you do so, of course), which is cool I guess? It kept me engaged for the two and a half hours the main story lasted.Onto the story: To put it mildly, there isn't one. Really, there's three characters: You, a mute anime-ish-looking boy/girl in a suit of what can only be described as power armor; a two-dimensional portrait of a lady that gives you instructions at the start of each level and congratulates you at the end of such; and the commander, who you never even see and who only shows up through text at the beginning and end of the main story. The story itself is that there are a bunch of bug-things and you have to shoot them. It's really not that deep. It also happens to stop halfway through and suggest that you should wait until some sort of update.The graphics are like a Nintendo 64 game, and not a good one. Enough said.All in all, it's not what I'd call a great game, but if it's on sale, go ahead and pick it up. Put it this way: It's cheaper and much more fun than going to Wal-mart and getting a gumball from one of the machines.			"

												A great game for it's price. Still learning the game, yet it seems like the power scale of the weapons is a wide range, to the fact where, unless I need a specific weapon is needed for an area, I always use it (SPOILER: orbit, it shields from attacks fires fast, and can be held down to make many different things). Not sure about later in the game though. The tutorial and the pop-up texts explain almost everything you need to know. It's a bit dark in parts of the game, and hit detection on a few of the enemies are off, but aside from that and me getting lost in some of the bigger maps, I have no complaints. I've seen other complaints about the game not being finished, but it seems pretty much done to me, aside from a few bug patches.			"

												Going into this I wasn't expecting much.  The preview video and the screenshots revealed little about its gameplay, and the art style didn't look like much, either.  But boy was I pleasantly surprised!  The spells you cast are really fun to use and each have their place against certain enemies, the movement is so satisfying and fun (dashing at the speed of sound and leaping across the entire map, anyone?) and the enemies, at this stage in the game, are easy but varied.  My only gripe is that the game hands you too many upgrade points at once.  I'm not even an hour in and I've already maxed three abilities (jump, dash and Pulse) and it's making the maps trivial at best.  Maybe this was the intention?  All in all, a great purchase (on sale for $0.14 USD) and I also think it's a good purchase at its full price as well.  Definitely worth your time.  Also, community maps!			"

												Caster is a 2009 game that would have been a big hit on the Nintendo 64. I'm talking about the good old Rareware quality before Microsoft turned it into just plain Rare. In spirit the developer should earn a Miyamoto award! I think the developer was a senior programmer at Hidden Path Entertainment, they are known for games like CS:GO and Defense Grid 2.Instead of writing a long review (which I may semi-do anyways ;P) I'd like to show some gameplay footage. From this hopefully you can deduce things like how quickly you can pass Caster and level of fun.

			I play four maps. No particular reason for selection. There are a few maps with some interesting features and slight variations to spice things up.		

The game directory contents is quite interesting. It uses SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and some other familiar DLL files. The assets are open to look at. For example the levels consist of two image maps. One for depth and one colour coded that represents the actual design. Essentially you could just create a level in Photoshop or Paint.The biggest problem with Caster is that it freezes my PC randomly. It may have something to do with the graphics since the game works fine in safe mode. The only thing you can do is press the reset button on your PC when it happens since Ctrl + Alt + Del won't even work.			"

												At first I bought the game for 20 cents to get some trading cards, I just idled until I got the cards, but then I played it. And it is so fun, it's pretty much a sonic game but with different attacks and weird enemies, a lot of the missions are repetitive, and some are unique, even when the missions are repetitive collecting all the energy balls and defeating all enemies is so fun, I wouldn't buy for 3 bucks, but I would buy it if it is on sale, it's very fun.

												This game could have given so much more. To give you an idea, I beat this game in 89 minutes, that's with exploring, and completing EVERY little objective this game has. As soon as I beat it I never touched it again. Here are some pros and cons...Pros:-The game is fun, and gives you a break from hardcore games.-I've never really seen any other game like it, it's fresh.-Easy to pick up, easy to play.-Fun abilities, and once yo finish the level you don't have to leave. There was a couple of times where I kinda dicked around a lot, but it was fun.Cons:-The levels/worlds are not very expansive, it can take anyone not even 2 minutes to walk from one side to the other.-The games levels also kind of seem unfinished, they made landscaping where they wanted you to go. Only one level was actually good, it was kind of a swampy level.-Small variety in enemies.Over all, this game was a bit rushed, or it was someones first project, I have no clue. If you have an hour or two to waste, buy this game, it's only $0.49. "

												I've finished what appears to be the first chapter of the game and I totally enjoyed it. The game is worth the money even at full price. It reminds me a lot of Dragon Ball since the gameplay mechanics are similar. If you want graphics, you're at the wrong game and you should probably check another one, but if you wish a decent game with some really interesting gameplay mechanics that can offer a lot of fun, don't hesitate to get Caster and help out the dev, since he deserves some love as well!

												Clearly an unfinished game (and should probably be advertised as ""Early Access""), but even in its raw state ""Caster"" is a lot of fun.  It's basically a third-person shooter with extreme low-gravity jump effects and a bumpin' techno soundtrack.  Not a game for graphics snobs (it looks like something from the Playstation One), but I did get a giddy rush as I leapt two hundred yards in the air and let loose with a barrage of heat-seeking energy balls upon the ant-aliens firing their pathetic purple lasers at me below. Sometimes it's all about the simple pleasures...I played through it in about four hours on the normal difficulty setting a few months ago. Enjoyed it so much that I'm coming back to it on the ""Extreme"" difficulty setting now, and finding it tough enough going that it feels almost like a new game.For what it's worth, the dev says in the forums that he's (she's?) got more content for this game in the works, which might be ready for early beta testing soon.  I'll definitely be buying it when it comes out.			"

												A mildly interesting shooter reminiscent of the PS1/N64 era shooters but a bit smoother. The music is killer and the sense of movement is really fast and satisfying. It's a shame, then, that it's all marred by uninteresting design all across the board. There's barely any story, the graphics are poor, the levels are emptier than my bank account and there's barely any sound effects.The music is pretty cool though but even then there's not enough tracks to keep me satisfied. You're looking to buy this game either because 1- you've played every other 3rd person shooter out there... EVER, and you want to play Caster as your last resort or 2- you're interested in the indie scene and think the game looks cool. For both camps, I say you can definitely do better than this game.So unless you get some chance to get this game free in a bundle or gift, go for it but I don't think it's worth the money spent at current price.

												Basically this game is a engine demo for a Mega Man Legends inspired game. It doesn't have tank controls though. You have 8 abilities and the ability to dash super jump. Jumping 500 feet into the air is super satisfied. You can upgrade all weapons, health, dashing, and jumping though points earned during the level. So you're Super Jumps become flying. The story is nearly non existant. You are Caster (seemingly a spell caster) who gets spells to destroy monsters and revive trees from evil flanks (creatures). The character looks inspired by Megaman. Theres a missions system where in the level you get the power up for certain creatures is similiar to megaman. The only other character in the game is a blonde who tells you a basic mission and says good job when you do it (Like Roll). IT IS A UNFINISHED GAME! But every level introduces new mechanics. The floor is destructable which can lead to some strategy on some level. The levels are basic, but have a general mechanic they are built around. Later missions I actually died. You are getting swarmed by flying enemies and little ground swarmers, and the chaos gets pretty fun. Seems like this game was made by a few people in thier free time. It's a shame nothing more came out of it because with money and polish if feels like it could have been a series. First 3 levels are meh. Then it gets more interesting. It is bland, but what is there is interesting and endearing. It's just sad because more resources could have turned a good tech demo into a great game. It's definitely worth a peek if on sale, you are a diehard megaman fan, and can appreciate the simple things. I shouldn't like this game as much as I do, but it grows on you. Which seems to be the general sentiment in reviews.			"

												This is a pretty simple little game. The game isn't anything hyper-exceptional but it offers fairly entertaining gameplay. The terrain deformation is present but rather primitive as these things go, but acceptable enough, considering the following:The game will run on basically any computer with more power than a toaster, all the way down to barely-relevant little netbooks. This makes it a very nice purchase for anyone who wants an action-y game on a netbook or other low power computers (do use an external mouse, though).And no, you can't run it on a Raspberry Pi 2 with Windows 10.

												Even though recieved at a 75% reduction in sales price, well worth the full $2. As I see other reviews giving it a hard time for it's outdated graphics and negative comments, I wonder why there are people hating on a developer such as this who took time to create a small indie-sized yet enjoyable sandbox-like, bullet-hell masterpiece but the same ones give AAA games that lack nearly any creativity the ""10"" rating that it doesn't deserve. If you are like myself who can play a games and can overlook small flaws to design in areas like grahpics and clunkiness from time-to-time, then I'm sure you will find the price is well worth this Electronic-soundtracked indie dark horse.

												Price / hour 0,58€ (there's some sales to get it cheaper)First off why it's a masterpiece in it's own way: It's unique and featured in ""250 Indie Games You Must Play""Before I move to Pros and cons, I say this: If you like the trailer (ignore the music), buy it. It's not like the new game trailers that doesn't have anything to do with the gameplay, this Steam trailer fits the whole gameplay pretty well. People who like fast and different movement in gaming like me, this is absolutely a good choice for it.Pros:- Soundtrack. It's not like in trailer, it's peaceful with little power in it, so heck it's awesome and enertaining.- The speed. As I said about the different and fast movement, it's true.- Destroyable enviroment -  The weapons destroy (or add) some ground and you can use it to example avoid attacks.Cons:- Length- Bonus maps by mods. Mod pack 1 took like 20 mins to complete, there's no much fanbase to this game and therefore no more maps, doesn't affect so much to the interest of this game.- Unbalanced weapons. Seriously I used almost only one weapon to complete the game because it was simply the best when upgrading to best- Super jump is too.. superior. You can kinda just fly through the map and kill the enemies above. It's not what Caster is about as you can see from the trailer. ---> I like the upgrades and stuff, but it makes stuff way too easy. If this game would be longer though, this issue could be removed, because you can't get half of the upgrades at the first levels.- Ignore the partial controller support - at least when my Gamecube controller was attached to my computer, it somehow bugged that it forced the mouse to go upwards 24/7			"

I especially enjoy the fact that I was able to play with a controller, as it requires a little more skill. What KILLS me about this game is the general lack on contect. I was able to complete the game within in an hour on its normal dificulty. Graphics wise there is alot to be desired, but that's just me being picky.

												Price / hour 0,58€ (there's some sales to get it cheaper)First off why it's a masterpiece in it's own way: It's unique and featured in ""250 Indie Games You Must Play""Before I move to Pros and cons, I say this: If you like the trailer (ignore the music), buy it. It's not like the new game trailers that doesn't have anything to do with the gameplay, this Steam trailer fits the whole gameplay pretty well. People who like fast and different movement in gaming like me, this is absolutely a good choice for it.Pros:- Soundtrack. It's not like in trailer, it's peaceful with little power in it, so heck it's awesome and enertaining.- The speed. As I said about the different and fast movement, it's true.- Destroyable enviroment -  The weapons destroy (or add) some ground and you can use it to example avoid attacks.Cons:- Length- Bonus maps by mods. Mod pack 1 took like 20 mins to complete, there's no much fanbase to this game and therefore no more maps, doesn't affect so much to the interest of this game.- Unbalanced weapons. Seriously I used almost only one weapon to complete the game because it was simply the best when upgrading to best- Super jump is too.. superior. You can kinda just fly through the map and kill the enemies above. It's not what Caster is about as you can see from the trailer. ---> I like the upgrades and stuff, but it makes stuff way too easy. If this game would be longer though, this issue could be removed, because you can't get half of the upgrades at the first levels.- Ignore the partial controller support - at least when my Gamecube controller was attached to my computer, it somehow bugged that it forced the mouse to go upwards 24/7			"

												Disclaimer: I've been playing offline, that's why it says I've only played 0.2 hours. In reality it's closer to 1.2 hours.The game has 2 chapters, and at the time of writing, I'm about halfway through the second one.The main complaint I have about this game is that it's just way too easy. I played on Extreme difficulty and I could still get through most of the levels without even taking damage. The Dash move, which is unlocked at the start is basically just a sprint which makes you run at about 3 times the speed of sound. After each level you can buy upgrades which cost about half as much as a ♥♥♥♥ing Twix, and after upgrading the Dash a few times you can dash for about 30 seconds with a 3 second cooldown afterwards.While dashing, you can walk on water, toxin and lava don't hurt you and you move too fast for enemy projectiles to be able to hit you. The only times you even need to bother with killing enemies are the levels where the objective is to clear out the area. When the objective is just to heal the tree at the end, or to collect all of the energy orbs, you can just sprint past the Flanx (enemies) and finish the level in about 30 seconds.For attacks, the only one you need is the Pulse, which is basically a rocketlauncer that you can charge to do more damage, but just spamming the uncharged attack is enough to kill most enemies in no time once you've upgraded the attack a few times. Even the big ♥♥♥ bosses are a piece of cake once you know how to spam the attack.The controls are good, and I like how your attacks can affect the level (shooting rockets makes craters appear etc.), and the monster design is pretty good and creative as well.That said, the difficulty is really a dealbreaker and therefore I can't say I recommend Caster.4/10			"

												It's $2 and made by a solo dev, which shows really badly in places. I bought it on sale for $0.14 and I've gotten about a buck worth of enjoyment out of ripping on the (slow and very samey) gameplay, (unusual and tedious) controls, and (low-res nearly untextured) graphics. I expect to also get a nickel or two from selling the cards. Make your own choices.			"

												Ezt a játékot 0,14€-ért vettem.  Nem ér többet, sőt még egy ingyenes játéknak is borzalmas lenne. Az a kicsi idő, amit játszottam vele, azt elvesztegettnek érzem, annyira gagyi. A grafikája finoman fogalmazva szar, de nem ezért rossz, sőt még ki is lehetne bírni. Egyszerűen annyira monoton ez a játék, mint a Terminátor új része. Maga az ötlet jó, de a megvalósítás borzalmas.. 2/10			"

												I played a bit of Caster and I didn't find it particularly interesting. I don't care about the graphics, which doesn't look good, but the game is simply not fun to play. You have 6 different weapons (that you collect as you progress) with which you can kill/stun your enemies, but the enemy variety is little, and basically it's always a question of running around the enemies to avoid being hit and shoot them until they die. Levels are really small, and with the instructions + map it's very easy to finish them.Sound effects are basic, and there's no story to get involved with. A plus of the game is the options' menu, very rich, but all in all I simply wouldn't recommend playing the game. Pick it up only if it's heavily discounted.One final thing: on Mac, this game crashed once while I was playing, and once it failed to launch.			"

												This game, while it looks bland and like something you would have played on the Sega Saturn or Nintendo 64 more than 10 years ago, is actually quite entertaining if you like mindlessly running around murdering things. It's a very simple game, not terribly difficult (though there is a level I'm stuck on so I haven't managed to finish the game yet), it's loads of fun to just dart around and blast the living crap out of (nearly) everything that moves. For the price, you can't go wrong, but if you're hesitant about spending the $5 (at the time of this writing), wait till a sale and pick it up then. Don't go into it expecting AAA graphics and story and you'll have fun, if only for a few hours.			"

												This is honestly a terrible game, even for 2009 standards.The camera angle is beyond screwed, and camera speed comes with 10 settings, which are realistically just variations of ""WAY TOO SLOW!"" and ""HOLYJEEZTHISISTOOFASTTOKNOWWHATI'MDOINGBUTTHISCOCAINESMELLSSOGOOD!"" so I'd recommend a mouse with adjustable DPI for that.The story is as rich as a dead hobo, and the gameplay bored the living hell out of me, which (Summarised) is: Collect magical orb thing, kill random alien things, go to the giant yellow light for Scotty to beam you up. Also, there's something about shooting a dead tree, and bringing it back to life, then getting more orb things to upgrade your super powers.Audio quality is very mixed, with some levels having nice music, and others being absolutely shocking. The level after the tutorial gave me a three hour headache after listening to a shoddy loop of rain until my punishment was over, and I finished the level.I picked this game up for 10 cents, and I regret buying it.

												Caster is a really fun, action-packed shooter game. You're able to run super fast, and also jump very, VERY high, which makes the game quite interesting. You get throughout the game 6 different powers (different attacks) which you'll be able to use in the later maps. These 2 combined together makes a quite nice punch, as you'll be able to jump quite high and run fast to dodge the enemy attacks and at the same time shoot the enemies (this made the game quite easy for me tho). This reminded me very much of Megaman -series, since the character also looked alot like Megaman.The game took about 1,5 hours for me to play through. "

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a  game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou are able to change the Music volume everytime by 10%.You are able to change the Sound volume everytime by 10%.All resolution sizes are available.You can toggle between fullscreen or windowed mode.There is a camera sensitivity.You are able to change the controls on the keyboard.You are able to change the controls on the controller.You are able to play the game with a controller. Obviously.There is ""How to play"".There is a difficulty level available.There are many save slots available.About the game.You are playing with some kind of thing and you are send into a mission. You have to complete objectives to move on to the next level. Mostly killing enemies or collecting orbs. The game is getting dull very quickly as it has nothing to offer. You are basically doing the same stuff over and over and over again. You got a shop to upgrade things and a mini-radar at the bottom.You can choose between male or female character.However the scenery in this game is very bland, and i mean VERY VERY BLAND/EMPTY.The animations are very dull.The game Graphics are from N64. The music is the best part of this game.Enemies are easy and not very interesting. I am playing this on the highest difficulty and there isnt a big issue to deal with.Other things.It would be better to only get this game during a sale or discount, otherwise you are better off playing a different game. Don't expect too much form this game.-------------------I Give this game a 3/10			"

												Caster is probably not for all people and its not for me either. In caster you play as a rookie caster who is asked to fight off a deadly waves of aliens called flanx. It gives you diffrent powers to fight them which is cool because some of those powers are pretty cool. The worlds you visit look awfull and look dull its just fields of nothing. The flanx types look awfull and sometimes just a pain in the ♥♥♥ to fight them off. With infinite lives you cant die so that helps to fight some of the tougher enemies. But some missions are a pain in the ♥♥♥ such as Acid meadows. In that missions you have to escort a boat by lifting up the ground through the acid lake and the boat can be destroyed. Overall this game is just awfull in all ways horrible graphics, bland worlds, terrible gunplay and awfull enemies its just a title you need to stay away from so if you want to buy it be warned i give this game a 2/10			"

I snagged this little gem for only 14 cents with a 95% Steam week-long sale.It's a lot of fun, is very fast paced and the controls are tight and responsive.You got levels to beat, lot of baddies to shoot down, towering cliffs to double jump on, and pools of water to jump into from far above to create an epic splash effect!  Super Fun!The options for both graphics, screen resolution, and sound are nice in an inexpensive game like this as well, plus it offers over 10 different game saves.At the regular prices of $2.99 USD, this game is a good deal... but at the 14 cent sale I bought it at, this is a no brainer.  ..If you play it 10 minutes, you've gotten you money's worth, lol.

												Drawing inspiration from such blockbusters as Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing and Jurassic Park: Trespasser, elecorn presents to you his magnum opus, Caster. In Caster, you follow the legend of a young boy (or a feminine frame boy), his face tragically crippled at birth by low poly counts, fighting against an unknown alien threat known as FLANX, determined to sit there and do nothing or walk at innocent humans in straight lines as they go about their day. To defeat such a menacing threat our hero is granted the power of super speed and must fly through rin- I mean collect orbs of power, granting him powers such as running up vertical walls, jumping so high he crosses the entire level, and homing missiles that _very_ accurately track their enemies.The game also features a myriad of references to previous grand slam titles often overlooked by the casual gamer. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics are a reference to Final Fantasy 7, one of elecom's favorite games when he was 5. The physics reference legendary racer Big Rigs, with the ability to instantly stop while running 172839127 mph. And of course, who could forget the large number of bullets and badly drawn characters, clearly a reference to ZUN and Touhou.Caster's main strength is in its simplicity and accessibility. With levels lasting between 3 seconds and 2 minutes, you don't have to worry about a commitment when you sit down; you can simply play! The controls are very intuitive; some may critcize the heavy mouse acceleration, but it's by design so that all players, newbies and pros alike, have equal trouble aiming and controlling their character ensuring a balanced experience no matter who's playing.However, no matter the level of quality of a game there are always a few negative points, and Caster is no exception... one of them being that there are some issues with the PC port of this game. In the optimization process from Linux to Windows and Mac, a large amount of autism was left in. I for one cannot stand for excess autism in my games, and so I cannot ignore this sloppy port job, no matter the quality of the actual game. Further, in his rush to get the game out for the holidays (a goal which he ultimately failed at, thanks to Steam wrongfully delaying his game in their rigorous review process), elecom unfortunately left the game unfinished. Not in the traditional way though, where devs don't have time to add their layer of polish, but actually unfinished. When you attempt to enter the final level you are given a ""To Be Continued"" screen. What's there is golden, but what COULD have been there could have been so much more...  It's a real shame elecom didn't get to finish his title, as it would have been a good nominee for game of the year.In the end Caster will be put on the long list of visionary video games tragically cut short by time and budget constraints, dreams brought down by the crushing reality of checkbooks and deadlines. Do yourself a favor and pick up elecom's game. For only 99 cents, you can't really go wrong. You don't need supersize fries anyway. I give this game a 7/10.			"

												I bought this game because it looked like it had some potential. However, this is clearly someones first game as it is basically the engines default graphics and such. You have a poorly made character with poorly made animations. The controls on the controller are misconfigured, so you have to essentially use the keyboard. The game consists of you running around collecting orbs that are scattered over the world. I'm sure there are enemies and such later on, but, there's nothing unique about the game. I'm sorry to have to write such a poor review of the game, but it's really really terrible. It's so bad, that in the intro level, you collect an orb that says, hey, there's some extra graphical settings we included, but didn't program into the settings, so you have to manually edit the .ini file if you want them. And another that states, if the controller isn't working right, you need to manually change it around.I can't stress enough how boring this game is. I would highly recommend against buying it, even if it is just 50 cents on sale. Go buy a candy bar, you'll enjoy it more.To the devs: do a better job. If you're a programmer making a game, hire some artists and designers. If you're an artist trying to learn to program, hire a programmer. If you're a 12 year old and this is your first game, then you're on the right track, but don't try and sell your 1st, 2nd, or 50th game until it's actually worth playing. If you're a team of artists and developers, then shame on you for producing this horrendous abomination trying to make a quick buck.			"

I have to agree that the graphic look like they should be on the playstation 1,but Hye my Username is KeyCaster so I think that this game was meant for me.Literally.So I got it played it....Its great buy some cons but this game gets a 7.5/10.Good.But I recommend buying it when it is on sale.49 cents like wow.talk about cheap.But it would be worth if you payed full price as well.

												As far as value for money goes, this game is pretty good. It doesn't hold any real replay value, and the game itself is very short, but it just doesn't care about itself enough to be anything but silly fun.Pros:+ Movement is very smooth+ Music is very good for an original indie game.+ The attacks are varied and require at least a tiny bit of strategy to complete, even if the game is easy+ Levels aren't too binding and rarely serve to frustrate or go on longer than they should+ Lots of options to play around with, including controlbinds and difficulty levels+Optional objectives in every level for completionist types+ Doesn't last any longer than it should, and ends before the fun wears out+ Boss levels are pretty satisfying to beat+Trading cards! Cons-Graphics are pretty bad, but forgivable as it feels strangely retro.-The game is very, very short. All in all you could get about 4 hours of enjoyment out of this game before it becomes stale-The story is plretty much nonexistent. -No character development whatsoever-No achievements-Enemies aren't too well varied-Minor gripes with weapons, their hit registration is sometimes off-Dash makes the game extremely easy-Running up walls and other surfaces essentially cancel out environmental hazards. -Some levels are hilariously easyFinal verdict: 6.5/10Definitely worth a go for 14 cents.If you're looking for a bit of silly fun or something new you won't be disappointed . Just don't expect too much, it is an indie game after all. "

Textures appear to be drawn crudely, then stretched over a few polygons.Even at 14-30 cents this game isn't worth the buy.

												So, after having played Caster for a good while...What do I think of it?On my first time, I started and stopped the game due to controller issues, but it was likely a problem on my end. I'm unsure if it's accostumed to XInput or DirectInput... Anyway, the controls are pretty simple and fluid, since it's the basic move-shoot-jump combo with a Dash button. You have an upgrade system, in which you can up your shield (Lifebar), your pickup distance, Super Jump, Dash (which becomes really handy as you go on), along with the six weapons. The graphics are reminiscent of the early PS2 era, meaning that if your computer is the equivalent of a toaster you shouldn't have any problems running it. You have three difficulties - Casual, Normal, and Hardcore - that are all functional in their own way. You have a good bunch of levels, though the objectives are straightforward. The gameplay in itself feels like a cross between Megaman Legends and a Bullet Hell, when you have loads of enemies. The music has a touch of electronica, neither ill-advised nor well-suited, but it gets the job done. The story's pretty simple, as you're a completely new Caster trying to go up against an alien race known as Flanx. As usual, it's all up to you as you traverse through the game. As you power up your weapons, you're going to have to play a little bit differently as each weapon intensifies its use - as an example, Blast blows small craters on its first upgrade, developing into giant holes as you further upgrade. The scenery, as advertised, shifts along with the battles you have in the level, in a level of terraforming I haven't seen in any game of yet - reminding me a bit of the Dragon Ball Z series, in a way. It's not exactly a time-sinker, as it is Single-Player, but it's always good for a round or two if you're a little bit bored. It does have mods, but you need to go to the game's site to get them. At the time of this review, there's only one modpack - that assumes you have everything upgraded, as it ups the challenge. Perhaps if this game had enough of a fanbase, it might qualify for a Steam Workshop...?tl;dr - Forgettable if you let it slide back into your games library not to touch it, but your first playthroughs are decisively fun and entertaining, and likely enough to keep you entertained.4/5 - Gameplay3/5 - Sound3/5 - GraphicsFINAL SCORE:3/5 - Reasonable!

												Out of boredom I used the last coins in my wallet to buy this game, at first I was thinking it would be a terrible mistake, ironically, this game has potential, and got me playing it for 2 hours 'till I found it's end.The spells at their first levels aren't that interesting, but after farming those trees for a bit and unlocking more powerful levels, I found out that it's incredibly fun to blow several enemies with that acid blast spell while jumping several feet high and creating a massive hole on the ground at the same time. I think the development should continue, and maybe in the future this game can earn a sequel, or a revamp in these graphics, because it's really worth it.
