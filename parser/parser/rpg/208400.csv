												I've been loving this game so far.  I was recently reminded that I had this, because of the release of Crystal Souls just the other day.. and boy am I sorry I forgot about Avernum for this long.  I should have played this ages ago!First thing I wanted to do was clear up the order these games are supposed to be in, because with so many Spiderweb Software games, it can be a little confusing to newcomers (like myself, until I did some research)This is a remake of ""Avernum"" which itself is a remake of ""Exile: Escape From the Pit"".  The newly released Crystal Souls is a remake of Exile 2/Avernum 2.  Exile 3/Avernum3 is also supposedly getting a second remake in the future. I know that sounds confusing, so just know that this game, Avernum: EFtP is the first game, remade for the second time. Also, I've been told that the stories are self-contained, so you don't really HAVE to play them in order.  Though, with a world as unique as Avernum, I bet it helps in understanding the lore a bit.So what makes this world so unique?  Most fantasy RPGs take place on the surface of a very earth-like world.  There's plains, mountains, forests, rivers, lakes, etc.. it all looks very familiar.  In Avernum, that sort of place exists.. but that's not where you play.  You, your party, and countless other individuals have all been exiled to the underworld.  It's a vast underground cavern, whose light comes from glowing moss on the ceiling.People survive by growing edible mushrooms, and receiving occasional supply shipments from the Empire.. the very people who sent everyone down here.  There are some cows, sent down by the empire, but without proper food, they grow sick and weak quite quickly.  Mages have managed to create things that kinda look like trees, just so the citizens have wood to build with.Magical equipment is extremely rare in this world.. It's all but impossible to create any, so most of it comes from adventurers who were sent down to Avernum with their gear, then were killed and looted.  It's a harsh world.Despite all the hardships, though, people have banded together to form towns, forts, and a government.  Of course some still decide to rebel and become bandits, or seek a way to rise into a position of power, but most people seem to live in harmony and cooperate.  And that's a good thing, because if they didn't work together, they'd never be able to fight off the Nephilim (cat people who hold a grudge against all humans for being sent down to Avernum) and the Sliths (lizard men, apparently native to Avernum, and most of them crave human flesh.)The gameplay is exellent.  At the beginning of the game, you create a party.. your people can be whatever class you want, or 'custom'.  You spend a lot of your time walking around as a party, talking to people, getting quests, learning about the world, etc.. there are blacksmiths and such in every town, to buy equipment from.  There are secrets to find, and plenty of loot to pick up..  When you're not in a town or dungeon, you'll be on the overworld, where everything is zoomed way back.  You can encounter enemies, special events, and other stuff out on the overworld.. and of course also travel from place to place.  The overworld is pretty darn big, and there are a lot of places to go.When in combat, the game turns turn-based..  You move and attack with your characters one at a time.. Each character has a certain amount of AP to move with, and are allowed to attack once, or cast 1 spell per turn.. It's simple, but not TOO simple.  It has a good flow, without sacrificing too much strategic depth.When you level up, you're able to assign attribute points, improve your skills on the skill tree, and sometimes pick a new perk/feat as well.  Pretty basic leveling up, but again simple/basic isn't a bad thing.  The game manages to do a lot with what seems like simple mechanics.The main thing that will be an issue for some is that the graphics look very dated... and I'm sorry to repeat the same thing everyone else says, but here it goes... Graphics aren't important.  Maybe it's different for people not old enough to have grown up with older-looking graphics, but it doesn't bother me.  Sure, I like a pretty-looking game from time to time.. but it's really not a requirement for me.. but, of course, not everyone will agree.  Everybody has thier own opinions.. so take a look at the screenshots.  If it looks unbearable to you, don't get it.  If you think you can put up with oldschool graphics in order to play an amazing game, get it. Anyway, I feel like I've written a much longer review than most people will bother to read, so I'll cut it short here.  Thanks for reading.			"

												Addendum: As of Nov 2016, I nominated Avernum for the “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Award.Second remake of the classic Exile series' first part, Avernum: Escape From the Pit is classic roleplaying at its best! Basically, you play as a party of adventurers, who were exiled into a huge cavern, Avernum, far below the surface of the world. You have to find a new purpose here, which basically means doing all kinds of odd-jobs and quests for mayors, wizards and kings of the underworld and, while you're at it, trying to escape your dark prison.The controls have been streamlined for the 2010s. Like in Avernum, the first remake, the game is still isometric and tile-based. However, you can finally control the characters efficiently with a mouse. This works splendidly, though the controls have frankly lost some of the function of the earlier games: e.g. you can no longer close doors (unless I've yet to discover how). Also, the pathfinding algorithm does some weird stuff sometimes when your preferred path is blocked, making characters run into wrong direction (and at worst, their DOOOOM). There's still no music (except in the title screen and the few cut scenes): use your favorite epic adventure music instead.Skill system has basically been remade, though the comedic art of the skill descriptions has been appreciatively retained. Skills are now learned in trees, with a basic skill in the bottom and every subsequent skill requiring the below skills before they can be developed. Also, characters gain bonus traits every few levels gaining small bonuses to different skills and stats. It's a matter of taste if these are good or bad changes, but the whole works nevertheless quite fine.Combat has always been a rather important part of Avernum series. Turn-based, the basics are still there. However, some additions and changes have been made. Warriors have gained special skills called battle disciplines to supplement their fighting ability, making them a bit more interesting and tactical than before. Spells have been remade as well since original Avernum. Particularly, all the blessings and curses have become area effects, and multi-hit spells are now cone or area attacks instead of simply hitting a number of targets.Frankly, the hard-coreness of the series has dulled quite a bit with this latest installment. No longer are the dark dungeons truly dark, as you don't benefit from bringing a torch or casting light spells (which were actually removed altogether). There is no need to eat to satisfy hunger nor deal with dangerous diseases, and death is no longer so much a set-back as party is automatically resurrected and healed at a friendly town, removing the need for inns and renting rooms. You may no longer jump down ledges (which was never that healthy anyway). Identification of magical items has also been removed (albeit hilariously explained by ""adventurers having better training nowadays""), and potion making has become a trade secret of alchemists, so your party can't learn it itself any longer. Spiders no longer say ""hi!"" in a high-pitched voice audibly. Along with these changes Avernum has lost part of its legacy and spark.What is left, however, is an excellent RPG adventure in a unique fantasy world. The streamlining makes the game more accessible and lets the player concentrate on what's really important: dialogue, exploration and questing. And their implementation is simply brilliant. There are tens, if not hundreds, of characters in the game who all have their own dialogue trees, and several tens of dungeons and towns to explore, everyone of them extremely detailed. Enemies are still dangerous, and mini-bosses and bosses are refreshingly difficult to beat.Game is not only high-quality, for there's also quite a lot of it. My first play-through, on Hard difficulty level, lasted about 80 hours. Want to just experience the story? Play on Normal or even Casual difficulty, and you may even change it mid-game. However, the highest difficulty level, Torment, provides an amply named challenge for an experienced player, requiring advance planning and lots of re-exploring in areas that were previously too dangerous. Seriously though, I recommend playing your first game on Hard difficulty at max, as Torment can get tedious if you don't know where to go for the next admissible challenge.TL:DR?Excellent dialogues.Robust tactical combat.Addicting exploration.Epic questing to become true heroes.Not convinced? You may as well give it a try.The demo is available at http://www.avernum.com/avernum/index.html, letting you play through, I believe, about one third of the full game.			"

												I love this game more than most people love their children. I carry pictures of Avernum around in my wallet.This game used to be called Exile, and I was obsessed. I was a nerdy fat kid with a bowl cut and poor social skills. This game was my happy place. It's funny and clever, well-written, in-depth. No loose ends, no DLC, no fear. Unless you cast a fear spell. Then there is fear.If you like RPGs and you support Indie studios, please buy this one, pretty please. They are a husband & wife team who had a staff as small as three people to make what has become one of the most epic series of games I've ever encountered. Not only that, but I remember them being so nice and helpful when I was a kid and writing them to ask questions about their game. There was no Google. Mind you, this was during a time when MYST had a pay-to-ask hotline, so it was a BIG DEAL that they got in touch. Oh, the nineties.Don't expect flashy graphics or quick-time events. This is 2D and it's pretty straightforward. There are no cutscenes. Don't expect lazy gameplay where everything is spelled out. Death is unavoidable. SAVE & be prepared with a notebook.Do expect one of the best, most engrossing, most interesting games of all time. You've been exiled into an underworld full of magic, strange beasts, and those noisy things I try to avoid all the time. You know the ones. People. They need things killed, items fetched, and hugs. Hugs with swords and screaming and demons. And also that mage was on fire when I got here.You'll get out of it what you put into it. Use your imagination and memory for once, oh and also it wouldn't kill you to shower and shave and call your mum.			"

												In today's day and age, Spiderweb Software's games may seem like a novelty, but make no doubt that for the right audience they are exceptionally good games that offer a lot of bang for their buck. Avernum: Escape From The Pit is a modernized version of the Avernum series, and while the graphics are still not flashy the game more than makes up for it with good writing and solid turn based combat.The game is a text heavy one, a blessing or a curse depending on the person playing. The writing is stellar and coupled with the low-key graphics it's one of the few games where you can really use your imagination if you so wish. It is worth noting that Avernum is an open-world RPG, so while I say the writing is stellar, don't expect a centralized story with deep characters--that's not what this game is. The game itself takes place in a huge underground cave complex, a joy for those like me who like underground fantasy settings and even for those who don't should still appreciate the unique and interesting world Avernum presents.Avernum is lengthy, but if it's your type of game it will feel just right, making it a great game to pick up if you're on a budget. One playthrough alone will take  about seventy to eighty hours if you are a semi completionist, and even if you aren't I would wager it would take a good fifty hours to beat. Throw in harder difficulties and achievements and you can easily extend that playtime twofold.The combat is fairly atypical for a turn based game, but by no means bland. Each ally/enemy gets one turn per round and there are different types of characters your party can contain (priests, mage, etc.). The game is open world as mentioned and it lets you explore the world on your own, the game guides you very loosely but the bulk of the exploration is up to you to do. As thus, you can easily find yourself faced off against baddies that are higher level than you which can keep the game challenging even on normal difficulty.Open world exploration in the deep caves of Avernum mixed with some awesome writing and very interesting in-game encounters made this game a blast, but one of the things I liked most was how seamlessly the keyboard was integrated into the game. With the exception of needing to use my touchpad to click on a few interactive objects in the game world and assigning character stats/equipping items, just about everything you need to do in-game can be done with just the keyboard. Conversations, looting, fighting, moving--can all be done with the keyboard. If you're playing at home on your desktop, this may not mean much, but if you want to play this on a laptop without a mouse handy, this game is the one. Very few RPGs can be played on low-end laptops and even fewer can be played without a mouse, but Avernum is perhaps the only game I've played that's required mouse/touchpad input so sparsely. I feel like I could have enjoyed an amazing RPG experience from any Spiderweb game, but this one stands out to me due to the stellar keyboard integration.			"

												======================================Avernum: Escape From the Pit(Read on for the full review!)======================================Spiderweb Software, creator of the ""Exile"" series took the PC RPG template of the time and ran with it, allowing players to control multiple party members and customize their growth, exploring a vast underground world with a surprisingly intricate story. Avernum: Escape From the Pit is essentially a remake of the original Exile game of the same name. Escape From the Pit has been given a graphical overhaul, utilizing the isometric view used in the Avernum games released most recently by Spiderweb Software. The remake changes more than just the graphics, however, and the result is a game that is both the same and quite different from the original.======================================Pros+ Old School style CRPG with plenty of replay value.+ Game-play: Explore the open world as you please and do it at your own pace.+ Really good lore for the game world+ A ton of sights to see!+ Engaging storyCons- The UI is clunky and the character sheet & Inventory is annoying at times!Neutral+/- Doesn't hold your hand at all. (This is a good thing to me)======================================IntroductionThe Avernum series is based in Avernum, a subterranean nation far under the surface of the world. The surface is ruled by the Empire, a single, monolithic power under the command of the cruel Emperor Hawthorne.Everyone on the surface who speaks out, rebels, or doesn’t fit in is sentenced to life imprisonment in Avernum. Prisoners are expected to die, the victim of starvation, horrible monsters, or simple despair.The Avernum series tells the tale of the Avernites' struggle to survive, avenge themselves upon the Empire, and win both freedom and a return to the surface world.======================================Game-playAvernum: Escape from the Pit is a single-player role-playing video game. The player controls a group of up to four adventurers, who can use melee weapons, missile weapons, magic, or a mix of these skills to defeat opponents.One of the better aspects of this game is the opportunity to customize your adventuring party. Whether you want to have a balanced group featuring every type of character or whether you instead choose to enter battle with an entire team of tanky sword-wielding knights; the game accommodates your decision. You are also allowed to select an image avatar for each of your heroes (whether it fits their class or not is up to you). That having been said, classes make relatively little difference in your characters' long-term potential, as every character can learn every spell and ability regardless of their class. The way this works is that requirements to wield spells are determined by the stats and skills that you develop for a character - meaning that you can choose to make your units as specialized or balanced as you please. Fan of sword-wielding battle mages who can heal their team in a pinch? Not a problem. Want to throw in a super-defensive tank that will soak up damage and demand enemies' attention? Easy. Escape From the Pit allows for such customization without over complication. A downside to this is the risk that characters will become a little generic, but the multitude of customizable aspects (stats, skills, spells, and ""traits"", which function as passive boosts to a character's stats or abilities) help to ensure each of your units is a unique personality.Escape From the Pit offers several difficulty levels, as well as the ability to adjust the difficulty at any time during your game. This might come in handy depending on how quickly you want to beat Escape From the Pit, because often you will find that enemies are just too difficult and you need to go grind somewhere else before advancing to where you want to go. Yes, Escape From the Pit does involve a lot of grinding in dungeons, but Spiderweb Software has done a great job making this experience far less tedious, with diverse and well-designed environments that often use interesting tricks to create light puzzle elements. The world of Avernum is by no means boring and progressing through the game is both fun and challenging.All things said, it seems there's a lot beneath the surface here, with plenty of things to see and do that will keep you adventuring for many hours.======================================GraphicsIf you're looking for up-to-date, modern graphics, you might as well stop reading now. Avernum utilizes 2D graphics in an isometric view, reminiscent of the original Diablo. Obviously this makes the whole thing look quite dated. If you aren't immediately turned off by that, then let me assure you that you will probably love this game. Noticeably improved even over those of the most recent Avernum titles are the character portraits, which are in fact quite beautiful. Otherwise, the graphics are essentially identical to those of recent Avernum titles, reflecting Spiderweb's low priority on steady advancement in that area. This is something important to know because Escape From the Pit is a game that will polarize RPG players depending on how important visuals are to them.======================================ConclusionOverall, Avernum: Escape From the Pit is a solid RPG experience that combines classic style, a compelling story, and generous content to create an indie game that is very much worth your time. If you're looking for a complex single player RPG and value content at the expense of visuals, don't miss this title.======================================			"

												Avernum: Escape from the Pit is a fantastic '90s era single player turn based RPG that draws from the best the decade had to offer. RPGs thrived in the 1990s, and for good reason. Games like Avernum (when released in 1995, it was called Exile: Escape from the Pit) aimed to get their player lost in an intriguing world for hours upon hours, leveling up characters, exploring an in-depth story and learning about the game world from multiple NPCs with varying opinions on the world around them, and finding hundreds of secrets (yes, hundreds). These RPGs were made by developers with imaginations that were close to perfection, back when people made games because they loved games and sharing fantasy game worlds they'd created with others, not simply making them to drain wallets and hearts.The game starts out after your party of characters (which you customize, of course) are thrown into the deep abyss known as Avernum. Avernum is a series of underground caverns that serves as its own subterranean nation far beneath the surface of the world, and is the trash bin that the powerful Empire uses to throw away people who speak out against its rule on the surface. It is effectively a prison, where you are locked away from sunlight and the surface forever--unless you plan to do something about it. It is here where the Avernum series distinguishes itself from many other RPGs. Although Avernum is not a dungeon crawler by genre, it has that feeling of isolation, desperation. You want to get OUT of this underground prison, and the injustices made against you and others you meet in Avernum make you yearn for revenge. Avernum is one of the few fantasy worlds with a dystopian feel; the Empire is this world's Big Brother, and you have the ability to get your revenge, try to escape, or even accept your fate and learn to embrace Avernum. (And thus, this gives you three separate ways to beat the game through various questlines.)This is not a mindless RPG. Don't go into this game desiring mindless fun, for you will have to read quite a bit, manuever Avernum's cave systems via map systems, and retain information about quests, as the game doesn't hold your hand with doing so. The game does have a journal system that is VERY nice for its time; when you're speaking to an NPC who says something worth noting, you can ""record"" their speech with the click of a button, so you can pull this up at any time. This comes to be very useful, as quest notes don't update as you progress through a quest, so it's up to you to pay attention and know what the next step is. Despite all this, Avernum stays very much so to the right side of the line when it comes to tedium. I encountered no game-breaking quests during my playthrough like I have with other RPGs of the time (Divine Divinity, I'm looking at you, though I love you so). It IS possible to kill NPCs that you'll need for certain questlines, though the other questlines are still available, and there is also a cheat system to help you through this as a last resort (just look up your problem online). I think the best thing about this game is just how interesting it is. I love RPGs because I like escaping to a different world for a bit and getting lost in its complexities; I also love exploring and finding secrets, new towns, or a hidden area of a map. This game has that, and its story makes it even more worth finding those extra tidbits. This game has so much to do and so much to explore that it has what I like to call ""Skyrim syndrome"", where sometimes you'll look at your quest log and weep at all you've failed to complete. If throwing yourself into a world is what you're into, I can think of few better worlds than Avernum.I personally give this game a rating of 9.5/10. This is a must have for RPG fans and fans of games from the 1990s in general, back when games threw themselves at you with days worth of content with a grin that said, ""I dare you."" This is a game that you will work hard to conquer, a game that will make you feel liberated when you beat it, and a game that will be a source of fond memories for years to come.			"

												At first you might be 'revolted' by the dated graphics.  Then you might laugh at some 1990ish  RPG your looking at.  Force yourself to put at least a couple of hours into it and soon you will find yourself hooked.  You got the crapiest equipment starting out and you will have to earn what you keep to survive.  No freebees like modern games throw at you like candy at a parade.  You will respect your CRPG awesomeness by giving this game a chance  and then seeing if you got it to survive escaping the underdark to the surface!  Good luck you will enjoy the  journey!!!			"

												I recommend this game for true fans of Role Play. If however your take on a RPG is Diablo or Torchlight, forget it.There is probably more storyline in this small download than in the entire Skyrim. There are many long hours of play ahead. I did a restart about 2/3 of the way through as my party was not strong enough and I had not distributed t6he party stats well, combined I have nearly spent as many hours now on this game as I did with DragonAge inquisition.Despite the old school graphics there is quite variety of terrain to explore.The character development is good and straddles the boundary between too simple or too complex well. I suggest you pay attention to creating a balanced party, which is also an area that I feel could be improved. It is too easy to create parties that will simply not work. Having a bow user sounds great, but the game is heavily weighted to swords.Another area which could be improved is the character conversation scripts. Old storylines do not disappear and too often you get into a dialogue that you have already been through a million times before with the NPC – it is almost as if the same people that wrote the  NPC scripting for Divinity Original Sin did this one too.

												Avernum is right in your wheelhouse if you like games like Baldur's Gate and Divinity and are looking to experience that old school pen-and-paper RPG experience. I have not played all the rest of the games in the series and do not feel that I must in order to enjoy it on this one. Don't expect stellar graphics, but do expect everything else- like great game mechanics, a solid loot system, compelling story (with admirable writing skill), and a giant world to get lost in. I have yet to finish it yet, but from the first handful of quests, I know I am hooked well enough to come back to it. Another great thing about this game is it takes up less than 200 mb of space and has ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly low system requirements, so it even  plays on the ancient technological relics I keep around due to lack of having a proper gaming laptop to tote about. This game is also pretty nifty on iOS.Anyhoots, I don't feel hasty in reccomending this.			"

												I really enjoy this game. It is a turn-based, isometric view (Diablo-style view looking down from above), single-player fantasy roleplaying game. Let me break that down:Turn-Based: While not in combat you move your party around exploring wilderness, dungeon, and city environments and interacting with various friendly and hostile NPCs (non-player characters controlled by the computer). When battle starts, the game goes into turn-based mode. People who like the fast and furious action of real-time games like Diablo might find turn-based combat to be slow and tedious. I like it because I can let my attention wander if need be or even walk away for a restroom break right in the middle of battle. It also allows for the formulation of tactics based on the battlefield conditions.Isometric View: Many RPGs in the 90s used isometric view. The view is from above and slightly at an angle like the Diablo games. It's nice because you get a kind of ""god's eye view"" of the game area.Single-Player: There is no multiplayer option for Avernum: Escape From the Pit.Fantasy Roleplaying Game: The environment is traditional ""Western medieval style fantasy"" (i.e., swords and armor and spells and fantasy monsters). There is a bit of a twist in that the game opens up with your being exiled via magic teleportation to a supposedly inescapable underworld where criminals and political prisoners are sent when they cause problems for the Empire.You can choose from a number of traditional classes (sorcerer, warrior, rogue, berserker, priest, etc.) or you can create your own classes. The pre-made classes are merely certain selections from the game's many abilities, skills, and powers available to characters both when they are created and as they level up. Selecting a pre-made class does not pidgeon hole your character because as you level up you can choose to improve any abilities, skills and powers.There are multiple difficulties to choose from ranging from beginner to nightmare. You can even change difficulty whenever you wish. So things are going to easy? Notch up the difficulty. Getting frustrated by how hard the play is? Notch it down.For $10 you absolutely cannot go wrong. This is a fantasy RPG in the tradition of 90s games. I used to play the SSI gold box D&D computer games and Avernum is a great game in the same tradition.			"

												This is the second remake of the classic ""Exiled"", first made in the nineties by a two-person team. The game has been streamlined, interface made usable, and the graphics have improved (relatively speaking) since then, but much of the core draw (and mechanics) are still there.If you're someone who enjoys having wide open spaces, no demand to go down any particular linear plotline, and plenty of rewards for kicking over ever rock to see what wriggles out from underneath, this game has plenty of delicious exploratory goodness for you.That said, I'm not as fond of the skill trees they've put in the new version of the game as the older point-buy system they had before. The point-buy system hypothetically allows for nigh-infinite varieties of hybrid characters, but largely forces characters into one of four types of characters: Melee Fighter, Ranged Fighter, Wizard, and Cleric. ""Thief"" is just someone who puts points into Tool Use, and you need Tool Use (there's no magic for opening doors without it) but there's nothing stopping any other sort of character from taking Tool Use, and the game only checks total party Tool Use skill levels, so it's easy to distribute. (No dedicated thief necessary.) You COULD use a ranged fighter, but melee combat is forced upon you fairly often, and you'll want a dedicated sword user and spear user to make use of the best weapons, anyway. You're forced into making a character dedicate themselves to a given path by the nature of the skill tree: The high-tier skills like Riposte (counter attack chance) or Lethal Blow (critical hit power up) require plugging an equal or greater amount of points into the lower skills on the tree. Your Combat Disciplines (special abilities for fighters) are based upon total base weapons skill, and you'll want to put your attribute points into Strength or maybe Dexterity. Keeping up with magic spell tiers demands you stick points into a single base magic skill at least every other level, and dumping nearly all your points into Intelligence, and a couple into Endurance for the HP to not die in one hit. Hence, no matter what, you pretty much always wind up with sword fighter, spear fighter, cleric, and wizard. Hypothetically, there's bows and thrown weapons, but there are no good bows, and decent thrown weapons are too rare to use as a primary weapon. There are some choices to be made (going for criticals versus riposte) but mostly, it devolves into putting all your points into the core sklls because on the harder difficulties, you'll miss every time if you don't plug every point you can into accuracy-boosting skills, and a melee tank needs all the hardiness they can get to survive. Likewise, wizard and cleric accuracy (yes, AoE spells miss) depend upon base magic skill, and base magic skill ALSO ups damage. Hence, there's no reason not to put points in every single level. It's really only a question of whether you need more damage-dealing skills or damage-resistance skills at a given level to survive, espeically on higher difficulties, and the number of utility skills like tool use or cave lore you need is surprisingly low, meaning you basically always put points into the same dedicated ""purist"" build all the time. It leaves one underwhelmed with the potential for customization.In the original Avernum series, it gave you more points each time you leveled, but the costs of skills rose as you purchased more ranks in those skills, meaning that there was more possibility to ""multi-class"", as a skill you dedicated points into every level would rise as fast as the skill points you gained per level, while skills you neglected would become relatively cheaper by comparison. This meant it was easily possible to make a wizard who studied enough cleric magic to be a passable backup healer and a truly excellent wizard while the cleric was a passable archer. Without the chance to really multi-class, you'll probably find that you're left with the same party time and again, as you're probably not going to want to play this game without a cleric or wizard, and you'll NEED a meat shield. Since this is the umpteenth trip to Avernum for some of us, playing the same party with the same character sprites in areas modeled on the same locations can give old hands a bit of deja vu all over again.It is, yes, possible to play solo, and you'll want to generalize a little more in solo play, but even that kind of comes down to playing a wizard with some melee skill and a few healing spells. Also unlike this game's predecessor, this game starts you off in a small dungeon for a minor tutorial on the basics, but quickly lets you roam as a free-range adventuring band. A few easily-dismissed text boxes shouldn't annoy veterans, but might help new players, so it's not a bad change. That said, I suggest new players save frequently, and have several ""safe zone"" saves, as they can easily bumble into more trouble than they can fight their way out of with no guard rails to keep them from merrily adventuring into danger out of their depth. All the time and money they saved not going for pretty graphics (and if you're a Spiderweb fan, you'll recognize the reuse of a LOT of those graphics,) was put into making absolutely sprawling caverns. For those of you who lamented Elder Scrolls' Oblivion/Skyrim's rubber-banded monster levels, rejoice as well, as the sliths just a few towns west of where you start WILL shishkebob you effortlessly. On the higher difficulty levels, this can curb your exploration somewhat, but with a mere 350 coins, you can buy a boat that lets you have access to a large portion of the map, so long as you don't mind having to hide from the fights. While not being able to fight something sounds limiting, you can gain access to spells early, which makes it worth the trip.That said, there's still a few places you have to go, and a pretty clear order in which you have to go there. While it's hypothetically possible to do sequence breaks, steep ramping of the power of enemies means that, especially in higher difficulty settings, there's little capacity for a player to bypass one major dungeon and be prepared for the next.Because you have access to all the spell trainers early (just have to dodge the monsters bigger than you) you can easily get spells meant for late-game early, but at the same time, you can't afford them. Spells cost 2000 coins to learn, and clearing a whole dungeon and selling absolutely everything only nets you 1000 coins... It doesn't really get better as you go on, either, until you've bought all your skill-ups, and then there's nothing left to buy at all. I've never seen a reason to buy potions or scrolls or even weapons, as, while some mid-level stuff is available in stores, by the time you can afford them, you have better artifact weapons you lifted off of corpses. Potions can be brewed from infinitely-respawning herb patches for free, so there's at least reason to use those. Also, you ram through MP quickly in this game, especially later on, but just setting foot in town restores all HP and MP for free... You have skills to reduce MP use, but why use them when you need every skill point in magic power to survive a single fight, and can just go back to town for a refill after literally every fight? There are a handful of dungeons where you do have to ""fight your way back out"" (monsters spawn in after you get to the end of the dungeon), but it's rare enough that you shouldn't have trouble sitting on a pile of 30 magic potions to refill between fights if you really need it.If you're at all interested in the genre, it's dirt cheap and provides easily 100 hours of gameplay.

												This game used to be a charming experience where magic, fighting bows and fantasy came together in a unique way. The game is far butchered now compared to it's older version. Before: Up to three levels of spells in both priest and mage classes so that you can indulge in a magic fantasy playing the game. With secrets at every turn for your wizard to decode and dangerous territory where they have to show their wit in using their magic to upgrade their arsenal and using it creatively to beat the lords of magic themselves, the slitheraki or however you spell that...Now: Even with three levels of spells you are limited to 5 spells either mage or priest. Mages might as well be replaced with archers until you find a spell that can hit more than one target. Priests are nice for minor heal but cannot bless the party for a long time. Now:Speaking of buying, selling and upgrades... nothing you get from battles is worth anything... There are times that have values that shops will not take anywhere. Items worth 240 suddenly worth 6 in a shop...Before:Things costed alot but you could sell items during battle, find money and not [5 coins] per 3 mobs or even find loot that is an upgrade to what you had without going into their preset dungeons. Before:A game about survival where your party had to eat in order to sustain themselves so sleeping outdoors while sometimes bad was a way of hunting AND healing your party. If you didn't play this well, you'd end up with having to remake characters you put time into because they died. [Unless you found/decoded a high level revive spell]Now:The revive spell is in the game but... what's the point!? You can walk into town and get free heals. ""Survival"" You don't need to eat anything. The food items aren't even worth picking up, they heal you for garbage amounts. Speaking of which rather than enriching their item pool and allowing you to diversify how you play, they've just created more garbage for you to pick up. Before:The game was hard but you could select information out of conversations you had with people in order to find interesting things to do and tidbits of information. The quests that you took up on your own accord were the experience to level up your party and when you came back to claim the gold reward after barely surviving that was the icing on the cake.Now:THe quests give experience because the mobs sure don't give enough. You are forced into conversations where you have pre-established answers which sound nothing like what you'd even ask about in a conversation to the point where it makes you seem really naive or stupid. Hell half of the information you can ignore and walk into who needs conversations anyway. Also they'll mark it on the map for ya, no need to explore or be a cartographer. Before: Having useful skills in and out of combat was possible and while not needed sometimes made the return to civilization what little you got pretty fun.Now:Some things are taken out because during a level up you really don't get all that much to train yourself. It's probably due to the fact that the items and money drops from mobs are garbage because in the old Exile you had to not only have leveled up to train and allot points, you also had to pay for the training. Now you somehow train yourself cuz you know everything you just don't have ""EXP"" and only casters suffer the need of learning from someone else.Before:Armor reduced damage, better armor reduced it better. These were flat amounts. You still needed hp, magic doesn't care about your armor and the strongest foes can use magic that you like to use all the time!Now: Enemies don't need to use magic to overwhelm you because armor only increases the damage you reduce by a percentage. So rather than buying something nice to actually protect yourself it's more like you will always take damage from a foe but can lower it somewhat. Mind you that healing in battle either cost money [which you won't have] via potions or mana [which cannot be healed outdoors or in dungeons even by waiting in safe areas that you've explored and mapped like a smart survivor.] Exile used to be a brutal game where you felt like you were thrown down the pit and each battle brought you closer to your goal of getting out. This version either you play at a low difficulty and give yourself a yawn fest or you play at a high difficulty and wonder why you play. This isn't one of those ""Strategizing rpgs"" at that point, it becomes a luck and trial game because the game cannot sustain itself. I did play it on the strongest difficulty but that's because I played it before expecting the same fun gameplay with a tough twist. Instead the gameplay is boring and now feels like a rip off of newer games. [Questing for exp, dumbed down,  does not self sustain, barely on topic, pompous pretending to make something hard with modes when it's just a percentage modifier to things that are there already... Give me back Exile. I am glad I only bought Avernum for 3 bucks but it really wasn't worth that either!]Also for those who get a tiny bit in... Spray acid...			"

												Avernum is a classic old school RPG. The game is massive, with lots of dungeons, encounters, towns and quests. Expect to drop 40+ hours completing it, if not more. There are multiple endings, and lots of plot. All in all, if you like detailed turn based RPGs in the classic mode, this is absolutely a game for you. on top of that, the low cost makes it an excellent buy, especiall considering the amount of time a playthough of this game can take.

												You have to like old school dungeon crawlers to appreciate the game. Having said that it was everything an old school RPG game should be about. I'm a bit of a 1-time-pass-thru-completionist (rather than quick finish to replay for alternative paths) and  I got almost everything done in 187 hrs. There was only a few times I felt it was tedious play and that was with the friggin horrible ""lights go out, so you must click millions off times to move inches"" periods. The game does have a few minor bugs, like some times in teleporting your party members can end up inside room objects and freezes game for reload and if you happen to double click when casting sometimes your party members cast fake spells and move (when not supposed to move at all) so wasted turns can happen in middle of battles. BUT even with those minor bugs, the game was so fun and challenging I didnt mind over looking them. Newer more expensive games with better graphics have been doing much worse lately. Just suggestion, but go into settings and set party to move in fast mode or you might want to kill them yourself waiting to move very far! I'm definitely a fan of Spiderweb after this intro and I've already purchased x3 more Avernums based off this one. If that helps you decide in a purchase.			"

												This is a game for those who want to experience the nostalgic turn-base RPG.  For those familiar with Ultima IV (1985 release), Avernum will bring back those fond memories.  In Escape from the Pit, you control up to four party members who have been banished from the Empire.  From that seed, the storyline will grow.  Since this is a relaunch of the Avernum series, the graphics are kept simple, but effective and plays efficiently on much older systems.  Combat is turn-base with turns accomplished sequentially by intitiative and party order.  The story is interesting with plenty of side quests and dungeons/caves to crawl around and explore.  There is plenty of content since as of this review, I'm over 12 hours in and have covered around 1/3 of the map.Bottom line is that this is a fun turn-base RPG.  It's a must for the fans of Ultima IV.			"

												Avernum: Escape from the Pit is an old-school isometric RPG the style of Ultima 6 and 7, Planet's Edge and similar games. While graphics are old-school, this actually adds to the game's retro-charm, and gives the game's mystic underworld a great atmosphere. There is a HUGE underworld to explore, MASSIVE amounts of NPCs and locations, and HOURS UPON HOURS of gameplay. This is essentially Ultima 6 or 7 done today, with an even bigger world and much more to do, as well as enormous attention to details.If you liked Ultima 6 and 7, or even Baldur's Gate and Fallout, this is teh game for you.Highly recommended!

												I've played through this game three times, and each time I tried to convince myself that I enjoyed overly simplistic D&D type knock offs. I think for me the biggest reason I don't recommend this game is that the skill system is useless, and really you're going to end up structuring your party the same vanilla way (warrior, mage, rouge, healer) no matter what your personal style is. I tried doing 3 warriors and a healer and ended up struggling at the end despite being ""overleveled"". I tried doing only ranged/mage and found myself in situations where the maps were very clearly not laid out with any sort of thought to tactical retreating.There's also no real story behind much of the game. Which, for D&D clones where the whole point is dungeon crawling a good story and redeem most bad mechanics. It's really you just make your way across the map and kill stuff for people as quests. Even the mainstay of fetch quests are really more like ""go clear this castle the thing I want is at the top"" style of quest than anything else. Combat is bland. Turn based with speed modifiers. AoE spells are extremely overpowered in basically every situation. Mobs love to aggro from ridiculous distances and you can easily end up fighting a whole floor at once when somebody sees your party through a wall and picks up 20 or so friends on the roundabout way to join the fight. Equipment is a joke. Your whole party will most likely end up wearing the same set of steel armor -- even my mages did -- because of how broken the skill system is. With nearly 60 hours of game play there is nothing memorable about any of it other than my annoyance that there are two places where you can actually get stuck with no way out and I managed to find both of them. There's not really any redeeming qualities about this game, it's a bland D&D clone that's entirely unmemorable.Pros+ 8 hours of playtimeCons- No story- Skills don't work right- Little realistic customization - Illogical pathfinding			"

												With fully turn-based cRPG gameplay, low end audio & visuals (many recycled from other Spiderweb games), and a fairly traditional fantasy setting one would think this doesn't have much to offer.  For many gamers that may be correct, but I'm from the DOS era and can easily enjoy games with poor production values but entertaining play.The basic story / setting involves an authoritarian government that banishes its malcontents to a massive cave system called Avernum where they are expected to suffer and die rather than sow discord among the surface dwellers.  Enough get banished in this way that, over the decades, a shaky civilization is formed.  Your band of up to four are thrust into this misery where you must learn to survive, and through many increasingly important deeds save Avernum from its many enemies and maybe earn vengeance for yourself & the thousands of other victims of cruel Hawthorne's empire.  This took me over 100 hours to complete (150.2 isn't accurate thanks to many breaks and distractions while running the game).While there are many rough edges (like targeting area effect spells and path-finding), my biggest complaint is that there is no way for players to add notes to their in-game journal and maps.  The auto-notes that are generated, while better than nothing aren't always up to the job, so if you don't have perfect memory be sure to keep a word document handy.My rating: 3.14159265359 (out of 4)			"

												Avernum: Escape from the pit is a remake of the first game in the Avernum series. It is a grid, turn based CRPG with sandbox elements.The plot is straight forward. On the surface there is the empire, ruled by the mad king hawthorn, a cruel dictator who rules with an iron fist. Those who go against the empire, or simply earn the ire of anyone in government, are tossed through a portal and left to die on the other side. The portal transports anyone who goes through it down to the depths of the planet, to a massive cave system with no hope of escape. So many people have been sent down there that they have begun to form their own nations as well, but, just because they are able to band together doesn't mean they are safe from the horrors that live down there with them. Your task as the newest exiles? Survive. Survive and do what you can for yourself, and for the underground nations.Gameplay is easy to understand. Everything is done on a square grid, from exploring the overworld to navigating in combat. Each character has four core stats, followed by talents, then perks. Each core stat effects an aspect of your characters growth. Strength determines how hard you hit with melee weapons and your characters carrying capacity, dexterity determines how likely you are to dodge attacks and how accurate you are with weapons as well as how much damage you deal with ranged weapons, endurance determines how resistant you are to certain status effects and how much health you have, and finally, intelligence determines how much mana you have, how powerful your spells are, and how resistant you are to magic.Every character has access to the exact same talent tree, allowing them to mix and match what skills they have to create whatever kind of character you want. Most of these talents are passive, but others grant active abilities which are worth investing into. You can put ten points into most talents, at which point you can't dump any more in, which is probably for the best considering at ten points in any skill, the bonuses are astounding. This really gives you the ability to build your own character however you want, from a long range crit machine, to a tank who casts spells.Then there are the perks, which give minor buffs to certain things, but can also have a pretty big impact on your character depending on which ones you pick. If you use summons alot, you can get a perk that makes them stronger, or if you want to cast more elemental spells, get the perk which makes them work as if they were a level higher.Combat works in terms of inititive, with the unit with the highest moving first, then the second highest going second and so on. Every unit has a set amount of time units to use during their turn, some actions costing more points than others. It might take one unit to move a single space, but ten to take an attack. You need to carefully position your characters and plan out what abilites your going to use on the many enemies you will encounter throughout your quests. Speaking of quests, you will encounter many on your travels, most of which are very fun. Granted, they can be as simple as ""clear out the fort"" or ""bring me five bear asses"", but few of the quests are exactly the same, and alot of them are actual, lengthy detours from the main quest lines. This really does help make the world feel that much more alive, which brings me to my next point.Avernum is a rather bland game visually. There are a few interesting things to look at here and there, but for the most part, you are inside a huge cave, with fungus growing around you. Thankfully, you start the game off with a world map, and they went out of their way to design the terrain so that its destinctive enough to be able to navigate based on land marks, like a river or an odd rock formation. While every dungeon uses alot of the same textures (in fact, most of the game does), each one is very different, This is because they designed them in very different layouts, with a wide enough variety of enemies to keep things interesting. The game has no music though, or voice acting, so bring your own music.With all this said, Avernum was an enjoyable experience for me, the only frustration i got was when i entered areas clearly too high a level for me or i missed that one hidden switch in the wall. The game does a great job of emulating the feeling of a Pen and Paper RPG, even allowing for player choice and, suprisingly, stupidity. It lets you ask really stupid questions, and the answers you'll normally get back can be equally as funny. I suppose thats what this game has, charm. While it isn't unique in terms of setting or has an overly deep, introspective, thought provoking plot. It does have alot of charm, a very well built combat system, a depressing, but hopeful and great plot, and a world that really inspires the desire to explore. The only limits are the walls of the cave. I would recommend this rpg to anyone who is a fan of old school rpgs, as well as people who enjoy newer things as well, as it has lots of familiar elements, while casting off some of the shackles older games have. If you are a fan of dungeons and dragons, or pathfinder, this is definitely an rpg you will enjoy, and possibly get some new ideas from.			"

												This is prehaps the best Dungeon Crawler/RPG (outside Legend of Grimrock, Dungeons of Dredmore) that Steam has to offer. It is easy to get into and hard to put down. What makes it so enjoyable is the non-linear progression of it all. You have a choice over everything, from doing quests to killing things. Your charators can be speced to your choosing. Want a warrior that hits like a truck and can shoot fireballs? You can do that! You want a rouge that can't be hit and is a master lockpick? You can!

												I am in between a rock and hard place for recommending or not recommeding this game. The original version (which was published 2000-2001 ish) was great for that time. But now I am not so sure, the first 10-20 hours are intriguing but after a while especially as the map expands you get bored of walking up and down on the map, in and out of dungeons etc. Nowadays turn-based RPG's present a more accessible gameplay, and very intuitive UI's. This lacks that modern touch but don't get me wrong it is not a bad or mediocre game. You can easily get carried away with the story and the atmosphere, especially if you are in for reading lore material. Just not for eveybody, thats all. If you like Baldur's Gate series, Arcanum and so on, you will most likely enjoy this one too. If you are a fan of Spiderweb Software already you probably didn't read this.

												Avernum Escape from the Pit is a shining example on how a game doesn't need to have amazing graphics (or even background music, for that matter) to create an amazing gaming experience. The game combines exploration, action point based combat, and a simple but surprisingly detailed storyline.After getting through the starting dungeon, you're thrust right into the middle of the Avernum, an underground world full of criminals of the surface Empire with no known means of escaping to the surface. You aren't given a central objective that the game forces you to persue throughout the game, and in fact, there are 3 different game-ending quests that you can complete. You're given the whole world to go through, and you can complete quests in any order you'd like (although some areas require certain items to access, like an orb that grants the power of flight). The towns and NPCs are colorful, although because of the nature of the game, there aren't too many NPCs with more than a few lines of dialogue.The combat system is simple, but offers plenty of options for tactical play. The system is action point based, and learning how to take advantage of it with abilities like Haste, Slow, Battle Frenzy, Sniping, and Adrenaline Rush is required to beat Avernum's greatest challenges. You also have to learn how to best make use of terrain, crowd control, and knockback abilites: moving through a space adjacent to an enemy uses up 4 of your action points instead of just 1, which allows you to set up choke-points to protect your weaker characters. Torment mode is particularly difficult, and because it's nearly impossible to power level (enemies in dungeons  rarely respawn), you're required to use every dirty trick you have available to win.Character development and levelling up is fairly basic. The party you play with has 4 members, all of which are created at the beginning of the game. You have 4 main stats (Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, and Intelligence, which do exactly what you'd expect), which go up slowly on their own, and you get 1 point to allocate yourself every level. You also get 2 skill points a level, which go into a branching skill tree which improves things like your casting power, ability to dodge, ability to unlock doors/disarm traps, and gather herbs. This means you aren't restricted to any particular archetypes or classes, and can develop your characters however you want (although certain hybrid character may not be the most effective in combat). You also get a trait every other level, which varies from making your character more likely to be attacked, to selling items for more money, to being able to cast spells in heavy armor. There's nothing about this that stands out immensely, but you are able to make a variety of characters.The game's graphics are somewhat mediocre, but it's not the focus of the game. There is also no background music in game, only ambient noises. Personally, it doesn't bother me much, but it could be jarring to others. While it should be the standard for games nowadays, I was impressed by how few glitches were in Avernum. Only 2 come to mind, and neither are game breaking (War Blessing only gives a 2% bonus instead of 10%, and targetted AoE spells have unlimited range if centered on an empty space). After the glitchfest of games like Fallout New Vegas, it's relaxing to see a game so free of crashes and progress halting glitches.Overall a fantastic game. I've probably put more time into Avernum than any other single player RPG (my 150 hours is from two separate playthroughs). It's simple, fun, and a great exploration experience.			"

												Pretty sure most people know what they're getting into by now with Spiderweb games.This is a remake of a remake, a turn-based, party RPG with an open world, tons of quests, and a legitimately interesting world and story.It's not going to change your life, but it will pass the time pleasantly to be sure.

												I am in between a rock and hard place for recommending or not recommeding this game. The original version (which was published 2000-2001 ish) was great for that time. But now I am not so sure, the first 10-20 hours are intriguing but after a while especially as the map expands you get bored of walking up and down on the map, in and out of dungeons etc. Nowadays turn-based RPG's present a more accessible gameplay, and very intuitive UI's. This lacks that modern touch but don't get me wrong it is not a bad or mediocre game. You can easily get carried away with the story and the atmosphere, especially if you are in for reading lore material. Just not for eveybody, thats all. If you like Baldur's Gate series, Arcanum and so on, you will most likely enjoy this one too. If you are a fan of Spiderweb Software already you probably didn't read this. Buy any Spiderweb Software game on sale if you can and if it is for your taste there are 10+ games from the same devoloper for you to enjoy.			"

												Okay so I'm pretty much hoping that my point gets across through my increasingly copious amounts of game time, considering I've had it for all of a week. If not, here's the gist of it. Spiderweb Software is an amazing company, and I originally discovered them through their Geneforge games. Now, I was skeptical when I first began playing Avernum because in my opinion it had a lot to live up to. I think I can now safely say that this is my favorite of all their games thus far. It is a remake of Avernum 1, which came out over a decade ago, and all it did was improve. Currently there is a gap in the story, because Avernum 3 has not yet been remade (though I assume you could go play the original) and so unless you're fine with skipping right over to 4, you'll just have to wait with bated breath.I know a few people who tend to ignore their games due to the admittedly strange graphics (how long can that man hold his arms like that, christ). While their portraiture and icons are very nicely done, they do skimp a bit in the 3D area, though I presume not for lack of trying. Having played a bit TOO many RPGs in days past I believe it to be somewhat nostalgic.In short, the story is amazing, the art ""antique"", and the replayability significant. If only we could port our endings to the next games. 9/10.			"

												A solid old-school RPG with beautiful retro graphics and emersive ambience.  It offers a huge underground world with plenty of events and creatures in it for you to explore. While the main story itself might not be that great and all. the side quests are usually fun and enjoyable. The game doesn't usually tell you exactly what to do next or where to find a certain item for a quest, and that, in my eyes is one of the reasons why old-school games are better than modern ones, in which all we do for side quests is go there and get that. the explore part is missing. In terms of character building and job skills, I think the game did ok, not great, but definately not bad either.So in conclusion if you are a retro rpg fan you should try it. If you are not, try it on a sale.			"

												Avernum: Escape from the Pit is overall a really solid RPG. It combines classic party-based tactical RPG combat with a large and deeply designed gameworld. The result is an expansive classic RPG with a modern user interface that is a delight to play. Combat is deep, but not slow or frustrating to go through. Dungeons are just the right length, with enough secrets to reward thoroughness and some backtracking. Character design is involving and interesting, with most character builds and party compositions working well. The presentation is functional, but for fans of CRPGs the breadth of gameplay will win you over.			"

												This is such a weird and lovely game. If you can get over the graphics and animations that are a few inches above the ASCII symbols of Dwarf Fortress and Nethack, you'll find a huge text-heavy RPG with a unique setting, hilarious writing (every innkeeper has some excuse as to why you can't get a room there) and a simple but efficient character stat system. There's goold old turn-based combat, tons of secrets and a lot of world map exploration with special events.The UI is kind of a pain in the butt (no automated inventory sorting, ESC to cancel out of spells / menus and pathfinding can be spotty) and the difficulty varies massively by area, with only a warning sign and NPC's advice separating you from having your legs removed by giant intelligent spiders. If you can live with that, it's a great rewarding title that perfectly captures the classic RPG feeling.			"

												If you have played western rpg games in the 80s and 90s such as Ultima I-VI , then this game is for you.  The graphics and gameplay will be just at home for you. Some people of the tablet generation may also find some interest, but it is like reading a book, you have immerse yourself before you can enjoy it, imagining what the world would be like if it was in the first person.  And like a book, this game offers a lot of dialog, though not quite a novel's worth.  This is not a game for somebody who can't play muds or needs a 3d world.  Also you can bork your characters by leveling up them wrong and their is no forgiveness*, if this is your first avernum game, use the guide on the forum.  Over all ifyou get past the hump, then you'll join the rest of us 100+ hour players.  If you can't , you'll be another person who puts it down after 20 minutes.  At least you'll qualify for a refund.*There is a character editor that can be enabled with a cheat code, but it can bork the game in the other direction.			"

												By the very end of Avernum I was ready for it to be over, having sunk a good 70 hours into it, but the majority of that time was very enjoyable.  It's pretty light on story and direction, and normally in large games without a story to hold my hand I wind up feeling a bit overwhelmed, but Avernum did a very good job in not making a big game ""too"" big.  The towns and world are the right size, and the packs of monsters you come across are challenging but never too much.  I also had quite a bit of fun hunting down caches and spell tomes, as a little extra something.The only real problem I had was that towards the end of the game it didn't feel like there was any character or story progression left to my character, just a lot of loose ends leading up to the three many ""winning"" scenarios.  That made the last 5-10 hours a bit of a drudge for me, as I no longer had talent points to spend or fun gear to acquire.  Still, well worth the price of admission.			"

												+ Quite a big world+ A lot to explore+ Considerable amount of content+ Simple yet detailed lore (easy to get into, interesting enough to dive deeper)+ Interesting NPCs+ Freedom right after the tutorial+ Character management is easy to deal with while still providing some depth+ Well presented battle mechanics- Interface is not practical enough- No crafting, yet a lot of lootable items that could be used as material- Making potions is a little complicated at first- Gear (both arms and armor) doesn't feel varied enough- You can't loot the bodies of fallen party members to use that resurrection potion you so desperately needVerdict: I'm a newcomer to old school sandbox RPGs and I think Avernum: Escape From the Pit was a very good start. EFtP is a reboot of a reboot and still presents some rough edges, but it's easy to get over them since most don't have a considerable impact on what the game is about: exploring, running quests, defeating foes and uncoverying lore. It brings more than enough content to justify its original price, being a bargain at a discount. Defintely worth it!			"

												First of all I must say I am a big fan of role play games, that I started back at the date with Eye of Beholder: I consider the top of the genre Baldur's Gate (the first one), and this is the first time I play an Avernum game; I was therefore completely new to the lore, mechanics and rules used in the game.From the beginning Avernum: Escape from the pit looks intriguing and catchy: from text to text and fight to fight, I found myself playing for 3-4 hours straight after installation without realizing it.The art and the drawing are inspiring, there is a lot of text that really make us feel the story and the lore, dialogs are brilliant; character creation and advancement, fightings, divine and arcane spellcasting: everything it is intuitive and somehow innovative, taking clear inspiration from old paper rpgs and fusing it with ""modern"" skill trees.Longevity also seems to be a strong point of this title: I played 4 hours and visited 3 cities, and I could understand from the world map how insignificant is the portion of underworld I explored so far.The only negative feedback some people might point out is graphics, and on this I completely disagree: it is a simple retro 2d graphic but is not bad at all: on the contrary it is clear and fluent, does not disturb the eye and does not require big machines to run.Also the music is fitting, with its epic tones: it is just a pity that there is not a bigger variety of tunes.All in all, I would recommend this game to all rpg fans and to all retro gamers, giving it a solid 8.5 out of 10. There are not many better roleplaying experiences than this one out there :)			"

												I played the earlier demo games way back in the day, and was excited to pick this up on sale.  On the whole I think it's a good game, and fun to play if you like 90s-style RPGs, especially for the fairly low cost.It's a big, open-world game with a significant number of quests and places to wander, and a sizable number of NPCs to interact with. The skills/traits and leveling system is fairly fun to play with. There are some issues that keep me from giving it a 100% positive review:1) If you play at higher resolution settings, it's going to be harder to see loot on the ground, and the numerous secret door switches that are pretty crucial for discovery and completing dungeons. But it will give you a better tactical view.2) Loot rewards are pretty flat - at level 30 (not technically a level cap, but more or less is one) I'm still using quite a bit of gear that dropped at level 5.3) The interface could be a bit better - different shortcuts to open/close windows is a minor annoyance4) Aesthetically isometric view is nice, but tactically it makes for some challenges, esp. since you can't rotate the camera. This can cause issues with moving if trying to fight tactically and occasionally targeting in combat. 5) You'll hit 30 before running out of content, at which point only a handful of fights will really be that challenging. Given that semi-tactical combat is one of the upsides, the game loses something when that's gone, though Grah-Hoth was a fun challenge.The biggest downside for me is really the quest log. The quests can really pile up, the log doesn't really track meaningful details, and quests can't be sorted or deleted.  Quests also stay in your log even when they can't be completed - a minor annoyance.The lack of detail wouldn't be quite as big a problem, except for the size of the game. Even playing a few hours daily, at some point you'll be working on a quest you picked up several days ago, with often minimal guidance on where you're at in the quest progression. Solving it in-game may require revisiting multiple towns and finding multiple NPCs who may or may not be mentioned in the text.  As the game went along I found myself using internet tips a bit more often because the fun of running back and forth between towns (even with a portal system running to about half of them) had waned.But on the whole it's a good game. I've put about 60 (mostly enjoyable) hours into it, and am only just past the first of 3 ""game ending"" quests.  It reminds me in some ways of a stripped-down Divine Divinity, which ironically I liked more but never finished.			"

												Let me begin... if you are not into reading lore, and saturating yourself with a game's story... you will be missing at least 50% of this game... and probably will not fully appreciate what this game has to offer.For every 5 minutes of battle, you will spend an equal amount, if not more, reading into the story, conversing with the various characters that inhabit Avernum, and learning about the land from pop-up descriptions.The skill-up system is nice. Though, classes are pretty linear. Mages mainly focus on mage, priest on priest, and so on. You won't really be seeing many priests dual wielding, or sword-and-board mages. BUT, you can really specialize in certain skills, so though, you can't really roam outside the realms of your specific class, you can specialize it pretty well.The combat is classic, old-school, turn-based goodness. The difficulty is decent. If you don't know how to play these types of games (learning to buff and debuff prior to battles, crowd control, and so on) this game will prove difficult. Once you get a hang of it, it becomes fun.AGAIN: If you are not a fan of engrossing yourself into lore, you will not get as much enjoyment out of this game as you could. IF you enjoy lore and character depth, you will thoroughly enjoy this gem.9/10 "

												I absolutely love this game.Spiderweb Software (one guy) writes amazing stories.I really can't believe I didn't review this before now.Okay, you see the graphics look ""nostalgic"" but if you either don't mind or even like the style, then you'll see the gameplay is solid and the story keeps you moving forward so you see what happens next. I can't recommend this enough, especially since it goes on sale all the time.If you're at all interested in this game, get it.The battles work as you expect for a turn based strategy game.As for leveling up: You aren't locked into ""classes"" you can mix and match and dabble into any abilities you want, but you'll be weaker than if you specialize. That being said, I put just enough to get my mage a healing spell ""just in case"". And ""just in case"" happens often enough for it to have been worth it.			"

												Great game.  Sure the graphics are quite dated, but I enjoy their charm.  As long as you enjoy very deep and sometimes unforgiving RPGs this is a must have. Character building is top notch and combat is strategic and engaging..  This version of the series is GREAT because it includes an in-game character editor/trainer.. So if you get to the late game and realize one of your party members is sub-par you can cheat and edit them a bit.. Which of course some purists would never do, but it does allow the gamer with little time on their hands to have a good time at such an unforgiving franchise.

												A great game for fans of old school d&d rpgs. This game really brings me back to the old Gold Box D&D pc games (Dark Queen of Krynn etc). In an era of very limited graphics those games brought large worlds with epic stories and solid d&d party building and tactics combat. The Avernum series of games continues in that style with a large world full of unique lore to discover. The character and skill system is not too complex but has enough options to keep fights challenging and requiring planning while focusing on exploration and the story instead of large stat sheets. Over the Avernum series you can see steady improvements in the ui, engine and balancing quests and this is the best one I've tried yet.			"

												Awesome open world, party focused, turn based RPG.  It has some of the usual flaws that come with most Spiderweb games: slightly cumbersome interface at times, a few too many trash mobs (which can become a tad annoying late game once you no longer need the experience for leveling) and the harder difficulties require a large amount of min/maxing to get by (which isn't a big deal on lower difficulties, but if you play on torment hybrid builds are basically ruled out if you want to survive).  But apart from these minor quibbles (and they are minor) this is really one of the better open world RPGs I've played in ages.  The world is massive and packed with detail so basically every nook and cranny has something to make it worth exploring, without any of the ""generic algorithm generated"" feeling you get from many open world games.  Well worth the 10 bucks.			"

												I spent hundreds of hours on the Exile series (yes, it's Avernum now... I'll accept that in another 20 years) in the 90s and loved every minute. I've picked up where I left off (after Blades), but the original should be commended for being an innovative gem.Party customization is fairly deep and allows for a wide variety of tactical strategies to fit individual play style. It's turn-based, so you can come and go as you please (save after combat). Exploration of hidden areas is rewarding and the non-linear questing (take your own approach, or even finish before picking them up) gives it a realistic touch. Graphics snobs--this might not be for you. As someone who started gaming with Pong, I can appreciate this restyled version of an old classic. This version seems to start off slightly less bleak--could be the additional color.I've always liked the developers, who are even friendlier than those spiders that think I'm cute.

												This has to be one of the most engaging games I have played in a long time. I have never played any of the previous games in the series but thought this one looked really interesting. It was very text heavy but it set the story, it set the world you were stuck in, it allowed you to get to know different characters and what they are going through. I wasn't at all bothered by the lack of music, if anything it really added to the desolate, barren feeling of the cave systems. I can definitely recommend this game to others. Give it a try :D.			"

												Almost 20 years and two remakes in, this game still rocks. If you can look past the graphics (which you should) and the odd clunky mechanic, this is a game that you will spend innumerable hours on. A vast (VAST!) world to explore with dozens, if not hundreds of secrets, a multitude of locations and quests, and three separate, intricate main plotlines make this game what I dare to call the Skyrim of isometric turn-based RPGs.

												This game just isn't for everyone.I'm sure it hits the right chord for some with gameplay harkening back to early PC dungeon diving, it didn't for me. The dated graphics leave something to be desired, the story is one that doesn't stand out and the gameplay is simplistic to a fault.I picked it up on the cheap during a sale just because it had a ""very positive"" rating on Steam so it was no big lost. There are just better titles out there I'd rather spend my few available gaming hours playing. "

												..I got this game cheap on a sale.  It looked like an old-school/tactical rpg blend (I didn't know it wasn't a new indie game) and thought ""the whole game takes place in a cave, that might be cool.""..I'm here to say it is cool...This is one of the few rpgs that actually make you feel ""This place is really interesting, I need to know more.""  At the same time, the writing does a great job of telling a story without making you read a novel.  ..There are random encounters that each feel unique.  Sometimes the enemies will flee and you can choose to cut them down or not.  Some goblins took up camp near a town.  I came up planning on killing them, but the game said they were poor and sad looking and that they didn't seem to be causing any harm.  I let them be and they're still there as far as I know...many of the mechanics are very unique (such as shared stats for things such as lockpicking).  The whole team's mechanical ability is taken into account.  Also secrets are hidden behind skills arcane lore and cave lore (also party cumulative)...Now I'm not through with the game, or even super deep into it, but (and this never happens) I haven't found one bit that annoys me or gets in the way of the fun. ..I highly recommend this to any fans of old school rpgs, and anyone who wants to explore a unique and interesting world.  Wait for a sale if you have to, but (knowing what I know now) I would have paid full price...PS there's like four sequels!  So even more waits if you like the first one.			"

												I admit it, Avernum has captured me!  Every time I play this game, I end up playing well into the night, and on some occassions, into the next day.  Why is this game so addictive, why had I never heard of it before, and why is it so inexpensive???  I bought the Spiderweb collection which contained this game (the Avernum1 remake); bought it somewhat on a whim after reading about how the guy who composed all the music for ""Faster than light"" had gotten addicted to this ""hidden gem"".Avernum reminds me of Ultima7 crossed with Xcom from the '90s.  But Avernum is both challenging and easy to play.  There are so many handy shortcut keys that you can practically play the game from the keyboard.   I love love love the command system, if you want to continuously cast a particular set of spells, you can just keep pressing the same key-combo's so you don't even have to look at the menu options that appear.  I think the biggest problem with Ultima7 was that it was too easy to 1 - get lost in the map, and 2  - get confused about what you had to do with the mission.  Avernum thankfully not only keeps track of all the quests, but also pin-points their relevant locations on the map.  And when I compare it to XCom, I will say that I died so many times, ruthlessly, that it made the game impassable after a certain point and I gave up on it.  Not so with Avernum.  The game is ""Generous"" in that it provides you with many ways to go about improving your party so that you won't die after every-other battle.   However, it's challenging enough that I still have to ""sneak"" around corners everynow and then so that I don't fall into an Ambush.I got so ""into"" this game last year that I confess I had to put it down completely for a few months.  It was that engrossing.  The other day I started it up again, not even knowing where in the huge world of Avernum I'd left off, and within half an hour I was back along the quest trail, using all the command combo's.  I must also mention the writing.  Kudos to the author!  I hear the game is solely developed by one man and his wife.  Is this true?  The writing is very nice, old school.  It's almost like playing a text adventure, and visualizing the story really gives you a sense of depth into the Avernum world.  There are also many many little secrets and hidden gems in the game.  For example, last night I battled through the temple of the ""Sliths"" (lizard people).  One of the items on the ground was ""Fine Trousers"" with a description that read along the lines that 'though the slith are wise, they have not yet found appreciation for a fine pair of trousers'.  I don't know, I just caught that when I saw it and thought wow, that's attention to detail.Avernum1 is the only game from Spiderweb I have played.  I actually can't wait to get my hands on Avernum2 which thankfully just came out (not to mention all the Geneforge and Avadon and other Avernum sequels).  There must be 10 years of gaming goodness in the Spiderweb collection.  But first I have to finish Avernum1.  I wish I could put my life on pause just to play this game.  Thank you very much Spiderweb software, this is the finest nostalgic euphoria one could have asked for.			"

												As a fan of retro RPGs, I can think of few that take place in a world as expansive as Avernum.  I originally played it back when it was called Exile, before the revamp that gave it a tutorial level, made sure you couldn't leave the first town without knowing about the free supplies, updated the graphics (including work by Phil Foglio!), and dropped the party from six members down to four (the part I am saddest about; having a six-person custom party was sweeeeet).The number of hours I spent exploring just the first portion of the game would be enough to fill a regular game by themselves.  Maybe it's just my play style, but I doubt you could get to the original's Shareware Demon if you weren't by that time ready to play through the rest of the game -- I still consider that the best form of shareware I've ever seen.And the world-building within that area was astounding.  The idea of living in a giant cave, and how it would affect the citizens, was richly explored, down to the type of farming (mushrooms) and livestock (giant lizards).  The political in-fighting was interesting without being overbearing; it comments here and there on modern issues through the types of people who got tossed in the pit.  The monsters had some variety to them (not, perhaps, as much as more modern games) and the way the combat flows from the environment is really appealing (there's Fight and Peace states, but the fights happen within the place you're at, not in a separate screen).  There's a lot of loot, including bits of trash and such to make the world more immersive; there's little bits of story everywhere.  And although the character-customization options seem to have been streamlined (reduced), there's still plenty of ways to make a unique team.If you're up for an old-school RPG with a very large world to explore, do give this one a try.

												You want a throw back to the oldschool cRPG, then this is the place to go to. Avernum - an underground kingdom/prison the size of a small continent. Thrown down by the overlording surface empire, you must survive with your band of adventurers in this strange land.Looking at the screenshots gives you a good idea of the look of the game. The writing, though, is probably the strongest feature about Avernum:Escape from the Pit. There is plenty of quick dialogue that forwards the story without becoming overwhelming. There are hundreds of differnet and unique characters to interact with.One of my favorite aspects of the game is the level scaling... meaning, I feel it doesn't hold your hand as you adventure. Some dungeons are leveled well above your party. This means that at times you need to retreat and come back later. Learning which dungeons are hard is part of the fun, and challenge. I feel that modern games try to hand hold you too much, not allowing you to walk into an overpowered demon boss who promptly decides you are his next meal.Avernum: Escape from the Pit brings back the old balance and fun of cRPGs. This game has been around since the 90s, first known as Exile: Escape from the Pit. It's got a great legacy and deserves attention. "

Avernum: Escape From the Pit is an old text-based CRPG with simple graphics and mechanics, that has been ""enhanced"" with new graphics and a better engine (still simple, though), along with a new name.Personally, I thought this game was not worth my time, until I played it. This is the first Spiderweb Software I played, and I assure you it will not be the last. The game is so well written that I started playing older games from the authors (Geneforge), all because of text and fluff.Gameplay is simple, with you directing a pre-defined party (chosen by you) around Avernum, the cavern-prison of the Empire. You get to places, get quests, fulfill them, get spells, items, and so on. You can modify your party at any time, and it even comes with a built-in character editor, in case you get stuck (due to poor ability planning) or bored.What sets this game apart is that mostly everything is richly described, from the lowly blacksmith to the Temple of the Lizards (no spoilers), to the Crystal Cave. Give it a chance, and you will probably end up liking it.			"

It's not like an epic battlescore, but it also doesn't make your ears start bleeding after 10 minutes.			"

It's still as solid now as it was back then, with better graphics, easier interface, and new plot elements. This is as close to a tabletop gaming experience as you're going to find in today's modern video game world. Make your party and then decide where you want to go in your underground prison. Follow the plot line, or just explore. It's your call.			"

												8/10Avernum: Escape From the Pit is the reboot of the Avernum series and it does a great job at that.While the game isn't anything heavy on graphics, it still brings updated looks in comparison to the original Avernum games, along with other updates, while at the same time maintaining the core mechanics from the original, which work just as great as they did before.People who enjoy oldschool RPG games and/or games that rely heavily on story and tactical combat will most probably enjoy these games. And even people who like RPG games but aren't too used to these oldschool ones can still pick it up and enjoy it, as the mechanics aren't anything overly complex to learn.You build your party the way you want (or skip it altogether and use the default party). When making your party, you can either use pre-set character archetypes (Soldier, Sorcerer, etc) or just customize each character the way you want, picking their stats and skills.The game has an interesting story, even if it's not anything mindblowing, and there's a lot of exploration and side-quests involved, including finding secrets. It's easy to accumulate many hours within the game (I should say, considering I have 91 hours in the game and I only finished it once).I think my only actual complaint with the game is the limit on summons - each character can only have one summon active, regardless of whether you use magic or items to summon a creature and summoned creatures themselves aren't too strong, save for the very best summon which can be decently useful. So if you want to make a character focused on summoning, he/she probably won't be very effective. It would have been a lot more interesting to be able to summon multiple creatures, maybe one strong summon along with a few weaker ones. (and I know it's possible - this has been done in other Spiderweb Software games)Nonetheless, a great oldschool RPG.			"

												Avernum: Escape From the Pit is an interesting game.  It's a remake of a remake of a game that came out in 1995, which is kind of surprising considering Escape From the Pit's graphics look like they're from 1995. Let's just say the original will make your eyes bleed. Now that we've gotten bashing the graphics out of the way, let's talk about the game itself. Avernum is a vast, expansive RPG that will take you around 60-70 hours to beat. Is it worth playing? Yes. It excels at everything it does. The world it takes place in is interesting and avoids many of the common fantasy tropes and pitfalls. The combat is enjoyably strategic and you feel a real sense of accomplishment after beating some of the harder enemies. The world is also filled to the brim with content and every enemy and item feels like it's been placed into the world with care and purpose. It's no masterpiece of writing, but it's far better than being merely servicable as a lot of RPGs tend to. The only real complaints of note are that the combat can get a bit silly at high levels and of course the graphics. Avernum is the type of RPG a lot of games wish they were and if you're fan of the genre you should definitely treat yourself to this one.			"

												I'm having a lot of fun with this game, already 30 hours into it  (probably a little high, as I sometimes multitask)If you've never played a game like this before, the learning curve is probably a little steep, but I would recommend looking around on the web for some character templates to follow until you understand character building.  The gameplay is fun, especially if you like tactical, turn-based battles.  Be sure to save often, however, as it is very easy to wander into fights that you can't win yet.  That's part of its charm, in my opinion, as you can feel powerful one minute and then have to reload the next!  Better yet, I've had plenty of battles that required quite a bit of time as I was evenly matched.			"

												I wanted an old school turn based RPG like Fallout.I didn't care so much for the graphics, and you won't see any eyecandy here.

But after a while you don't really feel the game pushing you forward.99% of the time the solution to a problem is to kill everybody and get the XP for it.There are some interesting races in it and funny characters, but after a while I just really got bored with running around and simply killing stuff.I found it pretty hard to get to an experience level where I could actually progress to killing the next big enemy, the solution for which is to find random enemies who are weeker and kill them by the thousands so you get enough XP to get to a level where you can take on the next bigger enemy.The game has an interesting world and political and race stuff and magic going on, but it is a little bit too slow and too open for my tastes, meaning it should tell you a little bit more where to go next or what to do next, and not leave you so alone.If you don't mind reading a lot and just going around killing stuff for like forever, then go ahead get this game.

												Oh, boy. Where do I start? I probably wasn't even 5 when Spiderweb Software came out with games but somehow they managed to reach our old Mac. Needless to say the original game was unplayable with the skill and attention span a child might have between the ages of 5 to 10 but something about the original Exile games managed to stick with my older brother who's 4 years older than me. He's followed Spiderweb's releases and remakes of Exile religiously ever since, so naturally he was ecstatic to see me checking out this remake on Steam. Having never touched the games aside from making a party, getting lost at the starting point and giving up, what did I think of this incarnation of a classic?The first thing that's clear is how streamlined the interface has become, I believe Jeff has been working on making all the Avernum games run on the same engine to get them all consistant. It was a lot easier to maneuver through making a party and looking at all the spells/abilities... which used to have a lot more of to the point of insanity. Luckily, the spells that have been removed were either combined with other spells or removed because they really weren't necessary.Questing and leveling is also pretty straightforward. Conversing with NPCs used to require you entering actually words yourself to get answers and information, now it's more standard with a choice of questions or answers to get what you want. The world itself feels large and lively with a map that you will be using a lot. There's a lot of choice in how your party gets shaped and your actions in questlines affect what happens at the end of the game for at least 3 types of endings.There's no music in this game but the ambience and sound effects make up for that. If it gets too quiet for your liking you can run some of your own music to fit the mood, classical music was my choice and it fit surprisingly well. :) The graphics are also pretty simple but detailed enough to tell what's going on. Spell effects are different for each spell so you know what you just fired is indeed a fireball and blizzards are made of ice.Combat is done in turns and has each character in the battle using action points. Using all your action points ends that character's turn while saving action points smartly allows you to attack or move multiple times. There's various skills and spell effects, defending, mana conservation and looting to take into account in every battle so there's some pretty large amounts of strategy to this game. Running in blind is a very bad idea and you should save often however...even on easy you can get ambushed and overwhelmed whether it's a fort, dungeon or out in the open-world... some of the enemies run faster than you also btw. :PThe most unique thing about Avernum (and most of Spiderweb's other games) is the writing and sometimes bizarre humor. It's charming and sometimes unnecessarily descriptive about some items or people in the world of Avernum... it's also a legacy to Jeff's imagination all those years ago, he's admitted while updating these games that even he thinks he was crazy when writing them and he'll never be able to create something like them ever again.While admitting I am influenced a bit by the nostalgia, I think there's plenty for a new player to enjoy in Avernum if RPGs are their favorite pastime. There's a plethora of guides covering all sorts of playthroughs and party builds. This game was also a decent challenge on the lowest difficulty setting and it goes up to nightmare. The community on Steam and the official Spiderweb website is friendly, helpful and pretty enthusiastic about new people getting into the games AND in case you still aren't sure about the games, Spiderweb offers a free demo which you can upgrade to the full game without having to start a new game. :)P.S.: There are 574 rocks in the game... I may have missed a couple.			"

												Great roleplaying, nice story, nice writing, interesting world, free roaming exploration, no level capping, no level scalling. Awesome game for it's price tag. And huge. I've spent over 60 hours in one playthrough withouth doing everything there is to do. If you are into roleplaying and don't mind the graphics, try this game. Now. Seriously. And you don't even have to buy it just to make up your mind. The developer offers a very big demo for you to see if it's really for you, and what's more, once you decide to buy, you can keep playing from where you left of on the demo. So there is no excuse for not trying, just don't let the overly simple (by todays standards) graphics scare you. This game is a jewel.			"

												I felt like reliving games I liked in the early 90s. Games like The Magic Candle and old SSI and Ultima games.Spider Web games taps into this nostalgia. They've released over a dozen isometric rpgs that offer hundreds if not thousands of hours of gameplay. I've put in 30+ hours into this title alone, one of 7 full titles in Avernum (I think), and that's not counting the Abadon games that take place in the same world. I'm estimating I'm about 25-30% into the game, though there are 3 completely different ways to win, so I really have no idea. The map is truly massive.A couple huge issues: The clumsy pathfinding will drive you nuts. Characters often take the long way around to a place with a misclick, ruining a battle and forcing you to restart.  The boat pathfinding is ridiculously awful. If you are patient enough to get accustomed to these old school mechanics, you'll be fine. Save. A. Lot.The world is dangerous. Don't expect clearcut level caps between regions, though the game is designed for widening challenges the further you venture. Money is hard to earn, and you get a real sense of accomplishment when you get a nice weapon or learn a new spell. While the starting area around Formello is relatively safe, the rest of the world is not. If it's a rich, nostalgic, challenging world you're looking for, get these. Can't be beat for the price either. "

												A lot of people have gone through the mechanics of the game better than I would. Everything in the game is mechanically sound and allows for ample strategy. You should absolutely buy it and support a great indie developer.The only thing I would comment on is the writing. A lot of people have gushed over the writing saying it's wonderful. Well, it is good, but have the right expectations: the writing is less the next Lord of the Rings in video game form and more having the best DM you could possibly imagine creating adventures for you.Definitely should get this game!EDIT: So I wanted to just add a final thought to my review. after putting almost 30 hours into the game, I've pretty much abandoned it. After thinking about it, I've realized the game lacks player agency. This means that there are no real choices in the game - there are dozens of quests to partake in, but there is no consequence if you don't do them. They are also almost all linear. The greatest choice present in most of them is whether you actually give a discovered quest item to the patron the commissioned the quest. Again, if you don't, the only consequence is not receiving the quest reward (which may or may not be better than the legendary item you're handing over). Games can overcome this if they have an immersive narrative or compelling aethetics and atmosphere. Unfortunately, this game lacks both. The narrative is ok and the world is unique, but it isn't enough to keep me going after 2 dozen hours. Now, some of Spiderweb's other offerings do give the player more agency. So again, I recommend the game, it's fun, but I just thought some may want to know.			"

Maybe this is why I am more addicted in buying games than playing them, it is just another story.I don't think its grapgics is bad by any means, the interface is great , others are developed enough for playing though  simple and crude. What attracted me most is the way it tells story ,  tons of words extracted before you ,  you decide , you choose , and as you decide and choose , your desitiny is formed in this way . I killed a great creature aiming at completing a quest from a psychic , my life wasn't saved later for this choice , because I haven't saved the file happend so long ago, it really annoied me much.

												Avernum is a pretty strange game, looking at it as someone too young to have played its ilk in their heyday. The control system is a little overcomplicated, the graphics are dated, and bosses tend to be signified simply by having disproportionate HP and *gasp* NAMES. Yet even with the remnants of gaming gone by, a natural consequence of the game's age, it's fairly enjoyable on its own merits. The combat is simple but solid, and the environments are decently detailed considering graphical limitations. What really makes the game stand out, though, is the sheer level of personality found in the game's world. The underground domain of Avernum is a harsh place of limited law. It's interesting to see how its forsaken people react in different ways to their exile: forging new civilizations, forming roving bandit bands making a bad situation worse for everyone, embracing adventure and combat... There's plenty of dialogue and lore to be found during your wandering, a lot of it comedic. For me, more than the game play itself, that's what makes Avernum worth playing: The sense of exploration in a bizarre subterannean kingdom. Give it a look--if you can put up with the eccentricities of age it's nicely done.			"

												Avernum is a turn based indie RPG. It's heavily inspirated by old fashioned isometric rpg from the 90's like Ultima , the nostalgia appeal is definitively there . It's a solid crawling RPG with an appealing world (or rather underworld) if you can stomach the primitive graphics and limited storylines.Gameplaywise Avernum presents us with a good solid and simple fighting system which is quite entertaining and challanging. It's similar to many other similar games but the mechanics work, and it rarely frustrate you depite teh flaws in the GUI or the inperfect pathsystem. The game definitively doesn't hold your hand, and there are areas your party should avoid unntil they've grown in experience and gear as the creatures will crush you mercilessly.Spiderweb does a good job in presenting us this huge world with unique features and cultures, great atmosphere but ultimately it sometimes feels a little empty and one city look a lot like the others. The game ,with no advanced graphical features to speak of ,tries to impress you with lyric descriptions of the grottos in Avernum, but honestly there are only so many ways to describe the huge , dark and humid  cave where the story takes place, it gets old rather quickly.The quests in this game are rather traditional with the usual fare of defeating bandits\creatures\deamons to save the kingdomI know Spiderweb do not have the means to pay an army of writers to flesh out dozens of intricate quests with intagrated storyline and unique characters. But a few interesting quests with memorable characters and dramatic events would have been welcomed.I got rather bored toward the end, maybe because my party had become as good as they could, and the monsters weren't very dangerous and difficult anymore. Or maybe because I was tired of exploring the same fort or grotto with different names over and over again, but to be fair many RPG  have this effect on me after countless hours of playing.Avernum is a good old game from a different era, it's refreshing especially for its comeback of corevalues of the genre with none of the frivoulous stuff RPGs have to deal with those days (soap opera romances, over the top graphics, boring sidequests).Its biggest strength can also be its biggest weakness however as it also doesn't make much effort to introduce new concepts and stay on the safe side of Nostalgia. Having spent well over 100 hours in this game , I can still say it's qualities still outweitgh its flaws by far, what Avernum does , it does it well. If you look for a nice traditional , no-nonsense RPG with a solid gameplay and credible if at times monotonous world , Avernum is exactly it.Its limitations prevent it to be on the same league as Baldur's gate or Divinity (to be fair those are AAA games...) but it's still an excellent game and well worth your time.

												There's no way I could not give this game a ""Recommended"" rating, but it comes with some significant qualifications:Avernum: Escape from the Pit is better than the original Avernum 1 in some ways, and worse in others.  I was disappointed that it wasn't much of an upgrade.  The engine is practically identical, so it just felt like I was replaying Avernum 1 with a couple of usability mods tacked on.  Fortunately, Avernum 1 was an amazing game, so I had almost as much fun replaying it as I did playing it for the first time.  I loved the story, I loved the length, and I loved the challenging turn-based tactical combat which rewards good planning and equipment choice as well as good combat decisions.Long-time fans of the series will know that there are three versions of this game.  The first, Exile 1, is a non-isometric overhead 2D tactical RPG.  Very fun, but the Avernum remake blew it out of the water.  This remake of Avernum just adds a few ""enhancements,"" some of them desirable and some not.BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL AVERNUM:Notable locations in towns and dungeons (shops, important NPCs, spellbooks you may want to return to a second time, etc.) are now marked on your map, which helps decrease the copious note-taking this game requires.  Note that you will still have to have some paper beside you (or a text file ready to alt-tab to), to record many places you will want to return to later, or quest details that aren't automatically added to your quest journal.There are some additional areas to flesh out the game world, and some additional fun dungeons.Hidden areas now have a visual cue, obviating the need to tediously bump your character against the sides of the maps to find them.WORSE THAN THE ORIGINAL AVERNUM:The skill and perk system has been overhauled to make it less likely you will unintentionally create a weak character.  I consider this undesirable both because the players who actually need such a feature aren't a good match for a game like this and because much of the fun, flexibility, and personality of the original system has been lost.  Furthermore, I believe that the ""problem"" being addressed is already covered by the fact that the difficulty can be changed at any time.Some of the content additions to this version of the game kill the mystery and thrill of the original game.  I can't be more specific without spoiling it for you, but things you really aren't meant to see until you are well into the game, in my opinion, are now accessible to you early on.The World Map now autoscrolls instead of letting you explore it one screen at a time, making it both easier to miss things and more annoying to track what you have already explored and what you have left to explore.Also, I can't remember if this was in the original version or not, but there is a ""soft"" level cap at 30, after which you only get a chance to allocate level-up points every five levels (which means level 35, really, since you will probably finish the game before level 40).  Worse, there is NO warning about this!  This can really screw up some of your planning, as many skills require a certain level before the ability you want is available to you.  Of course, this downside won't apply to you, because I just warned you. ;)THE VERDICT:Both versions of this game are amazing, so there's no question about my recommending it or not.  So which version should you play?If you are a more casual player, worried about making mistakes with your character creation and upon leveling up, get this version.  And if you are not interested in challenging combat, you can also put the difficulty on ""Normal"" or ""Casual,"" and just enjoy the story.  If you have trouble finding the original and/or getting it to run on your modern computer, you can settle for this version as well--it's not significantly worse.If you are a player who cut your teeth on old CRPGs in the 80s and 90s, or if you don't mind dealing with retro conventions, go for the original.  Much of the content you are giving up is not necessarily an improvement to the overall package, and character creation and growth is a LOT more fun.  Just be prepared to take lots of additional notes on the locations of shops and important NPCs in towns.			"

												Avernum is a turn based indie RPG. It's heavily inspirated by old fashioned isometric rpg from the 90's like Ultima , the nostalgia appeal is definitively there . It's a solid crawling RPG with an appealing world (or rather underworld) if you can stomach the primitive graphics and limited storylines.Gameplaywise Avernum presents us with a good solid and simple fighting system which is quite entertaining and challanging. It's similar to many other similar games but the mechanics work, and it rarely frustrate you depite teh flaws in the GUI or the inperfect pathsystem. The game definitively doesn't hold your hand, and there are areas your party should avoid unntil they've grown in experience and gear as the creatures will crush you mercilessly.Spiderweb does a good job in presenting us this huge world with unique features and cultures, great atmosphere but ultimately it sometimes feels a little empty and one city look a lot like the others. The game ,with no advanced graphical features to speak of ,tries to impress you with lyric descriptions of the grottos in Avernum, but honestly there are only so many ways to describe the huge , dark and humid  cave where the story takes place, it gets old rather quickly.The quests in this game are rather traditional with the usual fare of defeating bandits\creatures\deamons to save the kingdomI know Spiderweb do not have the means to pay an army of writers to flesh out dozens of intricate quests with intagrated storyline and unique characters. But a few interesting quests with memorable characters and dramatic events would have been welcomed.I got rather bored toward the end, maybe because my party had become as good as they could, and the monsters weren't very dangerous and difficult anymore. Or maybe because I was tired of exploring the same fort or grotto with different names over and over again, but to be fair many RPG  have this effect on me after countless hours of playing.Avernum is a good old game from a different era, it's refreshing especially for its comeback of corevalues of the genre with none of the frivoulous stuff RPGs have to deal with those days (soap opera romances, over the top graphics, boring sidequests).Its biggest strength can also be its biggest weakness however as it also doesn't make much effort to introduce new concepts and stay on the safe side of Nostalgia. Having spent well over 100 hours in this game , I can still say it's qualities still outweitgh its flaws by far, what Avernum does , it does it well. If you look for a nice traditional , no-nonsense RPG with a solid gameplay and credible if at times monotonous world , Avernum is exactly it.Its limitations prevent it to be on the same league as Baldur's gate or Divinity (to be fair those are AAA games...) but it's still an excellent game and well worth your time.

												I've always enjoyed Spiderweb software's products, and this was no exception.  I had a really good time playing the game.  I thought it was well balanced, not too easy or too hard, and the open world made exploration very diverting.  The writing was solid, and the story interesting.The interface is pretty good, although there was a problem selecting individual squares where 3D objects overlapped.  It wasn't bad enough to prevent me from enjoying the game, but it was annoying.  It was also at times difficult to tell whether a character would move or execute an action when you clicked, which could result in your characters doing stupid things that got them killed.  Also, some story devices were overused.  (Specifically “Enlightenment”)  It is also a little bit difficult to tell what direction one should take with skills and such while leveling.  It was also a challenge to find objects on the ground to pick up.Still and all, it was a very solid, turn-based RPG.  I really loved it. "

												Highly enjoyable open-world rpg. Graphics meh, but story, speedy combat, speedy movement and large number of quests are fun. Explore every inch less you miss something. Don't forget to add a magic-user and priest to your party - you won't regret it. Try dual-wielding too. Careful with too much armor and shielding as that affects your to-hit chance. Now go out there and defend Avernum from the Empire and all the monsters sharing space with your people underground. Did I forget to mention the demons? Yeah, there are demons and demon lords in this too. Good luck. One last piece of advice, whenever you level up, always spend a point on your weapon of choice, and your spellcasting ability as this unlocks special attacks for the former and higher level spells for the latter. Okay, now go out there and save Avernum!			"

												Avernum: Escape from the Pit is a remake of 1999's Avernum, which in turn is a remake of Exile's Saga, developed by Spiderweb Software, a indie software house which over the years has seen certain success among fans of the ""hardore"" RPG. With a structure that remembers the great classical, the player takes the control of a party of 4 characters, exiled as traitors of the empire in the Avernum, an enormous underground world in which city and factions have risen. Overall this Avernum: Escape from the Pit proves to be a good old-fashioned RPG: an original setting and a good exploratory component, excellent longevity, a turn-based combat challenging and complex and a narration over the top, true mark of factory of Jeff Vogel's games. This title is an excellent starting point if you want to approach the Saga of Avernum and fans of the genre should definitely not let it get away. For everyone else who would like to give it a chanche, remember that it's a good buy for the price, especially if you succeed in passing over the technical execution that is not to the height of the great productions.

												Avernum is a great RPG with depth, varied gameplay, and plenty of surprises.  I get bored by other games lately that are too easy or just don't have much to them.  Avernum is a classic RPG where you can explore, steal, battle, and tweak your characters to your desires.  However, it doesn't make character development confusing or strange; you know exactly what you are doing to your characters.  There are lots of little ""secrets"" to find everywhere, whether it be a hidden spell tome you still need enough knowledge to read, a strange quest NPC behind a false wall, or a pile of gems in the wilderness.  I suppose the interface might dissuade someone who is used to modern games that basically play themselves, but iI feel it just does its own thing and works fine.  Any way you look at it, this is a great game for any RPG fan.I recently made it to an ending and it was damn hard...but that's actually okay because of the depth of content in the game and the ability to become strong enough.

												You can actually see the casualization of the series: the most deep one is Exile escape from the pit where you had food management (you could die of starvation), a 6 members party, more weapon variation and a lot of spells.Avernum 1 is more streamlined and simplified version in a good way: you have a simplified conversation mechanic (no need to guess the right word to type anymore like in Ultima or king's quest), most of the useful skills are still there but it lacks the 6 party people which gave you the option of specialization to each character (a swordsman,a spearman,a blunt weapon user, a rogue that uses ranged weapons, a mage and a priest) and tou had less spells.Avernum escape from the pit is bad.....the story is still there (and it’s a good story!!....because it’s the same story for the 3rd time) but it dropped the skill system for a skill tree (why??), the food management aspect which gives more depth is gone (in Avernum 1 you had to be careful where you rest and in the second game where you took the journey to the Vahnatai lands you had to make stops in order to scavenge for food because you always lose some in the waterfalls), some of the useful skills like poisoning are gone, less weapon variation (no one handed spear, no rock throwing, no arrows, no clubs), even less spells, you cannot bash doors and alchemy? Forget it because you need to find alchemist in a town to do this for you and there are no recruitable NPCs...and death has no consequences because youer dead party members revive when entering a friendly town for free unlike in avernum 1 and exile where you had to pay a priest to revive them for a huge sum.Exile is still my all-time favorite because of the RPG elements (but sadly I need to emulate win 3.1x to play this or get a windows XP machine), Avernum 1 is a very good remake and escape from the pit......no just no, it's bad compared to the originals - a real casualized version for phones and iPads.If it would have kept the skill system and spells from Avernum 1 at least then I would have given it a good review but as it is…. it's too dumbed down compare to the other versions.Play Avernum 1, you can still buy it on GOG (AVERNUM: THE COMPLETE SAGA)			"

												This game is sort of like a retro, turn-based RPG. It reminds me of the old ""Pool of Radiance,"" and similar type games, which came out in the 1980's. But, it isn't the same, as in, it isn't ""official DnD rules,"" in fact it is more like a GURPS type system, where each character can be built any way you want. For example, you can have a ""tank"" type character who can also cast healing spells, or a wizard who is also skilled with a bow. I was skeptical at first, having been burned several times by games which are no fun at all. But, I am a huge fan of turn based RPG's, which are well made. This is one of them. I can't wait to try Avernum 2, 4, 5 and 6, which are also on Steam. (strangely, there is no Avernum 3 on Steam). The fights can be challenging. There have been several in which I thought the entire party would die, but I ended up victorious (my four man party has two healers, one of which is sort of an archer/healer, but it works well to have a back-up healer. I also put one point on healing for my mage, so he can also heal with his huge mana pool if he has to). And my party has been wiped out several times, but the game allows frequent saves, so all you need to do is go back to your last saved game and you're good to go if they all die. The game allows you to ""level up,"" with stat and ability increases at each level. There seems to be no level limit. I have been playing the game for a few days and my party is already level eleven. Treasure includes things like better armor, weapons, scrolls, wands, potions, money, gems, and all sorts of mundane things, like bags of flour, tools, etc.			"

												Great RPG. Unlike the first ""generation"" of Avernum games, it runs well on new systems, without awful resolution issues, and if you can get past the admitted hideousness, it's great. Personally, I feel graphics are only useful, at least in RPGs, primarily in aiding immersion and secondarily in establishing a mood. Escape from the Pit manages to be quite immersive and have a distinct mood and style despite not really showing you... much of anything. You forget you're actually in an underground cavern sometimes, particularly if there's no cave wall on-screen at the moment, but eh, minor gripes.It offers complete freedom and its lack of a real ""main quest"" is just fantastic. There's three biggest, longest questlines you can happen upon, the most obvious one being to escape back to the surface, but when and if you go about them is up to you.If you're looking for negatives, perhaps the fact that everything is very scripted, with no real emergent gameplay or narrative might sadden you a bit, especially as it means there's really zero replay value... once you do everything. But there is a bunch of content and things to do. It's a huge world with lots of stuff. So that'll take some time. I'd have guessed I completed well over 90% of it and it took me 40-odd hours. Then I did a second playthrough and found more.Also in its favor is its lack of classes. It's skill-based, and you get plenty of them, so you've lots of room to experiment. And the combat is tactical and far deeper than many turn-based RPGs. It's certainly not its selling point, but you don't get bored.Well worth your money.			"

												The concept is solid and the old school feel is right.  If you get this at a discount and want to try it for a few dollars, sure.  But as a game that isn't just fan made and shared amongst friends, but is sold commercially, with all due respect: (1) the game mechanics are too simplistic for its release date; (2) the plot and quests lack depth and there are glaring issues that detract from a player's ability to immerse himself in the game; (3) the interface is incredibly clumsy, and there is a lot of trial and error necessary to understand how certain items operate, which in the heat of battle is not great; (4) the writing is not as good as people say it is-it's not bad for English as a second language, but it doesn't stack up against its peers; and (5) the dialogue trees are terribly frustrating: you will find yourself having the same circular conversation for ages before you can actually hand in your quests or trigger new ones, and sometimes it's just a matter of mashing the text options at random until you can finally finish the dialogue and advance the plot.

												A good RPG however the UI is very unintuitive and hard to use, moving your party around is clunky, combat is annoying due to no previewing of how your hero will path to your cursor. Graphics could have been improved too.Usually I like turn based games but due to the clunkyness of interaction it felt like a chore... Why does 'i' (or 'g') open the one characters inventory but pressing it again doesn't close it?!It had a lot of depth though, perhaps potentially I might have changed my mind. But from a F2P perspective it was not enjoyable in the time frame.			"

												I've basically loved everything Spiderweb Software has ever done. Avernum is no exception, especially now that they've updated it with this version. No, it doesn't look much different, but the interface is worlds better, so that you actually know what all of the numbers mean. You don't need graphics to tell a good story, but you need a good story that sinks it's hooks in right from the start, and Avernum is one of those.  I'm really looking forward to Avernum 2.Probably the only real downside with Avernum is how god-like your characters get toward the end. After a certain point, there really isn't much left in the game that's a challenge to defeat, the baddies just take longer to kill.			"

												Isometric RPG with a vast and rich world. There is an emphasis on exploration and story with a solid combat system to back it. It's quite a time investment of around 40+ hours but is worth the effort.Currently on weekly sale (6/2/2014) for $1.99 and is on sale quite often. Highly suggest playing an hour or two, if you love it you're in for a good time, if not, it's not much of an investment.Be aware, it's easy to forget what you're doing and lose track of goals with a quest log that won't always keep you up to date, but as long as you keep exploring the map and make sure to be thorough, you'll usually complete quest objectives without too much of a problem.

												Focused on realistic world-building and open-ended questing, Avernum eschews aesthetics in favor of pure gameplay. From the moment you create your party, you are embroiled in the world of Avernum and if you can look past the somewhat crusty (but perfectly functional and intuitive) interface, you will not want to leave your new home until your quest is complete.Avernum is a bleak, dangerous setting (really just a dank cavern), but somehow the developers have filled it with a wide variety of both environments and inhabitants. Towns have the feel of outposts in the badlands with a motley citizenship of people with sordid pasts, meaning you never quite know where you fit, and always need to watch your back. There are points where you free to attack and kill NPCs that will affect the outcome of the game, but much of the time you will be signing your own death warrant by doing so.While it may feel a little difficult to play for some people who didn't grow up in the heyday of SSI RPGs, I personally have no significant complaints about Avernum. I loved playing it from start to ""finish"" (I say that in quotes because there are multiple endings, or you can simply roam forever finishing off a multitude of optional quests). Highly recommended for hardcore roleplayers.			"

												A wonderful, old-school cRPG with fantastic writng, challenging gameplay (though you can toggle the difficulty at any time), a massive open world filled with secrets and monsters, and enough content to keep you busy for several dozen hours.  I was surprised by how engrossing I found the world of Avernum to be despite its lack of pretty graphics, dated mechanics, and its fairly cumbersome UI - due in no small part to the large novel-worth of fantastic writing from Jeff Vogel, who manages to create NPCs who run the gamut from hilarious and bawdy to poetic and tragic.  The inhabitants of Avernum (and boy, there are a lot of them) are a strange and varied lot which help breathe life into the otherwise bare-bones aesthetic of the game.  Not to mention all the various bits of lore and worldbuilding detail that make Avernum feel both unique and immediately familiar to any avid RPG player.The combat is pretty basic turn-based strategy.  Buffs, proper equipment, a clever distribution of potions/scrolls/wands, and tactical unit placement are all essential to victory.  The character/party building system is not particularly deep and the number and variety of spells are a little underwhelming, but there's still plenty of room for experiementation.  My only real complaint about the, game besides the sometimes frustrating UI, is the disaapointingly small variety of weapons and armor.  The only melee weapons available are swords (short, long, broad), daggers, and spears/halberds - it's never mentioned why for some reason Avernum blacksmiths are unable to make maces, flails, warhammers, axes, or any of the other medieval weaponry common to the genre - a similar issue with armor, there's only leather, iron, and steel.  I assume it has to do with the original game's limitations, or possible deadline issues (Jeff seems to always be working on something), as adding new weapon classes would mean adding new skill trees which would require a lot more balancing and playtesting.  It's understandable, if not a little disappointing, but maybe I'm asking too much of a remake of a remake of a 20 year old game.  That said, the game is completely littered with various pieces of enchanted equipment which at the very least helps alleviate some of that disappointment.All-in-all, I whole-heartedly reccomend this to any fans of classic cRPGs like Ultima/Fallout/Baldur's Gate, as well as fans of tactical JRPGs a la FF:Tactics.  It's  real good stuff.			"

												Ah, Spiderweb Software. My first recollection of this fine company comes from the early ninties shareware disk compilations you'd buy for $10, chock full of shareware/freeware to enjoy. And there was Exile, in all it's wonderous glory, what would eventually be remade as the Avernum series. They haven't lost their creativity and knack for story-telling in all these years, and I'm glad to see them come to Steam at last. I do miss those books you could find on bookshelves and read in Exile. One of them was rather raunchy, and involved a buxom maiden running from a deranged, sex-crazed mutant squirrel. Needless to say they've become more family friendly since those early shareware days, but the game is still as great as ever. A+			"

												WARNING This review carry's spoilers which are not suitable for those who hate them!!!An old school RPG with a new heart, Avernum:Escape from the Pit is a remake of the first Avernum game. Character Customization, inventory management, dilog options and tradition D&D style are the corner stone of an RPG. However what makes this game shine above the others is it's in depth story. You're basically an outcast sent to Avernum, a massive underground prison where the empire sends all their unwanted. You have a choice of freedom, staying and saving Avernum, or killing the king.If you think this game is easy, it can be, and at times, it ups the anty. There is great reward for great risk, and small reward for little risk. Dragons are the best example of this, there are some I just would not mess with, (mostly because they were cool) but others were crude and rude. So you basically could chose if you wanted to rid the dark bowels of their evil stench, which I thought was a nice touch. Though I'm not sure if the choices you make in this game would carry over to the second, but for now, it's nice to have the option of killing what you want.Overall, with what it does great, I give this game a 8/10. There's always room for improvement, mostly graphically, but I won't hold it against them too much, since it improved the graphics from the last game greatly. A tutorial on spells may be needed since I didn't know that friendly AOE spells wouldn't harm your party members until mid way through the game, still, it's done well.			"

												I have always loved the Avernum series, and IMHO, the best RPG ever made.We can either follow the storyline or just go exploring , picking up one quest after another until we forget what's the main quest, which by the way can be easily traced back within our own pace since there is no pressure of time. The use of keyboard is somewhat frustrating, but you'll get used to it given a certain amount of time.			"

												I got this game three and a half days ago. That's approximately 84 hours, day and night. As of right now I have 45 hours on record. That means, since I got this game, I have spent about 54% of my time playing it. And I still have finals to study for.10/10 I can quit any time I want.			"

												Overall, not a bad game.I had loved the original incarnation of this game (Exile) from many years ago.  This title is, I believe, the second rerelease of the original.  Some notable differences: Graphics have changed quite immensely, random encounters don't generate very frequently in this version - requiring me to exploit game mechanics to keep the game interesting. More importantly, player party size has been reduced to four members from six. Skill points are handled a bit more differently than the original game as well as player inventory and NPC conversation. Otherwise gameplay and content are much the same.The updated graphics I'm a bit critical of.  In my eyes, they're quite busy and they have made it less apparant what is significant. However, it may just be that I'm being reminiscent. The avatar image options are, however, quite limited.The reduction is spawning has been quite an annoyance to me. If you're more into roguelike games where encounters are limited by design, this may appeal to you more. In Avernum, enemies appear to have a chance of respawning upon entering a location. If you simply revisit after sometime playing, there will be almost nothing there. Instead, to get any even significant respawning, you must repeatedly enter and exit a location, else you need to move on. This is quite different from the original game in which respawn appeared to be triggered by timers (often very quickly).The reduction in PCs is also quite significant.  Given the number of non-combat roles expected of the party (lockpicking, alchemy, cave lore, mage lore, etc) the larger party size helped to balance this amongst characters.  With only four, this feels very limiting and you have to make some hard choices as to what your party will be capable of.Overall, I enjoyed the original Exile more than this remake.  However, despite this is still a fun and interesting game, especially if you enjoy older RPGs with more up front strategy elements and a big world to explore.			"

												Made by the same people who did Avadon: The Black Fortress, this game shares much of the same engine and game resources while being a much more enjoyable title.  The story is much less scripted; your party of four generics is exiled to an underground Australia for defying or upsetting the powers that be, and the setting actually focuses a lot on cave life and does it pretty well.  The semi-open world lets you explore and adventure and kills things for loot, levels, and story progress.  Unlike Avadon, the scripted 'find a way to escape' goal is present in the story itself rather than spoiled and given away at the start.  There's optional fetchquesting and more interesting sidequesting, and a fair share of nice unique loot too which is always a plus in my book.  There is enough optional combat and XP to make the game non-challenging at a certain point, which is not necessarily a bad thing.The downsides are still numerous though.  There's a lot of RPG min-maxing and information invisible to the player, such as one skill specifying a fatigue reduction bonus in number (5%) per skill point but another merely saying it 'improves fatigue reduction' without saying by how much.  Two-handed weapons do not do more damage for taking up an extra hand and there are so few unique polearms in the game as to make polearms basically worse than sword-and-board or dual-wielding.  Archery is a completely useless skill having literally one unqiue weaponto its name, and there is no reason to not give everyone a single point in priest magic and completely eschew the First Aid skill since 'fighter' skills do not use MP.  Pathfinding is pretty annoying at times because the game does not want to path through allies, path too far, through doors, or falsely tells you a space is blocked.  A lot of abilities are not worth using because they inflict debuffs which have an insignificant impact compared to raw DPS abilities.  The sound design is basically zero.  There is music at the title and credits only, and a lot of ambient noise is lackluster.  Combat sounds are generic and unimpressive.  Aside from at least one charming moment with talking spiders, none of the characters have interesting personalities which is kind of a let down.So all in all, I'd say the following: The game is passable in combat and character progression (as long as you are good at understanding RPGs) and does please for those interested in gathering cool stuff to equip.  The game has a more open story progression, even if unimpressively delivered by its character writing and sound.  The setting is very unique and interesting, and definately a strong point of the game.  At 70hrs long on normal difficulty (I probably idled some of those hours) it provides a good amount of content and I did enjoy myself throughout.  I would not reccomend it to someone looking for a core game or an RPG dabbler but otherwise I think its fine.			"

												Somehow I logged in about 70 something hours in about 2 weeks.  Rarely has a game caused me to go into no life mode just to complete it.  Its a huge game, so many towns to explore, characters to meet and tons of discriptive text.  Like a good book the game lore is so detailed it really pulls you in and makes you believe that this can be a real world out there.  REcommended because its good, but not recommended because it really messes up your sleep schedule if you are in a hurry to finish it.			"

												Focused on realistic world-building and open-ended questing, Avernum eschews aesthetics in favor of pure gameplay. From the moment you create your party, you are embroiled in the world of Avernum and if you can look past the somewhat crusty (but perfectly functional and intuitive) interface, you will not want to leave your new home until your quest is complete.Avernum is a bleak, dangerous setting (really just a dank cavern), but somehow the developers have filled it with a wide variety of both environments and inhabitants. Towns have the feel of outposts in the badlands with a motley citizenship of people with sordid pasts, meaning you never quite know where you fit, and always need to watch your back. There are points where you free to attack and kill NPCs that will affect the outcome of the game, but much of the time you will be signing your own death warrant by doing so.While it may feel a little difficult to play for some people who didn't grow up in the heyday of SSI RPGs, I personally have no significant complaints about Avernum. I loved playing it from start to ""finish"" (I say that in quotes because there are multiple endings, or you can simply roam forever finishing off a multitude of optional quests). Highly recommended for hardcore roleplayers.			"

												Enjoyable game, a throwback to when RPGs were close to their tabletop counter part. It wins on the content and experience of the game and not the graphics, which might require an adjustment period. I acheived all the endings which brings me to my only complaint, it was a bit too long. Lots of side quests if your aiming to do them all, which you will if you want the most difficult ending.			"

												This is what every open-world RPG should be. Straight the ♥♥♥♥ up.There are no classes. You make 4 people, as little or as much as you like to customize them pre-game, and you get chucked underground because you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off someone in The Empire. You aren't coming back from underground, not anytime soon. You get a crude map and a tip that if you're as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off as you look, go visit a mage to the west. She's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ too.But you don't have to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Maybe you want to explore. (The more map you cover, the more XP you get for finding new locations.) Or that place called ""Tower of the Magi"" sounds handy, learn some spells. Perhaps go on a pilgrimage from town to town earning priestly skills from the preachers. You can steal like mad if you want. Nothing's nailed down. Just don't get seen. And maybe you just like the thought of being king of the underground? There's a crown out there. Kill the dude wearing it and park your ♥♥♥ on the throne.I have yet to see this game tell me ""no"".			"

												It was a tough decision.I deeply respect Spiderweb software for what they do. The quality of the game is great (considering that it was made by very small team). But I recommend or not recommend a game based solely on my experience with it. I played for around 7 hours and at some point playing became chore and not an entertainment. The graphics are very simple, the experience is not story-driven, the battle system is satisfying in the beginning, yet becomes monotonous at some point. The lore? Usual generic fantasy world. Caverns filled with lizard people, dragons, undead, cat people. Avernum is a RPG. Do play it, but only if you really want to play with swords and magic, but can't can't find any other decent game from the genre.			"

												I have not played Exile, or whatever the name is of the game that this is apparently a remake of. I am reviewing this game in isolation. That being said, the impression I get is that people seem to consider this game a ""diamond in the rough"", a game with poor publicity but surprisingly good gameplay given how unknown it is. As for me... well, all I can say is that I understand why this game is as obscure as it is.Let's start with the atmosphere... the immersion, the feeling, the factor that makes any good RPG its salt. Avernum uses a very similar plot premise to a game I love, Gothic (a game that came out later than Exile, apparently - so Avernum did technically beat Gothic to the punch). An oppressive monarchy throws its criminals - as well as political opponents and anyone it just doesn't want around - into a sealed prison colony where they have to fend for themselves and struggle against each other as well as the wilderness down below. The difference is - where Gothic pulled this off flawlessly (and seriously - if you like Avernum's premise, and haven't played the Gothic games yet, try those out first), Avernum just fails to impress. It becomes obvious immediately as soon as you descend that the prison colony is actually an IMPROVEMENT over the Empire - prosperous, free, and the Empire's rule does not actually have any influence down there. That is a big no-no. It makes it hard to get into the shoes of your characters, who seem to be motivated by revenge or a desire to escape (depending on what conversation options you take as them), because one can't help but think... ""okay, what's the conflict here? What's the big deal? Why don't I just settle down, become a mushroom farmer and have a happy life now that the Empire does not rule me?"" Because that's a very valid question. Unlike in Gothic (where the prisoners are dependent upon the surface for luxury goods, weapons and other advanced items, and have to excavate ore in return), Avernum (the prison colony and the game's namesake) is utterly self-sufficient and does not have to give anything back to the Empire. Unlike in Gothic (where there are several camps all ruled by tyrants, the insane and other questionable figures, and there is danger both inside the camps and on the roads, where bandits lie in wait), most of the Avernum world is ruled by a rather unified monarchy with a just king at its helm and with the rule of law largely upheld. (Or so it still seems anyway, well into the midgame. If there is any shocking twist by the end, I know as little of it as you do. Wouldn't matter either way as far as the enjoyment of the story is concerned.) Avernum actually has its sub-prison colony, the Abyss, where the criminals of Avernum are thrown. Not exactly a very inspiring world, is it? Far from the gritty world of Gothic's penal colony, here you stroll almost freely between established towns, the only  enemies being the occasional cat people (sorry - they aren't bikini-clad babes, don't reflex-click the Buy button), snake people (same deal), and generic RPG monsters. Oh, and where Gothic had exciting, living, breathing characters, Avernum's characters are so incredibly dull and lacking any fantasy, it is almost an insult to the genre of Role-Playing Game. Seriously - I haven't completed the game, but I have played through a good chunk of it, I think. There is not a single interesting character that I met. Not even the King, nor any of his Mayors - all of them interact with your character in the same way. ""Hello adventurer! Glad/not glad to see you. I love/hate mercenaries. We are fighting the cat/snake people here. I have a quest for you that involves either killing a lot of cat/snake people or retrieving a trinket guarded by cat/snake people. Or occasionally something else like a jelly or a drake, woo hoo!"" Far from being an adventure, the gameplay feels like you are King Micah's head marshal, taking care of his endlessly boring errands throughout the realm, one after the other, never given a break or even an amusing distraction. (And let me just say: this doesn't just apply to the sidequests! Even the main quests themselves are just more of the same.)Oh, of course, the game mechanics aren't stellar either. The combat system and the skill tree are nothing extraordinary, but at least they are serviceable... except for the horrible pathfinding system. There is no way to see whether your mage/archer is able to strike at the enemy from any given point. You have to click and hope for the best, then one of two things will happen: 1. your character attacks the target (woo hoo!) or 2. your character starts running around like a headless chicken, doing all kinds of crazy stuff, taking non-obvious paths, even attempting (and failing) to run all the way around the map to get at an enemy standing down a corridor (...why???). Nor are the line-of-sight mechanics intuitive - often you can attack when you shouldn't be able to, even more often you can't attack when you should be able to.The interface isn't exactly great either. Aside from simply being old and dated, it isn't that informative either - there are a lot of weird things that can happen: for example, there is a mechanic that your mages cannot cast spells if they are too ""encumbered"", but either the game just doesn't mention this or it is way too easy to miss, same difference: being ""encumbered"" means not that your gear is too heavy, but that your to-hit chance is too low (...I know right, WTF?). This means, for example, that a +1 strength blade and no shield may leave your character unable to cast spells, but a heavier blade with no strength bonus (but a +5% to hit bonus) and a wooden shield (which doesn't have a to-hit malus) will let you do so. Beyond that, there are - of course - bugs. The game isn't riddled with them, but there are some - some traits don't work at all, for example.While the big Spiderweb Software bundle may well be worth the price on sale (I don't know, haven't really tried much else from it yet), I can safely say I do not recommend Avernum: Escape from the Pit. If you get the bundle, try something else from it. Give this one a miss. It really isn't worth the hype. I'm sorry I couldn't finish it, but it was simply too much of a brutally boring slog - nonetheless, I hope that even my incomplete experience is enough to cast a convincing judgment... Avernum fails in the worst way an RPG can fail - it prioritizes quantity over quality and does not deliver much of the latter, it showcases how an RPG can go utterly wrong even before you take gameplay mechanics into account.

												There is something to say about modern game design. Games are more accessible, fun and a lot easier to navigate. However, there are a lot of players and developers who cherish, if that’s the proper term, that old school look and feel. Avernum Escape from the Pit does not disappoint those fans. Its old school in every way from its look, broken mathematics, terrible inventory management, and world navigation. What is painful are these are all minor and fixable flaws that take away the strengths and add dozens upon dozens of unnecessary hours to the game and ultimately ruins your experience.Avernum Escape from the Pit is an isometric party RPG that from my understanding is a remake of an earlier Spiderweb title, Avernum 6. The story begins with you and 3 other characters that are tossed into the underground world of Avernum for crimes unknown against the empire. Your main objective is to escape, but other game ending objectives become available later in the game. The story, writing and quests design border on excellent and are easily the highlight for your long adventure. Avernum is built on a very recognizable RPG level up system with points which are distributed through common statistics, skill and traits trees. As I said earlier the mathematics in the game are broken in such a way a character editor is attached so you can basically max out a character from the start. I did not use the editor until the end where I just had had enough. My party consisted of a tank (sword/shield), tank (pole weapons), Mage (archer), and priest (Archer). I would be confident in any RPG that this party is common and can succeed, but after many failures near the end and reading forum posts, specific character builds, not recommended, are it seems required in order to successfully finish the game. That is unacceptable but makes sense why an editor is attched.Battles in Avernum are turn based in which the true pain is highlighted. At the onset you will be highly overwhelmed in such a way enemies will hit what feels like 100% of the time while your main characters, no matter how you have them built, will be lucky to hit at 45%. I must have uninstalled and reinstalled the game half a dozen times it is so infuriating. What’s weird is around level 12 you start to feel somewhat capable, but then it all comes crashing back down around level 21. The inconsistences grow as you continue to get deeper in the game. If you are in a dungeon you at least have a fighting chance but out in the open where you can get surrounded, luck, potions, and a healthy healer is your only salvation. As a side note I started the game on hard difficulty as I do with all games, but seeing those statistics and constant early failures I dropped down to normal. I would like to say it made a difference, but not much.I spent over 100 hours in Avernum and I can’t think of a game that has made me more frustrated. Its complete broken character builds, mathematics and reliance to remain ‘old-school’ doesn’t help build an audience but keeps them away. Until I hear Spiderweb, who just celebrated 20 years in the business, address some modern design into their games, I’ll look elsewhere to spend my RPG time. Positives*The world, story and writing are very good. It’s very reminiscent of Edgar Allen Poeish in the description of places and people. *Quest design is excellent. *Great couch/ Laptop game never used a mouse.Negatives*Reliance on keeping old school mentality dooms the ability to grow an audience*If you release a character editor chances are the mathematics from your character builds, to enemy AI is broken. *No fast travel. There is some minor fast travel but I still figure 20+ hours is running around from place to place. Especially when trying to figure out a quest. The absolute #1 thing that needs implemented.*Shops don’t replenish goods. One of the most, if not most important potions, is frenzy where it increases your AP for a number of rounds. Because of the size of the world and number of quests, if you use them during some minor battles, when you get to the dragon fights or bosses at the end good luck if you are out.*Inventory as it has no effect for weight, unless worn, should be shared and have a sort button.*The loot is very weak. Because this is a dungeon crawler in 2015(released last year) loot should be awesome and your character should mirror that aesthetic, not remain static. *Because of the graphical fidelity sometimes loot is hard to see on the screen. An added button to highlight interactive objects would fix this problem. It didn’t bother me, but I know others have complained of the static camera.*A hit chance of 95% cannot =70%*Why are there not hidden passages at the end of a dungeon to go straight to the exit or at least a short cut?*Speech options remain even if you have used them*One of your main Mage and Priest abilities is to conjure a minion. They are completing useless and are nothing more than a distraction to enemies.  "

												This isn't a bad game by any means, but I found the actual interface you play with to be really frustrating. Picking up items is a chore and just moving around is a chore. Although I think it has an audience I didn't especially care for it and won't be picking up any other games by the same developer.			"

												Couldn't really get into it; the combat felt really repetitive and boring (coming from someone who regularly plays RPGs), not to mention the story was pretty bare. I could've gotten past all of it though if the game would literally even let me name my characters and pick a sprite for them. I mean, it's not like the dialogue EVER refers to them in any kind of individual sense. I get the feeling that there's an RPG someone would love hidden in here, but if you're at all like me this game's specific imperfections will leave you feeling perpetually unsatisfied.			"

												This is mainly in response to a lot of comments I've read in positive reviews about how good the writing is. I was really disappointed with it, and was hoping for much better writing, and though there isn't anything wrong with it, it really is very standard stuff, and not very original or entertaining.  The gameplay mechanics are fine,  as are the graphics, and I like the concept of being sent to an underground world, I was just really really disappointed by the writing. Perhaps it gets better, but for the seven hours I've played, it wasn't good.			"

												Only for the hardcorest of the hardcore turn-based strategy lovers. I have played Suikoden I and II from start to finish, Tactics Ogre, Suikoden Tactics, and Final Fantasy Tactics 3 times, plus both GBA games and the PSP remake as well. Not to mention Civilizations I-V. I LOVE turn-based strategy, in all of its forms. Or so I thought. This game is a member of a disturbingly expansive group of titles I like to call Keep Away Games. Remember the old childhood game keep away, where the whole point was to keep a certain person from getting a certain item they really wanted? This is similar, in that the fun is always kept JUUUUUUST outside your grasp. Ok, that's not true. Sometimes it flies so far over your head that the Sun blinds you, and you lose track of it completely.-Just when you're enjoying exploring the overworld, your characters get stuck because you're trying to click on the square next to you, but the game thinks you're clicking on you. Teeth starting to grate, CHECK.-Just when you're enjoying combat, you click to move 2 squares away, and the idiotic AI decides you meant you want to take 4 turns walking completely around the level, taking the absolute most circuitous route possible to get to your destination, rather than move TWO FREAKING STEPS IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. Bonus points if this idiocy costs you a battle. Prepare for lots of bonus points. Swearing at computer in multiple languages, CHECK CHECK.-Just when you've gotten a few dozen rounds of combat down and are feeling good about things, you hit a battle so ridiculously tough (in the same exact area you've been cleaning up) that you have to quicksave and quickload 3 dozen times, hoping to get an outcome where your entire party isn't stunned at the same time for the 3rd turn in a row again. Clicking on ""Delete Local Content,"" oh 10 minutes ago called to give you your CHECK.I would like to meet the person whose idea of fun is fighting 3 enemies, each of which can stun your entire group at once and summon other monsters to help, which each take 4-5 turns of your team's entire concentrated effort to kill, so that I can tattoo across their forehead in Helvetica bold ""FAULTY GENETIC CODE. DO NOT SLEEP WITH.""Controls are hideous as well. You can control the whole game via keyboard, and absolutely 165% should, but even that isn't well fleshed out. Hitting I opens up the inventory, of course, but DON'T hit I again. You have to hit ESC to close the menu. Hitting I again may accidentally use the item in your inventory to which the I key got arbitrarily assigned to. Small things like that really don't make that big of a difference, but they certainly don't help a game that already left a sour taste in my mouth.Games like this actually make me angry, because they have the potential to be SO. AWESOME. Idiotic controls, horrifically moronic AI, COMPLETE lack of direction, and stupefying difficulty spikes aside, you may enjoy this......if you're trapped on a desert island, or don't have enough money to afford aaaaaaaaanything else.

Nice try but not good enoughThe skill system is very shallow and just a min-max thing within a few variables. Story and quest management is ok-ish but nothing special. Grafics... well see for your self. You may have dosbox games with the same or better look.The controls are awful and clunky. Especially moving on the world map. Its a pain to steer a ship and your party because its so unprecise. Then you have the ui which is also annoying. For instance you open the inventory with a key but you cant close it with the same button wtf?! Then there are a lot of missclicks and unintentional clicks using menus like the inventory.I mean for a very low sale price like 80% or more off its ok if you need smth for a couple hours if you're bored. But overall its a better deal to get dos box and play stuff like return to krondor. The characters are bleak in Avernum with most of the story feeling also very pale. The writing is not good enough to overcome the technical limitations. You might get a retro feeling playing this and remember good old rpg times from the early pc games. But thats about it. I really cant recommend it for having a decent rpg feeling. For retro feeling yes but tbh... meh!			"

												I barely played this.  It looks like it could be a really fun and engaging RPG, but the interface really turned me off.  It's not because the graphics are simple, it's because they're ineffective.  Even when the game specifically tells you about something (like in the tutorial) it's difficult to spot items on the ground.  There's no way in hell I'm going to go through the entire game pressing G (to Get items) every few steps, and I don't want to just ""forget about it"" and miss countless opportunities.			"

												First of all, this game is WAY too fast. Your characters zip around at lightning speed, both in combat and outside it. The combat speed of the game is equally fast. Damage numbers, state changes, attacks, everything: it all goes so fast that it's hard to tell what's going on. For example, I couldn't tell which enemies my spells were working on, and which ones resisted it. There is no setting for game speed, so this is game-breaking. Secondly, the graphics suck. You can't tell what something looks like and it destroys the immersion. Honestly, this game has worse graphics than Fallout 1. The spell amimations and special affects are awful as well.Third, the controls are really clunky. You can't pass a turn. You can't select a character by clicking on them, you have to use the portraits. The inventory system and the way you pick up items is really wierd. Instead of having nice, neat action bars with abilities on it like every other turn-based rpg, you have to open menus in the middle of combat. It's so tedious. You can tell that very little thought or common sense went into the design choices. Fourth, the character developement and skill system is super streamlined. For example, there are only about 20 wizard spells and 20 priest spells in the entire game. And on top of that, you don't choose them. You unlock a specific spell everytime you gain a skill level in casting. The progression is about as linear as you can get. Oh, and rogues can't sneak or pickpocket for some reason. That's like one of the most basic aspects of RPG's! There are also no speech skills, so it looks like this game is 100% combat without any alternatives. Having multiple options, such as stealth or persuation, is one of the main pillars of RPG games and this game totally skips it.TL;DR-too fast-awful graphics-clunky controls-character development is about as simplified as possible.

												Simple role playing game about a group of adventurers that is abandonned into a world of caves, where humans barely managed to survive, and danger is around every corner.The first thing i noticed, is that this is an indy product, and therefore lacks the comfort and polish of famous titles of the genre. This includes, that battles play almost always the same, that information is poor, that loot and equipment on the ground isnt highlighted (and very easily overseen), that enemies on the world map need to be ""catched"" to get a fight, or that character developement is very simple.It still isnt a bad game though, but a solid mediocre, as it is pretty streamlined, and therefore doesnt feel as much as work as other competetors, while at the same time, offers enough content and quality to keep the player entertained:The graphics are nice, the interface is clear and intuitive, the overview is good, the battles are tactical and turn based and the content will keep you busy for dozens of hours. If you like role playing, you will most likely enjoy this one as well...For me, who isnt a RPG player anyway, though, the game didnt contain enough quality and polish to keep me entertained and playing.

The premise has spectacular potential, but it isn't well realized.

												Retro game that was quite a bit of fun, actually.  Not visually stimulating, but well-written for the most part, with some solid gameplay mechanics and some interesting and convenient ideas of its own.  Has a few annoying puzzle gimmicks that it will throw at you more than once, and puzzles are not exceptionally clever.  Still, the game was very good and very long for the cost.I'd say my only real complaint is the utter lack of a musical soundtrack.  I guess that was for ambiance?  It works alright, for the most part, but I think the game could have been much improved with a decent background soundtrack.Be warned, the game does not always provide you with a lot of direction, and is merciless if you happen to wander into an area that is too strong for you.  It will take a bit of trial and error to figure out exactly where you're strong enough to wander, at least at first.  The margin for error widens as your party gains strength toward the middle of the game, however.			"

												Second remake to the first game in one of my favorite game series of all time! Ages ago I pirated them when I was a kid with no credit card, so paying money for this felt so good. ^^This is at its core a very old school RPG with lots to see, do, talk to and/or kill. The sense of exploration is surpassed by very few games and the writing is great. The setting is basically an even larger (and MUCH deeper) version of Blackreach from Skyrim that is used as a penal colony by the tyrannical Empire that controls the surface world. The game does very little of telling you where to go, but there are 3 main quests that you will eventually find a trail to.Combat is admittedly kinda annoying at times. Don't play on hard because the enemies will have way too much hp and you'll just get frustrated. Have one character by a healer and KEEP THEM SAFE. Anyhows, super-recommended to anyone who ever liked old RPGs!			"

												A refreshed and recoded version of the fascinating 1995 indie RPG hit Exile: Escape From the Pit. If you enjoy exploration, turn-based strategic combat, and classic RPGs, this is definitely a great investment for the price. It is classic in the sense that it is highly dialogue and lore-driven, allowing for a large imaginative world filled with legends, myth and discovery. Avernum, much like it's source material, still has an impressive world map and environment to explore with hidden or special encounters for the curious.  Considering you can also purchase an iPad version of Avernum (available on the App store), it would make a great mobile RPG for those long commutes / trips. Recommended if you don't mind simpler graphics and a decent amount of reading.			"

												This is a remake of the original Avernum which was itself a remake of the Exile series so it's not exactly an original game. On the other hand the game itself is worthy of a remake. The story is a lot of fun, and the setting is fascinating. The game has a good mix of main quests and side quests and indeed you'll probably spend a lot of time wondering around doing side quests before you even find the main quests. On the subject of main quests there are actually three different main quest lines which can be completed independently of each other.In terms of mechanics this remake is staying reasonably true to the original. The stupid single map thing they had in Avernum 4-6 is gone and it's back to the traditional split between overland travel and town/dungoen maps. The skill system has been simplified somewhat but the addition of Battle Disiplines for fighters more than makes up for it.			"

												Avernum really harkens back to the days where games couldn't rely on graphics to sell, so instead, they put all their focus on gameplay and storytelling. Avernum's huge sandbox world that changes dependent on your party's actions is a huge draw, and the customization of your characters' abilities will leave you with tons of options on how to play the game. This is a remake of an older Windows game that I played nearly 15 years ago, and it's only gotten better with its age.			"

												Superb old-school turn-based (W)RPG! I think it still holds a trophy with most of my hours spent on one game on Steam.This is the remake of sorts from an award winning indie maker Jeff Vogel who actually made the game back during the 90es, but, for obvious reasons, the game needed to be updated to work with modern machines and OS', so after Jeff updated the engine starting from Avernum 4, he didn't want old game to be forgotten, so he rewrote the wole first game in new engine in 2011. It's fairly easy to see old genes still imbedded onto the game. Avernum: Escape from the pit is an Ultima style isometric turn-based RPG with unique skills and magic set into richly detailed fairly unique world with awesome, engaging writing and meticulously detaild maps. Narration and dialogues are the highlight, cause the game is old-school as it gets. No grim-brown realystic 3d graphic, no CGI cutscenes, but lovely prose with lots of charm and wit. Open ended world is one of the highlights. In theory you cn traverse the whole map, or at least most of it from the get-go, but areas do have unstated level requirement and you'll be quickly slaughtered if you go to the harder area than you'r level alows. Every city map is full of details, secret passages and metroid-esque still unreachable places, so don't expect to be 100% through with even the most basic of dungeons or cities up till the very end. Level progression is smooth and T-B combad is addictive in that ancient pokemon/Xcom/Fallout1&2 kind of way. So all in all, not to stretch this for too long, I'd warmly recommend the game for anyone wanting nice, solid T-B WRPG.			"

												A fine RPG styled like the games back in the DOS days. Not much handholding here, which takes some getting used to if you've grown accustomed to that. It has a sizeable world that's depressive, but still full of flavor. The game's not easy, it requires patience and cunning to get through its dungeons, castles and ruins. There are even hidden bosses that you might not want to trigger until you've grown a bit stronger. And there's often more than one way to approach a problem, or enter an area.

												Definitivelly a ""must have"" for all old scool RPG fans:Very well balanced with a good progressing curveThe lore is great and made me want to know all there is to know about AvernumThe battles ARE epic (you just need to put a epic music to go with it and to be able to use your imagination)Now just to warn about what this game don't have:No real player characteres development: no background, no personnality, no interraction between your four charactersNo stealth system (but better to have none than one useless or broken), this is not something missing really, I just wanted to have a backstabing silent assasin in my team when I started the game.No real replay value, there is very few alternative path, their is also probably only one good way to set up your team. (One play through took me 80hours so who care?)Sometime during fight, you will struggle to place your character where you want. And sometime the pathfinding will play againts you.Overall I highly recommand this game only for smart people... you are? right! "

												Avernum is an interesting game that is reminiscent of the RPGs from the 90s.  While the graphics aren't really there, the gameplay is pretty addicting and well worth the few bucks that I paid.There is a lot of traveling and exploration, with all sort of quests that require you to think a bit.  However, the puzzles are easy to figure out and offer great rewards.  The combat is pretty fun and simple.  This isn't anything spectacularly revolutionary, but it was a cheap thrill for me and I enjoyed it till the end without feeling as I was expecting more from it.  It is what it is: A simple RPG without any extra flair or new feature. I can honestly say that I had gotten more than my hours worth, exploring the underground kingdom for all sorts of lost treasure and whatnot.Rating: 5/5			"

												A remake of a remake of Exile, an indie RPG from the 1990s that was developed first for the Mac. This is actually a decent 2D story-driven exploration RPG in the vein of Ultima. The story (or at least setting) is original, which makes it stand out enough that I played it a lot longer than Avadon (another recent Spiderweb RPG) before getting distracted by other games.My only complaint is that the author doesn't know to put a one millisecond sleep call in his main game loops, so be prepared for having one of your CPU cores pegged at 100% usage while playing (which is especially frustrating on laptops, where power usage and heat dissipation / fan noise are concerns). This is a ridiculous oversight for a 2D game that is not heavy on the system requirements.			"

												This is the 3rd time this game has been released. Originally made in 1995, then re-released in 2000, Avernum is the effort of one man. This game excels at turn-based combat. It reminds me very much of RPG games before Diablo was considered a RPG. Top-down, party management with a good story line and some interesting characters along the way. Avernum has actually gotten better with age. A definate must buy.			"

												Pretty good overall. It's a little like Skyrim - large world and generally short quest lines. It's also graphically archaic, with a lot of the flavour being supplied by text descriptions, and the interface is a bit clunky. There's no steam demo but there is a fairly extensive demo on the Spiderweb website.			"

An amazing series of games, well worth any RPG fans time.There is no end to my love of Spiderweb Sofware games, great story woven into a challenging combat system and a true sense of being a cast out group of adventurers trying to make ends meet. I only wish that the 6 man party system was still available from the original Exile series.Lots of secrets and collectables to keep you going for hours and enough character diversity to have several playthroughs while trying out all sorts of different combinations of party members, there's even a built in character editor for when the going gets tough or if you want to have a godlike 1 man party.This rendition of the first game is a re-re-make of Exile: Escape From The Pit, updated to the geneforge engine I believe, providing more fluid animations, better sprites and a more stable environment for Windows users.(If you can stomach older games I highly recommend checking out the original Exile series available on Spiderwebs website. They do need some emulation to get working though.) "

												I don't know about this one. It's both retro and new and new (which is good), but you can sequence break your way into the abyss, great cave, and tonnes of other places without even getting a crown token.(Which can be bad for new players).You can get all the endings in one playthrough which is good, but your always broke, which is bad. Its a good game. People will treat you diffently based on how you act and what you do, Skill progression is slow, but balanced. People have more respect for you the acomplished you become, and where they're from. But if it's not your cup of tea to explore the world and get lost in every cave you come across... What are you still doing here?			"

												If you like retro CRPG you must play this. Or the rest of Spiderweb's catalogue, for that matter. Good writing, great storytelling, a vast array of NPCs and quests, the exact difficulty. The graphics are so simple that I look at them more like the miniatures in a tabletop RPG: something that you have to ""complete"" with your imagination.PROS:- Great story and storytelling.- Good writing.- LOTS of content.CONS:- The graphics may put some people off.- The UI is far from perfect.- The journal (where you consult the active quests) is a little messy.Overall: 9/10.

												I couldn't get into this game the first time around as Exile in 1994, nor the first remake many years ago as the original Avernum. I did play the first remakes of the sequels as Avernum 2 and 3 in the early 2000s and loved them. So, when Avernum: Escape From the Pit, the third remake of the original game came out, I was cautiously optimistic, played it for a bit, and then decided I had better things to do with my time.On hearing news of a renewed remake for Avernum II: Crystal Souls coming out later this month, I decied to give this another shot and have been pleasantly surprised. Unlike Avernum 2 or 3, this game doesn't have a large over-arching narrative to draw you in -- it's more of an exploratory game where you're (literally) thrown into a new world to explore and have to figure out how to make your way in it. It's a game driven by your own curiosity and determination to explore the rich new world, and figure out your place in it. It's also giving me a richer appreciation for what I know of the events of Avernums 2 and 3.			"

												Pros:-Easy to learn combat that still manages to heavily rely on tactical gameplay-Enough of a story line to keep you interested-Many many many hours of gameplay if you search out side content (I'm guessing I'm not even half way through the game yet at 41 hours)-Noticeable area difficulty - stray too far too soon and you're sure to get burned to a crisp-Skill customization - you can level whatever skills you like, as long as you've unlocked the prerequesite-Working control scheme that hasn't been brutalized in favor of controller support (as is the fad nowadays)Meh:-Character customization is pretty simplistic.  Choose from a handful of stock avatars.  Doesn't detract from the game, but doesn't stand out either.-Graphics - Same as the character customization, the graphics work, but feel rather dated.  At times, the art gives me the distinct feel of a late 90's PC RPG.Cons:-At times, it can be easy to get lost when looking for new locations, even with the help of a questline.  While this can sometimes lead to good things, like finding secret areas, more often than not it has caused me to wander into areas above my level, causing me to die or run away screaming.  This is subjective of course, as I may also have poor sense of direction lol.-When learning to play the game, you really need to pay attention to what strategies work in combat, or you'll find yourself in frustrating situations.  In the beginning, almost any strategy works, misleading you into thinking your current strategies are good enough.  In reality, I found myself being forced to reroll a new game a couple times just to try some different approaches to combat.  New starting skills to aid in my survivability and varying methods of damage output, to fight tough enemies like mages that like to disable half (or more) of your team in a single shot.(Honestly, I'm not sure if this is a Con or a Pro, as it really makes you think and adds to the strategy any RPG.  But it can be frustrating all the same, having to restart because your current builds can't counter something.  Casual gamers and those new to this type of game, may have trouble with this.)Summary:Awesome game.  Plays a lot like older and newer turn based RPGs, like Divinity:OS or perhaps Fallout Tactics:BoS.  Sure to be enjoyed by anyone that's a fan of turnbased isometric RPGs.			"

												I played this game from start to finish. After a while I just kept playing because I wanted to see it done. I didn't enjoy it anymore, but I talked myself into finishing it anyway, to be able to give it a full review.First of all, it's VERY light for a RPG. Your characters have no personality whatsoever. And it doesn't matter at all what you say to the NPCs you meet - you can just talk to them again, which starts the conversation over from the beginning. Your only concern is how to level up. Second, it's waaaay to action oriented. Your characters are running at a feverish pace all through the game to get around the next corner or into the next fight. It does help those ""deliver a message""-quests though.Third, while I like the main quest, the game is littered with pure grinding quests, like ""get me some shovels"", ""get me some flour"", and in time you'll have 20+ missions lined up, turning you into a quest-solving machine, running in turbo across the map, zipping through dialogue that doesn't matter, without any chance of it affecting your characters in any way except making them stronger, mightinger, richer, whateverer.This game is for power players who want bigger, meaner characters with zero personality.Good sides of the game is aforementioned main quest, acceptable NPCs, and a couple of memorable moments. But with achievements like ""I got all the spells and maxed them out two times"", you know it's a grinder.With main characters that you don't care about, why care about anything? Just kill everything, like you're killing time playing this.  "

												I expected this game to be better, but it's still very good.To explain this, I'll have to say that the first Spiderweb game I ever had was Exile 3. It was... well, huge doesn't even begin to describe it. Back then, I didn't know a single english word, but I still played that game (the shareware part, at least) for WEEKS. It took days to even notice that there were shareware restrictions, and then I just started a new game... and it was completely different. The world of Exile 3 was so huge, and there was so much to do, it was practically impossible to play the same story twice. A single decision could change everything.I miss that. Yes, Avernum has sideplots - important sideplots even. Your decision also influence the story in noticeable ways. Still, compared to Exile 3, where half the sidequests seemed to be at least as important and satisfying as the main quests, Avernum is slightly lacking in diversity.All of that aside, it's still a great game. The developers of Spiderweb Software have once more (re-)created a huge world, an epic storyweb (I simply refuse to call the complex plot of any of their games a simple storyLINE), many complex and believable characters... and made all of it work with, not despite, limited resources.My recommendation therefore remains: If you like to get completely lost in a game, if you're looking for a captivating story, If you want to truly identify with the characters of a game, and if all of that is more important to you than fancy graphics and the +12 Sword of <insert fancy name here>, then there's nothing better than a Spiderweb game. NOTHING.			"

(Avernum 2 Crystal Souls and the as yet unreleased Avernum 3)I can't tell you how happy I was to see these game come back.This game is HUGE. Think Skyrim huge. It requires a tonne of reading, as none of the dialogue is spoken aloud.If you enjoy reading, spells, and lore then buy this game.9/10The keyboard shortcuts are different than the original so it took alot of relearning. There's also far fewer random encounters (if really any) so gaining experience is somewhat of a strategic challenge.There's no party editer like there was with the original Exile games which is nice. Less temptation, more challenge.Be careful however, when you kill someone in this game they are dead and that has lasting consequences.			"

Boy was i wrong, this game sucked me in from the very start and i cant wait to do another playthru to do some of the smaller quests and try and take my luck at other pary comps.Absolute must buy when the avernum set is on saleGraphics 7/10 lets just be real youre not buying this game for the graphics. They are very simple but get the job done.Story 9/10 You quickly realize that this game has huge depth. There are so many locations and areas way across the map that tie into each other.Battle System 9/10 The battle system is actually pretty simple but is very addicting and requires some decent strategy for harder battles. Only real complaint is that sometimes it is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to select a gride close to enemies if that enemy in question is larger and blocks that grid.Leveling and skill tree 8/10 The leveling and skills system is pretty basic but has just enough depth to allow some pretty decent character development. The system uses a 3 pronged system which isnt too bad. Provided me with some interesting character combos that i liked.Overall 9/10 With the combination of the outstanding setting and story with a good battle system and decent character custimization Avernum Escape From the Pit will provide you with many hours of excitement.

												Avernum was one of the staples of my childhood. While I admit that games like this are almost exclusively niche appeal, Avernum has a deep enthralling world that was the first of the RPG genre to really bring me in. There's lore everywhere, and in a game where the top down setting would get in the way of that, it actually shines here. The world feels real despite not being first or third person, couple that with cool battles, spells, enemies, skills, and of course, sweet loot, makes Avernum quite a good series. If you've never liked RPGs or games of this top down turn based genre before, however, this will not change your mind.			"

												This is a remake of the original Avernum which was itself a remake of the Exile series so it's not exactly an original game. On the other hand the game itself is worthy of a remake. The story is a lot of fun, and the setting is fascinating. The game has a good mix of main quests and side quests and indeed you'll probably spend a lot of time wondering around doing side quests before you even find the main quests. On the subject of main quests there are actually three different main quest lines which can be completed independently of each other.In terms of mechanics this remake is staying reasonably true to the original. The stupid single map thing they had in Avernum 4-6 is gone and it's back to the traditional split between overland travel and town/dungoen maps. The skill system has been simplified somewhat but the addition of Battle Disiplines for fighters more than makes up for it.			"

The system is built around old classics like Baldur's Gate, it offers a strategic element to play which varies widely by what you choose. The hard stats and skills have been redesigned from the original series to offer new stat trees to the gameplay allowing for character customization.

												A refreshed and recoded version of the fascinating 1995 indie RPG hit Exile: Escape From the Pit. If you enjoy exploration, turn-based strategic combat, and classic RPGs, this is definitely a great investment for the price. It is classic in the sense that it is highly dialogue and lore-driven, allowing for a large imaginative world filled with legends, myth and discovery. Avernum, much like it's source material, still has an impressive world map and environment to explore with hidden or special encounters for the curious.  Considering you can also purchase an iPad version of Avernum (available on the App store), it would make a great mobile RPG for those long commutes / trips. Recommended if you don't mind simpler graphics and a decent amount of reading.			"

												I'm an old-school gamer from the time when characters on the screen were represented by simple symbols and squiggly lines. To draw people in to play the games back then the games had to be either utterly fun or have a great story. Games like Ultima IV were like that, utterly horrible looking but so deep you could play through it ten times and still not find eveything the game had to offer.""Avernum: Escape from the Pit"" [AEftP] is just like that...Except that the graphics are actually fairly good. This is a HUGE roleplaying game with so much ground to cover that you at first don't know what to do or where to go. As you start the game you're free to explore everything and everywhere, even places that will get you killed instantly.The game relies heavily descriptions and dialogue, so if you're afraid of reading this game might not be for you. However, if you DO like to read you'll find a game with great storytelling, a good combat system, and more content than you can burn through in a month.			"

												The new version (formely Avernum and Exile) looks better than ever.It's good to reminisce every now and than about the long lost days of youth :).The character development system is new (the same system from Avadon) so you can try new game styles. The graphic update, while may not seem as much, is pleasant. The story, as always, is good.I can't wait for the rewrite of Avernum 2 which should be done after Avadon 2 (probably by the end of 2014).I highly recommend checking SpiderWeb's other games at: http://www.spidweb.com/ "

												Superb old-school turn-based (W)RPG! I think it still holds a trophy with most of my hours spent on one game on Steam.This is the remake of sorts from an award winning indie maker Jeff Vogel who actually made the game back during the 90es, but, for obvious reasons, the game needed to be updated to work with modern machines and OS', so after Jeff updated the engine starting from Avernum 4, he didn't want old game to be forgotten, so he rewrote the wole first game in new engine in 2011. It's fairly easy to see old genes still imbedded onto the game. Avernum: Escape from the pit is an Ultima style isometric turn-based RPG with unique skills and magic set into richly detailed fairly unique world with awesome, engaging writing and meticulously detaild maps. Narration and dialogues are the highlight, cause the game is old-school as it gets. No grim-brown realystic 3d graphic, no CGI cutscenes, but lovely prose with lots of charm and wit. Open ended world is one of the highlights. In theory you cn traverse the whole map, or at least most of it from the get-go, but areas do have unstated level requirement and you'll be quickly slaughtered if you go to the harder area than you'r level alows. Every city map is full of details, secret passages and metroid-esque still unreachable places, so don't expect to be 100% through with even the most basic of dungeons or cities up till the very end. Level progression is smooth and T-B combad is addictive in that ancient pokemon/Xcom/Fallout1&2 kind of way. So all in all, not to stretch this for too long, I'd warmly recommend the game for anyone wanting nice, solid T-B WRPG.			"

												Avernum was one of the staples of my childhood. While I admit that games like this are almost exclusively niche appeal, Avernum has a deep enthralling world that was the first of the RPG genre to really bring me in. There's lore everywhere, and in a game where the top down setting would get in the way of that, it actually shines here. The world feels real despite not being first or third person, couple that with cool battles, spells, enemies, skills, and of course, sweet loot, makes Avernum quite a good series. If you've never liked RPGs or games of this top down turn based genre before, however, this will not change your mind.			"

												Avernum is the redesign of the original Exile series by Spiderweb Software. It is an amazing game with rich story resulting in countless hours of gameplay. The system is built around old classics like Baldur's Gate, it offers a strategic element to play which varies widely by what you choose. The hard stats and skills have been redesigned from the original series to offer new stat trees to the gameplay allowing for character customization. Overall I recommend this game to any old school RPG fans.			"

												Avernum really harkens back to the days where games couldn't rely on graphics to sell, so instead, they put all their focus on gameplay and storytelling. Avernum's huge sandbox world that changes dependent on your party's actions is a huge draw, and the customization of your characters' abilities will leave you with tons of options on how to play the game. This is a remake of an older Windows game that I played nearly 15 years ago, and it's only gotten better with its age.			"

												A classic isometric RPG experience. The dialogue and setting is sometimes uninspiring, but, the gameplay is solid and very similar to to the Baldur's Gate/Infinity Engine series of games.

Worth playing if you enjoy classic RPGs, but don't expect miracles or an amazing plot.			"

An amazing series of games, well worth any RPG fans time.There is no end to my love of Spiderweb Sofware games, great story woven into a challenging combat system and a true sense of being a cast out group of adventurers trying to make ends meet. I only wish that the 6 man party system was still available from the original Exile series.Lots of secrets and collectables to keep you going for hours and enough character diversity to have several playthroughs while trying out all sorts of different combinations of party members, there's even a built in character editor for when the going gets tough or if you want to have a godlike 1 man party.This rendition of the first game is a re-re-make of Exile: Escape From The Pit, updated to the geneforge engine I believe, providing more fluid animations, better sprites and a more stable environment for Windows users.(If you can stomach older games I highly recommend checking out the original Exile series available on Spiderwebs website.

												I had Exile: Escape from the Pit as a shareware version however many years ago it was new. (It was close to 30; I'm not going to bother looking it up.) I was very poor then, and couldn't afford to pay to unlock it, so I just played the trial content repeatedly. The gameplay was that engaging that I didn't really need the storyline, but oh, how I wanted it.Now, here it is, the full story, with the incredible turn-based tactical battle system that I remember, and even better graphics than the original. (Dated, perhaps, but I like retro.) Avernum presents a world where your choices matter, and there are a lot of them to make. Character development is flexible, and you're presented with difficult trade-offs to meet competing priorities. The possibilities to make up your party of four are practically infinite, giving the game a lot of replay value as well.If you like games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Suikoden Tactics for the battle systems, this is definitely worth your attention.

												I couldn't get into this game the first time around as Exile in 1994, nor the first remake many years ago as the original Avernum. I did play the first remakes of the sequels as Avernum 2 and 3 in the early 2000s and loved them. So, when Avernum: Escape From the Pit, the third remake of the original game came out, I was cautiously optimistic, played it for a bit, and then decided I had better things to do with my time.On hearing news of a renewed remake for Avernum II: Crystal Souls coming out later this month, I decied to give this another shot and have been pleasantly surprised. Unlike Avernum 2 or 3, this game doesn't have a large over-arching narrative to draw you in -- it's more of an exploratory game where you're (literally) thrown into a new world to explore and have to figure out how to make your way in it. It's a game driven by your own curiosity and determination to explore the rich new world, and figure out your place in it. It's also giving me a richer appreciation for what I know of the events of Avernums 2 and 3.			"

												I played this back when it was still Exile. I loved it then even though I just had the demo version. I'm super psyched to have this cleaned up and prettier version to play. Its a lot like Baldur's Gate or the early Fallout games in play style. The story is good and the world is explorable and expansive.			"

												I played this game from start to finish. After a while I just kept playing because I wanted to see it done. I didn't enjoy it anymore, but I talked myself into finishing it anyway, to be able to give it a full review.First of all, it's VERY light for a RPG. Your characters have no personality whatsoever. And it doesn't matter at all what you say to the NPCs you meet - you can just talk to them again, which starts the conversation over from the beginning. Your only concern is how to level up. Second, it's waaaay to action oriented. Your characters are running at a feverish pace all through the game to get around the next corner or into the next fight. It does help those ""deliver a message""-quests though.Third, while I like the main quest, the game is littered with pure grinding quests, like ""get me some shovels"", ""get me some flour"", and in time you'll have 20+ missions lined up, turning you into a quest-solving machine, running in turbo across the map, zipping through dialogue that doesn't matter, without any chance of it affecting your characters in any way except making them stronger, mightinger, richer, whateverer.This game is for power players who want bigger, meaner characters with zero personality.Good sides of the game is aforementioned main quest, acceptable NPCs, and a couple of memorable moments. But with achievements like ""I got all the spells and maxed them out two times"", you know it's a grinder.With main characters that you don't care about, why care about anything? Just kill everything, like you're killing time playing this.  "

												This is one of those games that I keep coming back. It has a very compelling (so far) story, a reasonably complex character building. And is wholly turn based, so you can keep out for 3 hours and forget to turn the game off, what probably justifies the big game hours that I have.I have never finished the game. Not that I ever finish a game: I've never finished Oblivion, Skyrim, Morrowind...The good:Clever rogue-like x tactical turn-based combat ;Interesting development choices for your characters: there are no ""classes"" in the normal sense. I currently have a party of a tank priest, tank mage, a spearman and a swordsman, both starting in the healing arts, now.Open game: Playing on the average difficulty, there are places where I still do not dare to go in the game. Oh, and it is an open-game: want to go all the way down to the pits of doom? Be my guest, and good luck : you will need a lot of it and lots of reloads, but it is possible...Compelling and well told story. You are thrown into a subterranean world by an evil emperor, and that happens to be the fate of every other human thrown there... If you wink the wrong may, say something you wouldn't, you will end up here. When you get there you find an struggling, evolving society, based on the growth of magical fungus and trees. ANd not without their power struggles: there are the catlike nephilim, also thrown here by hawthorne, and the native (?) slithzerikai, lizard men native to the place... And the avernites are at war with both. Not mentioning the abyss, where the most dangerous criminals are exiled from avernum itself... All this is told you by clever character dialogs (text based), where you feel the despair of the inhabitants, some of the depression, craziness...  And there is no way out (or is there)?The bad: The user interface is annoying: I had to manually edit many of the stock sprite screens to be able to identify objects that I can pick up (made the sprites have green stars when they are pickable). There are many objects that are not obvious containers (a bonfire, a dead body, a pile of skulls), yet they are... The map is isometric, and the walls are all opaque, making for situations where you simply can't find an object to interact with. The inventory screen doesn't show your armor and protection levels, making you bounce back and forth between the inventory and character sheet. Inventory . Esc. Character sheet . esc. inventory... The map is made of elevated isometric tiles: this can make the identification of where in the grid a foe is on the combat screen difficult some times... And you can't target properly area of effect spells... sometimes the characters get literally in the way of the actual square where you want to center a spell. Other times, this same visualization issues can make you target a square that is out of range , making you lose a turn by accident. Oh, and the keys for attack and shoot are the exact same: you switch them with the s key. Making you try a melee combat when you want to shoot, and vice-versa. "

												Only just discovered this series and Spiderweb this month....Guess I've been out of loop all these years. Amazingly under-rated gem. If your a fan of classic crpgs like BG this game is for you. For the price you'll easily get your moneys worth and then some. I plan to do a full review once I complete the game.			"

												I was soo happy when I saw this on sale. A great game that I thought I would never see on steam because it was just too good. Although you can't play as the nephilim or slithzerikai like in prevous versions of the game, which is a bit sad as those races were really fun to play and beats playing as a human any day. Still a good remake of a classic game though, highly recommend.			"

												Yes, this is the second remake of the classic Spiderweb Software RPG that started the whole ball rolling, Exile: Escape from the Pit. So if you've played either previous version, there's new content but you may well find it overfamiliar. That said, people new to this particular franchise should absolutely jump in here. It has all the glorious unfettered exploration of that vast underground cavern and the hard-bitten criminals and political dissidents that fight to survive it that made the previous editions so good, but with significant graphical improvements, a more modern interface and design, certain conveniences, and of course achievements. Also, it's cheap.			"

												A classic-styled RPG with a few unobtrusive modern implementations. If you like immersing yourself in a slow-paced story and light strategy, this is the game for you. Try the demo first.As a warning, if you've played the past Avernum game or Exile, the narrative is more or less the same.			"

												Countless hours can be sunk into this game. Classic old school RPG epic, teeming with nooks and crannies to sink your teeth into.Between cheats, difficulty adjustment, balance, and a straight up character editor, there's no way this game will be ultimately too hard for you to beat. Lots of reading though. That could be good or bad depending on your view point. The writing is great.			"

												This game has a really good storytelling the only BUT is that you have to learn everything there is no tutorial like wtf... and btw... use hotkeys in battle they are really useful and save u alot of time also the quickcasting. Well there is alot that can make your life easier if you find out how to use it.. so spam everything at the beginning. Also when you obtain something it feels like you deserve it, the gold is hard to find get every item that you can sell.. Great game great game (: over 80 hours of fun right now and im planning on finishing this series slowly			"

												I learned of the Avernum series back when the original Avernum 1 was new. It quickly swept me away with its huge open world and freeform exploration. In addition, the world of Avernum is both unique and well-developed. This was all just from the demo as I was never able to get the full game until it was released years later on GOG. Escape From the Pit is a revamped remake of Avernum, and it takes the game to the next level. I'm looking forward to getting Crystal Souls!If you're looking for fancy graphics and intense special effects, this may not be for you. To me, the visuals are excellent as I love the isometric style. However the true excellence of the Avernum series, as with all of the games made by Spiderweb Software, is the depth of the story and the excitement of free exploration.			"
