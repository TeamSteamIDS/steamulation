YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Saturday Morning RPG 

			Views: 14,806		

			Having grown up on Saturday morning cartoons like G.I. Joe and Transformers, Trent takes a look at the latest mobile title to find its way to the PC.		

Nostalgia is a powerful force and one look at what's currently on the market for gamers can attest to what a soft spot consumers have for it. The downloadable market is flooded with games that emulate everything from 16-bit RPGs to 2d platformers. Kickstarter has brought us updates and sequels to the games we grew up on and some of the key titles that defined the childhoods of 90's gamers have received HD re-releases. While some games simply play the nostalgia card to give us the warm fuzzy feelings that get us to open our wallets faster than an inebriated middle aged man at a strip joint, others use nostalgia as a vehicle for humor and personality. Saturday morning RPG falls into the latter category. Following an interesting episodic structure, Saturday Morning RPG places players in the role of Marty, an average teenager who is given a magic trapper keeper by a power glove clad figure called The Wizard in order to face off with Commander Hood. It waste's no time conjuring images of Fred Savage and a certain band of real American Heroes. Each episode plays out like an episode of your favorite 1980's cartoon with some sort of malicious force attempting to carry out a destructive plan and your Hero's journey to thwart their efforts. The episodic structure is actually quite interesting, your level and inventory carries over between episodes and players can go back to previous episodes to uncover missed items and sidequests. Also there are a couple minor cases where something that your character does in one episode carries over in another. The narrative elements are minimalistic but some characters carry over between episodes creating a bit of continuity. The problem is that characters have very little personality, they instead lean too heavily on what they are supposed to reference. Players who are unfamiliar with the source material used to create these characters will find little interest in them and some of the jokes centered around some of these characters read like overused memes.  Unlike most RPGs, Saturday Morning RPG doesn't dwell too much on it's narrative and in instead a bit more focused on combat and it managed to offer a surprisingly robust system for a small budget title. Aside from sharing an acronym with Super Mario RPG, Saturday Morning RPG borrows heavily from the timing based combat system in Mario's first role playing outing. Timing button presses during attacks yields greater damage and timing a button press at the last second can help players avoid major damage. Almost every special attack has some sort of mini game that requires a bit of skill and dexterity to make the most of. In addition, turns can be sacrificed in order to charge Marty up, giving him a damage multiplier. The charge function can be used in one of three ways, the first and most effective requires players to rapidly press buttons to build the multiplier, another requires timed button presses to make the most of the multiplier's potential and finally there is a charge function that requires no interaction but yields the smallest multiplier. Being able to dish out five times the damage in a single turn makes it well worth foregoing an action. Additionally, there are dozens of items and up to five can be equipped--each giving Marty a new special attack. Their abilities recall the abilities that Final Fantasy's Blue Mages are capable of learning and provide a mix of offensive and defensive skills.  The final piece of the combat puzzle comes in the form of stickers and covers for Marty's magic trapper keeper. The cover can be swapped out for a stat buff and up to five scratch and sniff stickers can adorn the front. At the onset of each battle, a fixed period of time is allotted for players to scratch each one of these stickers. Doing so can further buff Marty's stats or debuff your foes. The catch is that the more rewarding the buff or debuff, the more time it takes to scratch the sticker so finding the most beneficial combination of stickers that you can feasibly and consistently activate before each battle adds an appreciable degree of strategy.  The problem with this whole system is two fold, the first of which is that fact that it can make the game exhausting to play. Starting each and every battle furiously smashing our analog stick back and forth to scratch stickers then mashing the A button like a coked out woodpecker in order to gain the highest multiplier become taxing. It should be noted that Saturday Morning RPG was originally designed with phones and tablets in mind so some control input issues are not surprising. The other, more serious problem however is that the game is simply too easy. Anyone who is reasonably quick and has respectable timing will breeze through the game largely unopposed. It is completely feasible to build a multiplier in one turn and knock a boss out with your second action. There is one fight however that is an appreciable test of your skills and ability to strategize to be uncovered. Rounding out the trip down memory lane, Saturday Morning RPG features a hodgepodge of graphical elements to recall games of the past. Characters are composed of 16 bit style sprites but inhabit a 3d world recalling the look of Paper Mario. The environments are rendered in simple 3D with a cartoonish aesthetic. Unfortunately the environments can appear too simplistic at times with blocky geometry and flat textures. Being a mobile device port, it's not surprising that the tech isn't up to scratch but a little more spit and polish for the PC release could have really given Saturday Morning RPG an invigorating style. Audio is generally strong however with a soundtrack composed by Vince DiCola of Rocky IV fame and Kenny Meriedeth.  Saturday Morning RPG a solid and enjoyable game for those familiar with the pop culture of the 1980's and early 1990's but gamers unfamiliar with the bag from which it pulls it's gags are less likely to be tickled by it's appeal to nostalgia. Even so, the robust combat system and episodic gameplay make it really enjoyable to play and if you feel so inclined, replay. It's just unfortunate that players who want a bit of a challenge have to dig for secret boss fights to find it and that your favorite input device may fall victim to the harsh stick waggleing and button mashing required to play. Even still with a budget price, four complete episodes to enjoy and a fifth and sixth on the way, the good exceeds the bad and if you are of the right temperament, you may even find the experience totally righteous.

												How many of us remember waking up early on Saturday morning when we were back in school, when the biggest question wasn't ""how much sugar disguised as breakfast food can we down in a sitting"", it was ""what cartoons do we want to watch?""  Those were the good old days- when CBS, ABC, NBC and FOX all had Saturday Morning blocks of cartoons. You get to play as Marty, a guy who watches too many of these old cartoons.  His goal is to stop the forces of evil from taking over the world- and to stop them by using as many 80s pop-culture references as he can cram in his Trapper Keeper.  You can attach scratch-and-sniff stickers to your binder to give you special powers and increased stats when you scratch them, but let's face it- Marty's no Lion-O when it comes to battle.  Relying on physical attacks just won't get you anywhere- instead, you can rely on those same pop-culture shoutouts, like giant plastic playsets (like G.I. Joe's old giant carriers) and rainbow-striped zebras, and obvious knockoffs of Care Bears to do damage. If you remember the late 80s, you'll love all the shoutouts to cartoons that anyone born after the early 90s will never get the references to- if you were born later, you'll love the game for its playstyle- it's easy to pick up, fun to play, and it won't run you that much.  There are four episodes currently- if you count the overly short and played-up-for-cheesiness Christmas Special, and I'd like to see a fifth, if they ever decide to make one- or a sequel.			"

												Saturday Morning RPG could be really good game ... but something went wrong. I really enjoy playing episode one. It was something fresh, kinda fun, had cool elements, it wasn´t too long and it hold my attention whole time. Episode two was quite good as well. I played it twice (because achievements), but i started to feel slightly unsatisfied, as I continued.This satisfaction issue erupts in episode three. It was maybe fatigue from previous two episodes, but i was completly overwhelmed by battles. After some time it is soooooooooo booooooooooooring to fight anything and anyone here. Only thing you have to do is use same formula, and you win. Also i didnt even try to do something else because i care less and less. I felt this episode was unnecessarily long, not well paced, and some traveling points were completly useless.I just flew over episode 4, did what i had to and quit.Saturday Morning RPG had good beginning, but it start crumbling in later stages. It wasn´t well paced, i didn´t care about story at all,  battles wasn´t challenging at all, and even nostalgia avoided me.Even though i said what i said, i recommend SMRPG, for EP1 and partially for EP2.I want to like this game so much.Grade: C "

												Saturday Morning RPG;It is an episodic RPG game with Final Fantasy styled encounters. Quite possibly one of the most fun little games I've ever picked up off the Steam store. The episodes are around 30 minutes long. Just around the length of a Saturday morning cartoon. The combat system is easy to get used to and works well with an Xbox controller. Tons of fhidden items in the game that you should find but don't worry, if you don't find something on your first playthrough you can return to the episode and play it through again and find what you missed. Definitely recommend buying this game if you come across it while it's on sale. Pros:- Short Episodes- Fun Combat- Great Story Writing/Jokes- ReplayableCons:- Could Have Had Some Voice ActingFinal Verdict;9/10			"

												This game is better then I expected. It's got that nice classy arcade graphics with that 80's cartoon twist. I understand the references even though I was not born in the 80's. It has a lot of creative RPG elements in the game which I didn't expect so much. If you are a big RPG fan, I would defintely recommend getting this game. It's fun and I could go on for hours. :) 9.5/10			"

												Saturday Morning RPG is a nostalgia based RPG with turn based battles that use timing and button mashing attacks. It is a love letter to 80s cartoons, full of nostalgia.It feels incredibly unique for a RPG with a style all its own. You get a trapper keeper that you can put stickers on it for buffs. Well a chance at buffs. You can put 5 stickers on the trapper keeper, but when a battle starts, you have a certain amount of time to scratch the stickers for buffs in battle. The battles are incredibly simple, yet take far too long. You have powers, none of which feels powerful. Each power has a limited amount of uses per battle, but it replenishes after each battle. The battle has a timeline. Depending on what attack you're going to use determines where you are on the timeline. Certain attacks are quicker, such as using the pencil put you first. When a battle starts, the enemy always goes first. No matter how many times the game bluntly tells you 'sneak attack,' they'll always attack first. It feels like a glitch. Most abilities have button timings to do more damage.Because your abilities and attacks do little damage, you have the ability to 'charge your battery' which will become a damage multiplier for your next ability or attack. You can keep charging until its 9.9x. You have a variety of ways to charge the battery, either by spamming a button to charge it, being accurate on a slide bar or just picking a default 2.8x. I got tired of button mashing, so I just always selected the default 2.8x.You can get more abilities by finding them or purchasing them in vending machines. You have to do something with the gold you collect. Like the stickers, you can only have 5 abilities equipped at once, but that's enough. I made it through the entire game without buying an extra ability. I would visit the vending machines, see everything laid out and there wouldn't be any descriptions. Sure I could buy the abilities and equip them to see what they did, but my first episode abilities were good enough to take me through the entirety of the game.Most of the abilities and attacks all have a timing to them. I never really liked timing based attacks, because you quickly get the hang of it and exploit it. That's probably why other RPGs just use random chance. However, the powers can only be used X amount of times in battle. After each battle you're fully recharged. HP, MP, powers and everything. You never get any other characters, its just you against Cobra soldiers, He Man lizard men and Transformer robots.You can block / dodge attacks by pushing a button at the right time, but even though it tells you that you defended, it sometimes damages you more than an undefended attack. I'm not sure if that's a bug. The timing with some things seems off where I know that I've missed a perfect time window, but it still counted as perfect. It is also odd hearing a boss laugh about how you fool energy attacks only make me stronger, right after I energy attack him, right before he dies after saying that. It is also odd that I can get a 'sneak attack' on an enemy where it bluntly tells me sneak attack, yet the enemies get to go first. You'll see the enemies on the map, so there are no random battles. Enemies don't respawn, so you can't really grind. The enemies and battlers aren't varied enough and eventually just feel like a chore. Another cluster of 3 soldiers, another pair of red transformers. Even moving into episode 3, you'll still find the same soldiers from episode 2.If you die, then you just restart the battle or from the last checkpoint. That keeps you playing with no real consequence for losing. To top that off, there is an arrow that bluntly points you in the direction of your current quest. You will beat this game if you keep playing.The overhead map uses 2D sprites on a 3D map... yep. You heart that right. The 2D 16 bit sprites on a 3D map with millions of colors. It just looks out of place. The sprites aren't that impressive, but the 3D has a good look to it. It makes me think this game was rushed or cheap. They could have done 3D modeled characters, because the entire world is 3D modeled, but nothing is animated outside of the 2D sprites.The game has four 'episodes' and they're pretty quick within 40 - 50 minutes each. There is usually one puzzle per dungeon / episode. The puzzles show some interesting stuff and real thought put into them. If only there could have been more to keep me engaged. The final episode was a disappointment and just felt quick with no challenge, the final boss was a sad pushover.The game takes a brief 3 hours or so to complete it. There are side quests, an endless battle mode and an arena mode. I just can't justify the $7 for this game when it wasn't fun. I've played other games that I really enjoyed that last only 3 hours, but this isn't one of them.This game just seems rushed and shallow. More like a set of awful mini games disguised as a RPG. Battles are extremely repetitive and you feel very underpowered. You'll button mash far too much to buff yourself so you can actually damage enemies. Each attack takes way too long due to attack animations and killing animations. It also feels pretty linear even if episode 2 opens up into a less linear area, which is entirely inside of a school.Avoid this game.			"

												Saturday Morning RPG is a love letter to 80s nostalgia while at the same time playing homage to the timed-hits style battle system that has shown up before in RPGs. While I wasn't an 80s kid so I was never the biggest G.I. Joe or Transformer fan, I do know a lot about the pop culture of the time and I'm a huge fan of films from the decade.The real draw here was the game's battle system to me. I'm a huge Super Mario RPG fan, and this game draws inspiration from the series that follow it up: Paper Mario. It's also been used in Costume Quest (which the game is more similar to in design), and will even be in the upcoming South Park: The Stick of Truth. So as a fan of the genre, I felt it was nesscary to toss down the cash on it. And I enjoyed it. The game isn't the best RPG I've ever played (of all time...ever), but it's the writing, humor, and references that made me want to keep playing. Now, I've heard people saying this is a short game. Well, not really. You aren't going to beat this game quickly unless you skip all the side-quests and head straight from point A to point B. I don't suggest this. You'll miss out on a lot of a fun events, like when you find a Mogwai-esque creature and have the choice to feed it and get it wet before giving it back to Phoebe Cates herself. There IS a point around the third episode where the battles started to feel repetitive, but that soon went away as I found myself smashing Transformers with a freakin' axe. Not everyone is going to like it, but there are enough options in battle to keep situations fresh if need be. Better healing options (I didn't find a single GREAT healing item in my run) and more PCs (or a Paper Mario-esque helper) would have spiced up the battles, but if you're a fan of this type of battle system then you'll enjoy it.  You'll spend almost 5 hours with the first four episodes of Saturday Morning RPG. Another five more if you go back for achievements or try a hand at the other game modes. And for $7, it's in a good price range where a blind buy isn't risky if you're a fan of the genre and have just a little knowledge of the 80s. It's not the best RPG of all time, but it's a great indie effort and I'm always happy to see more of these. (7/10) Recommended If You Like: Paper Mario Costume Quest 80s movies, cartoon, and general pop culture			"

												Genre - Western Nostalgic JRPGI played a couple of episodes this on the ipod touch and I loved it because of the massive nostalgia/humour factor. It is actually fun to play with many weapons types and subtle tactics to use to win fights. Please bear in mind that this was a phone app originally and came to Steam via Greenlight so it is not a state of the art game. If you are in your 30s though you will definately find something in this game that brings a tear to your eye either of laughter or a memory of your youth...			"

												Despite the fact that it is almost always on sale somewhere this is a fairly decent little romp. I can't say I'm overwhelmed with the much vaunted ""humour"" (and I AM a child of the 80's having been birthed in the 70's). The gameplay is nothing special either but it's good enough to be more than worth the pitiful ammount this game sells for. You could do a lot worse for a lot more cash. Pick it up, use it as filler, and you will have a little fun.			"

												I find it a shame and astonishing that a game as good as Saturday Morning RPG has not done better commercially. The game has some crazy achievements, such as fighitng 1,000 and even up to 5,000 battles, based on an initial idea of 20 episodes. Since it didn't do well, they had to limit their ambitions to six episodes, hopefully with a fine tuning of the achievements in the future. But why is all this necessary? The game has everyone a gamer would be looking for. A series of episodes with a simple story, with tons of nostalgic references for one thing. I mean the main character is a guy named Marty, who rides a hoverboard, and gets his powers from a mysterious man known as The Wizard. The retro graphics are a joy to behold, the music is killer, and the gameplay is a very solid Paper Mario/Super Mario RPG type of thing, with button presses for better defense and better attacks. Not to mention your magic spells use everyday objects, from cookies and paper airplanes, to swords and baseball bats, up to toy aircraft carriers and transformer-like figurines. Hell even your notebook plays a part in the game as depending on the cover and the stickers you can enact various bonuses before each battle.As it stands at this time there are four episodes, with total time of about 10 hours to get through all of them. There is an arena mode against two semi-tough bosses, and endless battle challenges based around each chapter. You can get the grindy achievements I mentioned earlier legitimately, but my first run through the game got me less then even 100 battles, not counting everything else. Still if you want to, the game is a pleasure to play, and with the huge episode 5 coming early next year, there's no time like the present to get in and get ready for it. Super totally awesomely retro-nostalgia recommendation.			"

												I get what the creators are trying to do with this game, and I respect that. The first two episodes are the best part of the work, with some clever design and interesting ideas.Sadly, the remainder of the game starts falling flat and doesn't really recover. The fifth episode is unfortunately both obtuse in the puzzles presented and pretty short, and the story they laid out just kind of takes a sharp left turn into ""wut"" territory.The nostalgia factor is pretty strong, but the humor is a bit overly pun-dependent for my tastes. I picked it up on Steam sale, and I'd recommend giving it a shot in a sale if you have nostalgia for 80's pop culture, but other than that I can't really recommend this one.A final note: if you have motor disabilities, steer clear of the game completely. A lot of the combat is based around either timed presses or button mashing/control stick shaking, and if you have trouble with fine motor movements, you will likely have a much harder time with this game. I did not see an accessibility option for getting around that requirement.			"

												This game relies more on its charm and its disctinct tone and aesthetic than its game play. The game play is quite a lot like paper mario's only less well thought out. That said, it does provide some unique and interesting ways of mixing things up a bit and keeping them fresh, like the scratch and sniff mechanic and the little mini-games you have to perform before executing most of your attacks. After a while, though, it all starts to get pretty repetative. As I said though, if you play this game, don't play it for the game play: play it for the humor. Play it because you'd like to take a trip to a place where '80s pop-culture has run rampent and you must stop Lord Hood (basically the Cobra Commander) because the Share Bears and the Go-Bots are depending on you. If you didn't understand anything I said in the last sentence or see anything close to humor in it, don't bother picking up this game. Especially for your PC or Mac.			"

												Filled with references and nostalgia, but no substance,  This plays a lot like Super Mario RPG but without the battle variety or charm or story or characters or,... well you get the point.  Unlike Shovel Knight and Freedom Planet, this represents the bad kind of nostalgia, the kind that just says ""Power Glove"" and ""Skeletor"" and ""Captain N"" until it gets old.  The game's initial presentation is nice, but its not any different mechanically from any other Paper Mario esque rpg.  And it lacks the charming scenarios and characters and presentation that you could get from similar cartoony RPG's with active battle systems.  It's initially charming and stupid in a good way, but the lack of story and fun mechanics didn't really do it for me.  Pass on this one.			"

												Totally rad.  It's a tribute to GI Joe, Transformers, every John Waters movie, Back to the Future, and of course the bygone Saturday morning cartoon lineups.  Pretty much every other pixel-graphics game out there uses them not for nostalgia, but because they're cheap and easy.  At least in this game the graphics actually complement the theme.  The badge system and equipment scheme familiar to many RPGs is cleverly turned into ""stickers,"" and items stashed into a magical Trapper Keeper-style notebook.  Righteous.  There are a good bit of side quests to explore.  Some of the weapon animations are absurdly funny, and you earn steam achievements for trying out different things during combat.  Which, by the way, is a well designed mix of strategy and button mashing.  The four main story quests are on the easy side, but the arena and endless-wave battle modes are challenging.  Completionists will likely want to replay all the levels to get everything.  I'm looking forward to episode 5.  Recommended for turn-based RPG fans of any age and, definitely for every 80s kid.			"

												The game seems promising, and has some bits parodying/referencing 80s/90s cartoons, but there is nothing that is actually terribly funny.The combat system is obnoxious --- every fight opens with a Mario Party-style ""spin the analog stick"", to get your small bonuses from collectible stickers. The stickers are normally hidden items, and you can customize them out, but after a while the mini-game on every random fight gets tiresome and I don't even end up using them. The combat system itself resembles Mario RPG/Paper Mario. The items/attacks have pretty cool sound effects and animations, but requiring a handful of lengthy attacks that require quicktime events gets boring after a while.I stuck it through 2 of the 4 Episodes, maybe it gets better, but the episodes themselves are rather short. I got the game as part of an indie bundle with some other games I was curious about as well --- I wouldn't recommend purchasing this game by itself.			"

												While I did enjoy the sense of humor this game has, I still found it to be rather boring.  The battles are tedious affairs, with every enemy getting two attacks to my one, it's a matter of sitting around waiting for my turn, especially when faced with three opponents.  The rest of the game is mostly walking around repetitive caves/hallways, moving from battle to battle.Low budget, low-res games can be every bit as entertaining as AAA titles, and I have enjoyed many hours with them.  However, being low budget or indie is no excuse for being boring, so I would give this one a miss.  Well, I already bought it, but you know what I mean.			"

												This game was a pleasant suprise.  It touts the throwback to the 80's pretty heavily and it delivers without being just one name drop after another.  The combat system seems balanced but will definately get repetative, and you may find yourself choosing skills not based on what they do but based on the minigame (which tend the be pretty uninspired) or lack thereof.  Episodic game play is an interesting choice though I'm really not sure how much replayability this game will give you would be grinding or achievement hunting.Overall it won't blow your mind but then again not many things in the $5 range will.

Then this game for you.its retro with fun comments, dialogs, easter eggs for 80s movies.The game itself challenging aswell, fights are interesting, you can equip your character with various ""weapons"".If you see it on sale, buy instantly, however it totally worth the full price, this is a game what worth supporting so we will see more episodes:-)			"

												This is a really fun, lovingly crafted RPG. I delayed buying it because I was afraid it would botch the mid-80s setting or turn out to be an unimaginative parody. That was a mistake. This game is a genuinely creative love-song to the era. The NPC's have personalities, the setting and art is delightful, and the music is perfect. One quibble is that the soundtrack could have been longer. The combat system could be deeper, but it's adequate to make the battles exciting and often challenging.I was particularly impressed with the writing. The authors managed to combine some of the best storytelling elements of early RPG's with mid-1980s' cartoon serials. Like it's inspirations, the game's stories are funny yet also morally sincere. The snarky irony of 1990-current storytelling is conspicuous by its absence.Highly recommended. It's not necessary at all to have lived through the mid-1980s to enjoy this game. I hope to see more from this game's developers.			"

												This is a really fun old-school style turn-based RPG with a late 80s/early 90s vibe - full of nostalgia moments to SO many things, from Trapper Keepers to sewer surfing. The battles are incredibly easy and there tend to be a lot of them in a row, but that's typical of the genre. A VERY fun game, definitely worth picking up on sale, or if you're into the genre/time period- full price is reasonable.

												This game is loaded with references and throwbacks to pretty much everything from my childhood. It triggers a lot of nostalgia, and I am really enjoying it. It doesn't just throw things at you from the 1980s, the entire writing style is done like cartoons were done back then. The first episode actually has your girlfriend captured by the villian so he can force her to marry him. It's goofy and absurd with little bits of gameplay thrown in.That said, if you take all of that away... This is not a great game. The controls are really not well explained and you have to figure out how to use each new attack all on your own through trial and error. The menu system is not very well designed, and before you can even adjust your graphics settings you have to start a new game. Maybe this is intentional, since most games you played back then required you read everything from the instruction book. Or if you rented the game and it didn't have one, you'd have to figure it all out yourself. I still recommend this game because in spite of the gameplay issues, I'm enjoying it. And that's really all that matters.			"

												I like to joke that Saturday Morning RPG is my favorite game on Steam that I have worked on - (because it's the only game I've worked on so far that's on Steam). So, obvious bias aside, I will try to review this the same way that I review other games: by aesthetic appeal.The main aesthetics this appeals to are Sensory, Fantasy, Narrative and Discovery. Challenge is also there depending on how you set the difficulty in game and how much you are concerned with acheivements. There's also a huge nostalgia factor for anyone that grew up in the 80's or 90's.For those who like 80's music (pop/rock and video game/cartoon soundtracks) you will really enjoy the soundtrack that Vince DiCola and Kenny Meriedeth have composed.If you enjoyed games like Super Mario RPG(and Paper Mario Series), Earthbound(Mother Series), Pokemon, Final Fantasy (Particularly 1-9), Costume Quest, or other JRPGs you should give Saturday Morning RPG a try. Also I suggest it to fans of 80's and 90's music and pop culture. If you enjoy humorous games (like Double Fine games) this is worth checking out. If you are on the fence and can't decide if you would like it you can try the full first episode for free if you have a tablet.			"

												This game...MAN this game; it has the most nostalgic, ubiquitous feeling any game has ever personally given me. Now, it doesn't rely on this to captivate the audeince; the real quality lies within the QTE's. For some, this isn't a main attraction, but I believe it keeps the reflexes sharp, and who couldn't use a bit of tightening on that level? Anyway, this game manages to condense a multitude of radical 80's throwback quotes, abilities, and even that disgusting gum that had a zebra as a mascot into the fray, with positive results. I recommend this game to anyone and everyone who enjoys a hardy chuckle of a game, that can also provide a quality challenge as well.			"

Your character levels up and you get higher base-stats, but the real fun is in the creative weapons.  Most attacks come with a small mini-game that keeps you engaged.  Great game, check it out.			"

												I was looking forward to this game ever since I saw the trailer for it but it still managed to surprise me. Much better than I expected. The game is hilarious and is full with references to 80s and 90s. I laughed out loud so many times. The feeling of nostalgia is really strong in the game but it's not the only selling point. Story is nice. Dialogue is funny. Soundtrack is fantastic! Specially soundtracks that play during battles are kick♥♥♥♥♥ Another stong point of the game is the combat. It is turn based, but you can actively block and power up. Combat never feels boring thanks to all the different items you can use. Explosive discs, burning basketballs, a pack of unicorns and so many other awesome things.Game is episodic and there are 4 episodes available right now. 5th and 6th episodes are currently in developement and will be free DLC. Beating these 4 episodes took me 7 hours but you can replay them without getting bored because some missions have different endings depending on your choices and like I saide before, combat never gets dull.Like all the things I mentioned above weren't enough, the game is only 7 dollars. This is a steal in my opinion. Strongly recommended!			"

												Games where the interaction consist of little more than repetively moving the joystick back and forth and pressing down the right key at the right time as fast as you could, were pretty much the dogs ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ back in the 80s. Me and my friends used to love games like this when we were kids, playing them for hours.However, that was almost 30 years ago. Not only are my own personal standards for computer games and entertainment higher, but so is my craving for some intellectual challenges.As a kid 30 years ago, I'd probably love this game. As an adult today though, I consider Saturday Morning RPG to be nothing but a boring waste of time.Whilst I respect that many people seem to enjoy and like this game, it's just not my cup of tea.

												I don't know what would have to be wrong with your childhood in order for you to not enjoy the game. The music is brilliant, the references to everything 80's is really well done, and basically everything is done with so much love for nostalgia that there's nothing here that I can hate on. If I had to complain about anything, it would be that I can't get enough - at only 4 episodes long with about 40 mins gameplay each, its suitable, but makes me want more - hopefully some extra episodes will be available soon. But it has enough content for me to really enjoy it at a pretty decent price. :)			"

												If you are like me and born in the late 70s-early 80s and 'Merkin (I say that because I dont know how well 80s american pop culture references are going to translate to other cultures. If you live in a county that imported a lot of american stuff back then, you might like it too), this is pretty much a must have.You find yourself grinning at 80s stuff you totally forgot existed, and a lot more you remember. Just off the top of my head (and Ive only been playing for 20 mins) Lisa Frank style trapper-keeper with scratch and sniff stickers on the cover, rainbow brite-like belt, michael jackson's glove, people saying radical and bogus, fruit stripe zebras, care bears, the battle summary page looks like those strange bar graphs that were on the back of Transformer's/GI Joe boxes (or a card inside)...I could go on.But underneath of all the stuff that will make someone in the vicinity of 30 years old remember their childhood is a well made RPG. The controls are fluid and intuitive and although you are given a brief tutorial, anyone who has played video games will know how it works.Theres a lot of button press/joystick wobble quicktime events in battle to keep you from just mindlessly selecting fight or a special skill over and over, simple things any gamer recognizes. Hit the button at the correct point, tap the button repeatedly, wobble the joystick and so forth. Theres also plenty of awesome stuff you can get to have different attacks in battle, all of them amusing (IE chewing fruity gum causes a heard of rainbow zebras to run out and trample your enemy, a sword you hold over your head ala He Man causes a beam of light to hit someone). Also you can collect scratch and sniff stickers that you have to wobble the joystick before battle to ""scratch"" that provide powerups, the more you scratch in the alloted time, the more powerups.The graphics are bright and colorful, and remind me of Paper Mario. And to top it all off, the soundtrack is really really good. Or should I say ""radical"", har har.The game is episodic like a cartoon show, with 4 episodes included and a fifth to be released for free soon. If you fondly remember your 80s childhood, grab this game. You wont regret it.			"

												A hilarious setting comprised solely of 80’s nostalgia and references that saturated teenage life at that time. Everything from key guitars to 80’s cartoons and ad campaigns make up the entire world of this RPG. The story is nonsensical and funny, but it’s also a two-sided coin in regards to its audience. It’s one thing to have a story take place in the 80’s and quite another to have the story entirely constructed out of 80’s Easter eggs. People who never grew up with the “friends don’t let friends do drugs” cartoon ad campaigns, never had to use a floppy disk, never watched “Back to the Future” or know what a scratch and sniff sticker is might get a little lost in the humor. That’s not to say younger audiences couldn’t enjoy it, but most if not all the jokes are intended for those who grew up in the 80’s.  Still the game is fun and solid. There weren’t any bugs, combat was interesting and there was some obvious thought put into its funky visuals. For the price it wasn’t to short on playtime ether, I spent roughly $3.00 on this at a steam sale and several hours later I am still playing it. "

YouTube™ Video: Saturday Morning RPG Review 

			Views: 1,009		

			I do a video review of the game Saturday Morning RPG by Mighty Rabbit Studios. **CORRECTION: There are a total of 4 ""episodes"" in this game for a total of maybe 5ish hours game play.		

Saturday Morning RPG is an episodic turn based RPG with an art style modeled after an 80's or 90's cartoon/comic.  The game takes place in a boys dream where he explores the world on his skate board and fights off enemies to save the girl.  The script is deliberately cliche and has lots of vague references from the era.  For me the big let down was the combat, it just wasn't fun.  The attacks consist of either quicktime events with on screen button prompts or timing a button press with a cursor moving along a meter.  The player can also charge up for bigger attacks but this mechanic is another event requiring a button press timed against a meter.  With the style of combat, despite 5+ hours of gameplay, I can't recommend Saturday Morning RPG.EDIT (2/4/14): Updated the gameplay time to 5+ hours.			"

												My video impressions on the game:

Every now and again a game pops up and surprises you. This was one for me. It is a very casual JRPG game oozing with 80's nostalgia. It features very unique abilities such as a 3 1/2 inch disk slap to the face or a care bear stare. Pair that with active defending and a couple other surprises during combat makes it quite enjoyable. The game is broken up in to 4 current (5th to be released later TBD free of charge) episodes. Each features a different story line and location. The first episode was about 30-40 minutes and the second was about 2 hours taking my time.The gem with this game is best equated to the book, ""Ready Player One"" where the nostalgia drives the story. For someone my age (31) or older, you will love the references from times past (ie: stay off the adult BBS's or The Wizard with a Power Glove). Do yourself a favor and pick up this game. It's the price of a value meal and will provide you with quite a bit of entertainment, just don't take it as a hardcore JRPG, because that would be doing it all wrong.			"

												This game kinda came out of nowwhere for me.  Other than me picking it up in a bundle recently right before it was greenlit, granting me a steam key, the only thing i knew about it was it was its snazy name and just another indie with seeming lofty goals.  So its got exploration, hilarious side quests, engaging turn-based-combat with all kinds of crazy weapons and powers some requiring button pressing/mashing.  Most of these you find in game, but some are quests rewards or can be bought in vending machines.  The music is much better than most games in the retro-indie realmn for me at least.  There's even a handful of puzzles, etc on the decent size levels.  Right now there are 4 separate episodes with more to come.  Your character progresses though each and you can replay keeping your powers/equip.  Also each episode you pretty much have free reign of the maps once you pass certain story parts and i'd say each episode is about 1-2 hours if you do most of the battles and quests.  Lastly what puts this game on top is the insane amount of references to 80's, 90's movies, tv-shows, and other pop culture.  While i love Obsidian(the developer) and have no love for South Park and that soon to be released RPG may end up being good, but somehow i think this gem is already better, and only♥♥♥♥♥♥♥have the gall to charge $60 out the gate for a comedy/non 3d RPG.   I would say this game is worth full price though definately don't hesitate if it goes on sale			"

												If you are a child of the 80's like I am and you have the slightest interest in turn based RPG's you owe it to yourself to pick this game up.  However, even if you did not grow up in the 80's I think you will enjoy this game as long as you like a good old school RPGs.Pros:- great dialogue that will make you chuckle, even if you don't get all the references it is relatable enough for anyone to get a laugh out of the characters in this game.-fun turn based combat- think super mario RPG, if you never played that shame on you, you really should, but basically it is turn based but with timed button presses.  Different moves you do bring up different mini games that require timing to inflict max damage.  Also when enemies attack you, timed button presses reduce the damage dealt, the better your timing the less damage they inflict.- lots of cool items to collect, the weapons in this game are varied and funny and range from ordinary stuff like baseball bats to some bizzare things like simon says and fruit stripes gum.  -free DLC coming in the future, 4 episodes right now and the game will probably take you roughly 4-5 hours to finish if you do most of the side quests (you will want to, as they are generally worth a chuckle), the developer has confirmed episode 5 is coming soon which will be free, any future episodes will also be free.-epsiodic layout gives the game a nice feel, each level is large enough on its own and riddled with secrets and side quests and the episodic nature of the game means you don't have to worry about doing any boring backtracking which is all too common in RPG'scons-linear character development, not a huge con but if your into branching paths and stuff like that you won't get it here, you quickly learn that magic is the best, you will pour your stats into that and wreak havoc with your flying laser discs and karate kid headbands.Overall if you are into turn based rpg's with fun combat system and a funny story you will like this.  It is not an epic game, and it does not take itself seriously, but it is fun and you will laugh while you play it, and IMO that is what video games are all about.			"

												This game is incredibly fun, hilarious game with plenty of references to old TV shows and movies like Star Wars and such, you can play with keyboard, Xbox controller or PS3 controller so all the in game button prompts are corresponding to how you are playing. (I played this game with a Xbox controller so for the sake of this review I will using the Xbox buttons).The combat in this game is turn based like your average olden days RPG, however it has timing aspect to it. This includes pressing A at the right time to block enemies attack so they deal less damage to you, doing small mini games in some of your spells and starting every battle spinning your joystick to get buffs that you choose beforehand in your little notepad. Some of the powers include spawning rainbows out of you to attack your enemies, playing simon says to kill the enemies and I would go over all of them but I feel as if I would be spoiling it for you if I did.The story is broken up into 4 episodes (soon to be 5) where our hero, marty is trying to save the world from Commander Hood while trying to gain the affection of his crush, now that may sound cliché but trust me, this story is anything but cliché, It is incredibly enjoyable to watch play out and obviously you have dem sweet sweet side missions during the episodes which I found myself laughing at on multiple occasions.Oh you finished the game you say, well you can also replay old episodes with your now stronger character whom you can also take into arena mode to fight stronger versions of enemies, also an endless battle mode where you choose an episode and fight endless waves of enemies from that part of the game, and of course you have leaderboards so you can show all your friends just how much better than them you are.The only thing I dislike is the length of each of the episodes if you were to ignore all the side missions you could finish the first 2 episodes in around an hour or two, however if you are playing an RPG and not doing side missions and exploring, Then you are doing RPGs wrong, oh and you also get XP for exploring which is great.I would recommend this game to all my friends hense why I am writing this review, so buy it today :D			"

												Hey this game is fun.Be aware it is not a full fledged turn based game.  In the battles there are button pushes that require timing.  So it is a bit more active, but it makes it fun too.This game is chock full of 1980's parodies.  It's a light hearted affair, which made me think it would be too easy.  That is not  the case, while it isn't a die a lot game it is somewhat challenging.  Enough that it will make you want to pay attention to the buffs you choose.  I felt it was a nice balance and fun if you know the 80's.I installed it on my Ubuntu system and it worked no problem.  I did have issues with my brand 360 controller and my logitech one as well.  It involves a quick button push equaling a hundred pushes which could be used to cheat.  Every battle begins with a certain action known to destroy analog sticks anyway.  So I decided keyboard was the way to go, and it worked well for the game.The price is low because the game is short,  I got halfway through in 4 hours.  I will definitley be finishing the game because oh, did I say already, it's fun.  Get it.			"

												This is the nostalgic trip down satirical memory lane you need to feel like a kid again. Funny, chocked full of references, and with a story set up as corny and unique as old Saturday morning cartoons you will be entertained for hours. Granted, there are only four episodes right now so you won't be playing real long. However, it looks like the developers might be slowly making more. Overall, if you love RPGs, you'll want this in your collection. It's a definite win.Pros: Wonderful writting, well developed turn based gameplay, more than just the main story to play, great soundtrackCons: not a lot of episodes right now (i assume more are on the way), (if you're using the keyboard) the z,x,c,v buttons are your action buttons for battle at times and you may accidentally hit other buttons (this sceme cannot be changed)neutral note: It may benifit you if you have a knowledge of 80's pop culture. Not really needed but I feel it may help you get the jokes better.			"

												I am a big fan of RPG games, but even a bigger fan of Parodies. This has a very nice mix of both.Saturday Moring RPG is the ideal RG for people who are classic gamers as well as classic cartoon lovers from the 1980's to 1990's. The game features well over 100 pop culture items, enemies, comments, even the famous enemy one liners we all know and love since comic books.Such things that are featured are as follows...Basket ball = Labeled as (This ball is on fire), which is a reference to the arcade game called NBA JAMMarty = A character reference to the movie ""Back To The Future""Hover Board = A reference to the movie ""Back To The Future II""and many more that I will let you find out on your own.The RPG Game is almost played like Super Mario RPG for SNES, and also a cross from Undertale. Many of the RPG concepts are in this game, so many RPG fans will get a kick out of this RPG.			"

												Are you interested in a game that plays and feels like a real love letter to not just 80s cartoons but essentially all of 80s pop culture, from Skeletor to Back to the Future to every high school movie, written by and for children of that era?  If so, then this game is for you.  If not, then you are sad and I have no desire to speak to you further.The music by Vince DiCola is worth the price of admission by itself--it felt like a lost happy chapter of Transformers the Movie.  The gameplay is simple and a little repetitive but like the tropes and plotlines of all our favorite memories it runs its course before it wears out its welcome.			"

												A decent RPG that has a nice old school saturday morning feel to it (duh). I love the references, but younger kids probably won't get some of them; that's okay.Some issues I have with it though:1. The art styles don't match; you have a 3D world with clearly 2D pixelated characters, and the two don't mix well. Almost need to go high resolution 2D art to work well here.2. Having to waggle the thumb stick every fight gets annoying very quickly. Just let those stats be static and always on so we don't have to do this.3. Sneak attacks don't give any actual sneak bonus; even if you get one, the enemy is likely to attack first.I'm going to spend some more time with it, but early on it feels good as an RPG.			"

												Oh, the nostalgia! This game was made out of love for the ""back in the day"" shows and cartoons that we as kids watched and enjoyed the hell out of. By the way, keep in mind this was a game that did not make a lot of money and was developed with no contract or anything, it was a game made by developers who wanted to pay tribute to the past (reason why there isn't still an episode 5 available). Turn based combat sequences are carried out and you are able to use various everyday items as a weapon, a feature I have enjoyed a lot. Recommended for gamers that want to remember their childhood and have fun while doing so!

												THIS REVIEW ONLY APPLIES TO LINUXI've tried it on three different configurations (see below) and I've had the same issues: bad screen tear and unintentional turbo mode on the 'up' input, meaning my character moves up all the time against my will. Had the same issue with a 360 controller and two different keyboards, on all the different setups.Tried it on Ubuntu with a 3570K/7770 fglrx setup, and Arch on both a 3570k/560 Ti proprietary setup and a G860/560 Ti proprietary setup and have had the same issues. Didn't respond to the usual Vsync stuff for getting rid of screen tear, and there's no in-game Vsync option or console launch option to fix the frame rate. I've just given up. I don't recommend this game because the port just seems to have been done very lazily. A shame as it seems like it's probably fun.			"

												Need a new and enticing game to play? Look no further as this will blow your ♥♥♥♥ing socks off. ♥♥♥♥ anyone that has ever wrote a bad review about this game because they literally have no sense at all and really need to go and I don't know, go jump off a cliff or something (despite negative reviews helping developers improve the game I just haven't found anything wrong with it yet and if I do, I will continue to update this review). This game is truely amazing. Despite me originally only wanting to buy the game for the awesome cards and badges it has, I was always interested in what it could be like to play such a random looking game. I will never regret my decision and as soon as the game went on sale, I jumped right on it! Now I know the truth. Saving £2 (through waiting for the game to go on sale) or whatever was really nothing, you, yes you who is reading this, should buy this game, right now! I love it.Within the first day I bought it, I spent 4 hours that night playing it. All the nostalgic references really tie into this game better than any game I have seen to this day. All the little jokes in the game and the sarcastic expressions have not failed to make me smile. To describe the game is very difficult and as someone who is ""new"" to ""gaming"" it is quite a task. It is very much an RPG where there is turn-based fighting implemented within the game aswell as many little ""sweets"" that just make the game. Mini-games and side missions are everywhere and turn the 3-4 hour long story gameplay into something a lot more. The game play in itself is like nothing I have experienced before and as someone who usually avoids RPGs, this is by far one of my favourite games, without a doubt. You can play with a keyboard or pretty much any console controller with full compatibility (even though I have destroyed the palm of my right hand through one of the many mini-games by violently moving the joystick on my Xbox 360 controller but hey, it's worth it).After having bought it for myself, I have bought it and recommended it to all my friends as I truly believe the good guys at Mighty Rabbit Studios deserve every single penny they get, as they continue to update the game. There are currently 4 episodes but soon to be 5 which was exciting to see developers of the game continuing to love their ""baby"", as they put it. So even when you think it's all over, there is even more!Overall, I would say that is an amazing game, with amazing developers and your money would be very well spent buying this game and then later recommending it to others who may be unsure about the game aswell as your friends and even family! Buy it and enjoy hours of endless fun!			"

												First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/saturday-morning-rpg-first-impressions/Saturday Morning RPG is an episodic turn-based RPG (self-classified as a JRPG) heavily influence by the 1980s, with a great soundtrack to match.The game heavily emphasizes the combat aspect of the gameplay, with new fights just around the corner (literally). I was drawn into a fight very frequently and could barely navigate my way around with so many enemies. It is a great way to grind for XP, if you're wanting that kind of action. Although I didn't happen to be in existence during the 80's, I did understand most of the references made throughout my experience in Saturday Morning RPG. If you frequent the Internet and know just a little bit about pop culture, you should be fine.The references, packaged with the game's humor and absurd writing, is where Saturday Morning RPG really shines. I thoroughly enjoyed that aspect the game and that alone could serve as the basis for my recommendation of the game. The game's combat does get repetitive, very quickly in my case, but I still managed to enjoy myself despite this. There are plenty of side quests available, adding a great deal of content to the game. The game wouldn't take that long to beat by itself, so the side quests really add value to the game as a whole.The game's graphics were nothing too fantastic. In fact, it looks like the graphics originated from a mobile game. Most of the graphics are sprite-based, so can't really complain there. The graphics blended both 2D and 3D objects into one, large 3D environment. It took a little getting used to, haven't played a game with this style in a while, but it wasn't anything to complain about.Saturday Morning RPG is a great effort, I really enjoyed my time with it and look forward to completing it in the near future. And for $7 too!			"

												I felt like this game was trying very hard to engauge me with all the retro references but also irritate the crap out of me by being built on quicktime-event combat. When you go into combat, you've got the option to quick-time for 1-5 combat buffs. You'll do crap damage unless you charge first, which is a gauge quicktime. Basic attack is a gauge quicktime, to defend you have to hit 'block' *just* right. Item attacks can be rapid-press or other quicktimes. Finish combat? Your XP is based on YOUR SCORE FROM THE QUICKTIMES.Pass.			"

												Think Costume Quest gampeplay wrapped in a 80's coating and you get Saturday Morning RPG. Even if you weren't born in the 80's or remember a lot from that timeframe, It won't detract from the experience (as long as you know who GI Joe and Transformers are, you're good to go). You just won't get a lot or most of the references (which for me, being born in 81, love the references) . If you don't like button mashing or quicktime events (a lot of the attacks and defense use it), you probably won't like this game. I recommend this for anyone who liked Costume Quest, is looking for a fun time waster and or were born in or remembers the 80's (even those who don't).			"

												The two games this most reminds me of as I play it is Super Mario Rpg and Costume Quest mostly in the combat and a good sense of humor.This game is very well done with tons of 80s references like the movie Short Circuit with Johnny Number 5, the Thundercats, Back to the Future, or even an attack that involves the colorful Zebra Gum from my childhood.  Combat is smooth and actually fun to where you need to time a 2nd button press to get bonus damage or critical hits. The story is nothing to brag about so far but amusing and kept me interested.Lots of bonus content to like an endless mode and arena.			"

												The loving parody elements about Saturday Morning toons made playing it engaging and funny. I also enjoyed the mixed aesthetic; the pixelated sprites and gameplay brought some nostalgia from the 16-bit era of RPGs and fighting games.  One of my favorite things about this game had to be the music, it was thrilling and catchy and helped to tie it all together.			"

												I really like this game, but it's hard to pin down exactly why.  Some of the things that come to mind are:I was alive for the 80s.The combat seems really simplistic at first, being turn-based with occasional minigames.  But it gets more interesting as you get more and varied items and try to figure out what they do, eventually developing a sort of fighting style around favored items.  It was a little easy sometimes, but by no means mindless.  Though I had a bit of an advantage--using a keyboard makes the button-mashing bits a lot easier.At the end of a chapter it tells you whether you missed anything  (exploration, fights, items, &c) so you actually have a goal in going back to replay things other than ""more XP"".  Opt-out-able level-scaling means that it's not easy unless you want it to be.There were a couple puzzle elements but they're more of a short break than a main component.The script is humorous and slightly cheesy.  But so were 80s cartoons.I had a cannot-play-the-game-at-all level bug.  The devs fixed it within days.The game has four episodes now--apparently they're planning a fifth and sixth for free.One thing I really wish they had was a better explanation of the stat system.  Or really any explanation at all.  I've mostly gotten through by just guessing at what the numbers affect.There's an arena mode and an endless mode, but I haven't played much of either yet.			"

												Saturday Morning RPG is a very fun and entertaining little game with smirk-worthy writing, an interesting combat system, and a great sense of style. So why is it not recommended? Because the control prompts are broken.When you start a new game, it asks you to select your button prompt style; keyboard, Xbox 360, or Playstation. Unfortunately, for some users, myself inclued, this option simply doesn't work. I've selected 360 prompts and applied the change multiple times, and still the game is showing me keyboard inputs. Looking at the forums, it seems other people have been having this problem and have been asking for a fix since the game launched, over 2 years ago. That's 2 years during which the developers have completely ignored complaints about a broken option which significantly hurts the experience for many players. Knowing this, I cannot in good conscience recommend the game to new players. Mighty Rabbit need to fix this problem.			"

												I want to give this game a positive review in the worst way, but I can't. Two big reasons why:the first crime is Saturday Morning RPG is obviously imitating 90's jRPGs. While it gets the walking around the world part right, the jRPG style battles are god awful. I get the designers' decision to make the process involved with timed button presses, but they went overboard. Almost every attack relies on button mashing or QTEs. Worse is your character is so freaking weak your basic and special attacks hardly do anything to enemies so the battles drag needlessly. To be fair, there is a charge move that multiplies the damage your next attack does. Unfortunately charge is so OP I find myself relying almost entirely on it just to effectively damage normal enemies. And, of course, the charge move that gives you the best bonus is the one that involves hammering on a single button. REALLY annoying. The combat is easily bad enough that it ruins the game.the second crime is the soundtrack is not included with the game or offered as a download. The music was co-composed by Vince DiCola. If you don't know who that is, he composed the instrumental tracks for the Transformers The Movie (also the awesome montage medley in Rocky IV which undeservely won a razzie) so Saturday Morning RPG has the exact same super cheesy 80's synth sound and its a perfect fit for the game and its theme. The OST is wonderful. I'm actually really ticked I can't listen to it!Aside from these 2 issues, Saturday Morning RPG does everything else correctly. It crams as many sly references to 80's and early 90's Americana (including a Fruit Stripe reference) into its cliched cartoony plots that seem heavily biased towards Transformers and GI Joe (not complaining). Nostalgia is a big part of the enjoyment if you're old enough to pick up on most of it. The writing is actually good. There's a lot of awfully odd and amusing flavor text sprinkled thorughout. In fact, most of the references in the game are amusingly cornball nonsense. If it weren't for the game's awful combat system, I'd fully endorse the $7 asking price, but that awful combat system is like 1/2 the game and sucks a lot of the enjoyment out of it.			"

												Saturday Morning RPG is an jrpg that focuses on nostalgic references. The references are mainly from the 80s. If you aren't old enough you probably miss a lot of the references. The actual gameplay is that great. The combat system is a bit tedious with a lot of quick time events. If you born in the 80s or like rpg's the game is oke, but nothing special.			"

												SMRPG feels broken and patchy. I can't recommend it, the on screen elements are very abrasive and the movement is finicky. The UI is awful - won't stay set to gamepad controls displayed, so I constantly had no idea which button to press. The 'folder' is difficult to navigate and the game elements (attacks, boosts, etc) are never really explained, which left me just equipping and buying and spamming things all over the place. The stats are not explained or really referenced anywhere so I was left applying miscellaneous boosts that might have had an impact. With a couple of improvements or indeed an overhaul of the menu/folder system and a bit more indication for what to use, the game might be playable, but it would need many more changes for me to recommend it.

												This is a turn-based RPG with a great twist. I hate the word epic as I believe it is used far to often these days but if I had to sum the game up in one word it would be EPIC! being a child of the 80's this game bring back all the great things from that time. The game is an RPG with a zesty kick, no longer will you get mindbogglingly bored getting into fights and as a result spend most of the game trying to avoid enemies, in this game it is a joy to go head on with the enemies as they all have different abilities and moves. All in all it is a refreshing change and I love it! there needs to be a option to gives games two thumbs up to give this game justice. I will recommend this game over and over again. BUY this epictatstic game NOW or forever live in the darkness of mindbending boredom.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a RPG Adventure  game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are many resolution sizes available.There is fullscreen mode and windows mode available.You are able to play with a controller.You are able to change the volume by each 10%Notebook for stats.About the game.If you are familiar with the ""Paper Mario"" game, The combat is almost the same here aswell. If you are pressing the button on the exact moment. The effect will be better. Like doing more damage. Before the match starts you are going to scratch some of the stickers in order to make them activated during a fight. The faster you are able the scratch the more buffs you will get. You are able to use ability items. They will do damage and has sometimes a chance for a status effect on the enemy. You are able to explore around a little bit, which will reward you with experience. There is a Guage meter in battles, Filling this up before you are going to do an attack Will do you alot more damage!You are able to collect stickers that are affecting/buffing you in the battles.Has memes?Has references from different games, older cartoons and many others.Game is very fun.There is a story.Able to get experience and level up.Breaking the fourth wall.Music is okay.Graphics is decent.There are quests.Pixelated characters with a 3D background and world.Other things.Has many references from alot of things.It is like  ""Paper Mario "" series.-------------------I Give this game a 8/10			"

												There are a lot of references here... be prepared young ones otherwise you may not really get it.The graphics are kind of weird, we have 3D back grounds with 2D character models which gives it a bit of a charm, reminds me a bit of Grandia but over all I believe the enemies could of been drawn better. I'm also not a big fan of how the main character looks either but whatever, could of added a life jacket to his wardrobe. :PEither way, it plays like Super Mario RPG so if you're old enough to be familiar with that game then you know what to expect.. a timed attack and defense system basically. Trial and error is required to get the timing down, so don't expect to be a pro right off the get go as encounters with new enemies is like learning how to play all over again.The Dragon Ball Z power up system is a bit of an oddity and almost a necessity so don't neglect your magic stat.Be warned that the game is indeed unfinished and the last couple episodes have yet to be patched in... so don't go too hog wild maxing your character out as there will be no experience for you to gain when those episodes get released.Overall it's a decent game for the money spent. It's a good nostalgia trip and fun in stints. You can save wherever you wish so if the episodes are getting too boring or long for you, you can take a break and resume right from where you're standing.6.5 / 10			"

												Sometimes games are there to be funny when other times they're there to actually be games. Well this game leans towards the former with a very funny plot running through the game which will keep you entertained throughout the game. However, it does encompass a lot of depth in it's combat system with a meter that can be charged manually to increse your attacks power and different attacks that are able to be bought or picked up, making not only the story gripping but the gameplay too. The graphics are not stunning but the pixel art on a fully rendered background makes it easy to figure out what's what and the colour scheme is usually pleasing to the eye, not being too flashy or too bland. Overall, it's a pretty fun little experience for a low price and I say to get it. Also, it is very 80s.			"

												It's decent. More of a humorous RPG/adventure than a traditional (indie) RPG. Humorous adventure games that have references and jokes in them don't usually interest me, but yeah. I gotta say the battle system is pretty good but the user interface is terrible.The game becomes tedious after episode 3 in my opinion because the many enemies take too long to kill - the achievements require you to kill insane  amounts of enemies. The game takes about 10 hours to complete (I was afk so it took me a bit longer) and about 70+ hours to get 100% achievements.. the achievements not being worth it, if you ask me.Of course, you can always rush the episodes and make the game last much less by not doing sidequests.I'd give it a 8/10 - it's certainly not for everyone.

												Do you like 80s nostalgia about Saturday Morning Cartoons?Do you think most video games are too serious, lack a sense of humor and put realism above fun?Do you want a fun indie game that you can laugh at and with at the same time?If you answered yes to these questiones than Saturday Morning RPG is the game for you!Saturday Morning RPG is that goofy RPG we all want but any big company would laugh right out of the meeting room.You play as Marty who is an ordinary high school student, but in his dreams he becomes a superhero by way of a magical notebook that turns ordinary items into superpowered weapons.   He then gets to fight enemies right out of the cliche world of Saturday Morning cartoons!  Crafted with wit and humor the world of Saturday Morning RPG is a silly break from the modern styled realistic video game you are used to.If you don't like games that lack realistic cutting edge graphics, excessive guns, and overpriced DLC, well than this game isn't for you. Of course, if you want something different, exciting and fun, well then this game has it.			"

												I was smitten with the idea of playing a JRPG style game that referenced 80's pop culture and had a mind-blowing soundtrack by Vince DiCola of Rocky IV and Transformers fame.  I was somewhat disappointed.  The 80's references are jumbled and make no sense (why would the Cobra analog exist in a He-Man inspired locale?)  Many of the weapons are just plain useless and you basically have to ""power up"" all the time to be effective in overly simplistic combat.  The game world itself is overly simplistic and basically just involves wandering around from fight to fight until a boss battle.  ...And the soundtrack isn't very good and only vaguely reminiscent of Vince DiCola's other work.  Did I mention that the transforming sound effect from Transformers is literally somebody making ""whoosh whoosh whoosh"" sounds with their mouth into a microphone?  Perhaps I've been spoiled by the quality of other indie games I've played, but this one doesn't live up to the hype.			"

												Granted I only paid $0.49 for it, so I don't have much to complain and for what it is it's an alright game. The UI is really frustrating, especially if you're playing on pad because I kept trying to change the button style layout and it keeps defaulting to the keyboard style layout. And as a personal opinion, I'm not too fond of the visuals, there's more 3D elements than 2D elements and it's a bit of a mess. Honestly, if you want a game that's very 1980s esque but filled with easter eggs, go play Retro City Rampage instead.			"

												The story is as generic as they come, there is the occasional genuinely funny quip, but besides that, it is nothing special.The battles are ridiculously repetitive and the control scheme makes it a chore. Despite my best efforts, and selecting so in the options menu, the on screen prompts would not show for my Xbox 360 controller so any quick time events were met with me trying to figure out what Z, X, Y, V were on a controller. Not a fun time and just adds to the frustration.The visuals were great, I enjoyed the low-res 2D sprites in a 3Dish world, it game the game a nice look but the game is a complete letdown for me on a technical level, so much so that I have had to give up on the game.

												A well-written RPG that pays hilarious homage to many iconic figures of the 80's. If you're familiar with G.I. Joe, Transformers, Care Bears, Back to the Future, Michael Jackson, Top Gun, or Jean Claude Van Damme, you will find many chuckles to be had throughout the course of the game.You play as Marty, and the game is played through 5 episodes, each introducing unique locations and characters to the overall plot. Gameplay itself mostly consists of the standard RPG elements: Explore, level up, complete quests, and advance the storyline. Your party will always be a one-person affair, but this is acceptable due to the customization options available to Marty. You will find stickers, 5 of which can be scratched prior to each battle to give Marty bonuses (or debuffs for enemies). In addition to this, there is a pretty big selection of items that Marty may also equip. Each of these items is an attack that Marty can perform in battle, and each item ranges in damage, speed, accuracy, and uses per battle. Many of these items also have unique QTEs that give the fighting a bit of flavor as well. Add this with a charging system that is required to make your attacks more lethal, and a timing system that puts emphasis on speed as well, and there's actually a little strategy required in some of the fights.The music is also pretty good. It probably won't make many Top 10 lists, but it is quite fitting for the gameplay. I wish they would've gave the music more of an 80's hair-band vibe, but I was satisfied with the overall score.

												Nostalgic references can be fun, but they can't carry a game. Saturday Morning RPG is a love letter to 80s childhood, featuring loads of references and parodies from the time period.It features a cool take on the turnbased system, 80's charm, a fun soundtrack, but proceeds to slip into mediocrity. There's no real strategy or challenge to the combat and it becomes very repititious very fast. It's cool running over Not-COBRA foot soldiers with Not-Optimus Prime for the first 20 times, then it just becomes drudgery.It isn't bad, but it isn't great. It's competent.			"

												First thing the game does is ask you what kind of button prompts you want: keyboard, PlayStation or Xbox.Second thing the game does is fail at showing you the prompt you selected and it just shows you the keyboard prompts.The third thing I noticed was that this game was written by an autistic 5 year old and that the references are completely inane and boring. Great, the main character is named after Marty McFly. Original. Oh, The Wizard showed up! He said ""so bad"" like the Power Glove scene! I grew up in the 80s and corporations aren't ""ruining our childhood"" by releasing remakes, you people are doing it by not ever shutting the ♥♥♥♥ up about Back to the Future and the NES. Reference something fresh for once!Fourth thing I noticed is how dreadfully ugly everything but the pixel art (which is only for characters) is.

												I got everything I expected and more. Saturday Morning RPG has a sort of Paper Mario or The Stick of Truth feel because the combat system is turn based with a lot of interaction and quicktime events. The game's response is very good, so the fights always feel like you're doing what you intend to. The visuals are nostalgically pixelated, so if you like that kind of graphic you'll enjoy the look of this game. The music is incredible, that's probably my favourite part of this game. Every song and theme is composed very well in addition to the audio quality being fantastic.The story has a very ""Saturday morning TV show"" feel to it, which makes sense considering the title of this game. I enjoyed it for the most part, especially all the references to other videos games, movies, and TV shows, but some of the dialogue gets a bit full of itself sometimes. Some NPCs will tell you their stories if you give them a chance, but that just adds a wholeness to the game in some regards.If the developers make any DLC for this game, like new episodes, I would definitely play them. I had a lot of fun with this game.			"

												Saturday Morning RPG is everything it promises to be when you see the store page on Steam. It is a love-letter to the pop-culture of the 1980s and has no apologies to offer for that. As an RPG game, it both is amazing and disappointing at the same time. The gameplay itself is surprisingly deep and something I can not recommend enough, but at the time, it is very short for RPGs (I finished it in about 8 hours) and the overall story falls very flat.If you look back fondly on an 80s childhood, this is probably a game you should get your hands on, as you will enjoy it. If not, the strengths and weakness of this RPG kinda makes it a toss-up. But for the price, it just might be worth giving a shot anyway.The full review is available at http://redsectorshutdown.blogspot.com/2014/02/saturday-morning-rpg-pc-review.html "

												An excellent, original game, it may seem like just another indie project at first. But beneath the layers of pop-culture, nostalgia and product placements (RcAstley's? Really?), an intriguing RPG can be found. While the control scheme can take some getting used to, you can always configure it rather easily. I personally quite like the idea of a ZXCVUpDownLeftRight control system. While this may not appeal to everyone, I recommend it for fans of RPGs, especially Pokemon. The game retains a laid-back, cool atmosphere, while offering up decent combat and exploring parts. I owned this game from release day (it was on sale, what can I say), and I most definitely have not regretted clicking that Buy button.8/10			"

												There have been a lot of nostalgia-related computer games lately, but this is one of the ones that speaks to me most.  It has a lot of references to 80s shows I watched like GI Joe and He-Man.  Plus it has nods to other things I did back then, like putting stickers on Trapper Keepers, and chewing Fruit Stripe gum.  On the downside, I didn't love the graphics.  The low-res sprites are a reference to older video games, and I appreciate that.  However, the characters are too detailed to realistically be called ""8-bit"", so they didn't actually push my nostalgia buttons.  Instead, they just look blocky.  Different characters and backgrounds have different levels of detail, making characters look out of place.  Again, the graphics are intenionally bad - it's not like the programmers just got lazy.  It's just I would have preferred they presented the 8-bit references in a different way.  I've played enough modern games with 8-bit graphics, and I think this particular game would have worked better using an art style that emulates 80s cartoons rather than 80s video games.  But that's just my opinion.Getting past the art, the gameplay is just okay.  It's your basic turn-based RPG.  Some of your special moves require minigame-like button presses to do more damage, but if you don't like that sort of thing, you can always favor the more straightforward moves when customizing your character.  It's fun, but if you play a lot of RPGs, it's nothing you haven't seen before.  The bottom line is that you're playing this for all the 80s references.  If that doesn't describe your childhood, you probably won't get much out of this game. "

												I got everything I expected and more. Saturday Morning RPG has a sort of Paper Mario or The Stick of Truth feel because the combat system is turn based with a lot of interaction and quicktime events. The game's response is very good, so the fights always feel like you're doing what you intend to. The visuals are nostalgically pixelated, so if you like that kind of graphic you'll enjoy the look of this game. The music is incredible, that's probably my favourite part of this game. Every song and theme is composed very well in addition to the audio quality being fantastic.The story has a very ""Saturday morning TV show"" feel to it, which makes sense considering the title of this game. I enjoyed it for the most part, especially all the references to other videos games, movies, and TV shows, but some of the dialogue gets a bit full of itself sometimes. Some NPCs will tell you their stories if you give them a chance, but that just adds a wholeness to the game in some regards.If the developers make any DLC for this game, like new episodes, I would definitely play them. I had a lot of fun with this game.			"

												This game is well made. It is clear from playing the game that it is in a league of it's own. The graphics work well for the type of game that it is - a homage to the 1980's and early 90's culture. I bought this game and didn't know what to expect. What I found was a well-made, thoughtful but fun and light game that may become my game of the year. I HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone. It was very rewarding to play this game - it was FUN. It was a feel-good experience and I just hope there is more of this game. DLC? Count me in DAY ONE!EDIT: UPDATE - August 23, 2015 - I've started playing the game again to get achievements and complete levels. Doing that really takes the gameplay to a new level and increases the challenge. Playing the game fully takes a game that was a ""quick playthrough"" and turns it into a full gaming experience. Returning to the game after playing it once gives new perspective. The game is STILL fun, enjoyable and well made. I would still highly recommend it to others.EDIT: UPDATE - August 25, 2015 - This game has been due for an update for the past two years. EPISODE 5 was due two years ago, but has been pushed to ""summer 2015"" as per the games Steam page selling the games soundtrack. It's 2015 and there is no update yet. This is important because this game has achievements and one of them is ""complete 5 episodes"" - and you can't do this with the current 4 episodes that are released.As much as I love this game, other players need to know that there is an UPDATE DELAY that impacts the ability to play the game and makes 100% completion impossible.  I have posted twice on the facebook group of Saturday Morning RPG but there is no word from the developer. I will update this as needes.			"

												Have a nice and gently laugh at that 80s/90s aura you would otherwise find a little too kitchy. The game is so full of quotes and referencies you are bound to get -at least up to a certain extent- and to feel a bit old and nostalgic with some self-awarness of the time passing by. It's a melting pot of crossed pop referencies that blend up into a school canteen soup: lines and expressions are accurate enough to get you into the mood just by themselves (I'm not a native english speaker but somehow they bring me back to the ones I once was used to), the tools you'll use are a trip in a yardsale, the end battle screenshot are shiny as they should, the music is nothing short than a Journey, the ""cinematics"", the main and the side plots are a collection of action films memories. It's not a gem of crazy humor in itself but mostly in the eyes of the player who picture himself and his childhood through the eyeglass of an older person. Moreover you can enjoy a pre-battle and in-battle tactical system that it's easy enough to get but gives you a decent rate of improvent and learning. Basically, you have to combine power-ups and buffers and the tools you use in battle, so the options are vary and not repetitive and suit the rpg concept of the game. To add more flavour (said by a very clumsy guy) the developers put into a certain number of minigames, mostly to trigger weapon and tools side effects and to charge up your attacks (I'm not using a mouse and I'm regretting it). Last but not least it's cheap. This is not a lifetime game experience but it actually gets, in a rather honest way, it's primal goal: to help you sail through a lazy saturday morning when you are in vein of a time back flip.			"

												I bought this game on the last day of the holiday Steam sale on a whim, and it was one of my best purchases to date! Admittedly I am the exact target audience for this game - I grew up in the 80s and still remember sneaking downstairs waaaaaayyyy too early on Saturday mornings to watch Voltron, Dungeons & Dragons, Josie & the ♥♥♥♥♥cats, etc. and nearly dying of  excitement the year we finally got an original Nintendo. Everything from the music, to the quests, to the NPC dialog perfectly captures both my real and imaginary life from that time period - I love it.Speaking somewhat less subjectively. The episodes are short - for me that's a bonus. Each one took me 45-80 minutes for the first run through, and that was fully exploring. But that is perfect if you don't have a lot of time and want to feel like you're accomplishing something in a gaming session. Also, there is some replay value, as you get to keep all your new shinies when you replay a level, so you can experience the satisfaction of instantly obliterating a baddie that gave you trouble the first time around. But I can see how a short game would be unsatisfying to some players. But don't say it's not worth the $$. It's like, $1.50 now, and even if you pay the full $6.99 that is around $1 per hour of fun at most. If you're willing to pay even $5 for a matinee movie, you can't complain this game isn't worth it.Also the battles, turn based, can be a little repetative - especially in the beginning. But once I had a few more weapons/defensive options/buffs I had a lot of fun playing around with various combinations.No the graphics aren't up to Witcher 3 standard. Or 2. or 1.  Or...   80s remember? That said, if you've ever seen the Transformers cartoons and thought only ""Ugg, this is unbearable"" or can't stand music from before 1998 then maybe this game isn't for you. But anyone who had to sit through a D.A.R.E program, or rushed home aftrer school, hoping not to miss the Transformers OP please, please ""risk"" $1.50 (or whatever!) on this game. The psychological benefits of just the first 15 minutes alone are probably greater than your last 5 therapy session.**I'm not mocking therapy or people who need it! I'm in therapy!

												Saturday Morning RPG is a very unique rpg influenced by 80's culture and Saturday morning cartoons. For a gamer like me this is a instant buy! From Gi Joe,Transformers to random Michel Jackson gloves, the many puns and references keep the humor and nostalgia at a all time high! Can a gamer who know nothing of 80's culture and cartoons like this game? Definitely yes! It has plenty of wackiness and charm to keep anyone entertained. You play the role of Marty who was granted  a magical notebook that looks like a Trapper Keeper. This notebook allows him to use everyday objects as weapons to defeat his foes lead by the evil Commander Hood. Being like a cartoon you play through different episodes and you can play them in any order. As you advance through the game you will find more object's to use and different covers for your notebook that will add helpful stats. You also find stickers that you place on your notebook also giving more stat bonuses. The visual style is heavily inspired by the classic Paper Mario series having a 3d world with 2d sprites. The graphics look decent but nothing mind blowing. Game play is very close to Paper Mario with the battles being turn based and the action interactive. You will have to time button presses for better defense and attacks. Some attacks are mini games ranging from timing your button presses, gauge building to even classic Simon memory games. This makes the battles extremely fun and interesting at the same time. The music matches the charm of this game perfectly! Composed by Vince DiCola (Rocky IV and Transformers: The movie) with his partner Kenny Meriedeth (Duck Tales, Power Rangers, X-Men) expect nothing but awesome! Although this game is short compared to most rpgs it does have some replay value. You have different quests to undertake for each episode and upon beating episodes you are awarded a grade. You are able to replay any episode with all your earned items and levels to try quests you may have missed and also go for a better grade. You also have arena battles where you fight special bosses and endless mode fighting waves of enemy's. The developer is working on another episode for the fans even though the game is not earning enough revenue for support. Developers like this I respect and deserve support! If you like rpgs I totally recommend this.			"

												Bad:The user interface was slightly unwieldy; sometimes the tooltip would block the ability to click other items.Some of the items don't deal the damage the tooltip might suggest(i.e. five star damage items doing 4-5 damage whereas 1 star damage items doing double, not talking about multi-hit items obviously).Combat was frustrating at times, especially if an opponent puts up a shield just before a big hit, nullifying more than 50-100 points of damage with a ~10 health shield. On that note, if you get a moderate to severe debuff to your accuracy, you may as well restart the battle since you are pretty much next to guaranteed to not hit .Good:Quests were intuitive with their direction and were easy to understand and undertake as a result. Lots of different items and builds to experiment, with some degree of flexibility with changing builds via stickers. Being able to repeat episodes allow you to make different choices and do quests/obtain items one may have missed. Overall: 6.5/10Points deducted mainly for game balance and minor UI issues. For such a cheap price, do buy it for an enjoyable game with some quirks.  "

The story is basicly captin N, but with tv shows, but still enjoyable. Its a pokemon style game. Explore the world, and go into a turn base battles. I recommand the game for people who are aware of 80s popculture, and if youree one of those people and love RPGs, this is the game youve dreamed of. But be warned of tought boss battles. 8/10.			"

												I have been playing this game for a bit, and I have to say that it is excellent. While loaded with ""retro"" humour and pop-cultural references, the game also manages to keep a more or less coherent plot to it. The turn-based combat harkens back to Super Mario RPG on the SNES.Anyway, I'd say that overall if you are a fan of 1980's and early 1990's cartoons, video games and movies, you'd probably get a kick out of this game. I certainly am.			"

My only gripe is that you pretty much play through it alone, you don't get any back up and you fight the hordes of bad guys by yourself. Other than that it's a great game and I highly recomend it.

It's like, $1.50 now, and even if you pay the full $6.99 that is around $1 per hour of fun at most. If you're willing to pay even $5 for a matinee movie, you can't complain this game isn't worth it.Also the battles, turn based, can be a little repetative - especially in the beginning. But once I had a few more weapons/defensive options/buffs I had a lot of fun playing around with various combinations.No the graphics aren't up to Witcher 3 standard. Or 2. or 1.  Or...   80s remember? That said, if you've ever seen the Transformers cartoons and thought only ""Ugg, this is unbearable"" or can't stand music from before 1998 then maybe this game isn't for you. But anyone who had to sit through a D.A.R.E program, or rushed home aftrer school, hoping not to miss the Transformers OP please, please ""risk"" $1.50 (or whatever!) on this game. The psychological benefits of just the first 15 minutes alone are probably greater than your last 5 therapy session.**I'm not mocking therapy or people who need it! I'm in therapy! I'm just saying laughing and feeling good is good,			"

												As far as the humor of this game goes, it's absolutely great. If it was in the 80s and early 90s, it's in here. That makes it incredibly entertaining, and I want more episodes just to see what other things show up. It's a non-stop run of references, like if I Love the 80s was a video game.I like the style of the art as well, although the biggest issue is that the fighting gets a bit repetitive, and the grades for it feel a bit arbitrary. For what the rest of it has, though, I can more than forgive it that, though I feel like if I could more easily test out different weapons I'd not be as bored, but with only 5 slots, it's tough to take leaps to try other weapons.

												Saturday Morning RPG is a very unique rpg influenced by 80's culture and Saturday morning cartoons. For a gamer like me this is a instant buy! From Gi Joe,Transformers to random Michel Jackson gloves, the many puns and references keep the humor and nostalgia at a all time high! Can a gamer who know nothing of 80's culture and cartoons like this game? Definitely yes! It has plenty of wackiness and charm to keep anyone entertained. You play the role of Marty who was granted  a magical notebook that looks like a Trapper Keeper. This notebook allows him to use everyday objects as weapons to defeat his foes lead by the evil Commander Hood. Being like a cartoon you play through different episodes and you can play them in any order. As you advance through the game you will find more object's to use and different covers for your notebook that will add helpful stats. You also find stickers that you place on your notebook also giving more stat bonuses. The visual style is heavily inspired by the classic Paper Mario series having a 3d world with 2d sprites. The graphics look decent but nothing mind blowing. Game play is very close to Paper Mario with the battles being turn based and the action interactive. You will have to time button presses for better defense and attacks. Some attacks are mini games ranging from timing your button presses, gauge building to even classic Simon memory games. This makes the battles extremely fun and interesting at the same time. The music matches the charm of this game perfectly! Composed by Vince DiCola (Rocky IV and Transformers: The movie) with his partner Kenny Meriedeth (Duck Tales, Power Rangers, X-Men) expect nothing but awesome! Although this game is short compared to most rpgs it does have some replay value. You have different quests to undertake for each episode and upon beating episodes you are awarded a grade. You are able to replay any episode with all your earned items and levels to try quests you may have missed and also go for a better grade. You also have arena battles where you fight special bosses and endless mode fighting waves of enemy's. The developer is working on another episode for the fans even though the game is not earning enough revenue for support. Developers like this I respect and deserve support! If you like rpgs I totally recommend this.			"

												Saturday morning is a rpg with lots of nostalgia feelings from the 80s heck even in the first 5min of the game you get a reference to the power glove and how it's so bad.But the rpg elements are really boring, notice i said boring not bad, you gather stickets and elements from the 80s to put in your notebook, select up to 5 stickers and 5 of those elements from the 80s and when it's time to battle you gotta do a QTE to scratch those tickets for the bonuses, once you're fighting is similar to a paper mario game, each item has a different attack and can be used a limited amount of times, accompanied with a  QTE for more damage, you also need to recharge your batteries in order to do extra damage which can be done in 3 different ways, tapping fast, timing, or automatically.Battles are somehow lenghty hence why it becomes really boring in the long run, since it's the same strategy each and every battle, recharge , attack , recharge, attack , until you win.The items attack animations are really cool though, using a carebear to shoot carelasers from your chest and such.If you're from the 80s or are a fan of turn based rpgs you can give it a try, this game got bundled quite several times already so don't go hasty and buy the full price.

												What can I say about Saturday Morning RPG hmmmm lets see.....This game is amazing it mixs two things together in a right way. It mixs 80s style cartoon and pop culture references with your standard turn base RPG elements. Lets just say it makes you feel like a kid again. This game is fun but I will say it is on the short side. You will want to play the game more than once to try out new sticker powers. Its a game to TOTALLY pick up!!!!			"

												Loved this game, start to finish! As a man born in the 80s I loved many of the references to the cartoons of that era.However, nostalgia is not the only thing this game has going for it. Nor is the fantastic soundtrack. The battle system itself proved to be surprisingly addictive, to the point where a considerable chunk of my time playing was spent in the Endless battle mode. The battle system reminded me of the likes of Paper Mario, with having only one character and emphasizing tactics over level-grinding, especially if the difficulty option is set to level the enemies to match the player.You can generally tell if a game's retro-style sprites are a stylistic choice, or a sign of laziness on the part of the developer- the former being graphics like those of Mega Man 9 and 10, which have real effort behind them and would have been considered top-of-the-line during the period of gaming they imitate, while the latter often would be considered ugly even by early NES standards. For Saturday Morning RPG, I'd say it falls quite squarely in the stylistic choice category- I could easily imagine the sprites wouldn't look too out of place on a 16-bit era title. Your mileage may vary on how willing you are to have that merged with the 3D backgrounds, but for me it reminded me of how things worked with some PS1 classics like Star Ocean: Second Story, Breath of Fire III, and Tomba. (Yep, I got some 90s nostalgia out of it too, not just 80s.)The buyer should be aware this game is short. Its four episodes are written to feel like episodes out of a Saturday Morning cartoon, and their length is set accordingly. The plotlines are very much self-contained, and emphasize nostalgia-related humor over deeper storytelling. I still considered it well worth the small price tag and then some (liked it enough to buy it twice, even- Ouya and PC versions!), but don't go expecting $7 to buy you a Final Fantasy-class epic. I read there's plans for two more episodes in the future, but I've no idea how far in the future.Overall, Saturday Morning RPG is a surprisingly addictive title, well worth it for anyone with any fondness for the 80s, or who enjoys RPGs like Paper Mario that have unique battle systems that stand up well on their own.

												There have been a lot of nostalgia-related computer games lately, but this is one of the ones that speaks to me most.  It has a lot of references to 80s shows I watched like GI Joe and He-Man.  Plus it has nods to other things I did back then, like putting stickers on Trapper Keepers, and chewing Fruit Stripe gum.  On the downside, I didn't love the graphics.  The low-res sprites are a reference to older video games, and I appreciate that.  However, the characters are too detailed to realistically be called ""8-bit"", so they didn't actually push my nostalgia buttons.  Instead, they just look blocky.  Different characters and backgrounds have different levels of detail, making characters look out of place.  Again, the graphics are intenionally bad - it's not like the programmers just got lazy.  It's just I would have preferred they presented the 8-bit references in a different way.  I've played enough modern games with 8-bit graphics, and I think this particular game would have worked better using an art style that emulates 80s cartoons rather than 80s video games.  But that's just my opinion.Getting past the art, the gameplay is just okay.  It's your basic turn-based RPG.  Some of your special moves require minigame-like button presses to do more damage, but if you don't like that sort of thing, you can always favor the more straightforward moves when customizing your character.  It's fun, but if you play a lot of RPGs, it's nothing you haven't seen before.  The bottom line is that you're playing this for all the 80s references.  If that doesn't describe your childhood, you probably won't get much out of this game. "

												An excellent, original game, it may seem like just another indie project at first. But beneath the layers of pop-culture, nostalgia and product placements (RcAstley's? Really?), an intriguing RPG can be found. While the control scheme can take some getting used to, you can always configure it rather easily. I personally quite like the idea of a ZXCVUpDownLeftRight control system. While this may not appeal to everyone, I recommend it for fans of RPGs, especially Pokemon. The game retains a laid-back, cool atmosphere, while offering up decent combat and exploring parts. I owned this game from release day (it was on sale, what can I say), and I most definitely have not regretted clicking that Buy button.8/10			"

												This game is just stupid amounts of fun. Especially if you're like me and grew up watching cartoons like this. On top of fun characters and story the game play is pretty tight and the combat system throws enough in to keep things from getting stail. My only gripe is that you pretty much play through it alone, you don't get any back up and you fight the hordes of bad guys by yourself. Other than that it's a great game and I highly recomend it.

												Let me start with the only thing I don't like about this game-The stickers. Having to scratch off stickers for every fight brings back awful memories of the first Mario Party. Other than that one gripe, I have nothing but good things to say. A Paper Mario style twitch reaction RPG combat system that gives you the option to charge any attack makes battles engaging more than just selecting attack over and over. Numerous ""spells"" to equip give you the chance to experiment and find what you like. Loads of 80's pop culture references are supported by catchy synth music and great pixel animation. Only 5 chapters is a bit of a bummer and the game may be slightly overpriced for its' length but arena mode, endless mode, and that tantalizing %100 completion give you a decent bang for your buck. I hope to see a sequel. A sequel with no stickers.			"

												Silly bit of nostalgic fun for less than a buck (it was 90 cents when I bought it). I used to play this on my iPad, but it became unsupported and sound stopped working so I gave up on it. Nice to have it back on PC. If you grew up in the 70's, 80's or maybe even the early 90's this game just might make you smile.ONE PROBLEM THOUGH: the button prompts keep getting switched on me. For example, if I play using an Xbox controller, it shows me keyboard key prompts sometimes, and ruins my ability to react. I know this is a cheap little budget game, so I don't really expect much support, but it would be really nice to see that bug fixed in the future.			"

												I purchased this on sale, but it is worth the $7. I have had a soft spot for JRPGs for a long time, but they often take themselves very seriously, are very stereotypical, and have repetitive (very long) gameplay. Sometimes this is just what I want, and sometimes I want Saturday Morning RPG (SMRPG).Divided into short episodes, this game is all about charm and style. It is an indie production, and the amount of care he has put into the writing is apparent. The graphics try for pixel-love, and mostly succeed, but the 3d areas lack definition. No, this isn't so much about the look, but about the ideas. It's about having fun. It doesn't take itself seriously, it doesn't last too long, it doesn't boast complex systems. It's a Saturday Morning cartoon, and it is filled with charm and nostalgia.Enjoy.			"
