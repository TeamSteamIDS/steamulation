												The best game ever. It was the best game when it came out, it still is the best game ever made. Now with all the fanmade patches that add the cut content and fix a massive amount of bugs, there is no reason not to try this classic. If I could, I would take this game out, buy it dinner, have sex with it and call it the next day. Then we would start going out regularly, we would fall in love eventually. We would become the couple that has their own inside jokes and are always teasing each other and everyone else would be jealous of us. We would get married and have a child (System shock 2, the second best game ever). We would grow old together, on my dead bed as I lie there about to draw my last breath, Fallout 2 looks at me with tears in it's eyes ""Thank you for everything, you were always so good to me"" and I would take Fallout 2s hand, look it in the eye and say ""No, thank YOU"" then pass away. Updated on 26/11/2016 Still the best game ever			"

												*I have included some tips at the end to help newcomers to the early Fallouts*I remember the hundreds of hours I've spent on the console version of Fallout 3 back in 2011. Fast forward to early 2015, I've decided to try out the older Fallouts, starting with Fallout 2. This being my first ""true"" RPG experience, all of the info and stats, along with the fact that it was a turn based isometric game, made it look intimidating from the surface, but after some researching, the game starts to look less daunting.Just like the Bethesda Fallouts, the game uses the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system and the familiar stats, along with traits. Fallout 2 really does gives you a lot of options on how you can adjust your character. Naturally, I (stupidly) chose to have a really buff gunman with perception and agility as my dump stats. I went through the Temple of Trials (the tutorial dungeon) and got demolished. My stats made playing through the game a nightmare. See, unlike Fallout 3, the stats you choose matter a great deal more. Some of stats in Fallout 2 function the same as Fallout 3 (Strength judges carry weight and ability to use weapons, Intelligence increases skill points, Endurance increases HP and resistance, Agility affects Action Ponts, Luck increases stats slightly and influences random encounters). However, some act differently. Perception affects how acurate you are at longer ranges, every single action requires Action Points meaning that high Agility builds are better for combat, Charisma affects the number of companions you can have, and low Intelligence can effectively deny you from a large amount of quests and activities.With this information, I remade my character and went back into the Temple of Trials. It must be said, however, that the Temple is a very poor representation of the game. The game forces you to use melee and barely gives you enough healing items to get past the darn thing if you don't use hit and run tactics with high agility. Fallout 2 gives you no information regarding mechanics, and it's clear that the devs were forced to phone in a tutorial segment (if you can call it that).Fortunately, the game starts to show its magic after you exit the Temple and rejoin the villagers of Arroyo, the home of the decendants of the protagonist of the first Fallout. The village is dying and you are tasked to gind the G.E.C.K, a device that can help bring life back to the village. From there, you find a multitude of interesting characters and locations, such as New Reno and its many gangs, to the Broken Hills with its super mutants. Although there is a small amount of quests compared to the later games, the quality of the dialogue and the world you are thrown into makes it easy to forgive. The game also includes some returning characters from the first Fallout, which give some background to the protagonist and the events of the first game. Unfortunately, the humor of this game is something that may not be appealing to some, however. Fallout 2 does include many pop culture references and fourth wall breaks, which does get tiring admittedly.Combat in this game is very enjoyable and has a satisfying punch to it, with gory animations accompanying sounds of limbs being blown off. The amount of weapons in this game is fairly reasonable, but this is mainly towards the end where you have gained large amounts of money and can handle the tougher enemies with better loot.Overall, Fallout 2 is a real classic of a game. It may be hard to adjust as a newcomer, but the game is very much worth it.*Some tips*- You have four types of cursors in the game (switch by using M2), a yellow arrow (click on items to interact, hold M1 to get a list of interactions), a red hexagon (decides where you go), a hand (decides what you pick up in the inventory screen), and a red crosshair (decides what you shoot, only accessable when you are in combat).- You can break wooden doors by using melee on them or using a grenade.- To use Skilldex skills, click on the skilldex button, choose the skill and then the item you want to use the skill on.Examples: Click on Doctor and yourself to heal. Click on Lockpick and a door to lockpick. Click on Steal and a person to steal.- Before exiting towns or talking to important characters, save.- To change the action done to a weapon you are holding, press M2 on the weapon box. For guns, this can change them to Single Fire, Aimed, Burst (If the gun has it), or Reload. The green ticks on the side of the weapon represent the ammo level.- When bartering, make sure to get change from transactions. For example, if I bought a gun that costs $1000 and gave a gun that costs $950, I need to bring the vendor's money into the transaction area to get money. In this case, I would ask for $50.- The red button above the inventory button helps switch weapons.- To enter combat with friendlies (or unaware enemies), click on your weapon. To end combat, press the CMBT on the bottom right. To end your turn, press Turn. (Also on the bottom right).- Rest by clicking the Pipboy button and clicking on the yellow button on the top of its menu. This can only be done after finishing the Temple of Trials.-  You can scavenge extra ammo from dead NPCs by using the yellow cursor and choosing the ""unload gun"" icon (picture of a gun and magazine) from the interation list.

												THIS GAME.THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.BUYING THIS GAME WAS ONE OF THE WORST MISTAKES I EVER MADE.I started this game up expecting to have a good time, as I did with the other Fallout games. I'd played Fallout 1, and I'd heard from almost everyone that Fallout 2 was FAR superior. I throroughly enjoyed Fallout 1, but my main problem with it was that the game was timed, and practically forced you to rush through it. Because of this, I felt as though my experience with the game was cut short. The main thing I was looking for when I started playing Fallout 2 was a lengthier game that would allow me to explore and progress at my own pace.I got more than I could have ever hoped for.The game started out slow, much like many other RPGs, and frankly, it was a bit boring for the first few hours. But I knew from my previous experiences that Fallout games only get better as you progress. I made it through the first few areas, and started getting a feel for how things worked, finding plenty of new quests, etc. It was becoming rather enjoyable, then I got the car, which would allow me to carry more things, and explore the wasteland with much more ease. It was very exciting, almost like getting my first car all over again. And at that point I was hooked.Everything from that point on is a bit of a blur, I remember traveling from city to city, back and forth, looking for every quest I could possibly find. The process of finding better and better gear for my three companions was addicting, the process of ensuring the prosperity of all the settlements was addicting, the atmosphere is addicting, becoming famous for various reasons across the wasteland was addicting, the fact that the game goes into so much detail and lets you influence the way things play out was addicting. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME IS ADDICTING!I couldn't help it, hours and hours of my life were being sucked away, and there was nothing I could to about it except keep playing. IT WAS AMAZING.The final toll was a little over 66 hours for me. And that was all spent on a single playthrough. When I FINALLY beat the game, I felt a feeling of happiness and satisfaction that I haven't felt in YEARS. But most of all, I felt an overwhelming sense of FREEDOM. NO LONGER WAS I SHACKLED BY ITS IMMENSE QUALITY, BY ITS SHEER BEAUTY. I will never play this game for the first time again, that makes me both relieved and depressed. Depressed, because this game is phenomenal, because it is one of the best games I ever played. But relieved, because I will never lose that many hours that quickly ever again.This game is a true gem. It is an incredible, immersive experience even by today's standards, and in fact, shïts all over most modern RPGs.That's the problem, though, this game is TOO GOOD. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO LOSE.Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna start my evil playthough.			"

												Destroys everything, one of the greatest pieces of art ever created, Fallout 2 is an RPG in which you play a tribesman who is tasked to find and return a device to his village known as the G.E.C.K (which is a piece of technology that is able to revitalize areas of a post-nuclear wasteland, transforming dead, irradiated soil into viable land suitable for farming) to save his people from famine. The plot is subtle and a great break from all the melodramatic, save the universe type ♥♥♥♥ most games consist of.Fallout 2, like the first, gives you a large, brutal and unforgiving world to traverse at your own risk, full of genuinely fascinating locations and extremely interesting characters to interact with; from scientists who give mutated scorpions chems to their increase intelligence, talking plants and a highly intelligent and articulate Deathclaw, there are tons of geniusly fantastic, memorable characters to interact with through-out and even though Fallout 2 doesn't always take itself too seriously and is sometimes outright comical the game still portrays a grim, cruel and extremely immersive world like no other.Fallout 2 features some of the finest role playing out there, with tons of meaningful choices and consequences through-out which question your ethics and morality on a far deeper scale than just simply being the good / bad guy. The quests you recieve in Fallout 2 are diverse and often offer multiple ways in which you can complete them, some ways which were not even intended by the developers, there is just so much freedom of choice here that is completely non-existent in 'RPGs' today.The character building is brilliant and has a ton of depth, every little stat directly affects how your game plays out, being highly intelligent with the personality of a brick or being a knucklehead with the charisma of a dictator will deeply affect how NPCs interact with you. There are so many choices to make in character building that have huge, meaningful impacts on the world around you that multiple playthroughs are essential to experience what this masterpiece has to offer.The visuals at first glance may seem bland and out-dated but the art direction is beyond brilliant and is complimented by believable, excellent world design and an insanely thick atmosphere - this doesn't feel like videogame world nor like it was designed to be one, rather an actual post-apocalyptic place.The sound effects are absolutely spot on. The ambient, non-intrusive music through-out is fantastic and adds a lot to the atmosphere and the voiced dialogue is pretty well done. Fallout 2's combat is turn-based and offers a ton of depth, giving you the opportunity to use a tactical approach rather than just mindlessly clicking away like in many of todays so-called RPG's - I do however encounter frustration with not being able to control friendly AI in combat and as a result get shot in the back and watching friendly AI running at an isolated enemy instead of backing up your character who then gets outnumbered and killed is rage-inducing to say the least, these flaws only occur right in the beginning until you get used to pathing and such but rather big flaws non-the-less. Overall Fallout 2, along with Baldur's Gate, Darklands and Planescape Torment are the pinnacle of RPGs in every regard and will probably remain that way until the end of time judging by how far the genre has declined since. You can't call yourself a fan of RPGs until you have experienced these absolute masterpieces, if you're interested in playing Fallout 1 or 2 for the first time and haven't played anything of the sort before I'd advise a lot of patience in the early stages which by judging from some of the negative reviews is too much to ask for some. This is a mandatory experience for anyone who loves videogames, experiences like this simply don't exist anymore.			"

												If there is a genre of games which I value and play above all others it's first person shooters. Especially competitive MP FPS games like UT, Quake, Counter Strike etc. However every once in a while comes a game that isn't a part of those genres and it's so bloody good that it makes an exception to my preference. This recommendation is for Fallout 1 and 2 which are easily bought in a cheap value pack. Without a doubt they stand as some of the greatest games ever made. Even if they are technologically way behind the times, the concept idea and execution are so well done that this become one of the biggest benchmarks for role playing games in general.These games are simple to explain, it's a free roaming massive quest based role playing game. You start the game with entire world open to you, hardly any restrictions and it's up to you to what happens. There are absurd amount of choices in pretty much everything. Make a character that is a gunslinger, sniper, brute using melee weapons, a silver tonged diplomat, a retard who can only communicate via grunts and hardly understandable shouts,a slaver, evil to the core son of a ♥♥♥♥♥. it's all open to you from start. The character creation portion is extensive, complicated and delightful to how much you can plan out for your game. This is followed numerous ways to solve problems. Almost every problem has multiple solutions, ranging from taking different sides (pleasing or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off factions), violent approach, diplomatic approach you name it. A person won't help you with something you just take your gun and kill them, then face the consequences. Game is really harsh, anything rash and dumb can easily end up with game over.One huge praise to the choice presented to the player is the adult theme that isn't dumbed down (unlike the more recent Fallout 3 and NV(though NV to less extent)). You can become a porn star, ♥♥♥♥♥ yourself out for services and persuasion, you can kill children and be labeled as a Childkiller. Everything you do reflects your standing in the world and how NPCs look at you.Another big praise is how humor is incorporated into this wacky, grim post apocaliptic world. Expect several monty python references and spoofs.It's seamless and fitting. It's amazing how well such wacky humor incorporated into dark games such as these two.If there are downsides it's that vanilla games are rather buggy. I recommend Killap's unoffical patch/restoration project for fallout 2 and the appropriate patches for fallout 1. Check No Mutants Allowed for patches. Get the resolution patch as well. This way you can upscale the resolution to more modern standard.I could sit here all day and write about the insane amount of cool things to do in this game, but that's better to be experienced in person. Do yourself a favor and if you like RPG games where you are not shoehorned into a path, play these game. They are most certainly some of the best you will ever play.			"

												While Fallout 2's wacky humor and ridiculous references to things like Monty Python and the Holy Grail might not be for absolutely everyone, it does have a much larger world with much more content than Fallout 1 that is, in my opinion at the very least, of equal quality as it's predecessor. The story shares some similarity to the first game, as you play a tribal descendant of the Vault Dweller, sent out to find a device that will save your dying village of Arroyo from famine and disease.The world, though, feels much larger, showing far more signs of development over the years. Old towns like the LA Boneyard and Junktown have disappeared off the map, replaced with or absorbed into new, more solidly established places like the New California Republic, an evolution of the town of Shady Sands, a San Francisco Chinatown populated by chinese refugees and even New Reno, a city of vice and sin populated by casinos, porn theaters, drug dealers, and gangs of post-nuclear mafiosos all going at each other's throats for control of the city.Mechanically, Fallout 2 tightens up a lot of stuff from the first game. Most immediately noticeable are things like a ""Take All"" button in container menus, an option to push NPCs out of the way non-violently should they ever block your path, and an overhaul of the companion system, allowing you to get one extra character in your party for every two points of Charisma, with the limit maxing out at five companions for ten Charisma, and the ability to change every companion's strategic options if you don't want them accidentally mowing you down with a Vindicator Minigun.Although Fallout 2 was criticized heavily for it's buggy and rushed state of release, with a large chunk of content never seeing the light of day, it has since received support from modders that fix all of these issues. Most notable are sfall, which makes many engine tweaks and quality of life improvements, and Killapp's Unofficial Patch and Restoration Project, which respectively patch out all the major bugs in the game and fully implement all the cut content seamlessly into the game.All this put together, Fallout 2 is a very large, but tight package with solid mechanics and fun writing, injecting even more personality into the wasteland than the first game. It can miss the mark sometimes, but on the whole it feels like the writers had a fun time, and the game itself is well worth playing even today. Whether or not you're a lover of old-school RPGs, Fallout 2 has a lot on offer, and most of it is pretty superb.			"

												Just over a decade ago, life was simpler and more frivolous, so every fictional discovery was fascinating and entertaining. It was in that simple, mid-teenage life, that I dug Fallout 2 out of a fortunate coincidence. A disc copy of the game, in a modest gaming magazine, to whose cover it was poorly attached. It seemed interesting enough, and with little knowledge of cRPGs or English, I went home and gave it a try. Boy, was I enthralled by this game. A game which would, about ten years later, still be the most cherished piece of gaming I have ever experienced. Fallout 2 ventures deep into the dark territories of humour and morbidity. Not many have the grit for its atmosphere, inauspicious and heavy as it is, its dense soundtrack that evinces feelings of gloomy solitude and decadence; exactly the vibe you have got to be in when playing any Fallout title, for that matter. Back when I first tried it, I would engage in conflicts between the curiosity to explore its narrative and the uneasiness caused by that very atmosphere, even after having previously and briefly tried Planescape: Torment - an equally dense game. Fortunately for me, I got past that.Provided that you can also overcome such uneasiness, you've got an unparallelled RPG challenge ahead of you. Fallout 2, very much like its predecessor, is beautifully written, and cleverly designed in a way that connects your actions to the realities and contextual changes of Northern California as you go. The turn-based combat is typical late-90s cRPG gold. The S.P.E.C.I.A.L role-playing system, a jewel derived from Gurps, offers you that edge of character construction and skill management that makes a bonafide RPG pleasurable. The post-apocalyptic setting and aesthetics, built on the famous premise of the Divergence - the historical fragmentation in which the fictional linearity of the game took a different course from that of our world in the heat of the Cold War, leaving the former with that futuristic-50s style -, renders Fallout's identity unique and typically dark humoured. Its characters are deeply unpredictable and credible, especially the companions, much more mature than those of the previous installment (with all due respect to the likes of Ian and Dogmeat). The game leaves that bitter feeling of longing in the player's mouth should they pass away or have to be left behind for some reason. Each companion adds to the player's enterprise, each has their own story, each has their own passions and motivations. And flaws.Fallout 2 appeals to multiple audiences. Those looking for an RPG; those looking for a post-apocalyptic piece; those looking for a story-driven game; those looking for open-world dynamic narratives; those looking for a demi-horror title; and so forth. While it may not touch some of these categories in depth, it is a game that brings them all to a perfect harmony. Be ready for a challenge, an unforgiving gameplay, but be also ready for enriching rewards that will open your mind to new spheres of role-playing gaming.			"

												- Starts game.- Completes Temple of Trials tutorial. - Wanders around home village for a little while, helping people solve trivial problems to gain a little experience.- Exits to world map, starts heading due South.- Stops to save often on the journey South, as the region is extremely dangerous and he is still only Level 3.- Randomly encounters Fire Geckos, dies horribly in flames. Relaod at last save.- Randomly encounters Deathclaws, dies horribly torn limb from limb. Reload at last save.- Reaches southwest coast of California, begins searching about world map.- Randomly encounters Super Mutants, dies horribly riddled with 5mm bullets from a minigun. Reload at last save.- After a short search, locates secret Enclave base hidden behind an old gas station by the coast, just North of San Francisco.- Sneaks into Enclave base, collects standard-issue Enclave Advanced Power Armor and Plasma Rifle.- Sneaks out of Enclave base.- Goes on to handily dominate every foe in the game and save the Wasteland, in style.- Is not a cheater, just knows this game that well after playing it for more than 1,000 hours.10/10 Would murder Mr. Bishop and sleep with his wife again.

												A classic for the ages. When I hear Louis Armstrong on the radio it immediately takes me back to geckos, rad scorpions, and those secure vault tec vaults. The graphics are old but the gameplay and story are great. I feel the content is a bit greater then the orginal fallout making it to be a very long game. Your goal is not only a main quest but also to intervene with the towns and locations you encounter. The ending is the best because it tells you the later fate of all those you've helped or destoryed. One of the best video game endings ever!~update~ I failed to mention this before. Your SPECIAL stats are very important. You will miss a lot of side quests with a low Charisma (people will refuse to talk to you). Other Special stats might play a role at times. Its best to keep them atleast above a 3 or 4. The Gifted trait is a great choice to get 7 extra points to allocate anywhere.			"

												Second volume of the legendary role-playing game about humankind after Doomsday, very thorough both in the battle system and in interactions with the world around player. World with numerous different characters, situations and occasions. And with constant multiplicity of choices for every your step, of course.Now, with the High Res mod which Steam finally added into the launcher. Without that mod, you couldn't play this classic on everything upper to WinXP, which was a bummer really. So glad that Steam finally fixed it…Some of my friends are so purist they think Fallout 2 was a misinterpretation of the first, the-one-and-only, Fallout game. Thanks to Heaven, I'm not one of them. On contrary, I'm enjoying the second game more, for all additional content it have with comparison to the first game. Which was great, but a little straight-forward closer to the end.In the Fallout 2 I've spent dozens and hundreds hours of my time, found so many secrets and easter eggs... It is like a town where you were grown. You may be now a big man from big city, but you'll always remember old shortcuts and hiding places where you were at your childhood...Sure it looks dated, and maybe somewhat clunky at first, but, once you get to know that game better, I’m sure, you’ll love it.My mark for one of the most tempting games of my teens age? 10/10, of course! Yes, it’s dated, yes, it’s much harder and unforgivable for beginners than new-age RPGs… But it’s lovely thing. Like some books, that you want to open again and again, or people you always love to meet.			"

												Before i start the review i would like to give you a overview of what i will speak about in the review Fallout 1 Fallout 2 Fallout 3 Fallout NV and maybe Fallout 4 if i feel i need to Story Fallout 2 is set 80 years after the events of Fallout 1 and you are the grandchild of the 1st games's protaganist the vault dweller you are the chosen one of your village Arroyo tasked with finding a G.E.C.K to help save your village.Gameplay Fallout 2's gameplay may not be appealing to the modern genration but once you become familiar with the combat system and the fact that all quests are unmarked the game becomes excellent Fallout 2 sticks to the formula of the first game you can tell this because the games play virtually the same.For me Fallout 2 was definatley more challenging than Fallout 1 and definatley more challening than the newer Fallout 3 and FNV this brings me onto my next pointWhy i personally think fallout 1,2 and NV are better than 3 and 4Personally i think 2 and NV are the best games in the franchise for me Fallout 2 engrosed me into the deaper lore and decisions of the game along with the backstory. When i comes to the ending of Fallout 3 there is only one major outcome of the game (Im not going to spoil if some of you havent played Fallout 3) and the end credits just talk about what sort of person you were in the game. Whereas in Fallout 1,2 and NV the way you handle quests in different areas and your actions in these areas affect the areas future in a deaper manner. for example Fallout 1,2 and new vegas in the end credit scence you hear things like ""Your involvment in this town and how you did this mean the town prospered or the town was quickly eradicated"" Wheras in fallout 3 this isnt there. General overview of Fallout 2 Fallout 2 is a timeless classic of the Fallout franchise and for those who consider themselves die hard fans of the fallout series you should get this game also if you do get the game also download the resteration patch from the No mutants allowed forum it adds cut content into the game and fixes bugs and generally makes the game better overallNote: In no way in this review am i hating on Fallout 3 i think Fallout 3 is a brilliant game and i recommend it to anyone but i do not think of it as a Fallout game that stays true to the originals like Fallout New Vegas did Thank you for taking the time to read this review			"

												Oh boy, where should we start? Well, at the very least, in 2016 this game still manages to make me completely forget about everything else (including other games from this series) and forces me to spend a week or so on another playthrough. This game is not perfect, but it doesn’t matter: it captivates with benefits, while allowing to ignore the disadvantages. Bugs are pesky though, as well as newer OS compability.Pros:Engulfing atmosphere. The whole world is marvelously crafted to be believable and interesting. Poor cities look like a crumbling mess, striving to survive, rich cities shine in the Wastes, contain quests connected to political issues around the post-apocalyptic California and involve a lot more features that you could imagine.Simple and effective RPG-system. Famous S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system didn’t change a lot from the previous game, but everything else did. Level cap - 99, you could say there is none, and this allows for unlimited potential for any character. Perks & Traits revamped and adjusted. Skills are now much harder to develop. As a general reminder, this game allows you to create a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ character that speaks in grunts. What’s not to love?Gruesome combat system. It is more unbalanced than Fallout 1’s combat system, but it delivers much more fun than previously. No more 8 HP human critters - people tend to live longer and hit harder. “Gore”-geous gore, get it? Death animations are extremely satisfying. The whole process of trying to squeeze multiple actions into 5 to 16 possible action points is engaging and rewarding when done properly.Possibility to become a pornstar and arm wrestle wtih supermutant (your punishment for loss is getting ♥♥♥♥♥), sell your friends, drugs, weapons or Elvis pictures for money, get involved in a shotgun wedding, talk ♥♥♥♥ to an army officer via network, etc. Lots of dark humor.Cons:Bugs on bugs. Crashes, save corruptions, graphical glitches. Get ready to google patches and fixes.Bizarre amount of pop and cultural references. Even though I listed dark humor as a good thing, sometimes this game just throws a lot of stuff at you, like quotes, characters, etc. This is not a great thing for me, surely it maybe not a good thing for others. Fallout 1 is a better choice for a more “serious” post-apocalyptic adventure.Old graphics. Aside from meaty execution animations, graphics aged poorly. Not a turn-off for old cavalry, but it is a disadvantage that’s present.In general: 11/10 game, cult status, prospering series. If you say “post-apocalypse RPG”, Fallout is the first thing that comes to mind. And this part is the pinnacle of it. Surely, Fallout 3 is better in combining old and new, but Fallout 2 is superior in everything else, and not only inside the series itself.I’ve gotten a lot farther than I should have. But then again I’ve never met any other game like this either. My ride’s over, folks. Time to play.			"

												Fallout 2 is by far the worst Fallout game I've ever played, a total abomination. Character Customisation: You actually have to put thought into your character, their special points ACTUALLY matter through the game, if that isn't enough to bore you to tears, I don't know what will. Way too much thinking and planning.Speech: How the hell do I get quests? Everyone in every town always wants to make conversation with me about pointless nonsense, like as if you were having an actual conversation with a person? Seriously? A horrendous design flaw. And don't even get me started on the options for speech, way too many. I need to take a break just reading one paragraph of text.Factions: So It turns out that there MORE THAN TWO FACTIONS in this game. And you actually have to talk to them, and worst of all, they all have their own motives and goals for you to learn about? why should I care about the history of vault city? Or why the enclave are there? Fallout 3 did it much better, good vs evil is so much simpler. A lot less character in the npcs and more killing. Like a good Fallout game.Story: If you want a snore fest of a story based around topics such as human evolution, science, vengeance, slavery and long list of boring, broad and ethical topics, this is the story for you. But for the real Fallout fans, just go to 3. The story is 1000 times better than this garbage.Boss encounters: Why would anyone want to waste time having a final conversation with the boss, learning about their motives and their goals and even potiential sparing of their lives, when I could just kill them? A waste of everyone's time.Map/Travelling: The worst map in all of Fallout's history, why would I want to travel a realistic world where people have naturally built places far away for tactical and territorial gains when in Fallout 3 Every location is close to each other? You'd think they would have thought of that earlier. If you want to play a good Fallout game, play Fallout 3 or 4. Not this garbage.			"

This will improve your accuracy. You will miss quite often in the Temple of Trials, but don't get discouraged; you've still got plenty of room to grow, and if you distribute your skill points correctly, the rest of the game should make it much easier to hit things.And that's not ever scratching the surface of what you can do. Games like this aren't for everyone, but if you don't have a problem with reading a lot (it is an RPG), then you should at least try this game. It's one of my favorite games ever, as I have owned the original disc far longer than I've had an account on Steam. I strongly recommend you try to play it, even if you don't like it in the end.

Fallout 2 is my favorite RPG. If you have played it, I hope you enjoy it too!If not, give it a chance sometime. It took me about 80 hours to complete.PROS:+ Turn-based tactical RPG action that doesn't mess around+ Almost every character skill has a very good reason to invest in, unlike Fallout 1, a major improvement from the original+ Hilariously violent, painstakingly crass world to explore and subjugate; leave your safe spaces and idealisms at the door, as you will do terrible things throughout the game (and enjoy it)+ Lots to see and do, oodles of secret content+ Many quests have multiple outcomes that persist throughout to the end, often with obscure ways to complete+ Says the ""f*ck"" and ""sh*t"" words, way before you saw it in the console world, relays tone of the world+ You can be a porn star+ Kids steal your stuff and sell back to you at a markup+ Michael Dorn (Worf from the Star Trek) is in it+ No autosave or V.A.T.S. crap; git gud baby+ Untainted by the Bethesda Fallout canonCONS:- Runs like absolute garbage on newer machines; crashes at the worst times(your milage may vary depending on how much you want to invest in playing this game)- The 'meatier' gameplay elements like Action Points and Sequence can be a little daunting for some, mostly unfamiliar players			"

												It has some of the coolest dialogue  ive ever experienced. It is really funny and gritty. In fallout 4 nothing you said changed peoples reactions. This game is totally different because sometimes it completely alters the quest if you ♥♥♥♥ someone off. It  is a true rpg because you have to have skill checks for pretty much everything. The combat is really challenging and even though the graphics arent that great all it is is numbers so it doesnt matter that the graphics arent good cuz its still fun. Its one of my favorite games of all time and i havent even beaten it yet. I just like this type of game where you have to read and it really gives you a good sense of choice and consequences for your choices. I wish they made games like this cuz they are a lot of fun. I just dont think people like to read and thats a shame.			"

 I beat this game as a kid (and the First One, and i still play it as a man.)-This game just stays classy. Post-Apocolyptic, Chaotic World. I wish the new Fallouts still resembled this fully as the original game designers intended fallout to be. Sex, Drugs, Alcohol, Guns, Mutants, Raiders.- I loved this  because you can be bad, and kill every thing in your path. There are no such things as invincible people.  *Bethesda* {cough, cough} - This killed the new fallouts for me.-Any Ways, Get past the slow game play and the graphics and you have this wonderous story line. - -You have almost everything you can imagine, hell on earth with out the demons and of course satan.

												Fallout 2 is a game that went under my games to play radar for far too long, mostly because when it came out I wasn't even   in primary school yet. I'm typically not the biggest fan of this kind of post-apocalyptic setting, in fact this is the only one I like. I owe my discovering this masterpiece entirely to the streamlined fallout experience by Bethesda and later Obsidian.I found the first dungeon to be ruthless my first playthrough, it took me a reload or two before I managed to survive the initial trial and start the main quest. When I emerged into the wasteland of Fallout 2, I was a bit intimidated, every direction on the map had opened up to me. The main quest giver did point me in the direction of a nearby town, but I wanted to see how far south I could go, maybe discover a cool town or two. Nope, I just ended up with plenty of bullets in my corpse. I decide to not go south when I reload and instead go to the town that the elder directed me to, this is where I lost interest initially. I ended up not in the mood to read any of the dialogs that would've pointed me in the right direction and instead gave up. A few months pass and on a whim I decide to reload my save and see if I can't make any headway in game. After I did a few side quests I really started to enjoy myself, the battle system I found unforgiving started to feel a little rewarding, and I kept going.I am a little sad however, I'm nearing the final content of the game and I'm trying my darndest to make my remaining hours on my character, the powerfist wielding warrior Gertrude, last as long as possible.PROS:-The game has aged well in my opinion, the graphics may not look as sharp as some people may desire, but the game is  still entirely playable.-The combat is very fun after the initial slow burn, I'd say about level 5 is where it took off for me.-The characters have been very fun, I can recall most of the characters I've run into in Fallout 2, the same can't be said of Fallout 3 or New Vegas (granted they each had a few good characters).-Tons of content, I've spent a good 30-40 hours on my current character and still find new quests.CONS:-The game is from the late 90's and has technical limitations because of this (Combat can be very slow when a large number of characters are engaged in battle)-You cannot reload in combat when it is not your turn to move, this doesn't sound too bad but in large battles where you try to keep your companions alive it can be a little bothersome.-There is a time limit in game for how long you can play, it's an unfortunate technical issue, however you have about 13 in game years until you are forced to play a new character (my current character is on year 3 near the end of the game)Final thoughts on the game:This is honestly the best game I've played in past years, it makes me yearn for games that don't constantly hold my hand. Every mistake I make is punished, every good decision I make is rewarded. The myriad of companions in game really made my experience that much better (barring when Sulik would sit in doorways, blocking my only exit). If I had to give this game a number score it'd probably be an 8 or 9 out of 10. There is no perfect game, and this game certainly has quite  a large number of faults, but this is the most fun I've had with a game since my initial Dark Souls playthrough.			"

												I met a girl in a small village. I flirted with her for a little, then she ripped my clothes off and made love to me. Her dad walked in on us after the deed was done, and demanded to know what was going on. I then proceeded to tell him that I was a doctor, and I was giving her a full body physical. He then asked me why I had to be naked as well for the physical. Like any good doctor, I told him we needed to make sure no germs could be spread. He then asked me to give him a physical.............. 10/10 would give her a physical again.			"

												Warning: Disliking this game is punishable by death.Methods of execution include being whacked by one of the crime families of New Reno, melted into a pile of goo by Enclave plasma rifles, and getting talked to death by one of the people who run Vault City.*strolls around post-apocalyptic Oregon, Northern California, and Nevada while running into endless pop culture references and idiots who need to be ended.*(Gameplay is highly similar to Fallout 1, but there is vastly more to do here. This game also takes a more light-hearted tone, being filled with a horde of pop culture references from everything from Star Wars to Monty Python to The Godfather. Some might get turned off by this, but it adds funny moments to an otherwise dark and brutal world. Have fun with this... or else!)			"

""War, war never changes!""War remained the same when Fallout 2 was released a year after its predecessor. It was back in 1998 and it was a jolly good time to be a gamer. This game was the perfect example of ""not fixing what isn't broken"". So, game mechanics were pretty much the same while the game world became much, much larger.Storywise we control a Vault Dweller once more - in fact, our protagonist is the descendant of the hero of the first game - who's tasked to save his establishment by acquiring the so-called G.E.C.K., a device with such a power that it can restore completely damaged environments to their default state.Naturally, the ""bigger the better"" concept was followed by introducing a wider range of weapons and enemies and, of course, new environments. We also have more skills, perks and beside Karma we also have a Reputation. Something that is constantly changing along the way as we make progress by completing subquests. You can be attacked in a new town if you have a bad reputation -  settlements are not independent of one another; if you complete a deed somewhere it may very well be heard of elsewhere.Finally, recruitable characters seem to be much, much better. We have total control over them by being able to issue orders, help them level up and provide equipment. Just make sure you have the necessary Karma to be able to recruit them - not that you don't have enough to get to know. With all the new stuff introduced Fallout 2 requires much more time to complete - if you're a completionist you can expect to spend 50-60 hours with the sequel. And, of course, like in case of all such RPGs you can start a new game, pick a different level-up method, solve quests in a different way and hire different people to be at your service.I spent dozens of hours with this game when it came out. I remember being happy of having our own car (called Highwayman) which then could easily disappear (in fact, the game had a related bug which needed to be patched at the time). If you did not pay attention you could lost it forever. It was a shame as it made travelling between towns fast and easy.Fallout 2 is a classic. And it comes patched on Steam which allows us to pick a higher resolution. If you have invested hundreds of hours into Fallout 3 et al you might as well check where it all started back in the '90s.

												      Fallout 3 was one of my favorite all-time games. Naturally, I thought at one point, ""I've played Fallout 3 and New Vegas, but I've never even heard of Fallout 1 or 2. I wonder what they are like?""      Well my question has since been answered. And my god, Fallout 2 is one of the greatest games made. As most people do, let's go through pros and cons. I'd also like to say that I haven't played this game in a long time, so I'm going off memory.PROS:~Story elements. You are The Chosen One, or if you are me, Penguin Johnson. You are the descendant of the Vault Dweller, a member of Vault HMHMHM (woops I can't remember) who saved his/her vault from certain doom by dehydration, when he went out into the wastes to get a Water Purification Chip. Your tribe is dying, brahmin and crops are dying as well. And only one thing can save it. I bet you guessed, ""Me!"" HAH! DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH! No, a G.E.C.K. In fact, if you were the saviour of the tribe, then they would be doomed because of this games...~Difficulty. Fallout 3, while I died a few times, wasn't that difficult. However, when you ask this game for help, it flips you off, and says how about you deal with that guy with a machine gun yourself? It then proceeds to laugh as the machine gun guy burst fires and kills you instantly with a critical hit that does 78 damage, and you only had 5 health. You WILL see the death screen a lot if you are new to this game, but that's an element that makes it good.~So much to explore. This game, has you traversing THE ENTIRETY OF THE UNITED STATES! From San Fransisco, to Klamath. What's that? Never heard of Klamath? Where have you been living, anywhere but in Fallout 2?~So many weapons! You got your pistols, sub machine guns, assault rifles, snipers, shotguns, knives, blunt weapons, fists, fist weapons, light machine guns, miniguns, plasma weapons, laser weapons, and probably even more. And there are a lot of weapons in each of those categories.~Characters. Characters are so unique. You have the ghoul from... the ghoul place who makes a joke about what assuming does. (It makes an ♥♥♥ out of you and me). Then you got the leader of Vault City, who I shot many times out of pure  annoyance.NEGATIVES:-This game, is so broken. I'm not kidding. You know how people say Fallout New Vegas is glitchy? NV is the tip of the iceburg of glitches, and this is the entire thing. Luckily, people have made a total conversion mod which fixes most of the game. It's called Project Purification or something like that. I can't remember.-SPOILER ALERT! When you get the G.E.C.K. Why? Because SPOILER ALERT AGAIN the Enclave just kills your entire tribe anyway. What was the point? At least I can get revenge on them. Seriously. You have to. It's a main quest to wipe the Enclave out.So what do I give this game? 7/10. If you didn't have to download a mod this would have been a 9/10 easily, but unfortunately, that's just such a big problem that I can't. But, get that mod, and you will be embarking on a journey, through war. And as they say, war. War never changes. THAT WAS A REFERENCE THANKS FOR COMING!			"

												(In addition, I have hundreds of hours on the original retail version)Where to begin?  This is one of my all-time favorite games, and I grew up with it along with the first game. It was part of my childhood and continues to be a part of my life all these years later, and it will always have a place in my heart.  Fallout 2 is excellent and anyone who likes RPGs who aren't afraid to play a game that isn't entirely welcoming should give it a shot; I admit I am somewhat biased because of my nostalgia but that doesn't explain the entirety of why I think this is an excellent game.  There is *much* more to this game than the references, humor and fourth wall breaking; that being said, the humor is a nice touch depending on your tastes.  This game deserves as much attention and recognition as the first in the series and I consider both games to be one in the same and part of the same collective experience.This is game is punishing in certain ways, and is not that casual of an experience; and in some ways I would admit that this game isn't the most welcoming, but once you figure things out and start to progress there are numerous different possibilities and choices laid out before you, and you can play any type of character you choose and have any type of temperament you choose in this game world, which is rich and unique.Fallout 1 and 2 haven't aged very well, although personally I can transcend that completely due to my nostalgia and attachment to the series; the game looks better now since we can change the screen resolution, and the game is even better with the Restoration Project mod.You are the grandchild of the Vault Dweller from Fallout 1, the game takes place 80 years after the first game, and you are part of a primitive tribe which your ancestor founded.  You must save your tribe by finding the holy GECK.  Along the way in your quest, you can do many interesting things and talk to many interesting characters.The gameplay is the same as in Fallout 1, aside from a few things like starting skills being calculated differently and starting at different levels. Fallout 2 is much longer and there is much more to do and see in Fallout 2 than the first (especially with the Restoration Project mod), although the first game is excellent for many of the same reasons this game is excellent.  Most people who enjoyed Fallout 1 (or similar titles) will probably enjoy this immensely also.  I would even recommend this game to people who don't normally play games like it, but are merely very interested in the Fallout lore.There is an issue I have with the game but only due to playing it on newer, larger displays and playing it on a higher resolution than the game was initially intended for; certain scenes will look wrong if the resolution is set high.In conclusion, this isn't for everyone and not everyone will be able to enjoy it in the same capacity as others might, for whatever reasons, whether it has to do with the age of the game or not.  But this is classic Fallout and deserves as much love as the first in the series.  This game is highly recommended for any fan of oldschool turn-based RPGs, this and its predecessor helped to redefine the genre. This game is old, but it's excellent and one of the best RPGs I've played, and is very well written.I'd also highly recommend the Restoration Project mod, which includes the Unofficial Patch.  It restores new content into the game that the developers intended to have in the first place but weren't able to, and  you can choose which options you would like to install easily. killap.net "

												Nearly twenty years after the fact, this is still my favorite RPG. With the exception of New Vegas, this was the last official Fallout game in which the skill system was, in fact, meaningful and had a significant effect on gameplay.Do you want to be something of a pacifist, with high speech, intelligence, and survivalist skills who runs for cover at the first sign of a fight and has his companions do all the heavy lifting for him? Go for it, Skeeter.How about a post-apocalyptic hard-♥♥♥ who just wants to make a living skinning giant geckos and selling off discarded raider gear? You can do that too. The game does have a story and it is actually pretty good, but you're likely going to spend more time doing just about everything else than you are folliwng the main plot, and that is a very good thing.The graphics have not aged particularly well, and the game takes some minor adjusting on a modern rig in order to make it work and look properly, but seriously, don't let that stop you. Once you get used to the visual style, the pixel hunt-like searches for items dropped on the floor becomes the least of your concerrns.You will be far more interested in the cavalcade of goodies that's just fallen to the ground alongside the raider whose chest you've blasted a whole clear through.Also you can murder children, and acquire a perk which reflects said habit of killing children. Game of the year, all years.			"

												It's hard not to recommend a game like this.  Being the sequel to one of the best computer RPGs ever created, it had very big shoes to fill, yet it managed to fill them.  It's a big adventure, with plenty of places to see and quests to complete.  And best of all, you can go about it pretty much any way you want.  Be it by trickery, stealth, or just plain violence, there are usually multiple solutions to any problem in the game.  Indeed, if you feel like it, you can kill  anyone (yes, even the children) who literally or figuratively stands in your way.  It won't be easy, and there will usually be consequences, but it can be done. However, the game is not very beginner friendly.  Those coming from Fallaout 3, New Vegas, and 4 will likely be frustrated to find themselves missing half or more of their attacks at early levels.  Not to mention the frequent encounters of 5+ enemies at a time while you're travelling, each of which takes a turn each round.  This can result in lengthy encounters which end badly for you.  If you stick with it, however, and pace yourself while also building your character to survive, these encounters will soon become a piece of cake, or a thing of the past altogether.  In all, a fantastic experience awaits you with Fallout 2, and if you have the time and patience for it, you'll in for a hell of a ride.  One final note: if you played New Vegas and found the ""Wild Wasteland"" jokes to be more annoying than funny, then take heed: this game's humor is like Wild Wasteland on jet.  Seriously.  You can't go ten minutes in this game without some character breaking the fourth wall, or making some pop-culture reference or other.  Some of them are really good, but if you're like me, you'll find yourself tired of them quickly			"

												22 of my 50 hours of gameplay are of the actual Fallout 2 - I have that one memorized backwards since I was ~14, the rest I spent on the superb fanmade seq/prequel, Fallout 1.5: Resurrection. This is going to be 2 reviews in one and I can't say that I care if that's okay or not.Fallout 1.5: Resurrectionstays true to the old school Fallout vibe and is aptly named with the mod being very much in-between Fallout 1 and 2. Resurrection starts in 2170, 8-9 years after Fallout 1 and well before 2241, the starting year of Fallout 2. You'll have to deal with the aftermath of the dispersion of the Master's super mutant army. Story wise Resurrection is closer to Fallout 1, being a lot more serious, mature and scientifically plausible than Fallout 2. In comparison, it seems Creative had their drawers stacked to the brim with jokes and pop culture references that then required a game to be built around them with Fallout 2.I did figure out the main plot at about the 10 minute point, but generally I very much enjoyed discovering another piece of the Fallout universe.I've even made a modest walkthrough in case you're a perfectionist and want to get it 'right' the first time around:


Fallout 1.5: Resurrection To Do List 
A Guide for Fallout 2
By: Lauri

			During my first play-through I found myself missing at least some general outline of what can be done in each city. Maybe you're like me.		


Fallout 2The overwhelmingly positive reviews others have left should convince anyone who hasn't played classic Fallout yet to change their ways, so I'm not even going to go into every aspect of the game.As I've already mentioned, Fallout 2 is a lot more jokey than its predecessor, featuring a ghost, aliens, a super mutant magician, talking mole rats, Skynet, Mike Tyson, civil deathclaws, Tragic: The Garnering, scientologists named Juan Cruz and Vicki Goldman and the POTUS to name a few. If it's hard to imagine a story arc that incorporates all of these seamlessly then you're probably on to something. I can't say that all this humor is somehow bad though, just know that Fallout 1 and 2 are different and you may find the latter not quite what you would've expected.I've read a few reviews that call Fallout 2 'slow' and being a total fanboy had to stop and think for a second to digest this criticism, but it's true. 2's story starts off really boring and I applaud any millennial that can sit through Arroyo and Klamath without deleting the game. Without using Cheat Engine or somesuch, shooting and missing a rat or gecko for the 23rd time really is for the dead-of-brain. But I swear from The Den and on the game improves by an order of magnitude with the high points coming in New Reno, which provides much to do in itself (like boxing and starring in porn) beside being a nexus for many quests from other towns.A small annoyance I noticed during my female playthrough was that Fallout 2 is very obviously a game by guys, for guys. Male PCs get a whole extra ending for New Reno, can donate sperm to alleviate the inbreeding situation in Vault City and have dozens of extra pervy dialogue options to use compared to females who can at most suck D to save a few hundred caps here and there. Caps, by the way, which are infinite after you get to ~120% in gambling. Can't say I blame Black Isle too much though because if you think of how many people owned a computer in 1998, played games on it, had the intellectual capacity to grok RPGs and out of that tiny sliver of the population, how many were women, well... peddling encyclopedias at Bible study might have been a better business model than catering to girls with Fallout 2.As customary with RPGs, save often and into different slots. I recommend always keeping around a save from the first second you arrive in a new marked location so you could replay it if need be.			"

												My friend got me this game for my birthday... It was a really old game so I wasn't entirely psyched about him getting me this over say another 10 dollar game like garry's mod... but I didn't complain and I started playing it and I must say...AMAZING game, havn't had this much fun with a classic game since the legend of zelda series :P. The one thing that I found a bit buggy or kind of awkward was the sierra army base, which was unlocked after doing quests for the wrights in New Reno. It was hard as nails to get through, didnt seem to be a way to completely disable the forcefields so they wouldnt kill you--I ended up using about 20 stimpacks simply passing through forcefields in that area alone, and one of the quests in there to unlock one of the companions requires you to kill one of the robots which causes the entire army base to aggro on you the entire game and if you unlock the companion they will always be hostile if he isnt with you. At the enclave oil rig there are some of the same robots there as in the sierra army base so they attack you if your not careful; So if you walk by them you agro the entire base full of end-game mobs...Moral of the story-don't do quests for the wright family in New RenoOther than this, i'd give this game a 10/10, its a must buy :P "

												Originally released by in 1998, I never really had the chance to play Fallout 2, mostly due to the fact I was too busy being born. Having got wrapped up into the Fallout 3 hype train, I became rather enthralled in the franchise itself. So, several years later, I picked it up and…...in an attempt to not color my already vibrant opinion of the nearly twenty year old title to nothing but what can be considered felatio, let me just be a bit hypercritical about the game. The most glaring “problem” is what Fallout: New Vegas suffers from, by basically being the same game twice, effectively Fallout 2.0. While it didn’t work to the determent of the more modern entries, it hurts the overall visual experience with the sprites being rather noticeably polarized. Most are ripped straight from the original, built by pixels and with limited frame to frame animation. Then you have the newer 3D rendered sprites with smoother animation, creating an immersion breaking experience. Thankfully, these sprites don’t really appear in the same cell often, but when they do it is noticeably. Another problem they never fixed was the ♥♥♥♥ING INVENTORY UI! Its clumsy and finicky at best, with the mouse cursor deciding the change sensitivity like a pregnant women. You will work around it eventually, but it just infuriates me how this aspect was never fixed. Its horrid but manages to get the job done.Getting down on my knees, everything else is, the world, leveling system, character's, weapon variety and quest are, to put it broadly, ♥♥♥♥ING FANTASTIC. While the characters are a tad uninspired and two dimensional, and the story banal, Fallout 2 is possibly one of the best Western RPGs ever made. The leveling system grants satisfaction, managing to maintain this by having “Perks”(effectively permanent stat or combat boosts) that you receive every other level. You can’t help but wanting to progress with the prospect of nearly sawing men in half with not much but as dainty slap.The world can be summarized as a sour salted candy advertised as extremely so, its daunting at first and WILL kick you ♥♥♥ once you pop it in you gob, but will eventually become remarkable sweet. Southern California is huge, being exceptionally difficult during the early game but incredibly rewarding later down the line. The only problem I have with the world is the lack of variety, but I feel the questing can make up for this. I feel developers can live or die by the hand holding die. Choosing to do so makes the game a breeze, and choosing not to has the potential to make progress come to a screeching halt. Fallout 2 gives you just enough information to get on with the question without some patronizing arrow pointing out where to go. And can even have you thinking about solutions for the rare puzzle here and there. Quest are satisfying and varied to an insane degree.Fallout 2 might possibly be one of the few games in which you likely won’t see every weapon or outcome. If you ♥♥♥♥ up, you ♥♥♥♥ed up and there is no turning back, with some things being consequently cut off. Prompting actual thought and replay-ability, I love this idea. The weapons on the other hand, are insanely variant. Its not the fact that a quest outcome closes them off from you, it's the fact there are so ♥♥♥♥ing many that you're unlikely to even find them all. Whether this works for the games prosperity or detriment.Regardless, with its negatives and positives in check, Fallout 2 is one of the greatest title I have ever played. Even with its missteps, no matter how small, they pale to what the game does right. Of fantastic value, Fallout 2 is a must buy title, no matter its age.Verdict: 9.5 - Fantastic "

												Oh Fallout 2, where to begin? So first off I recommend this game to anyone who loves a good story, It is actually by far one of the best stories I know (Fallout 4's story is crap in my opinion so get over it) I've played all the Fallout games and currently own all but one. Fallout 2 is a game I enjoy playing( though I don't play very often and don't have many hours on my account) It's very enjoyable and for it's time was a very advanced game. My one wish right now is to see this game and the first one remade into first and third person games...while leaving the story totally untouched, Hopefully Bethesda (and maybe Obsidian) do remake this game (And yes I know that they likely have to get permission from interplay given the games were made by them) Even if that doesn't happen I want bethesda to take a big slab of pages for the next game they make...Fallout 4 needs work bad...I don't want the same mistake made on their next game			"

												I would like to begin my review by saying I started the Fallout series with 3 (I know shameful right?) But soon learned about the first two games and how different they were from Bethesda's Fallout 3. At first, I thought they looked horrible with their dated graphics and gameplay. But after reading hours upon hours of lore and story tidbits on the Fallout Gamepedia, I just knew I had to play them. I was on Xbox 360 at the time so I couldn't play them yet, so I figured I would play New Vegas in the meantime.Anyways, eventually I got my PC, and one of the first games I got on their was the entire Classic Fallout Collection. I played through 1 first, I loved it. Then, after a long break, I started Fallout 2. I was blown away by it's atmosphere and compelling story. Even though I am not used to turn-based gameplay, I have come to enjoy it because of Fallout and Fallout 2. The game makes you think about your moral desicions and the consequences they bring, something Bethesda games could never really do. For example, if you kill a child bounty hunters will chase you down and everybody will hate you, discouraging you from doing such evil things. I highly recommend this game to any Fallout fan, even the new ones like me. This is definitely my favorite RPG game, and maybe even my favorite game. 10/10			"

												I have to admit, at first, I had difficulty adapting to the isometric style of this game, my first fallout being new Vegas after all, but after playing for a few hours, I was hooked. This game is possibly my 2nd favourite in the entire franchise (the first being New Vegas). The game has content for hours, 200+ hours into the game and I'm still finding new things as I go along. The combat is easy to learn, but can be punishing if you don't adapt to the isometric style quickly. There is a large variation of weapons and armour for your character to use. There are also companions (with varying levels of usefulness) who can back you up in combat or help you with various tasks you may come across in the wasteland. There are a wide variety of interesting and vibrant characters to meet, from gangsters to ghouls, Soldiers to slavers. There are plenty of quests and locations to complete and explore. I cannot stress enough how good this game is, it has more content that fallout 4 and it has all the charm of New Vegas. I would give it an 9/10. it's a masterpiece that has more content than most modern games have.			"

												One of the best role-playing games I have ever played.  A great sequel to the original Fallout and probably one of the last great Fallout games (except Fallout: New Vegas, sure).   It has a huge map to explore, lots of weird characters, an amazing storyline, and lots of memorable NPC's.  Plus stealing that Enclave armor.  See all the stuff Bethesda basically ruined in their Fallout games when it was still proper canon!The only downside, and this is very minor, is that the controls seem a little clunky by today's standards.  However, that shouldn't deter anyone from trying this classic cRPG!			"

												A great classic RPG with plenty of charm.I experienced Fallout 2 for the first time after playing the newer installments, and I found this title to be just as impressive in most ways. Fallout 2 tells an interesting story, is housed with a unique environment and compelling characters, and rewards exploration very well. Basically, Fallout 2 excells in the fundamental mechanics of an RPG. It builds on the first game in scope and experience in ways that enhance gameplay while retaining the core characteristics that make the first great.If you haven't played through this game or the original Fallout from start to finish, you're missing out.

												If you have been playing any of the recent fallout games like Fallout 4 for example, you should try out this game. Sure it looks different from the other games but this is consider one of the classic RPGs thats worth your time playing this game. Before the new Fallout games were real time combat, this is turn based combat whenever you take the first shot or the NPC does, depending how many action points they have. Theres a lot of interesting stuff such as traveling from one place to another with the world map. I recommend you buy this game thats worth 10 dollars with good story, interesting characters, great dialog and other sorts you would find interesting. Take your chances and time with this game, see what you'll think about this game.			"

												I was afraid that Fallout 2 might've been too outdated for me at first, that it wouldn't be entertaining or worth the time.Oh boy I was wrong. I'd say it's the best Fallout game I've played so far (haven't played the first one yet but I'll get to that someday).The combat feels satisfying and its turn-based gameplay seems to have aged well, though, it might be a bit slow at times and can be very punishing because of them lethal critical hits. But there's a lot of options to fiddle around with to personalize the type of experience you want, same goes with the game's great characterization system where you can create a lot of different builds.Game's tough at the start but if you give it time and try to make some progress you'll surely get well rewarded, because of the loot you get after hard-fought battles feels worthy enough for you to want progress even further. The dialogues are really well written too, there are a lot of different options you can choose from depending on what stats you invested in, which can lead to some really amusing conversations. For instance, high intelligence with the speech skill mostly provides with the most available options, but even low intelligence comes with unique dialogue or reactions from NPCs throughout the world.Choices you make does actually feel like it has consequences, it also affect the game's ending to a large scale. So the replayability is there if you want to tackle the game with an entirely different approach.The whole plot in this game is also a pretty thrilling experience the more progress you make, it's very gritty and has this dark atmosphere to it which I love. I also do think the game's soundtrack and visuals have a big impact on the game's atmosphere and that it's really well done. I'm happy I decided to pick this game up, even bought it during a sale for a few dollars.So money well spent I'd say.

												The hype is spot on for this classic, it actually is not blind nostalgia when it is said that this game allows for far more role-playing than every other video game in existence.Fallout 2 is not bound by modern day game design limitations and rules, it does things modern games are afraid to do.  It was designed by the most talented game studio of all time, Black Isle Studios, with much of the excellence being on showcase in Planescape: Torment which was released the following year.  Largely a different kind of excellence, but both games are so much more original and limitless than anything today.  Everything you do in Fallout 2 leads to some reaction, big or small, but usually somewhat realistic.  When playing the game you have to think twice about what you say and how you act.  Keep talking to someone who doesn't want to be bothered, and there may actually be consequences.  Sneak around in the open and people will question you.  Walk around with a weapon equipped in certain places and you may find yourself being fired upon.  Throw away First Citizen Lynette's trust and say goodbye to Vault City forever.  Become a boxing champion in New Reno and you will be famous and respected in that area, with the townsfolk calling you ""Champ"" most of the time.  Play as a cold blooded, ruthless killer and you will be feared and certain quests will open up to you while others will become unavailable.  Finish the main quest in a positive way and you will be hailed a hero in most places.  Play as a low intelligence character and watch the whole game transform appropriately (look it up on YouTube if you must).  The list goes on, these are just some examples of the attention to detail in Fallout 2 that no other game exhibits.Fallout 2 is also a very good satire, less serious than its modern counterparts.  If you've only played Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 then you've barely experienced Fallout.  New Vegas is an impressive sequel however, but still more ""gamey"" and with less role-playing.			"

												One of the best RPGs ever created. Period. And probably best of post-apocalyptic games of all time.Pros.- Absolute freedom within a strictly linear plot (paradox?): you can finish your mission.. if you want. Or go somewhere to find something. Or kill anyone in sight. It's up to you. Playing this game is so much more fun than finishing it..- Totally unpredictable random encounters (on first playthrough, but anyway): getting in the midlle of gangfight? check. saving innocent farmers from wildlife? check. saving innocent wildlife from some bad trappers? check, and don't mind if wildlife would try to eat you, it's just their way to say ""thanks"". getting one-hitted by gigant predatory lizard? check. finding an extremely OP weapon being level 2-3 right after you leave starting location? check, if you'll find a way to actually get your hands on that weapon without dying.- Special encounters: no spoilers, you must find them all by yourself.- You and only you choose how you would play: kill bad people and get praised by others (actually not), kill good people (and get your butt hunted for that), don't kill anyone ever (it's even possible to win the game that way, with only one exception), aimlessly wander around exploring, become a gangster (almost), help some people with their problems (or help other people with those problematic jerks). Your choice is only thing that matters.- Side quests: they make up about 95% of all quests you'll get. Yes, you could finish the game and see about 5% of content only. But take one step aside from main quest - and a brave new world will open before you.- Easter eggs: there are plenty. Nuff said. Go find them.- Combat: totally unpredictable even on your 144 playthrough. Critical oneshot with a 7% chance to hit? Easy. Missing target with 95% hit chance while it's staying in front of you? Easy. Killing three random targets with minigun - out of five standing before you EXCEPT YOUR ACTUAL TARGET? Very easy. Killing yourself with a critical miss? Not that easy, but possible.- You can actually kill these annoying little critters: yes, it's about kids. Name another game where you are allowed to do such horrible thing at last? No more immortal godly beings that wander around, annoy you and steal from your pockets. Be warned: people of wasteland won't like you for that (and your ♥♥♥ would be hunted).Cons.- Too much myths about cut content: there are some really beatifull things that didn't get to the final version. Maybe they  existed, maybe not.- Map: after 4-5 playthroughs you will get everywhere and find everything. Maybe sooner, maybe later, but that will happen. There are so much empty space on the map, so many lost opportunities to place something exciting.. not to mention that map from first game could've been added to second.- Replayability dissapears after 50-60 times. Seriously, what else could you do when you've done everything possible?Total score: 9.7/10. Almost perfect.			"

												The best one.-Extremely interesting characters and innovative locations. The art and animation is very detailed for the time, and sometimes quite stunning.-Engaging and lengthy quests and character arcs, and actually has a main villain that you don't just encounter for the first time at the end of the game.-Wide variety of enemies with a vast multitude of attacks, and the combat system is different but entertaining.-Not afraid to touch on wacky elements and pop culture, and pulls it off in a superb manner.-Basically refines and tightens the mechanics of Fallout 1, resulting in an even smoother experience than the first game which is also very much worth playing.-Talking deathclaws.

												Fallout 2 is the sequel to one of my favorite RPG's of all time and it does a superb job of the lifting the mantle of the original Fallout even if it does have it's flaws.Fallout 2 sets you as the descendant of the original Vault Dweller who we now learned founded a small tribe near the Californian coast following the events of the original. This tribe has now fallen on hard times and as the direct descendant of the Vault Dweller you are charged with going out into the world and finding a mythical Vault device known as the G.E.C.K. This device, the elder of your village believe, have the power to turn the part of the wasteland into an utopia and ensure the tribe's future.You start off the game with a somewhat lackluster tutorial that introduces you to the basic elements of the game however it is only once you leave this initial area and are ready to depart your childhood village for the first time that the game truly comes into it's own. The massive world map at your feet with no restrictions on where to go and who to see.The mechanics are much the same as the original. Isometric turn-based role playing game using the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system for character development. It is however in the open nature of the game that you find it's soul. Made a female character with high charisma? You might be able to charm, or sleep, your way past several encounters. Made a character with incredibly low intelligence? All of the sudden your dialog responses are just various grunts and the people you encounter will treat you as a freak of nature.Even most of the storyline can be skipped if you know where to go and almost every task you are given in the game can be solved in a myriad of ways, many options not even becoming apparent to you unless you have the needed skills or made some particular choices beforehand.The game does have some shortcomings. The 4th wall breaking that was rare in the original are much more commonplace and several characters and areas just feel out of place with the rest of the game.New Reno in particular, a gambling town complete with mafia families fighting for control and a working porn studio takes you completely out of the game and makes for a rather disappointing experience.Fallout 2 has all the qualities that made the original one of the greatest RPG's ever and it improves on many aspects of it with better companion AI and a much larger map. It's faults however do weight heavily and keep it from surpassing it's predecessor. It is still one of the greatest RPG's ever to be made and if you are a fan of open ended RPG games and intelligent story and dialog then it should be a definite purchase.			"

												“The struggle for survival is a war without end. And war… war never changes.”This sequel succeeds in expanding the post-nuclear universe of Fallout.

												When I finish playing the first fallout game I love it and I said to myself that this sequel cannot surpass the first one. I was wrong in so many levels. STORYIt picks up right after Fallout 1 and there are many reference to fallout 1 so I recommend playing the first before heading to the second.Fantastic the plot, should I say is better than the first...well is really hard to say because they're both great! In my opinion I slightly sided with the first game plot because of sentimental value moments but the second just nail right in the park with interesting characters, settings, the jokes oh my god the jokes are better than ever because there are some moments that I smile for those humorous wacky moments. The new enemies are interesting like the enclave (I havn't played fallout 3 before this review) sadly I was a slight dissapointment of not much shown on the brotherhood of steel just only a mention on their OPs and I like them in the first game but I understand they want the most focus on the enclaves. Your partners have a combat control which is awesome that you can put some orders into your team and they do better in combat but it does not mean their AI is better oh no just slightly, the rest the AI of your team can be walking targets at times. Side missions are better than ever especially the many new added towns they put that you can do a lot in their for many hours. I spend countless of hours just to complete the side-missions which are just awesome to complete because each important side missions adds personality of the towns and it will eventually effect the ending depends of actions you take.EVERY ACTION COUNTSI really starting to love the fallout franchise just because of the towns I visit and the different atmosphere the citizens treated you or to others and it adds different layers of problems and situations that can effect other towns as well if you don't take care of the problem. You can be the savior of many towns saying your name like a hero or you can be a complete bully to everyone and doesn't give a dang about anyone and just want money, booze and sex. Each reputation to each of the town you did effects the endings and there are multiple once and even some funny shock once that you can actual impregnate someone and that child will be ""this character."" Depends on whom you impregnate though is very limit and I wish they put more on that including when choosing a female. I was playing a female and a slave trader wants me to be in bed if I did and got the ending that I have a child and that child will do this I would laugh but instead I didn't and just pop his head by the end of my barrel. Now there are some minor annoyance when doing specific actions and that is when following some direction to someone only that you the player playing the game for the first time just follows direction. When doing that task you actually miss one conversation to this specific NPC or doing this specific task and thus either lose that oppurtunity to get it back (unless reset a point of the game) and have to either do it the hard way or just lose an event that you wish to explore. I know the game can be specific on their actions toward some events but man can it backfire sometimes to very important events that you either wish you don't miss or don't want to tackle. Like extra experience or easier access to a certain level with ease.Diversity and RealityI'm really surprise Interplay is really open and creative with this game back in the late 90s! I will say atleast when playing a female there are hinted of homosexuality which you can actually sleep with other females (don't know males but I'm betting yes). The jokes as I mention again is up high because it tackles some interesting topics that back then videogames had to censor it but this one is like an infant state of Southpark, poking fun of many topics in real life we tackle such as; scientology, American politics, race dispute and drug war. I am so happy they made it so professional about their jokes and not over the top in your face though some you might catch up where are they putting but it isn't enough to make it ""controversy"" to start yet another arguement. There just many easter eggs, references on different levels of media that I tried google up where are all these little sweet bits come from.Bugs and ImprovmentsThere are many improvements within the game but how about the combat and trading system? Well the combat feels the same as before though I still which I get an extra AP two get two shots instead of only one and not have to wait for a perk but other than that they added some new perks along the way. The trading system they finally fix that issue I had with the cap collecting where you have to press one by one, now you have to hold it and it will raise the caps level faster the longer you hold though to be honest is not exactly what I want I still prefer that wishful thinking where you can change the digit of the number of caps to save even more time but eh is atleast a slightly better. The bugs I notice they have a bit more than fallout 1 if I'm right? Like some scenarios it won't activated, sometimes my partners even walk through walls or out of the border which I laugh a couple times when Vic just casually walking through an impenetrable base and he walk in the fence and building with no problem. The biggest complaint I should add of the bugs is script errors and even scenes missing! Like don't worry if at some parts you say to yourself ""shouldn't it be here or shouldn't the person say something else?"" Well that's script error and some scenes missing some bug reasons some developer time constraint and that's kind a sad. Because there are some interesting areas I really want to explore or complete like finding sulik's sister or going in the chinese's sub or even saving the deathclaws from extinction!Thankfully I heard there are some patches that fix some problems and even improve a better experience to the player even more. The only personal issue I will warn you is once again be careful on running this game on win 10 (and Idk win 7) because it does work and I finish the game but in some areas my fps runs slow like walking in mollasses. I don't know if there is a fix on it or not so please be warn not to break your keyboard if it slows down, just make multiple saves, reset on one point and it will go away for now is not a constant nuisance since is only on some section of a town but it gets frustrating later on if it keeps doing that.In conclussion I'll give a 9/10 the best sequel of its time and even still to this day, it really does age well to look back and enjoy this masterpiece collection to play again or start a new.

												It's the definitive Fallout game, plain and simple. I prefer 1 for the story and for the simple fact I love timed games, but this is an improvement in every other way. The best quests, characters, and atmosphere in the entire series to date. I personally believe it has held up beautifully over the years, and no future game in the series (especially ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bethesda Fallout) will even come close to topping it. Really, the only cons in my opinion are bugs, but you can download some patches to take care of those.			"

												I got my first taste of Fallout with Fallout 3, and I immediately fell in love. I couldn't think of a better game out there. And then Fallout New Vegas came along. And I'll be honest, I was not a fan. Not in the least. First glance was a desolate land that had more punishing combat and a bizarre ammo system. Fast forward a couple months and I decide to give it another go. For some reason this second foray really opened my eyes and I had a blast with the changed up combat that made you think, and the ammo system that gave you more flexability. And once I started playing I discovered something even more miraculous: the writing. Fallout New Vegas had a more believable environment, better characters, better writing. It simply felt more thought out. And looking into its development I discovered that it had some of the creators of the original Fallouts working on it. So I had to give the originals a try.So I started with Fallout 1, of course. I bought the pack off of steam and installed it with a gusto. Finally the 5 minute process ended and I delightfully booted up the game, only to have a brilliant rainbow engulf the screen. Great. So I do some quick interneting and download the hi-res pack for Fallout 1 and Killap's Restoration Pack for Fallout 2 in order to plan ahead. Fallout 1 started, and I hit the ground running. My first isometric RPG! Woo-hoo! I immediately fell flat on my face, being killed by rats. I learned my first Fallout lesson: It's okay to run. So after hours of such trial and error I finally completed my game of Fallout 1, and was eager to continue the adventure in Fallout 2.If you have made it this far, good lord. On to Fallout 2.Fallout 2, to put it mildly, blew me away. Though the first level was obnoxious as hell. That Temple deserves to burn. Regardless, I pushed forward and entered the world proper. And it was glorious. Everything good from Fallout 1, Fallout 2 has. And then it expands on those. And THEN adds even more. I could do anything here. The world was truely my playground. I could, and did, do anything I wanted. The combat is incredibly punishing, forcing you to make some truely tactical decisions, however it just makes every win that much more satisfying. The dialogue is witty, dark, a tad campy at times, and heartbreaking. The depths of depravity that is portrayed is mindboggling in the modern game sphere. GTA has nothing on this. Additionally I simply love the Enclave. Probably shouldn't, but I do. I really didn't do this game justice at all, did I? When it came down to it I didn't know what to say.Buy this, install it, download the Restoration Pack, install that, play the game, never stop.			"

												This is it.  This is the game the cemented the Fallout universe and is considered by many the pinnacle of the series until New Vegas.  This is the game the truly cements the core story of the franchise and takes the seeds planted in FO1 and grows them to fruitiion.  In that process, they helped open up countless routes for storylines for the rest of the series.Some folks complain that now a game like this feels dated.  I would do my best to compel to you put aside that sort of metric when it comes to assessing the greatness of a game.  With some patience and thought ,which is so often taken out of today popular games, you can grasp hold of what seems at first glance, a copmlicated system for conveying your player character through the in-game universe.The routes you take, many encounters, and many other aspects of the game are so open, so huge, that you could play through many times and still find different things. There are so many hidden routes, items, quests, etc and so many ways to play the game it's impossible to describe them all here(smart, tech savvy character or a  brawler or a dimwit?  you can play them all and they all change the game)This game is a classic for a reason and is the gold standard by which other similar games should be judged.Buy it, play it, and understand where one of the greatest game franchises ever got much of it's spark.Do it now.

												A worthy successor to Fallout 1, and for those who loved the original they're in for a whole new experience.Few RPGs provide so deft a balance between the wandering monster-slaying and the NPC interaction phases of role-playing.Perhaps even more so than its predecessor, Fallout 2 contains dozens of subtle and more often not-so-subtle references to cult movies, television icons, and other aspects of popular culture.If you value character development, old-fashioned gameplay, and a good plot, this game delivers on all counts.

												War. War never changes.The end of the world occurred pretty much as we had predicted. Too many humans, not enough space or resources to go around. The details are trivial and pointless, the reasons, as always, purely human ones.The earth was nearly wiped clean of life. A great cleansing, an atomic spark struck by human hands, quickly raged out of control. Spears of nuclear fire rained from the skies. Continents were swallowed in flames and fell beneath the boiling oceans. Humanity was almost extinguished, their spirits becoming part of the background radiation that blanketed the earth.A quiet darkness fell across the planet, lasting many years. Few survived the devastation. Some had been fortunate enough to reach safety, taking shelter in great underground vaults. When the great darkness passed, these vaults opened, and their inhabitants emerged to begin their lives again.One of the northern tribes claims they are descended from one such Vault. They hold that their founder and ancestor, one known as the ""Vault Dweller,"" once saved the world from a great evil. According to their legend, this evil arose in the far south. It corrupted all it touched, twisting men inside, turning them into beasts. Only through the bravery of this Vault Dweller was the evil destroyed. But in so doing, he lost many of his friends and suffered greatly, sacrificing much of himself to save the world.When at last he returned to the home he had fought so hard to protect, he was cast out. Exiled. In confronting that which they feared, he had become something else in their eyes...and no longer their champion.Forsaken by his people, he strode into the wasteland. He traveled far to the north, until he came to the great canyons. There, he founded a small village, Arroyo, where he lived out the rest of his years. And so, for a generation since its founding, Arroyo has lived in peace, its canyons sheltering it from the outside world. It is home. Your home.But the scars left by the war have not yet healed. And the Earth has not forgotten.			"

Withdrew ebola; dropped it. *CONTAINMENT BREACHED. 3 MINUTES TO EVACUATE FACILITY*. The mob boss that hired me to check out the depot was very unhappy to hear that it blew up. So unhappy, in fact, that he shot at me, so I punched him and his family to death. The other three families in New Reno were fairly impressed.

												At one point i stumbled across a village of ghouls. They seemed nice enough, and offered me a quest. 'Go convince this city full of bigots to help us. k thx bye.' Later i found the back door to a large shed. Turns out it contained a ladder to the underground. Down there, I found out that there were about a dozen ghouls talking about getting 'renewed'. I knew instantly it was a cult of some sort. I convinced one of them I totally knew what was going on and managed to get an audience with their god. I found an evil genius who wanted to take over the world, who was also a talkng molerat. He asked me for some cheezy poofs I had acquired, and I gave it to him. He then told me that his plan was to convince the entire population of ghouls that he could restore their humanity IF they worked for him. He also gave me an economic data disk that would convince the city of bigots to help the town of ghouls. I gave it to them, and they agreed to help. They also made me a citizen of their city and I was instantly a local hero in both places. I also got to speak with the 'mayor' of the bigoted city.

												Whew, this game. I could make a big frickin' list about the cool stuff here (plus killap's Restoration Project, which is a ♥♥♥♥in' awesome mod), but I am too lazy to do that. What I will say, though, is that you should definitely play Fallout before trying out Fallout 2 because of the story, obviously (if you don't care about story, I don't know what you're doing here), and also for the better introduction to the gameplay system and game that Fallout gives. Fallout 2 is harder, longer, and has way more quests and content, of course. I mean, damn, dude, in Fallout, you start with a gun, some ammo, stimpacks, a knife, fighting some silly weak rats. In Fallout 2, you're a tribal with nothing else other than a spear, fighting giant ants. It shouldn't be a big deal for players who are used to it, but I've seen people complaining about dying way too much at the beginning of Fallout 2 (and guess what, a lot of them never even played the first one!). I think I've played and finished this game more than enough to say that I loved it, and I still do, as I enjoy playing it from time to time, and try some different cool builds. I'm not an old school gamer, but I still feel a great compassion for this game, which I truly think is well-made. (Guess I'm not so lazy at all, seeing as I took the time to at least write a bit about this cool game.) Totally recommend it.			"

												I've spent a fair share of hours for this game, and I'll say they were all well spent.I'll admit, this game does require patience, but once you've figured out where that one object is or where that one person went, it makes it all worthwhile.You may have to look up a tutorial here and there, but that doesn't matter that much in the end. What matters is that YOU picked up the object, YOU found and talked to the person, YOU fought the final boss. Because the tutorial can't press the keys or control the mouse, only you can.Besides all the deep talk, fallout 2 offers a lot for players who liked fallout 1 or just like turn-based RPGs. There is a wide variety of quests,weapons,people and locations all for you(the player)to find and explore. The campaign isn't linear and gives you choices on how to handle different situations. What more do you want? Why are you still reading? Buy the game and go head-first into the wasteland of fallout 2!			"

												Fallout 2 in my opinion is the best in a series of games that include Fallout 3 and New Vegas. Nothing like going back old school days with this fantastic turned based RPG. The story telling in this game is unique, very often funny, and always engaging. You are free to be who you want to be in the wastelands of Fallout, want to be a prick that steals from everyone? Maybe you want to be the hero who saves the children instead of killing them? With the way karma works in this game your actions very much affect the way the world reacts to you and your party. Along with the choice to go where ever in the world, the skill system is just as open, you can spend your skill points however you like. I find myself making many characters just to try out different styles of play. You could be a sweet talking brawler, a thieving sharp shooter, or even a non-combatant that talks, repairs, or barters thier way to the end, the choices are truly up to you. If you do decide to buy this be sure to download Killaps unoffical patch and Killaps Restoration project, both have installers and make the game more incredible. Oh and by the way kids, stay off the jet, it's addictive!			"

												Okay this game is like Fallout 1 but stretched out with NEW features that the developers played around with. I was quite surprised how long the game was, maybe too long. I found out that I only did 75% of the game before finishing it. That is huge when I have played the game for nearly 20 hrs. Alot of it is really the travelling, as it is further and takes longer to get between the different towns in this one. But you have a CAR! BUT that car has some of the worse bugs in video game history, you can be an unlucky player like I did and lost the car randomly, never to ever see it again. There is no way to track where your car is situated and yea if you lose track of it or if the lost car bug happens to you, that's it no more car for you. You cant get it back nor can you get another one. Also in this game you can play your character even AFTER you finish the game to pick up the quests you missed etc. It is a good game but a very long and buggy game too. Still definately worth it, but you must stick with it for the long haul. :)			"

												I'd rather confidenly say this is the best Fallout game in the series so far. All of them have great atmosphere and mood, but they also have their fair share of stupid mistakes or just plain lack of certain qualities. Fallout 2 eludes most of the failings of its predecessor and its successors and stands strong on its own as well.It provides enough variety and character to feel full and alive, while staying true to the mood and maintaining the bar of quality at a reasonable level. Just as importantly, it maintains a very decent level of reactivity and non-linearity, and offers maybe not perfect but seriously flexible mechanics. It also introduces the best plot twist of the whole series. So all in all, I'd call it the purest and the most successful execution of the Fallout concept so far. Even though I would love it to have more of the desperate and mysterious mood of the very beginning of Fallout 1, the vast pretty enviroments of Fallout 3 and the tasteful characterization of New Vegas.

												I have very little time played on this on Steam as I played the GOG version but trust me when I say that Fallout 2 is one of the greatest, possibly the greatest RPG of all time. I sank dozens of hours into this on my old laptop (if you have a laptop you use for college or whatever that dosen't have great specs but you want to play some games, Fallout 1 and 2 are perfect for this) and didn't even finish it in the end.If you have only played the newer Fallouts like I had, playing the originals is so fun and insightful and the games are masterpieces. If you can look past the strategic and somewhat slow combat (which you can speed up in the options), Fallout 2 can offer hundreds of hours of enjoyment .			"

												At the time of this review, this game is literally old enough to vote in the United States. And yet no other game has made me so deliriously happy to finally get my hands on a gun.Pros:-Top-notch dialogue and writing in general-Well-designed strategic combat-Major emphasis on roleplay and many ways to accomplish any given goal-Difficulty level that reinforces the harshness of the setting without being too hardcore-I am attended by a fat, balding tuna can merchant who karate chops scorpions for me-60 fpsCons:-Hope you like brown and beige-Occasional b.s. random encounter, like spawning in the middle of a scorpion nest-There are two very obvious god stats: Agility for combat (how often you can attack and how far you can move), and Intelligence for everything else (how many skill points you get when you level up, the base value for the highly useful First Aid skill, and for some inane reason how persuasive you are in dialogue, making Charisma close to useless).

												The masterpiece of all rpgs, Fallout 2 yet its practicly a son of wasteland, this game is worth the weight, worth getting rid of your nagging girlfriend/wife and worth quitting that business monkey job, you don't need any of that anyway! all you need is a fresh nuka-cola and some fallout 2. Now in a few weeks is mah birthdays with planning to buy wasteland 2 I decide to write my personal expierence and opinon on this game.Why you ask? I will tell you my experience.Here you are born in a tribal village in the wasteland of america,  your home where your ancestor known as the vault dweller of V13 was exiled from his overseer due to the fear of spreading diseases and radiation inside the vault towards the pure dwellers, your ancestor did nothing wrong but saved his people from being forced out of the vault into the cruel wasteland due to a dying water supply and being raided by monsterous mutants of the Master's army, he walked north and north to find a tribal village on the wasteland... in present time, you discover your home village is dying.. brahmin are dying, children sick with diseases. everything was starting to fall apart slowly, but you the decendant of the v13 dweller have been chosen by the village's elder to go out the wasteland explored by your ancestor to find the mighty G.E.C.K to fix all this hell happening.. and that is where your journey begins.Now with some quick tips before you first time play this game:I reccomend reading this guide to help you get started playing, trust me its worth to read than being torn to shreds by a small Enclave patrol or getting shotgunned in the face when you try to fight with melee in a random encounter. small spoilers because the guide also brings up the details with all the quests available in this gamehttp://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/The_Nearly_Ultimate_Fallout_2_Guide#Character_designDon't ragequit over getting wrecked by a bunch of geckos or radscorpians, the more you play the game, the better. Okay so now onto the Gameplay, its very Turnbased but its rewarding seeing the animations of someones torso being blown to bits by shotguns and mini-guns, even melting him like a witch with a plasma gun is entertaining too, of course you can also be blown to bits by anyone. there isn't open world exploration like you get in fallout 3 because outside of towns/other places will bring a large map with a green dot (you) click around and you move around, when you want to travel to another location for the side/main quests  you will often have random encounters such as radscorps, walking into a middle of a firefight between caravans and bandits, there are peaceful encounters like the caravans who will trade with you for caps (aka money) of course the small downside with trading is your karma status effects the caravans, some of them will refuse to trade with you either becuase you are known as a evil fat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ villlain  or a goodie white knight of the wasteland it mainly depends on  locations that you are nearby like the cities, small hint there are easter egg encounters too!You can also choose to do what ever you want. Killing before asking/chatting, turning the tables of the side quest (i.e giving the brahmin you were meant to guard to the twins when you trick your dumb tribal friend into running away) you can't slaughter the villagers in your home cus otherwise the game will be over insta.There are also Companions that you can take with you on your travels, based on my experience I will give you the details of the companions I had with me.Vic This man may be your second/first companion you can bring along, he's good for ranged weapons, be sure to collect his rifle at his shack in the first town you go to, but he's often slow and bad for melee combat. Lenny A ghoul, he's not great with combat and carrys a knife with him but he is a decent doctor, have him as your field medic and sort. Also he cannot run.Marcus this guy has a talking head voice acted too, but if you want this big hulk with you, its best you either take his mini-gun away and give him a plasma rifle, or have him as your only companion because he will freaking kill every single thing in his line of fire no matter who's infront when you're in combat, his mini-gun often has a unaccurate shot hitting mutiple targets in a burst of fire which means he can instantly kill you or his fellow companion by accident. K9 this cyber dog is simliar to the famous dog-meat but he can talk and is cool, you can find him inside a lab at the navvarro Enclave base, its best you get in there with the highwayman car otherwise you will have a pain in the ♥♥♥ experience getting killed by enclave patrols in 1 turn every time. Goris this DEATHCLAW is quite a badass, except he can only fight with his claws in melee so he can sometimes get in your line of fire including marcus's and his animation with his jedi cloak gets repeative. The story also has multiple endings on every town and faction you have met along in your travels, your actions towards them will bring them a future, for example if you slaughter the slavers at the Den and free the slaves, the town will flourish and sort, and if you screw up modac its gonna die because you made a mistake on your decision. Immersion on this game regardless of the graphics is really great too, you're gonna get tempted to kill somebody because of what-he-said about those poor ghouls or maybe even insulting you. This is not some fallout 3 where enclaves gets killed by revolvers, or deathclaws getting killed in 3 seconds or children being immune to gunshots Oh yeah you can kill kids in this game if you're a heartless monster :3  this is fallout 2 friend. -fun turnbased gameplay-immersive storyline-able to do what you want that can effect karma or faction/town reputation including the ending of the faction and town.

												The best of the best. And definitely the best of Fallout series. Incredible amount of choices and outcomes, good humor, beautiful graphic details (especially for those years) and fascinating soundtracks. Most famous RPG's aren't even half this good.Completed it more than 10 times:been a ranger, been a slaver, cleared the wasteland with a BB gun\fists only\knives only\etc., fought bandits\mutants\robots, assasinated important people, avoided violence with speaking skills, fixed a nuclear plant, destroyed it too, got married to a ♥♥♥♥, got divorced, rode a nuclear car, been in a sect, wiped out the sect, became a boxing champion, a porn star, a gangster, impregnated mob boss's daughter, saved everybody, doomed everybody... and still willing to play more. The game becomes even more exciting with the ""Restoration Project"", which adds a bunch of locations and quests, that were cut from or incomplete in the original game.			"

												Another true classic. (I have owned three different copies of this game to support this claim.)To get the most out of your gaming experience, be sure to check out the best fan/mod community for this game 'No Mutants Allowed': www.nma-fallout.com Here you can find an unoffical patch to fix bugs, improve graphics and gameplay ' and restore many elements of the game that were left out by the developers due to constraints.. Even better, you can also consider the 'Resortation Project' or other Mods to get more out of your Fallout 2 gaming experience.			"

												I played this after i went through Fallout 4 to see if it was as good as i remember it to be, and i was not disappointed. This is one billion times better than fallout 4 when it comes to the sheer feel of it all, Everything just works. It's such a perfect game, with an immensely rewarding and equally punishing combat system. The calculations of the hit percentage, the gameplay itself, the old graphics, the isometric viewpoint. Everything .. JUST ... WORKS. I haven't gone through the entire game since i am quite the slow player, but believe me, so far this has surpassed fallout 4 in every way imaginable. Plus i have after all played the game before, 17 years ago. as for the gameplay, let me give you a story:Once upon a time there was a gunfight between 7 golden geckoes and a lone tribes-man who just left his companion because he kept blocking passages infront of doors so that the tribes-man would have to save and reload until the companion rearranged his position. So, as the - never again - ""lone"" tribes-man (conveniently named with the most ineligible, and unsuiting name since the dawn of time) stood infront of the golden geckoes he had an epiphany that this would not end in an orderly fashion (he also did inconveniently forget to save the game since he is, and was a complete moron). He fought until there was all but one golden gecko left, with 7HP and an arm with a golden shine to it on the ground. The tribes-man with a peculiar name raised his one-shot gun as far as his ripped up arms could bear, with the 5 remaining Action-points - the fairly girthy built man had left - He pulled the trigger costing him 3 action points. The gun gasped for air as the bullet traveled through the 50cm long, rifled barrel. The bullet caught a spin and flew through the air (just like the keys on a keyboard when a companion decides to block a passage), it got near the golden gecko and flew straight past, because the tribes-man was a retard and didn't for one second think to move closer with the two actionpoints he had left in him. It was now the gecko's turn and the tribes-man died horribly in one move. Moral of the story: ""you die in-game if you make a mistake in a crucial moment, and you die IRL when you haven't saved for 2 hours"".10/10, childhood memories comes flooding back from me pulling my hair in dispair.sincerely, Nomad			"

												Hands-down best Fallout game to date. Fallout 2 blows every other game in the amazing series out of the water. Providing the most amount of gameplay, and some features that aren't even in the modern installments. Fallout 2 took the first game and made it more in depth, funnier, bigger, and badder. If the next Falllout were to have the awesomeness of this one packaged with modern graphics and combat, I don't think I'd ever get anything done.			"

												So I was selected as the saviour of my tribe and set off into the wasteland. After a while I found myself in New Reno,a drugee and gambling paradise. I fit in very well as I had become addicted to Jet and part of the Slavers Guild with my gambling skill as the highest skill. I found a movie studio and, as I had the charisma of a average house plant, I couldn't become a pornstar, so I had no choice but to become a fluffer to keep the boys rock-hard for their takes. I contracted HIV after preforming so much fellatio. I later went to a casino to gamble and I found a daughter of the owner of the casino. She  brought me to bed and I preformed amazing intercourse. Afterwards, I stole all of her personal belongings. I later went out of her room  and her father interrogated me and because I have no weapons he shot me dead. So it is a very good game, in my opinion. 10/10			"

												So, all I have to say is that I'm quite glad I played the first two Fallout games as they are great! While 3 and New Vegas still are my favorite games in the franchise, the first two Fallout games are still amazing and definitely have withstood the test of time.I think the one thing I love the most is that the game is demanding, making you think out each action carefully, which I like, it also is fair with its difficulty.  Plus, it requires you to really think about how you build your character. I at first mistakenly built my character in the game with a gun-centric build focused around accuracy with guns, not realizing the first quest, you didn't get any guns and had to use a spear. Luckily, I quickly realized my error and made a similar character with the build to make it through the Temple of Trials without dying at all. (Thank goodness for those Healing Powders...) It's really good to see a game that isn't dumbed down too much.I love the soundtrack in this game as well.  The gloomy music is perfect with the atmosphere.Gameplay is very nice, too. Quite fun. Especially with the whole D&D style of gameplay.If I had to list any problems with the game... One, my save files keep getting corrupted for some reason... >:( and two is that the game doesn't always seem to want to work on my laptop, which has NO trouble running Fallout 3 or New Vegas.			"

A Better RPG than Fallout 4Bleeding from several wounds, I thrust my spear once more toward my enemy, this time connecting, finally. I'm poisoned, bleary eyed and have six hitpoints remaining. I just survived the first dungeon with a charismatic character. I killed some Giant Ants. This is what Fallout was. A sprawling, tough RPG that actually required some amount of planning toward your character and your decisions. Even to this day the dialogue is great and the story gripping yet allows a sense of freedom. If you want a fighting character you better make a fighting character. When I played Fallout 4 I made an incredibly charismatic, intelligent character with poor stats in fighting. I still managed to kill everything. In Fallout 2 I barely survived the first dungeon, getting mauled by Lesser Scorpions and Giant Ants, all because I wanted my character to be a talker, not a fighter. Obviously it's aged; three mousepointers need to be alternated between; combat, movement and interaction. There's a panel that brings up skills and not everything is made immediately clear. But if those main 'problems' with the game don't scare you away then this is a great game. It's worth a try, even if just to see how Fallout was and to experience a true gaming classic; one that will remain for countless years as a great game in the history of gaming. jmcone's Personal Rating: Highly Recommended "

												I will reccomend this game as the time that I have been able to play it (not anymore) was amazing. But, I will have to give you some adviceDO NOT RELY ON THE STEAM CLOUD, THE SAVES WILL NOT WORK!(I found this out the hard way)Just as you would have thought from me writing this, my saves will no longer work. I had put 39 hours into this game and then, one day my computer starts running into issues. Long story short I had to completly reset my HDD and reinstall windows. I thought I would still be able to play Fallout 2 as my saves have been uploaded onto the steam cloud. When I reinstalled the game, my saves came along with it, only for every save to give me this error upon attemping to load ""The instruction at 004f11db referenced memory from 00000010 The memory could not be read from"" I have looked up just about every single discussion about this error and nobody can find a way past it. I have posted about it on reddit, steam discussions and nma-fallout.com. It is unfixable and therefore I have wasted 39 hours of my life.Other than this big problem the game ran completly fine on my modern pc with no crashing, plus I really did love this game when I was able to play it.

												While some decry that it's a lot goofier than the first Fallout, you still have a game that'll give you your daily dose of grimdark, on top of a whole heaping of intricate quests and very well-written dialouge. However, I must temper my recommendation with a warning: Fallout 2 has what is generally regarded as the worst tutorial level ever created. If you're not rolling a combat character, you're going to have a bad time. Just grit your teeth and power through it, and you'll be treated to one of the best WRPGS ever.			"

												This is a case of learning from past mistakes and implementing fixes that are fun and fair. The improvements in gameplay are spectacular and make this a must own for nearly any gamer, both new and old. Then the beautiful mixture of story and world building. One of the best old school RPG's I've played.So like I said in my Fallout review this game fixes nearly every gameplay issue I had from the first one. The VATS hit calculations seem far more logical and correct, though it suffers a few times in a playthrough. I did not feel like rage quitting because of it at any point like the original did so many times. Thank you for this improvement.Criticals, another point from my Fallout review, vastly improved. So now enemies will actually do damage to you throughout the game, and criticals won't drain you in a single shot usually. Once again I found the new system of critcals to be fair and appropriate. So the story takes a step backward but then takes two more forward. The stepbackward is the depth of the NPC's. That has left, unfortunately, but has been replaced with greater variety. These enhance the world quite a bit, while giving you a little wish that some NPC's were used a little more. It's a better trade off in the end, because not only does it build story within The Chosen One's life but it also creates world depth. So this could go either way depending on your preference.Add onto all of this more weapons and items. Then a Highwayman to boot. This is a monumental increase in gameplay making this a fun game and a great story.			"

												I finally had a chance to complete this game. I tried to beat it about 2 times before and always failed due to the lack of time. I must admit I cheated and used a wiki toward the end of the game to speed things up, because without it I, most possibly would fail to beat it again.It's a very deep, hard and challenging RPG game in the best sense of role playing meaning. I played it then it was first released, it was fantastic then, now it certainly feels aged, and controls are not as good as they could be now, but for old-school players it's all fine. If you are not scared by aged games I really suggest you try this masterpeace but be prepeared to spend at least 100 hours for a fast paced game. If you really want to figure all by yourself it's better to have a physical journal there you should write up all information you encounter in the game since it's not that good at tracking all your discoveries. P.S. And that's the one of the rare games there you really need to read manual before playing (and it's a good manual too).			"

												Perhaps my favorite RPG ever...perhaps. The stat system offers unparalleled variety. This might be the only RPG, for example, where having a low Intelligence actually changes the way your character talks and how NPCs respond (you haven't truly played until you've tried a character with a level 1 INT and watched him bumble about like a cartoon Neanderthal). Also, the game is huge and, best of all, you can do all the things that RPGs usually shy away from: go on a mass child killing spree, get addicted to speed, become a gay porn star (provided your ""endurance"" score is high enough, of course), contract venereal diseases, become a pimp or a slave trader. What's not to love? Plus, everything's given a sort of ""Gee Whiz!,"" ""Leave it to Beaver"" sheen so the contrast between the main character's wide eyed naiveté and the often terrible stuff he's duped into doing (often with the best intentions) is always amusing and can provide a good deal of comedy (depending on how you play).

												Favorite game of all time, still delivers an unparalleled CRPG experience in 2015.EDIT: Finally finished the game, there is no other game like this. Except the first Fallout...Buy it! At the beginning the game is quite slow, but once you get your small guns skill up to 130% the game starts to pick up its pace and it's just a matter of developing your character from there on. You'll be an unstoppabble killing machine, or an unstoppable diplomatic if you want by end game. It's amazing seeing how much you've accomplished throughout the game, you'll go from you missed 4x in a row to insta killiing fools in the eyes. Also pro tip: always go for the eyes.			"

												During your character creation you get to choose from some traits and there's one called ""bloody mess"". The only thing it does is, that whenever you kill anything it dies the most violent way which results in throwing rocks at children makes them explode but other than that it's completely useless. Still I pick it whenever I start a new playthrough.The game itself is pretty good but is very unforgiving and not very friendly towards players who are new to games like that. If you want a game with high challenge and a good story then you should get this one but maybe during a sale.Don't forget to install killap's restoration project.

												Hoo boy. I have mixed feelings on this one.Fallout 2 is more or less the same as Fallout in terms of gameplay, but with improvements, which is certainly a plus. There is one minor gameplay quibble I have, and that's that they slightly nerfed the Turbo Plasma Rifle for no good reason. Why, besides trying to make the Pulse Rifle seem better by comparison? That seems like the completely wrong way to go about it, making and trying to balance new content by changing the old. It was fine! On the subject of equipment changes, they also reduced the weight of the Power Armor by about half with no explanation. I'd accept that if you at least acknowledged it, but now it just seems kind of silly. Just one offhand remark about removing unnecessary systems in there! THAT'S IT!Anyway, the story issue is a bit more complex. The focus in Fallout 2, I've noticed, is more based on the moment-to-moment or area-to-area experience, rather than Fallout 1's cohesive whole. As a result, the whole thing seems more scattered, muddier, and overall less entertaining and less absorbing, as they'll do anything to make sure that you're never not entertained, while Fallout made sure that there was a single, easy-to-follow narrative, leading to a better and more consistent atmosphere.One other really annoying thing: the game takes forever to get going, especially for gun-oriented characters. The Temple of Trials and the majority of Klamath have nothing but scorn for your desire to find a single ranged weapon that doesn't have a 1-bullet clip, and even then you're still on shaky ground until maybe the Den. For a while, I even tried to just play a hand-to-hand character for this game simply because the beginning is so stupidly unhelpful! In contrast, take a look at Fallout 1's beginning. You're kicked out the door. You have a gun, a knife, and ammo to spare (and a definite and straightforward goal). Boom. All playstyles are go. Even with the gameplay sorting itself out, the whole Fallout 2 package doesn't really get engaging until Gecko. After that, though, it really does pick up steam, and by the Enclave you realize that just now you're getting the experience and thrills that Fallout 1 was delivering from square one. (I should probably mention that eventually I was so desperate for some fun way forward that I looked up Per Jorner's excellent guide. That was what truly rekindled my interest, and I urge everyone to check it out. It contains levels of love and research of and for a game that I haven't seen since Everything You Wanted to Know About Headcrabs and More. Check that out too, actually.)Overall, I like Fallout 1 more. Fallout 2 is huge, much bigger than its predecessor, and has its share of wonderous delights (don't get me wrong on that), but more often than not for me they're hidden behind some sort of obtuse non-engaging..sloppiness? Design oversight? Overreaching? that the first game rarely if ever had. I guess I'd still recommend it -mostly for the story connectivity- but really, Fallout 1 is the better of the two, in my opinion.TL;DR I like Fallout 1 more, it seems to me that they got sloppy with this one. Too big to ignore, though.Also, some of the canonical and best endings are hidden behind lazy bugs? WHAT?EDIT: Just recently, I've been replaying the Fallout games in preparation for Fallout 2. When it came time for Fallout 2, I used Per Jorner's guide to speedrun through the thing in the course of a night. Playing through the entire thing once was enough for me.			"

												After putting a couple hundred hours into Fallout: New Vegas, I decided to play the first three games. I started with Fallout. It was fun and gave some background information to common themes in the later games. I beat it in under 24 hours, if I hadn't wasted 3 hours remaking characters that could survive it would have been less. Then came Fallout 2. With the experience I had gained from Fallout I ran into Fallout 2 expecting a cakewalk. I was wrong. The wasteland had became an even harsher place. It took over 50 hours to beat this game and I loved every moment. Unlike in Fallout where I had ditched Ian late in the game to comtinue on, I found myself reloading ealier saves time after time when Lenny or Cassidy died. I ran all over the wasteland avoiding the Enclave and mutants searching for secret places and proper oppponents. I hope when I start Fallout 3 Soon that I can experience the same level of investment in a game.			"

												It's definitely harder to get into than Fallout 1, but in the end it's worth it. Whereas Fallout 1 drew me right in from the start, I had to force myself through the first couple hours of Fallout 2, but it was worth it. What you find is a game with everything that Fallout 1 did right, (the atmosphere, the characters, the immersion, the story) and added onto it with a bigger environment, more things to do, more items, and a generally longer and more diverse gaming experience. Highly recommended to anybody who can appreciate an older game.NOTE: If using windows 7, the colours will most likely look really distorted when you launch the game. This makes the game unplayable, but it can be easily 'fixed' by closing explorer.exe when you run the game.			"

Now that I got that ♥♥♥♥ out of the way, all I have to say is that Fallout 2 is one of the best RPGs of all time, and if you love RPGs, you better get it however you can, because it is well worth the time you put into it, for it has the following:- An open ended world that feels just like the real world, involving drugs, sex, politics and much, much more.- The same good ol' gameplay that the first game had, but with much improvement.- A story that ♥♥♥♥♥ on a lot of other stories not just in RPGs, but video games in general, with plenty of interesting and quirky characters.- Tons of interesting side quests, including a side quest to blow up an outhouse in order to get a watch from a giant ♥♥♥ rat.- The ability to become a porn star (come on, you know you wanna be one).Need I say more?

												Fallout 2 was a game pirated and given to me on a blank CD by a friend's little brother in high school. What I got out of the game has lasted me a lifetime. From it's familiar locales like New Reno and San Francisco, to it's gritty noir, Fallout 2 has it all.  You could even murder kids and get branded a Childkiller. Not your forte? You can go into the porn industry in New Reno! If you're any sort of fan of post-apocalytic scenarios or films in general, this is an assured staple for your library. Every few years (or new computer, I suppose), I would dig out my old burned copy and reinstall it to give it another playthrough. I happened upon a one-day sale wherein Fallout 1-3, New Vegas, and Tactics were all $2.49 apiece. Naturally, I ♥♥♥♥ with glee and promptly ordered. This game will entrance you, given a few hours of dedication. Just like Fallout 3, Fallout 2 begins with a catchy, old-timey tune; in this case, it's Louis Armstrong's ""Kiss To Build A Dream On."" Here's hoping this game sticks with you, too.			"

												Hello Fellow Wastelanders,I strongly suggest the purchase of Fallout 2: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game! It's a wonderful game, even though it's a little bit old and still uses a turn-based system. The game's storyline is amazing and it feeds into the future Fallout games. It also builds off of the original Fallout, but it doesn't make you feel clueless when you first start. It's a wonderful game, great storyline, great everything, that leads into a great series. I strongly recommend it if you are into the lore of the series! Definitely worth the money!-Kyle James			"

												Tired of your average RPG? Does helping the same settlement have you down? Introducing Fallout 2, one of the best, if not the best, game in the series. It's a great RPG overall. Fallout 2 has so many quests, characters, enemies, weapons, skills, and tons more. But wait, there's more! Like pop culture references? Fallout 2 has so much of that. Like apocalpyse games with humor injected into it? Fallout 2 has that. It'll take some getting used to if you haven't played it before, but it's worth every cent.			"

Harder But its still fun the problem is if you arent much of a fan of fallout you are going to right away quit the game and play your little less succcesfull Franchise 8) But its still Fun to play and Talk With a few fimillar faces (Since this game is in California so meaning in fallout new vegas you might see refrences from this game or fallout 1) 8/10cons -its a bit slow to lvl so you will grind alot-the music aint that great meaning better start blasting GNR music -you will get very lost on what to do especially the main story			"

												CANNOT RECOMMEND ENOUGH! This and Fallout 1 are MUST OWNS! I recently purchased the 2 in a bundle and I seriously cannot put them down! I've been hooked on them for 2 weeks straight. Now I know if you're like me and not from the era of these types of games you need to be in the mood to play this type of top down, turn based system. But if you look up a quick guide like I did, I was used to the system and was having fun within the first 20 min of Fallout 1. And since FO2 is so similar, you can get straight into it. - The story of the games is 10/10, love them.- The worlds (especially Fallout 2) are sensational, I spoke to every NPC to soak in as much info as I could- The companions are cool but as always in these games, they're in the way a lot and they shoot you a fair bit (Much improved in fallout 2 since you can push them out of the way)- And the CHOICES! I now understand why all the other fans were dissapointed in FO3 and 4.. the choices and consequences here are exciting and rewarding.- FO2 = Best RPG i've ever playedThere is sooo much more to be said here but I need to get back to slaughtering slavers. I wish I could forget the two games just so I could experience them for the first time again!TL;DR: Best RPGS ever, world, story, choices 11/10. Buy buy buy			"

												(Post Fallout 1 Review) Fallout 2 continues 70-80 years after Fallout 1, playing as the ancestor of your previous character, the ""Vault Dweller"" or also called the ""Chosen One"". You are sent off into the wastes to help your tribe ""Arroyo"" and uncover the legacy The Vault Dweller left behind within California/Nevada and introducing a new grand threat who origins are from those whom governed before, the ""ENCLAVE"". Remnants of the United States.The core gameplay mechanics never really changed when transitioning between Fallout 1 and 2 (Isometric turned based combat). The most noticable differences is the amount of new perks, and the way you begin the game. Fallout 2 entices you to create a close-quarters heavy build, over Fallout 1's small guns since you are a tribal. This game also introduces a boatload of new companions (12-13), which smothers Fallout 1's four followers. Fallout 2 has plenty of new quests that all intertwine nicely together, as multiple factions and cities effect one another.Tons of Fallout cameos, pop-culture references, and tons of new content. Such a lovely addition to my Fallout experience! (Did one playthrough, with around 90% of the sidequests complete. Time clocked: Around 50 hours)			"

In The End, Why Not Just Hit Children In The Groin With A Sledgehammer - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]In the event that the world ever ends, be it zombie apocalypse, nuclear armageddon, or any other fun kind of catastrophe, I feel like humanity definitely will live on. We're a stubborn race of beings. Like cockroaches. We're everywhere, we just won't go away, and we seem to find a way to procreate everywhere.Out of every possible way that the human race could near extinction, I think being mostly annihilated by an atomic bomb or so would be the best way to go. Especially if Fallout is something we could go on.In Fallout 2 specifically, one of the great tactical CRPG classics, an atomic post-apocalyptic wasteland is a pretty fun place. You can pretty much do whatever you want.Fallout 2 takes place after the events of Fallout 1, with your character from the first game starting their own village outside the Vault to live out the rest of their days. Your new character is a descendant of them, and has grown up outside the Vault. Their village has had a horrible drought, and it's up to you as The Chosen One to set off and save the world.Fallout 2 is near identical to the first game in terms of gameplay, polished and upgraded to make it the definitive classic Fallout experience. If you're looking for the very best in terms of isometric, tactical CRPG action, Fallout 2 is probably your game.The time limit is gone. You're free to explore Fallout 2's vast, open world to your heart's content. There's all sorts of side-quests, missions, and just random nonsense to get yourself into. You can join the mafia, become a pornstar, or just slaughter every human being you see. It's all free game.To start, you just need to create your character. There is a selection of pre-made ones, but the real fun of the game is creating your own character to fully immerse yourself in the world of Fallout.From there, you just need to play through what could be called a crude tutorial dungeon. After that, the world opens up. Slowly at first, as your stats will not allow much exploration when the wasteland is crawling with giant scorpions and freaks. But with time, you'll be able to do as you please.Mechanically, it's better than the original Fallout. It plays better, it controls better, and it has more depth than the original in terms of what the world offers. The gameplay has been balanced to make all character skills viable, which was an issue with the first Fallout game. As a sequel, it definitely has at least improved upon the original.However, I personally still prefer the first one. Fallout 2, I felt took a lot of what made Fallout special out of the equation. The time limit, while brutal, was part of giving that sensation of hopelessness and urgency. And having your character born outside of a Vault, it took some of the impact away of having stepped out into the wasteland for the first time.The story was not as compelling, and it didn't really feel like Fallout at first to me. The early game is particularly slow, and it takes a while to really capture that Fallout vibe.As an older game, it is still a little bit dated. Especially in the graphics department. But still completely enjoyable as a game. I always did have a thing for older games. I like them a little mature, you know?Regardless, Fallout 2 is still a very special game. There aren't very many other games where you can blow up small children with powerful explosives, become a slaver, or have sex with a mutant. Fallout 2 really is something special, and it's an essential part of any PC game collection. The sheer depth of the game constantly gives off the feeling that there's still more to do and more to see.In the event of a real nuclear apocalypse, I call dibs on leader of the pornstar mafia. No, I already got dibs, it's official. Too bad. You can be something else.I called it, it's mine.			"

												At first I was really really sceptical about it because its such an old and somewhat clunky game for todays standards which CAN throw you off, especially in the beginning.Same happened to me. Long time fallout fan but never played 1&2. At first its very difficult. Combats in early levels are such hardcore RNG based. But after a while you realize you dont have to fight everything at all. This game doesnt force you to fight like 3 and 4 did.Anyway, if you get past the clunkiness and stuff you are in for a great and very atmospheric/immersive game. Loving it by far now!			"

												At first I was really really sceptical about it because its such an old and somewhat clunky game for todays standards which CAN throw you off, especially in the beginning.Same happened to me. Long time fallout fan but never played 1&2. At first its very difficult. Combats in early levels are such hardcore RNG based. But after a while you realize you dont have to fight everything at all. This game doesnt force you to fight like 3 and 4 did.Anyway, if you get past the clunkiness and stuff you are in for a great and very atmospheric/immersive game. Loving it by far now!			"

												One of my favorite RPGs ever... ever... everrrr... everrrrrrrrrr..... *drool*but on that note, there are tons of bugs! And it's still an amazing game, but thankfully there is a fix for that, just google that sheeeiiiz and find that there is a dedicated man of holy worthiness that has provided a patch fix for all the bugs and glitches. He also has one with optional improvements that I highly recommend with better graphics, higher resolution, coding errors and dialog errors/options.

A Rpg set in a post apocalyptic world with turn based combat and luck of the draw difficulty one time you can be top of the world next you're just starting out and a pack of rats kill you in a random encounter but I wouldnt have it any other way.

												This game is an absolute classic. If you are a fan of rpgs you have to give this one a try. The pinnacle of Roleplaying in the fallout seris. Gamplay hasn't aged as well, but if you like more strategic gamplay you can probably look passed that. The atmosphere of the wasteland and humorous tone of the game really blend well. I really suggest anyone who enjoys rpgs who has not played classics like give Fallout 2 a try			"

												Fallout 2 seems somewhat less polished than the original entry (especially in combat), but it focuses on giving the player as much freedom of choice as possible, and that, it does well.Also, few RPGs ever made me want to become evil, and honestly, you can do some pretty ♥♥♥♥ed up ♥♥♥♥ in Fallout 2.As a became a slaver, one of my companions (who had been a victim of slavery in the past) freaked out on me and started calling me names. I pushed him and he fell to the ground, in the middle of the street. Before he could even get up we had literally kicked him to death with my other mates. That was dark, in a pretty cool way.Also, had sex with a random farmer's son AND daughter. Pretty nice.			"

												Now that Interplay has lost the rights to Bethesda, the new ownership has decided to patch the glitch that would cause your game to black out every few minutes and/or the random rainbowish colors that would be there in error due to the incompatibility problems caused by newer systems. This pretty much saves you a few minutes if you couldn't figure out the problem yourself online. Nonetheless, the game itself has an enriching storyline that even pleases graphics-spoiled gamers like me. I would really recommend this to anyone who has played any part of the newer fallout series such as Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas but wants to know the backstories to various references in the newer games, such as the origin of Marcus at Jacobstown in Fallout: New Vegas or Harold at the Oasis in Fallout 3. Overall I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for fun games in general.			"

Adds a lot of content that was cut out of the original release and fixes a ton of bugs that have existed since Interplay went out of business all those years ago.While Fallout is actually a pretty short game, this one is burgeoning with content. The world is alive and connected. You can play in any way you want. Your moral compass can point in any direction. I still find new things even after all these years.			"

												Builds on everything I had problems with in the first game: The companions, and travel mainly. I only got one playthrough into this and it took 40 well-spent hours away from me, it felt like a small MMO or something with all the content and quests and cities to explore. What's more, it drastically builds upon the political ideas behind the game, as FO1 mainly had just the authoritarian left that was the Master, FO2 now has Vault City as a criticism of democracy, the NCR as a pushy police state/democracy and the Enclave who stood for forced eugenics, absolutely awesome stuff. Even though the pop-culture references and less serious atmosphere only slightly take away from the game, it's a very, very solid 10/10 from me. Would ride that Highwayman into the sunset any day of the week.			"

												This is one of my absolute favorite games of all time. I have been a huge fan of the Fallout series since I was a kid and this game delivers almost everything a fallout fan could want but you have to take it for what it is. The game is about 16 years old now so for most of the people that became fans of the series because of Fallout 3 and New Vegas this game is not what you might be expecting. I recommend this game to all of the people that grew up in the 90's and love the rpgs from that time. I do not recommend it for all of the people that are expecting it to be like Fallout 3 or New Vegas or any newer game for that matter. This game is amazing but like I said you have to take it for what it is.			"

Pros *gore I love the pixilated gore *unique custimisation system  *nice combat system *many more choseable allies than the first Fallout*great story that follows up well on the first fallout Cons * No mini map  * Some skills are redundant and rarely utilised  * Your allies can die permenantly and since there is a select few number of allies you are going to have to redo battles over and over to get a result where non of your allies die  *  weapon iniquality: guns are better than mellee weapons, although this is realistic I would have hoped rpgs wouldn't stoop to such realism   * and last of all the frequent much dreaded MISSOverall though it is pretty fun to play this 1998 classic.

												Fallout 2 is a great game, and perhaps one of the best in the Fallout series. The setting, characters, and music are all wonderful. However, the combat is very dated and the game is infested with bugs. Certain quests and outcomes are simply unobtainable. In addition, I was annoyed that for a game that features many different solutions to complete a task, the game would often force you into doing things during crucial moments that if you had not previously focused upon, would be very difficult to do. Still, I can overlook this and say it is a game that any western rpg player should try out.			"

												Simply the best game I've ever played. It's ancient by gaming standards (came out 1998), and I still keep coming back again and again, usually after playing another RPG and feeling it was, once again, missing something or doing something wrong (like not being Fallout 2).To me the biggest fault in Fallout 2 is that most people who have played it will never REALLY be satisfied with any other RPG. Ever. Yeah, in the new games the graphics might be better (by a lightyear) or the game mechanics might be insanely good and inventive, but when push comes to shove nothing really compares. The plot, the writing, the characters, the freedom, the harshness of the world, the humor AND the fact that your character build does actually REALLY affect your run - drop your INT low enough and almost all NPCs A) treat you like you were an idiot (which you, in fact, are) B) don't really feel inclined to trust you to take care of their problems (duh, you're an idiot). A really stupid character has his own way of getting things done (like accidentally selling himself as a slave), and the fact that the developers thought of all these things and incorporated them in to their game is - by the way - awesome. Simply awesome.			"

You could actually build a character too weak to survive the first zone, instead of just doing 10% more damage with weapom type x.You most certainly did not get laser weapons, power armor, and a minigun to kill a deathclaw from an elevated position in your first play session.

Nostalgia GaloreWord cannot describe how much I love this game and I have lost count of how many times I have played it from beginning to end. Even though the game is ridiculously bugged and in many ways flawed (in its original form); the gritty grainy charm, the uncompromising dialogue and gory pixilated body explosions on a critical hit or by using a massive enough gun are just unparalleled, even when compared to the more modern instalments of the franchise. The retro pop-50s, hilariously grotesque depiction of a post-apocalyptic future is iconic and unmatched, it creates a post-eschatological environment that is equally gruesome as it is enjoyable. With that said, I love all of the other iterations of the game universe including those done by Bethesda, even Fallout 4, but none of them really compare to Fallout 2, only New Vegas comes close. I cherish my adventures with Sulik and his dialogue with his nose-bone, I laugh every time I buff John Cassidy in the heat of battle but forget his heart condition leading to his demise and of course the possibility of being reunited with Dogmeat from Fallout 1. I also love that you can make a character with such a low intelligence score that virtually all dialogue is impossible (as you are more or less unable to speak) and yet, you can complete the game in a meaningful way. I will be playing this game again and again, and force my children to do that same.And if they refuse, I will disown them. This game is indeed; a kiss to build a dream on..   ** This is a review of the original game, not Bethesda’s polished version.			"

												Old school, old graphics, still lots of fun. This is old graphics more like Dungeons and Dragons, except with Fallout script and story. A lot of customization, mad mature content (drug use, sex, and violence). You can even kill children in this game. Everything bad has consequences so it makes it even more realistic. A lot of humor in the game and spoofs hidden throughout. This was the original and so it is the best source to learn what Fallout games are really about. Combat is turn-based.			"

												I have been playing and playing this game since i was a kid. And after all these years I still find this game interesting. Creating different characters makes the game different every time you play. And it's not like in F3 or New Vegas. Char Sets really make the difference in the gameplay. But in fact, I think that the atmosphere of this game, the way the game was created, all the quests? special and random encounters they all make this game so exciting. MUSTPLAY			"

												Fallout 2, like it's predecessor and sequels, stands to date as one of the greatest roleplaying games ever devised. First introduced to the original game in the series as a youth, I quickly became addicted to both the setting and the story being told; I loved the choices you were asked to make, and the customisation options that were available to you; I adored the pre-war 50s feel that inhabited the wasteland, even as you carried plasma rifles and power armour into battle.In a word, Fallout 2, like the other games in the series, is sublime. As a fan of roleplaying games in general, I recognise that the post-apocalyptic genre is harder than others to make enticing - and yet Fallout somehow manages to nail it. Gore and mature themes meet head on with quirky humour, memorable locations and characters (Dogmeat and Harold the Ghoul being just two), and an expansive world to explore.Unlike the first game in the series, Fallout 2 has you taking on the role of a tribal youth who is sent out into the wasteland in order to secure a G.E.C.K. - a Garden of Eden Creation Kit - which will help your primitive people make the land furtile and liveable again. Who your character is - what gender, what they're good at, what their quirks are - is entirely up to you, as are the dialogue and moral decisions you make, and the route you take across the wasteland. With side quests all over the place, you can spend hours after hours trudging through the Fallout world, making your mark as either a sentinel of justice, or a madman with a shotgun. Good or evil, hero or villian - it's entirely up to you.The latter games might be controversial to a select few - after all, not everyone liked Bethesda's treatment of a classic game, and it's their perogative to think that way. However, it's almost unanimous fact that Fallout 2, like it's predecessor, stands as one of the greatest RPGs ever made.Buy this game.			"

												Fallout 2: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game is a role-playing open world game featuring a considerably larger map/world and a far more extensive storyline, than those of Fallout 1. It is hands down one of the best games I've ever played (and that says a lot about it). The fact that the game was made in 1998 makes it even more impressive.Fallout 2 centres around the protagonist a.k.a. 'The Chosen One' and is entasked with the duty by the elder of his village to find and retrieve the Garden Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.) which is a device that can create thriving communities out of the post-apocalyptic wasteland.The game comprises of exploring and travelling in the open world as well as speech and quests to various characters and NPC. In addition to the role playing elements, a unique turn-based shooter is used during combat. This incredible blend  makes the game so widely stimulating and intense. It is an experience unlike one other. Not to mention the storyline is as engaging as it is compelling.The player's actions throughout the game dictate what future story or gameplay opportunities are available. A player can choose to inhibit/aid certain NPCs and affects the entire gameplay. Aside from combat, speech also plays a huge role in the final outcome of the game. Before the game begins, the player is allowed to create his/her character with a variety of different skill, perk, trait and character point (S.P.E.C.I.A.L) builds. Because of the extensive outcome and scenarios, Fallout 2 is a game with incredibly high replay value.There is not much else to say, this game is IN-F***ING-CREDIBLE!GET IT (if you haven't already)6*/5 - 110% would recommend			"

												It's a good game, here is why.Pros:Reputations/karma/fame: e.g. you can become a slaver, which affects you in game, by making you despised by some of your possible companions.Cost: First of all, it's cheap, and for this reason alone I'd buy it. Bonus if you get it on sale.Gore: lots of it if you choose the bloody mess.Perks: lots of perks, depending on your actions and skills.Exploration: I felt as if exploring was fun and worth it.Funny: the humour is dark, which I prefer.Shortcuts: a lot of shortcuts, super useful.Cons:Story: the story is very fractured, and mostly involves you running around from A to B to C to D to kill 80 raiders then to finally get the GECK.Movement: the movement and combat are both very difficult to learn.Overall, I think it is fun and well made for its time, though frustrating at times.

												A true gem of rpg genre. Timeless classic which never becomes boring and, surprisingly enough, outdated.When I bought my first pc long time ago F2 was one the first games I installed and since that time it's still one of my favorite. And I'm still have that old cd full of old scratches.Rich world with charismatic characters, wide variety of story-impacting decisions, post-nuclear atmosphere, turn-based combat and just fun. Where else can your character become a pornstar (no videos sadly, just your own imagination), find a Holy Hand Grenade, been referred as a ""walking refrigerator"" and feel yourself as a skilfull diplomat even your character was under performance-enhancing drugs and had a huge heavily-armed supermutant at the back looking curiously at slightly shy local inhabitants? And you can't put a price tag on that unforgettable feeling when your Chosen One receives Expert Excrement Expeditor perk.And there was real supermutants before Bethesda made a typical orcs out of them.If you've ever been curious about the games which made significant contribution to the evolution of rpg genre you just must to try this masterpiece.PS. And don't forget to download high resolution patch.			"

EDIT: The text below was written before Steam Recommendations became Steam Reviews.Can the ideal be even better? Fallout 2 means more weapons to use, new enemies to kill, driving a car, taking all at once from the containers, giving and taking items instead of trading them with our followers and most importantly, more adventures in a post-apocalyptic world. Wander through the wasteland with Ron Perlman's narrative voice, Mark Morgan's amazing music and Louis Armstrong's immortal song ""A Kiss to Build a Dream On"" in the ears. Experience and absorb the great vibe of Fallout series. Interplay Entertainment and Black Isle Studios have my respect and I will be eternally grateful to them for creating this game and its prequel. Fight for survival in the harsh Fallout world. Kill or be killed, because war never changes. The answer to the question is affirmative.			"

												The good, the bad and the ugly for Fallout 2.Fallout is one of those game franchises that gives me he warm-tingly feeling just thinking about the games and while Bethesda has made some great sequels with Fallout 3 and New Vegas, by far one of my favorite games of all time has to be this instalment.Now, just to save time the review of this game could be applied to the original Fallout game with one major difference; there’s no annoying time limit. Now, sure the lack of that time limit may affect some’s perspective of realism but I think the freedom to explore and do side-quests makes the game more enjoyable but that’s just my opinion.The good:Grittiness of stories, environments, and characters has been something that’s been fairly popular in today’s gaming culture but nothing that’s come out recently could hold a candle to this game. Throughout the game you’re subjected to a very harsh environment where even the most civilized towns seems to have a dark streak that plays into the general feeling that the world is, in fact, completely screwed up and it’s up to you (ironically titled “the chosen one”) to save not only your village but the whole region from various forms of corruption and evil. Or you know… not… that’s what’s so great about this game! It gives you real choices on how you want to address problems you come across. Do you want to kill the slavers holding onto a mission critical NPC? Or do you want to trade in a companion and join them? Do you want to work towards putting a stop to the growing chem addicts in the region? Or ensure the chems keep flowing freely? Sorry, I kind of got off topic there. Bottom line, this game’s dark themes and choices give this game a level of depth that makes replays all the more enjoyable.The Bad:Some of the problems that gripped old PC games like this is they are often under-developed. It’s hard to tell if they just ran out of time on some things or in the case of things like the child-killer perk they were just WAY too controversial to be put in at release. Some of the things they took out though honestly would have made the game more enjoyable. If you have the time, do some research and take the time to get a good unofficial patch to restore some of these missing pieces.The ugly:The learning curve… Look, this game is not for the meek. You’re going to die and you’re going to die a lot. It falls under the category of old-school rpgs where even the easiest difficulties can be brutal for those who don’t know what to expect playing a game like this. In fact, if you don’t know what you’re getting into playing this game I’d warn you that you will probably restart a few times until you can get a character build that works for you (I recommend custom builds) and just like with all old games like these SAVE OFTEN.Story: 8/10Development: 2/10Nuka-nostalgia: 9/10 "

												Simply the best game I've ever played. It's ancient by gaming standards (came out 1998), and I still keep coming back again and again, usually after playing another RPG and feeling it was, once again, missing something or doing something wrong (like not being Fallout 2).To me the biggest fault in Fallout 2 is that most people who have played it will never REALLY be satisfied with any other RPG. Ever. Yeah, in the new games the graphics might be better (by a lightyear) or the game mechanics might be insanely good and inventive, but when push comes to shove nothing really compares. The plot, the writing, the characters, the freedom, the harshness of the world, the humor AND the fact that your character build does actually REALLY affect your run - drop your INT low enough and almost all NPCs A) treat you like you were an idiot (which you, in fact, are) B) don't really feel inclined to trust you to take care of their problems (duh, you're an idiot). A really stupid character has his own way of getting things done (like accidentally selling himself as a slave), and the fact that the developers thought of all these things and incorporated them in to their game is - by the way - awesome. Simply awesome.			"

												This is kind of a beautiful game. Basically everything that New Vegas improved on over Fallout 3 was taken from Fallout 2 (weapon mods, NPCs reacting to your SPECIAL stats in conversation). It's a post-apocalyptic setting, but that doesn't stop the southern California landscape from creating a vibrant world filled with a variety of unique cultures and creatures. The pop culture references create a light-hearted atmosphere without detracting from the wasteland experience. It's just really pretty, and almost infinitely replayable.			"

												Best. Game. Ever.Nostalgia! The feelings! I have finished the game several times, finding something new each and every playthrough when I was a kid. The best part is that when the Internet came, I have googled for a playthhrough description and still found a couple of new unknown things to do in this game, that's how thought through it is, that is how much effort have been put in it. It's a masterpeace of gaming. It's a legend! It's Fallout!Even at the time it was released, the graphics were considered a downside of this game. Half-Life was released about that time with much better 3D graphics.The lack of graphics makes this game trick your brain into turning it's imagination center on or whatever it is called. It's like a book, makes you dream while you are awake, imagine how the caracters and places would look like in real life, placing you directly into the wasteland. That is why Fallout 3 and New Vegas will never be better than this to me, they look not as I have imagined it to be as a kid.The music is on point! The sounds, the instruments used add to the atmosphere of the place. The first second you are in New Reno you understand that mobsters and gangsters rule the place. Or Gecko? In Gecko you feel the place is dead even is ghouls are walking and talking and ready to beat your ♥♥♥ after they caught you stealing. Still, the music tells you life abandoned this place long ago. To this day I can tell by heart which melody plays in which place of the map.Dialogues... Just call Enclave from teminal in Gecko and you will understand that dialogues are the heart of this game. The can be very serious and almost existential, they can be simple and super fun. Basically, 50% of the time playing this game you are sitting and reading through millions of lines of dialogue. The other half you are looting, kicking ♥♥♥, levelling up your character, buying and selling stuff, picking locks. But the majority of time you are carefully reading not to miss a clue on a quest or simply cause it is interesting.Combination of this three things made a perfect game for me. As this review starts, this is the best game ever for me and I do not think this will ever change.Still playing this from time to time. Damn this game is good.On the downside - I feel really old. Ancient. I work with people who are younger than this game, that is how ancient I am.P.S. I know that nobody will read this review. I pay my respect to this game this way.			"

												The sequel to Fallout (reviewed here if you're curious), released a year afterwards in 1998. It's bigger and more ambitious than the first game, with more quests, more items and more locations. Even the tone of the game is lighter: more 'epic quest with comedic elements' than 'save your home from doom in the dystopian wasteland', although that element is certainly still there. The wasteland is even starting to rebuild in places - a theme that New Vegas would revisit.Of course, not every writer consistently strikes gold. Fallout 2's writing contains more scattershot comedy, with less of an emphasis on your quest to save your village from starvation. Which might not hit the mark with everyone, this being a relatively hardcore niche title released in 1998 and developed by a team that was almost entirely if not 100% male. But don't despair: there's a solid game here for RPG fans nevertheless.Base gameplay is much the same as in Fallout: gaining XP to level up and allocating skill points/choosing perks, turn-based combat that uses Action Points, hex-based movement in locations, and wasteland travel between settlements - this time with an optional car!The interface and companion management is definitely improved from Fallout's. Among other things, the inventory menu isn't tedious to use, you can now trade money in sums containing five figures, and you have much greater control over your companions' battle tactics/equipment. Your companions also level up with you.Graphics are obviously the same style as Fallout, and FO2 even uses some of the first game's music. Good thing the new tracks are also excellent and evocative. You can download all of the remastered classic Fallout music here[auralnetwork.com].Much like Fallout, the patched Steam release is pretty buggy, up to and including serious bugs in main quests that can pretty much prevent you from finishing the game. I would suggest downloading killap's Unofficial Patch from his website[www.killap.net]. For those of you interested, he also made the Restoration Project mod, which adds a bunch of cut content.Fallout 2's early game is more difficult than Fallout's. The first game gave you a gun right from the beginning, and pointed you in a relatively easy direction. Fallout 2 starts with the Temple of Trials, which is an overly lengthy, somewhat implausible and definitely annoying tutorial-by-fire that is ten times more frustrating if your character isn't skilled at Melee Weapons or any of the other tested skills. If you picked any of the less-than-optimal skills, the whole game gets that much harder. Its only saving grace is that it lets you level up a few times. Most of the rest of the game afterwards is much better.After that ordeal, there are a few quests you can do in your home village before you set out, which are usually a good idea. It'll be several more XP levels and a couple of towns before you find a firearm worth anything. Your options will expand from there, although you're still kind of vulnerable until you find good armor and good weapons you're skilled with. It'll be another while yet before you can clear rooms by yourself, and even in the late game that's not always possible unless you explicitly made a character to do so.It's worth noting that there are many more high-tier weapons in each class to choose from, as opposed to Fallout where the turbo plasma rifle and gatling laser reigned supreme. True, the pulse rifle does the most damage, but now you have more options across multiple weapon skills and styles for when focusing on DPS doesn't quite cut it.Overall, it's a good game and a worthy sequel, but watch out for Lynnette.She doesn't like you.

												I had played Fallout 3 on console and when I went to college, console was no longer an option.  So I got steam and this is one of the first games I bought.  I was thinking it would be similar to Fallout 3 and clearly I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  At first, I had a bit of trouble getting into the game and the isometric perspective.  But I paid for it, so I was going to give it a shot.  After I played through a bit, I actually started enjoying it.  I found the quests and role playing elements well done and I spent a lot of time on multiple playthroughs.  The world is expansive and the choices to make are thought out.

												Best. Game. Ever.Nostalgia! The feelings! I have finished the game several times, finding something new each and every playthrough when I was a kid. The best part is that when the Internet came, I have googled for a playthhrough description and still found a couple of new unknown things to do in this game, that's how thought through it is, that is how much effort have been put in it. It's a masterpeace of gaming. It's a legend! It's Fallout!Even at the time it was released, the graphics were considered a downside of this game. Half-Life was released about that time with much better 3D graphics.The lack of graphics makes this game trick your brain into turning it's imagination center on or whatever it is called. It's like a book, makes you dream while you are awake, imagine how the caracters and places would look like in real life, placing you directly into the wasteland. That is why Fallout 3 and New Vegas will never be better than this to me, they look not as I have imagined it to be as a kid.The music is on point! The sounds, the instruments used add to the atmosphere of the place. The first second you are in New Reno you understand that mobsters and gangsters rule the place. Or Gecko? In Gecko you feel the place is dead even is ghouls are walking and talking and ready to beat your ♥♥♥ after they caught you stealing. Still, the music tells you life abandoned this place long ago. To this day I can tell by heart which melody plays in which place of the map.Dialogues... Just call Enclave from teminal in Gecko and you will understand that dialogues are the heart of this game. The can be very serious and almost existential, they can be simple and super fun. Basically, 50% of the time playing this game you are sitting and reading through millions of lines of dialogue. The other half you are looting, kicking ♥♥♥, levelling up your character, buying and selling stuff, picking locks. But the majority of time you are carefully reading not to miss a clue on a quest or simply cause it is interesting.Combination of this three things made a perfect game for me.

Superb dialouges.And by the way, Fallout 3 and New Vegas ain't even close to the greatness of this game.But – Don't buy it here on Steam.

However, despite the (nowadays) unusual combat system, Fallout 2 is one of the best RPGs every made, and is a must have for fans of both the series and RPGs in general.Also you can hit a kid's balls with a sledgehammer.420/69			"

												One of my favorite RPGs and games in general. Sequel to the first post-nuclear simulator, Fallout 2 retained the same good qualities of the first Fallout with an experience just as good. Fallout 2 doesn't change too much in comparison to its predecessor in terms of the actual gameplay mechanics, but the the improvements and more content, like improved companions and a larger game world, are a welcome that offers plenty of replay value. The charm of Fallout 2 is the change in the nature from the first. The wasteland has progressed greatly in the last 80 years since the events of Fallout, and it offers a much different atmosphere. Trees are starting to grow back again, settlements as large as cities rebuild, governments forming, civilization is getting back on its feet. And with that comes a constant struggle for power across the waste among these different factions. And throughout the game the fate of these factions depend on your actions. The world feels more alive and its a welcome change to see how the universe has progressed since the Vault Dweller walked the wasteland.Along side these changes to the atmosphere comes a much different approach to the game. It's seemingly more satirical with many pop culture references and breaking of the fourth wall. It's different from what you'd expect from Fallout but its can be humorous enough to get a chuckle out of it when you get the references.However, there is one major flaw with this game and it's the bugs; and there are a lot. What I would say is the biggest issue with the bugs are with the quest. Many of the quest in the game are heavily bugged, even to the point that it can completely block off an entirely different path to completing a quest which is rather disappointing because you'll have to settle for a lesser outcome rather than the one you desired. It's a real shame too because Black Isle Studios did some outstanding work with quest design, but the experience is held back by the nasty bugs. Despite these issues, I am still able to forgive the game for the rest of the great work put into it.In the end, it's the Fallout you've always loved but with the added joy of getting addicted to Jet, becoming a pornstar, or punching children with a mega powerfist because they thought it was a good idea to steal from the Chosen One. And then later you'll be labeled as 'Child Killer'.			"

												The sequel to the classic Fallout, not only does this contain many improvements over the original, but it also contains great gameplay and writing that is just no doubt better than most AAA RPGs of today. This game is the sole reason so many Fallout fans hate Bethesda. They ruined the franchise with the removal of a lot of great, classic RPG elements, a complete overhaul (for the worse) of the game's style and hiring the most boring people you could ever know as writers. This is a very old-school game and it screams nostalgia. A real blast to the past. This was also the big breakthrough for LGBT equality in video games. You can be gay in this game. Also, it was the first game to feature gay marriage, which was illegal in US back in 1998. This whole package, as well as Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale, all of it just makes me miss Black Isle. 9/10.			"

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. It is very old but that does not take away anything from it. The begining of the game is extreamly bad. The first temple will make you want to stop playign but after that its amazing. As you progress in the story you go to different cites with 10 or so different side quests. And they are very interesting. One is about a ghost where you help her find peace. Another is where you go to a bar on one side of town where drinks are twice as much as a bar on the other side of town and you can do a quest where you go snooping around looking for the reason those drinks are so low. In the begining of the game you won't have much and combat can be a little difficult since in fast travel it brings you to a map where you click around in the direction the NPC's told you the next city is which is very unique and interesting. Although sometimes you will run into a group of bandits ir wild animals trying to kill you and since there are edges of the land that you are on you can just run away very easily. Over all this is a great game.			"

												Fallout 2: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game is a role-playing open world game featuring a considerably larger map/world and a far more extensive storyline, than those of Fallout 1. It is hands down one of the best games I've ever played (and that says a lot about it). The fact that the game was made in 1998 makes it even more impressive.Fallout 2 centres around the protagonist a.k.a. 'The Chosen One' and is entasked with the duty by the elder of his village to find and retrieve the Garden Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.) which is a device that can create thriving communities out of the post-apocalyptic wasteland.The game comprises of exploring and travelling in the open world as well as speech and quests to various characters and NPC. In addition to the role playing elements, a unique turn-based shooter is used during combat. This incredible blend  makes the game so widely stimulating and intense. It is an experience unlike one other. Not to mention the storyline is as engaging as it is compelling.The player's actions throughout the game dictate what future story or gameplay opportunities are available. A player can choose to inhibit/aid certain NPCs and affects the entire gameplay. Aside from combat, speech also plays a huge role in the final outcome of the game. Before the game begins, the player is allowed to create his/her character with a variety of different skill, perk, trait and character point (S.P.E.C.I.A.L) builds. Because of the extensive outcome and scenarios, Fallout 2 is a game with incredibly high replay value.There is not much else to say, this game is IN-F***ING-CREDIBLE!GET IT (if you haven't already)6*/5 - 110% would recommend			"

												A true gem of rpg genre. Timeless classic which never becomes boring and, surprisingly enough, outdated.When I bought my first pc long time ago F2 was one the first games I installed and since that time it's still one of my favorite. And I'm still have that old cd full of old scratches.Rich world with charismatic characters, wide variety of story-impacting decisions, post-nuclear atmosphere, turn-based combat and just fun. Where else can your character become a pornstar (no videos sadly, just your own imagination), find a Holy Hand Grenade, been referred as a ""walking refrigerator"" and feel yourself as a skilfull diplomat even your character was under performance-enhancing drugs and had a huge heavily-armed supermutant at the back looking curiously at slightly shy local inhabitants? And you can't put a price tag on that unforgettable feeling when your Chosen One receives Expert Excrement Expeditor perk.And there was real supermutants before Bethesda made a typical orcs out of them.If you've ever been curious about the games which made significant contribution to the evolution of rpg genre you just must to try this masterpiece.PS. And don't forget to download high resolution patch.			"

												A post-apocalyptic turn-based RPG like no other.This game is a classic. I've put in hundreds of hours in it playing different ways with different characters before I added it to my steam library (I own the discs for 1 and 2). The game has a good mix of stat/skill building and loot collection. For its time, the cutscenes are pretty good. There's little to be desired in such a classic game.The ability to choose your path in this game is beyond astounding for such an old game. If you remember when Fable came out, people freaked out because you could choose your own path. Fallout has done that stuff way before such games. If you like to be a jerk or a good guy, you can do either to your hearts content.Fallout has some of the most memorable designs and lore of any post-apocalyptic setting I've seen, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good turn-based, isometric RPG romp.Easily a 10/10 game. As good in my childhood as it is in my adulthood, a timeless classic.			"

												<3 <3 <3This is my all-time favorite game. Why? ...That's hard to pinpoint. The open world? Only the vaugest hint of linearity? The shenanigans? The trouble-making? The snark. The sardonic, grim humor of a post-apocolyptic world inhabited by humans (tribal and ""civilized""), ghouls, mutants, and more.If you wondered about ~any~ of the backstory in F:NV, Fallout 1 and 2 will fill in the gaps. Fallout: New Vegas is the direct sequel to Fallout 2; Fallout 3 is what happens when a company aquires an IP with a rich internal history and says, Eh, let's move everything across the country because who wants to play in -that- world anymore? Me, that's who. This is the 3rd copy I've owned (because I'm terrible at keeping track of install CDs), and now I have it forever (or, at least as long as Steam servers are up).Whole-hearted recommendation to any RPG fan, any turn-based combat fan, or ~anyone~ with a dark sense of humor.

												One of the few games I recommend without hesitation.  Fallout 3 (a.k.a.: Oblivion 2) is total garbage, which completely lacks the mechanical equality, spirit, aesthetics and depth of its predecessors.  Fallout 3 is an open-world FPS that lacks the integral granularity to exist a an RPG, yet passes itself off as one as effectively as Steve Buscemi in drag.The REAL Fallout series represents an almost unparallelled RPG system in its complexity, balance and replayability.  Fallout is, without hyperbole, also one of the most influential games in history; it literally is the foundation for much of the modern PC (and PnP) RPG paradigm.Out of all the hundreds of RPGs I've played, Fallout 1&2 are still unquestionably in my top 5.

												Fallout 2 is a classic, a legend that stands amongst legends. The equal of every great CPRG that came before it, and superior to most that came after it, this game has aged gracefully and still holds the charm it did when I first booted it up nearly 2 decades ago as a younger lad.You play as the Chosen One, a villager from a dying tribe who is sent on a hail Mary quest to recover an ancient device rumored to return dead wasteland to verdant fields: the Garden of Eden Creation Kit, or G.E.C.K. for short. This is not a new plot device, it is not terribly original to be the only man or woman in the world capable of saving your people. However, the execution of this quest is what sets Fallout 2 apart from even it's own successors. You are given almost complete freedom to be anyone you want in this world. You can be a sociopathic killer, an opportunistic slaver, a drug-addled genius, or a savior to the common man and the tread upon. Your character, and how you are reacted to and perceived is entirely based on your choices. An interaction I recall from my very first playthrough many years ago had someone asking my sarcastic little thief of a character what being a tribesman was all about, and did we eat our dead like he'd heard? My answer was thus: ""Of course, how else would I grok their essence? Just sauté what you want to eat in a light garlic sauce. Delicious.""As a top-down, or isometric, turn-based game, this is slower than most modern games. There's next to no handholding, as the game will frequently murder you for taking on fights you couldn't handle, or frankly just for fun. RNG is a large factor here. However, the gameplay holds as true now as it did then. Plot your moves, mind your enemies, and bask in the glory of every hard-won battle. Of course, for every victory there can be defeat, and you should be prepared for it if you've not played a game of this type before.While dated by anyone's standards, the graphics serve their purpose with charm and readability; and more importantly it supports modern monitors, no patching required. There is a fan-made patch you can use that many will recommend, but I haven't tried it. Haven't felt I needed it.This game is my go-to. I've owned probably 5 or 6 copies of it over the years, and whenever I find myself somewhere where Internet is scarce and my battery is a consideration, it never fails me. If you are in the mood for old-school role-playing magic, you've found it.			"

												Tags : Isometric RPG - Post Apocalyptic*HALL OF FAME* *ALL TIME FAVORITES*On July 15, 2016 a Bethesda backed translation of a Czech mod for Fallout 2 called Fallout 1.5 has surfaced on the internet. I hear from articles in the news that it is the same size as fallout 1, feature the grittier tone of fallout 1, but has a ton of quests in it. We need to somehow petition steam to put this on the store as a steam mod for Fallout 2!!!No mutants allowed has a fair amount of downloadable locations for fallout 2 - and some mods aggregate a ton of other mods and some bugfixes into them. I am not sure how much of this has been made redundant with the remastered editions of the fallout trilogy to work on older systems but it is definitely worth checking out before you start a playthrough. You can get more locations, more quests, and some new items. Otherwise this is the same awesome kind of content as fallout 1, the main difference being that you can no longer fail the main arc by making the wrong choice or dicking around too long anymore. A feature that used to be present if heavily relaxed in v1.0 but that was just taken out altogether through patching. There are a ton more pop culture references and jokes here and some people might miss the grittier fallout 1 style of handling things. The brand new campaign is longer, NPC control has been improved, skills have been slightly reworked, and the level cap pushed all the way to 99. Individually those differences dont seem like much but they add a lot of longevity to the title, and I end up spending a lot more times in fallout 2 just cruising around the wasteland fighting ennemies. If you intend to take this game very slow and max out your characters and have a semi-permanent game going then I suggest you download a mod that allows you to change the game over message timer. Indeed, because of a coding limitation back when the game was made, there is a definite amount of time you can spend in game before it abruptly ends on you and tells you the game is over, you will in essence, have reached the very last calendar day allowed by coding, which in game time is 13 years. Modders have found a way around this however and you can make this message appear straight as you leave arroyo or 50 years later in game time, meaning you could in theory roleplay the entire life of a character from age 19 to 60. Which is kind of awesome. At some point all you will have left to do is grind the wasteland so I suggest if you go for that route that you leave yourself some main quests going, no mutant allowed total mods can really help here by adding quests.Anyways enough ramblingMasterpiece			"

												F2 is classic. A great tactical game, an awesome book, a movie that is played in your mind. The adventure that you don't want to miss. Today is September 30, 2013, and the game was released September 30, 1998. 15 years is a huge age gap, so if you play it for the first time now, it may take some time to love it, but you will never regret. You must play this sh.it before you die.Two best games I've ever seen are: «Deus Ex» & «Fallout 2». Enough said.100 out of 100.			"

												17 years later and it outclasses half the RPGs since. Easily outstrips Fallout 3. Lots of content, cool areas and characters, nearly infinite replay value. If you think it's aged poorly, I played this first in 2010 or so after Fallout 3 and loved it way more. Buy buy buy.			"

												Tags : Isometric RPG - Post Apocalyptic*HALL OF FAME* *ALL TIME FAVORITES*On July 15, 2016 a Bethesda backed translation of a Czech mod for Fallout 2 called Fallout 1.5 has surfaced on the internet. I hear from articles in the news that it is the same size as fallout 1, feature the grittier tone of fallout 1, but has a ton of quests in it. We need to somehow petition steam to put this on the store as a steam mod for Fallout 2!!!No mutants allowed has a fair amount of downloadable locations for fallout 2 - and some mods aggregate a ton of other mods and some bugfixes into them. I am not sure how much of this has been made redundant with the remastered editions of the fallout trilogy to work on older systems but it is definitely worth checking out before you start a playthrough. You can get more locations, more quests, and some new items. Otherwise this is the same awesome kind of content as fallout 1, the main difference being that you can no longer fail the main arc by making the wrong choice or dicking around too long anymore. A feature that used to be present if heavily relaxed in v1.0 but that was just taken out altogether through patching. There are a ton more pop culture references and jokes here and some people might miss the grittier fallout 1 style of handling things. The brand new campaign is longer, NPC control has been improved, skills have been slightly reworked, and the level cap pushed all the way to 99. Individually those differences dont seem like much but they add a lot of longevity to the title, and I end up spending a lot more times in fallout 2 just cruising around the wasteland fighting ennemies. If you intend to take this game very slow and max out your characters and have a semi-permanent game going then I suggest you download a mod that allows you to change the game over message timer. Indeed, because of a coding limitation back when the game was made, there is a definite amount of time you can spend in game before it abruptly ends on you and tells you the game is over, you will in essence, have reached the very last calendar day allowed by coding, which in game time is 13 years.

												One of my all-time favorite video games. The writing is intricate and well-done; the environments, characters and enemies are all fitting and often-times funny and endearing. You get a real sense of adventure - venturing out into the wasteland with a underwhelming aresenal of weapons and supplies, a posse of weaklings and a steamlined roll of the dice in a nuclear wasteland. For me, it can't be beat. Perfect 10.			"

												I'm going to be honest, I despised this game when I first played it. My attacks weren't doing ♥♥♥♥, I was extremely confused on what to do, and hated how it felt. That was months ago, until recently. I sat down, read some tips and tricks and gave this game a shot. Now I've 70 hours in this game. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ blast.Pros:-Interesting and well-developed plot: The more I got in, the more I wanted to see what was going on. The stroy hooked really hooked me in.-Interesting locations: Many locations you visit always have some backstory around them and I gotta say, almost all of them are interesting and awesome to visit like the casino of New Reno with mobsters hanging around running the place or even  Navarro which let's you infiltrate the enclave base as a recruit. -Choices Galore: There are many choices to make in californian wasteland and many I never even knew about until my second playthrough. There's so much you could miss on one playthrough that it makes me want to do another just to see what the other way could have been.-Dialogue and Writing: This game has the best writing in any fallout game hands down. There are many humerous moments that we come to love in fallout, but it knows when to be dark and disturbing. You'll want to talk to everyone just to see what they're gonna say. (Low intelligence runs are the funniest ♥♥♥♥ ever)-Combat: This is a hit and miss for some. For me, it's a hit. When you sit down and understand what to do, the combat goes from something you may despise to something you won't mind at all.Cons:-Confusion: This game can be pretty confusing at times. Don't be afraid to pull up a walkthrough to help you out because while some quests are easy to do especially if you actually read what they want you to do, there are other quests where I just questioned Wtf am I supposed to do. Then when I do figure it out, I just think how tf was I supposed to know that. -Useless perks: There are some perks in this game that I took on my first playthrough that I thought would be good, only later to find out how useless they are and pretty much ruin my run. Traps and Gambling are prime examples of perks that you're rarely ever use most of the time. Watch out what you pick. You could really bone your run if you choose booty perks.Conclusion: This game may not be for everyone, but I urge you, stick with it. This is a kind of game I don't think we'll ever see today again. It's got laughs, it's got amazing writing, decent combat, some actual balls compared to newer fallouts (like being able to kill children and some of the subject matter) and it's just so damn interesting. Consider me a fallout 2 fan. This game rises as the best fallout game IMO.PS: Get the restoration project mod too! It adds cut content back into the game that makes the journey even cooler. (Just be sure to follow a guide for that too if you get stuck) :)			"

												Fun and rewarding game but with a few problems.*It's really easy to gimp your character from the start because so many traits and perks are just useless.*You will be spending your first 5-6 hours killing rats because there are to few early-game quests to get you started. The game does get a whole lot easier once you get a mid-game weapon though.*The game has some glitches and slowdowns that can ♥♥♥♥ you over if you don't have backup saves. (There are fan patches that fix these though)*Energy weapons, First aid, Doctor Melee weapons and Traps are Throwaway skills in my opinion. Not worth leveling.*♥♥♥♥ you Lynette nobody likes you!With that said, the rest of the game is prima salami, go buy it.			"

												Now alot of people like Fallout, But What about the classics for new comers? Well Fallout 1 Was good But it was small. Where Fallout 1 Is small. Fallout 2 is Larger. Even if content was cut due to time constraints the community have mods that Re-Add that content, Fix it, Add quests, And make it as if it was actually in the game. Fallout 2 Gets easily a 9/10. A Great Must have game for Fallout fans waiting for Fallout 4. And this will take a while to finish aswell as Fallout 1 Even though its short Fallout 1 is fun. Even to this day the master will freak people the living hell out of them. I even saw a drawing of him and i got spooked. The game isnt that buggy except for the exploitive ones. And Bethesda made a HD Patch that really didnt do much. Great game that i would reccomend.			"

												Well this game is great.  I played this for much longer than Fallout 1 and there is reason for that.  This game has so much more content than the first.  There are many more quests and many more places to explore and visit.  This game is turning into one of my favorites because of everything the game is.  The guns are amazing to and all different.  What took the cake for this game was the dialouge and story.  The story far exeeds the first in depth and feel.  You feel like such a badass after the ending and feel satisfied.  The game is a memorable one for good reason.  What I didn't like about the game is that I wished that the Enclave were a better enemy faction.  I wish there were more to them so I can hate them more.  They did do things that were terrible to me but I didn't feel like they did much.  I guess that is the downside to isometric story driven games.  It is a great game and worth a buy.			"

The sequel to Fallout (1997); this game takes place 8 years after the first game following the same protagonist.

The game mechanics are the same like the first game, but with NPC improvements.
This storyline is set for you to save a village and explore new areas.

If you liked the original Fallout game you'll still enjoy this one.

I have many fond memories of this game, it is one of my all time favorites and even after all these years, after all the hours and hours and hours I have put into the game across several different computers; I can still play it shamelessly for hours and never get bored. Its like a great film that you never tire of. I bought Fallout 2 back in '99, as a teen and could not stop playing it. I ended up becoming so engrossed in the game, that I took to the internet and found myself at the No Mutants Allowed forums where I started a long running RP called Fallout: Systematic Annihilation (My name was TRAG on those boards.) The RP was a little hit on the website, and we had quite a few fans that read it regularly and even joined in the fun. But, I didn't stop there- Chris Avellone started releasing a little document called- The Fallout Bible. I was pulled in yet again. I have read that Bible more than once- I even have a digital copy on my cell phone for my reading pleasure. Yeah, this game started an obsession. Thankfully, it never got bad enough to where restraining orders were necessary (This is a joke of course, but there are those out there that have gone that far). So, you have read how this game has touched my life, and inspired my imagination. Now, you are probably wondering- where is the review!?! Fallout 2 is an isometric post apocalyptic role playing game with turn-based combat. That being said, this is not just any isometric RPG, this is one of the most well written, deep, open world rpgs ever crafted. Your choices here carry real weight within the world- Want to be a Slaver? A rough, hard living slave catcher/seller. All you have to do is get a tattoo on your forehead that the world can see and you can be one. The only problem is that people really do see it and their reactions to you will reflect that. Needless to say, Slavers aren't exactly welcome in many places in the wasteland. You may wish to rethink that life choice. But, this game is not just about career choice, this is a game with a deep strategic combat system that will challenge even the most hardened RPG gamer. The game does not hold your hand and more than likely you will die a lot. Saving often is the best tool in your arsenal, and you will be relieved when you can reload your game only a few moments before you told that Super Mutant and his pals to shove it up his you know what, and instead he shoved it up yours...Lets move on.This is a CRPG in every sense of the word, so if you get the feel that there is a feeling that you could be playing this on a table with some friends and a cashe of multicolored dice, you probably could. In fact- There is a Pen and Paper version of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system (the rules system the game is powered by.) on the internet and you can find it at No Mutants Allowed (the most well known Fallout fan site, find them here http://www.nma-fallout.com/ .) There is so much that I can say about this game, but I won't, because I believe that you owe it to yourself to see it with your own eyes.Fallout 2 is considered one of the greatest RPGs of all time for a reason: It lives up to the previous statement. It really is one of the greatest RPGs of all time. The writing is top notch, the sheer amount of choice and freedom. The methodical and satisfying development of your main character from an upstart, inexperienced tribal into a wasteland killing machine who is feared throughout the region, or a hero reveared by the struggling wasteland people. The choice is yours and your actions and decisions will determine the man/woman you become in this harsh and unforgiving post apocalyptic wasteland. You will need all the help you can get, and companions are there to meet and join your quest to restore your village and save its inhabitants from starvation, disease, and destruction.This game is so detailed for its time, that even today I am finding things I have never seen in the game before; and I have been playing it since 1999, a year after it was released! If that doesn't give you an idea of the replayability factor I don't know what will. If you purchase this game, you will come back to it year after year. And if you are a fan of pen and paper RPGS, CRPGS, or old school RPGs, then Fallout 2 is a godsend. Bigger and crazier than its predecessor Fallout (Which itself is an AMAZING game.) Fallout 2 takes you to the future that everyone hopes will never happen and lets you either wallow in it, or conquor it. I HIGHLY recommend this game for any RPG fan. It will ensnare you, it will inspire you!!			"

												I can't believe I haven't got round to writing a review for this game already!Fallout is a role playing game with an excellent story run throughout the series. This game is one of the best games I have ever played and it is a game that you can simply play through time and time again not only due to a wide range of choices but a story that you will want to hear again and again, admittedly the controls up until fallout 3 have been a bit primative and lack luster but they work if you're willing to give them a prod and experiment. Fallout 2 is an excellent addition to this series but the game either is for you or is not and with the excessive amount of bugs, primative style of controls and lacking graphics compared to todays top RPG's such as The elder scrolls I would only really reccomend this game is you really enjoyed fallout 3 and New vegas and would like to explore the story of fallout further; if you are one of those people who can't get enough of the fallout series this game is 100% for you, you will not be disappointed because the original games are just as good if not better than the recent ones except more primative.

												Fallout 2 is one of the best games ever created.It's a trun-based post apocalyptic rpg with an isometric view. You can create your own character by allowing stats (strengh increases melee damage aswell as carrying capacity, intellect determines how much skill points you get to spend when levelling up, etc ... ) You start as a native of a tribe from the north-west of the former USA now called the Wasteland and you're send out to find the fabled G.E.C.K. (Garden of Eden Creation Kit) to save your village.Great story, Great game. Hands down the best fallout game with fallout: new vegasThere is an unofficial patch that solves tons of bug and restores some of the cut content on the webThere is also a High Rez patch that enables you to play the game at today's screen resolutions on the web "

												Aunque creas que Fallout 2 es un vejestorio no debes  subestimarle. Este titan ha soportado el paso del tiempo manteniendo sus 20 horas de durancion intocables a la vez de su  combate y atmosfera  que permanecen exquisitamente similar a su dia de estreno.  Por algo lo consideran uno de los mejores RPG Western de todos los tiempos.			"

												TL;DR: This game is FANTASTIC! But DON'T buy it from Steam. Get it from gog or somewhere else where you can find a older version.Longer version:If you were thinking about buying this game DON'T. This game was great before the update but they ♥♥♥♥ed it up and made the game worse.How?Before, I had about 30 saves of different characters. Now? Gone. No warning, nothing. All that progress is ♥♥♥♥ed. You can now only have ONE ♥♥♥♥ING TAB to save in which is about 10 slots. They also made the travelling system be slower so you're more likely to run into more deathclaws and die in one hit. Also, of course this breaks any type of mod (the fallout 2 restoration pack which was almost mandatory to play the game properly has now been broken by this update including all of my saves are broken/corrupt). I have no idea what the person who patched this game recently was thinking.  They've effectively just destroyed older players who got it before the update and made it tougher for newer players who don't know what they're doing.			"

												Bizarre is a word that comes to mind when playing Fallout 2. Its a world both serious and very silly at the same time. The main quest is serious but the whole game is full of pop culture references and silly scenes, sex and drugs run rampant and it feel like almost everyone is a sneeze away from wanting to kill you.  I know this game is treated like a religion so people are going to hate me but I'm being honest despite the fact how someone can downvote this game while ignoring all peer pressure and being honest lol. I Installed a restoration patch which added many things although I was there mainly for bug fixes. My strange story included giving children an orphanage to get them off the streets, sleeping with a mob leaders wife while dealing with mobster wars in an even more lawless city, getting someones spleen back which he lost in a bet, moving a plant to another garden so he could teach me how to beat a Radscorpion at chess and many many more but mostly just shooting annoying obnoxious people in the face. The combat is pretty much the same as Fallout 1 and for me that is no bad thing with a few new weapons added andthe gory deaths are still here. I encountered many things in the world map such as knights looking for a holy hand grenade then right after meeting them again getting killed by a small rat despite their power armor, Darth Vadar and friends standing around chatting while Han Solo told me something there no match for a good blaster so gave me a blaster, a crashed ship with dead red shirts, a dead whale in the middle of the desert and a man guarding a bridge asking familiar questions, the Cafe of Broken Dreams and many more which you will probably recognise. Amongst the things I didn't like is Fallout 2 has many quests but alot of them are not obvious and this game needs a guide/walkthough more than most as many are at least semi hidden and even when you get them there is no reminder in your log where you had to go/do what. Such things will effect new players more and it can be and get very confusing especially amongst its bloated game world. The same with items, there is no description how things work and what they do such as drugs and medical items and which items are just vendor trash. Once again this effects new players more because once you know you remember but there is no harm with an ingame description but I do understand games were different when this was made. With NPC's too Its so easy to say '' the wrong thing '' which more so than Fallout 1 can suddenly turn even whole towns hostile and likely result in a last save game reload. Skill checks are still here but like Fallout 1 they are '' invisible '' so you may not know when you are using them. This game is also difficult , more so than Fallout 1 and companions are almost as annoying. Comparing to the later fallout games is hard because like the Fallout 1 they are so different especially the obvious Isometric vs First Person game worlds. Having said that Fallout 2 does feel very different to Fallout 1 in many ways too. I noticed when watching Bethesda's '' making of Fallout 3 video '' they would reference Fallout 1 but not Fallout 2 so I guess they had that more in mind. Overall I can see why people like this game and while I like easter eggs and the occasional joke this game takes things beyond silly so much which felt too distracting. Also I cannot be like one of those people who are like '' wow you can bea porn star 10/10 game'' . I spent along time experiencing what this game offers which I don't regret but honestly I prefer Fallout 1 as The story , atmosphere and locations feel more consistent and the lol sillyness is not everywhere you go. I did prefer certain things in Fallout 2 such as better inventory management, the car for faster transport (which is needed in this bigger map) and you can store items in and unlike Fallout 4 the characters are not making excuses to explain indepth or technical things for you. Not a terrible game if you can get over the archaic game design. Still try it for yourself you may like it like many others seem to and you can get it quite cheap these days in sales.			"

												It was going well with this game at first. It's the typical story, you know? Girl meets game, game and girl fall in love, girl meets another game, game gets jealous...It was like, there was nothing to be jealous of, you know? I liked both games just the same, for different reasons, and I wasn't gonna forget about this game! But this game just didn't understand.We fought, we argued, and neither of us could remember what it was like to be in love with each other any more.And that's such a sad feeling- it's bad enough to fall out of love, but I'd say it's even worse to forget what love felt like in the first place. We said we'd still speak after the break up, but we lost contact.I guess I'd still recommend the game, but I have to warn you, if your relationship with the game hits a roadblock...You might fall out.

												Black Isle at their finest.  Game is older than many gamers.  Reviewed ad nauseum, I will take this opportunity to impart an anecdote.I am currently playing thru this game.  I was getting annoyed at the engine.  Even 17 years ago, the hidden behind walls thing was mad annoying.  I have 1 full playthru, and many partials over that time, the last substantial one I stopped at New Reno.  That was 10 years ago.  I was in a town where there is an important NPC (skeeter) in a building that you can't see inside unless you run behind it.  The doors are on the hidden backside.  I knew as I played before, but was a little frustrated.  I was muttering about how Pillars better have screen rotation.  Then I randomly talked to an npc behind this building a bit.  This one was in view.  I asked about the other guy who is hidden a few steps away, and the NPC says ""he's standing right there.  Use your eyes.""  Those guys at Black Isle knew full well how frustrating not being able to see an npc standing 10 feet away right in front of you due to an immobile painted background, and put those lines in there.  I bet whoever wrote that bit snickered like I did.  I never read those lines before, in probably 100 hours of varied gameplay.  The nuance and subtlety is what is so great about this game.  The way characters are written, the storylines, and unsanitary reality of what harsh life does to mankind.  The good do indeed die young as even the good ones have some bad in this world.			"

												At this time writing this review I have only played about 85 minutes of the game but it took just that short of time to see how good of a game it is. At first I was skeptical because of the age of the game, but honestly that shouldn't be the deterance for this game. It's your top down, somewhat turned based, game but it's more than that. The game unlocks so much creativity to solving things outside of combat! Using your brain has never been more fun! Literally...Play this if:1. You are a big Fallout fan2. Enjoy ""puzzles"" (couldn't think of another word)3. Don't mind turned based combat (real time movement isn't turned based, only when initiating combat)			"

												This is the Fallout franchise at its peak.  Taking the open world of a post-apocalyptic wasteland of the original and making it 10+ times bigger but keeping the charm of almost every location that you visit.  Every location is detailed and contains a bevy of unique and interesting characters.  This was in the era of audio dialogue and coupled with the computer generated faces of a range of notable characters from the story made this game very engulfing (except Myron, ♥♥♥♥ THAT GUY).  Add to that a list of amazing voice actors that fit their roles like a glove.  Before we got the idiotic Karma system of Fallout 3 (who is thinking of 'karma' in a dog-eat-dog wasteland?), we had the awesome system of reputation for each location (this was the influence for the faction rep in New Vegas) and it worked wonderfully.

												Simply put Fallout 2 is a masterpiece. It improves upon Fallout 1 in virtually every way and it allows for such creative roleplaying and variety that I am still impressed that few games have surpassed this. You might want to be a slaver one playthrough and a pornstar the next who is also a champion boxer. What more do you want? Well if you want good companions you're in luck because Fallout 2 has the best companions in the whole series and they're not even comparable to the cardboard cutouts in Fallout 1.Superficially this looks just like Fallout 1 but more (the same opinion people had for New Vegas compared to 3) but the more you play it the more you realise it stands out as a wonderful game in its own right, not just as a sequel to another amazing CRPG.I'll admit that out of the 3 amazing Fallouts (1, 2 and New Vegas) this has my least favourite main quest and the final showdown is only a fraction as good as the confrontation with the Master. But despite all that Fallout 2 is an amazing game with few faults.			"

												To be frank, I really enjoyed the game. I started playing it way after it was released, so this isn't a nostalgia trip for me or anything, this was from pure interest in the genre and what I've heard about it. I was not disappointed.This game is packed with content. There's lots of quests, characters, weapons, locations, and items. There's almost always 2 or 3 ways to resolve a conflict and the straightest path isn't always the best one. Most of your choices do have some sort of consequence. The combat can be pretty challenging, but can also be like super easy if you have the right build, it's not particularly well balanced. The visuals, well, they kind of hit the spot for what the game is portraying. Dark, dull, forboding, if not boring landscapes. I mean, you're in the middle of the desert, it's not that interesting. The humor is pretty cool, and I must have laughed a few times at either something happening or when a character said something funny. The story is pretty interesting overall, having you start as one of the previous PC's (from Fallout) decendants in a tribal community to helping out (or hurting) towns or refugees to disabling (or enabling) nukes.I think that anyone who can deal with turn-based rpgs should play this. It's pretty awesome. Even if you haven't played turn-based rpgs or maybe have had bad experiences with them, you should like this. But stay away if you can only handle fps style gameplay, this isn't for you.The steam version does work with all of the mods out there btw, I've not run into any issues regarding that stuff.10/10Would die in the first battle again.

As you can already see, this is not anything like Fallout 3, New Vegas, or 4. This is an entirely new game along the same story line, and if you enjoyed the Wasteland series, this is definitely the game for you. It utilizes seriously outdated graphics and controls are iffy, and support with higher-end PCs is minimal. However, it's still possible to play with a few adjustments and soon you'll be leaping through Navarro and experiencing so many pop culture references from the late 90s, your head will spin. In other words, this is a very nice game with a bit of a learning curve at first, but quickly gets easier and doesn't contain the short timelimit Fallout 1 did. This time, the timelimit is about 13 in-game years, which, even if you explore every inch of the map, do every sidequest, and find every special encounter, you should only be about 2-3 years in, allowing for lots of fun leveling afterwards.

												(Note: Bought this game elsewhere, but wanted a digital version)The sequal to the fantastic Fallout game, you know you are in good hands. This game is set years after the first where you play as a decendent of the Vault Dweller who has been tasked to go out and find the vault for it may contain a G.E.C.K (Garden of Eden Creation Kit) which could save your people as many are sick and dying as are there Brahman. You start by proving your worth by entering the temple of the vault dweller and retriving the vault 13 suit left by your ancestor before heading out for the elusive Vault 13.This game is far better than the previous by doing away with the timer that was in the first one, however the start does involve you running into giant ants and lesser radscorpions in the temple and being armed with only a spear so if you focus on gunpower, there's a good chance you might die or be unable to get through the temple. This game also has the introduction to power gloves if you wish to make a mellee focused character where no previous such weapon exsisted in the first and you were stuck otherwise. There is more adult subject matter as you get to sleep with numerous women (or men depending on sex or your choice) with only a brief description which is somehow more graphic than the Bethesda attempt (dissapointing since the game is a 18, you'd think you'd be treated as a adult) but that's a different discussion for something else.For those who have played Fallout 3, this game is where the Enclave first appeared and in this you run into references to the previous game (appearance of Harold, a discovery of a horde of water chips and a Super mutant who is worried about getting a woman pregnant) as well as an evolution in the society where no longer do people collect bottle caps, but crudly made discs called Dollars.  Ghouls and Super Mutants are no longer a big enemy as they have been trying to intergrate with society (except for Vault City which is Xenophobic) and even gain a Super Mutant as a companion as well as many other interesting and even hidden companions.Well worth if you enjoyed the first game and a lot of fun if you like RPGs in general. You don't need to have played the first one as you can always ask questions about why the world is the way it is and the story has a totally different enemy than the last one. You also have multiple possible endings when you complete the game like the previous one and get to see how Shady Sands has evolved into the infamous NCR.			"

												Better than Fallout 1, I can rate this one up because even though it still has the exact same game breakling bugs it has a slightly higher replay value. Still can get dull at times but the companions are far more lively and customizable and the story is simply better than the first one, not going to lie. Anyways, it's good to see that they learned from their mistakes the first time, some modern devs can learn from this.			"

												Good, wholesome fun that the whole (nuclear) family can enjoy. Beware Parents, this game does have the occasional glimpse of cartoon violence, but nothing too scarring for a child. 2 Thumbs Up/5			"

												Purse survival and a overall better experince than Fallout 3, when you get over the downgraded graphics for its time and the technology, youll have a hell of a time. You can be a porn start for frig sake!			"
