												If we look at Verdun in the standards of modern gaming, it fails miserably.  Compared to triple A games and large developers, Verdun and it's developers fails in almost every aspect of game making.  No first day DLC save final updates. No microtransactions. No ""pay to win"" mentality. No unrealistic twitch shooting. No dodgy business practices.No massive failures on day one. No insane advantage for high level gamers. No false advertising. By today's standards, verdun would fail on the table of EA, Bethesda, CA, SEGA, Nintendo, and just about every single gaming company that is larger than, say, CD Projekt Red.  These failures, however, make this game the best FPS on the market as of now. These indie developers have crafted the most satisfying experience I have had in a first person shooter in a long damned time.  The game is perfectly digestable, the upgrades system is easy to get, the weapons are balanced and look and handle fantastically... The list of amazing acheivements this game has accomplished could go on for pages of writing.  Verdun created it's own version of FPS gameplay, taking us to an era most companies find dull and drab.  The trench warfare turn based attack gameplay is insane, as you see first hand the horrors of the First World War, which, by the way, is now 100 years past.  I bought this game in eraly access and was satisfied with it.  Now I can't get enough of it!I have been fed up with large companies coming out with garbage and selling DLC every five minutes.  Verdun's updates and new squards are being released free of charge over the next while, so this game will become even better and more varied than it is now.  Verdun is one of a special kind of game, one that requires teamwork to dominate the map.  While battlefield has become zany and unrealistic, Verdun forces you to play as a team, and unlike in battlefield, if you fail to do so, you will die again, and again, and again. I cannot recommend this game more to anyone.  The learning curb is massive, but you have so many classes to play as that are open to even the newest players.  Honestly there is something satisfying about having to use bolt action rifles in a trench that is captivating in and of itself.  It is insanly addicitive and the squad based gameplay is incredible.  Verdun is by far the best FPS I have ever played as I have put in so many hours of my life into it (roughly 10 hours alone in hte last few weeks).  I cannot recommend this game any more. SO GO BUY IT.And as for some advice, keep your head down.  This isn't Call of Duty.			"

												I'm crawling down in the mud among the dead men. We all signed for this, some of them added a year to their age to go here, to reach this hell. The bomb struck few meters away from me. Tinnitus in my left air. All I can hear is buzzing noise that drives me nuts. Our attack didn't succeed. Now we're defending this point desperately and I can hear enemy... I can FEEL enemy getting closer. Too afraid to raise my head, to afraid to take a look. I keep my head low. It might save my life. I've seen it before. Head goes above the sandbag line... Splattered brain showers the muddy trench. I can't move. My NCO told me to stay here. Moving away, progressing or backing up would mean I'm a deserter. And we all knew what happens to those poor souls.I see a sizzling bomb dropping a few meters away and suddenly, the trench is filled with thick green smoke. Mustard. Senfgas, as Germans call it. I feel like a trapped mouse. Panic takes control over my body. My hands are struggling to protect my face with a gas mask. I... I did it. I've started running away mindlessly from the deafening noise of shots.I feel the enemy getting clos...Bayonet strikes my chest and pierces skin, muscles and bones. The pointy, rusty blade exits through my back. I taste blood on my tongue. Thundering noise in my head, I raise it to see the eyes of my killer. He has the same eyes, just like me, hidden behind the gas mask, just like mine. He... he's me, the same frightened boy who will think of his mother the way I'm thinking about mine right now... maybe a bit later. Maybe tomorrow. Who knows... He's just been a bit more lucky than me at this moment. I can sense his misery and fear while he pulls the steel out and pushes me away. As I fall down, I see him going away. Leaving my body to be swallowed by everlasting darkness...This is Verdun.---If you like this review, feel free to join me for some more recommendations at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/libereviews "

								Fantastic game that really captures the WW1 Essence.The only thing that i think the game is missing is the ""ANZACS"" You need to add a Gallipoli map and Re-capture that horrific battle between the Anzacs and the Ottomons if you guys could create such a thing your Australian and New Zealand Community would be very thankful. Adding these Factions and maps would really thrive and push this game further then it already is. Anyway please take this theory in and if there are any Aussies or Kiwi's reading this please back me up on this idea we all know you want this just as much as i do :)			"

												I feel that after two years of playing this game both on browser and on Steam that I'm qualified to write a semi-intelligent review on this game. Verdun. A truly one-of-a-kind experience that blends the familiarity of standard FPS games, and the uniqueness of the World War One era. This is the only game that you will find for this time period and genre of game, and for there to be only one choice, Verdun fills the niche perfectly. The developers are active on the forums and after every major patch I can see implementations of things that were mentioned in the forums. As well as amazing devs, the gameplay is very immersive. Although I can only play on low graphics, the immersion in the game while running up to take a trench is mind-boggling. This game does what no other company has tried to do and has pushed the boundaries of what, by many, was thought to be an impossible idea. Most people assumed that a World War One game would be boring and have no playerbase. They were wrong. Kudos to Matt, Mike, Leo, and the rest of the squad for making a dream game come true.			"

												A very nice game.Pros:+ World War I theme. There are very few games set in this time period (at least vs. WWII titles);+ User-friendly & intuitive interface;+ Authentic trench warfare: covered in mud, crawling across bleak landscape... only to be killed with a single bullet from only hell knows where. Happy times XD+ Gas warfare. The only game (in my memory at least) where you can actually gas your opponents;+ Good selection of weapons and squad roles;+ Good servers; no lags / connection issues.Cons... well, only one and, unsurprisingly, it lies with the players' ""ingenuity"":- One-man squads. There are 4 4-man squads per side in the match, if 4 people create 4 different squads because all of them want to be snipers / machine gunners, they prevent new fully complemented squads from joining the match.

												Verdun is a timely homage to those who fought in the First World War, it's that good.An OverviewVerdun. A word that encapsulates the horrors of the First World War. For it was at Verdun where the belligerents to the fighting had to endure some of the most appalling living and fighting conditions during the course of the war on the Western Front. The incessant shelling had turned the once pristine land into a wasteland. The constant disturbance of the clay at Verdun and the driving rain caused the formation of deep craters filled with oozing liquid that could drown men if they were so unfortunate as to fall into the hell hole. The battle was so ferocious a man is said to have been killed every minute of every day for 9 months. A death toll of some 800,000 men. One infantry man wrote 'If you have not seen Verdun, you haven't seen anything of war'.Verdun the GameVerdun is not primarily focused on the 9-month battle of Verdun of 1916, but rather encompasses 6 intensively researched maps, each portraying a different sector along the Western front, in which the Entente and Central Powers fought so ferociously over between 1914-1918. Why Verdun SucceedsI don't think it is premature to state that the developers of Verdun, have made a tour de force in the form of Verdun. It is rare to find a game, that catapults you into an era in history with such an eye for detail, that you'll find yourself swearing that you are there. The immersion level in Verdun is what has kept me coming back to Verdun time and time again (286 hours on record). VisualsThe game runs on Unity 5, perhaps the most popular Graphics engine currently around. Having had the game for 10 months or so, I have witnessed the transformation of Verdun's art direction first hand. It is only in the past 6 months, where the visuals have elevated the production values of the game to stratospheric heights. Notable visual details include:-On ultra, the deformation of No Man’s Land is a feast for the eyes. However, even on low the game looks good.-The character models have been researched to a very high degree, with excellent texturing.-Artillery shells impact the ground as you would expect. Showering men with debris and sending intense plumes of smoke high into the air.- Water logged craters, reflect the environment and character models.-Those trees not victim to shelling, look accurate.- The mud, especially on the map 'Artois' and 'Flanders' look photo-realistic.-Gas obscures your vision as it should, and the way it slowly creeps through the trench systems is impressive looking.Ambient SoundsFrom the whistling of bullets over your head, to the dull thud of shells in the distance, Verdun shines in depicting the sounds of the Great War. Rifles from the Entente and Central Powers make distinctive 'cracks', whilst the man suffocating from a gas attack near you, gasps in desperation. Other ambient highlights include:-Voice commands by fellow players which can be entered using the X key. There are over 20 instructions/emotions you can use. The most commonly used is 'Take Cover' and 'Retreat'!- Mud squelches beneath your feet, when running in poorly irrigated battlefields such as Flanders.-Officers (NCO's) can use their whistle to direct where their squad should position themselves.-Reconnaissance aircraft can be heard (and seen) meandering their way above the frontlines.Squad progressionProgression in Verdun is unlike anything you’ve seen before in an FPS. Verdun relies heavily on the use of squads. A squad comprises of 4 men each and there are 4 squads in each team. Each squad brings a unique role, uniform and weaponry to the battlefield. If you are in a match with certain players often and they are in your squad, the game will automatically track and save your progress (xp) with those people. Overtime, building enough experience with these players will elevate your squad rank which in turn unlocks a plethora of new abilities. These new abilities include the use of mustard gas and artillery barrages! Personal progressionVerdun of course also tracks your own personal growth within the game. There are over 40+ unique roles to unlock during the course of the game. Reaching the rank of level 100 is a bruising yet satisfying experience.Battle ModesThere are battle modes in Verdun. Frontlines and Deathmatch.Frontline modeThis mode tries to depict and simulate the mainly futile efforts of soldiers to try and take trenches on the Western front during WW1. It is almost flawless in design. A frontlines battle usually lasts 25- 45 minutes depending upon which map you’re playing on. When a game begins you’re either authorised by the game to ‘attack’ or ‘defend’. Once the initial attack timer is over (usually 5 minutes long) and provided the enemy have not achieved a foothold (whereby extra time is afforded to the attackers if they are able to place men in the enemy trench before and after the initial attack timer has needed) then it is tasked with the defenders to attack. This counter-attack and defend system really forces squad collaboration. It is imperative that squads cover the entire length of a trench system, if they are to avoid being overrun and their trench taken. However, once the first line of a trench is taken the defeated team ‘fall back’ to their prepared 2nd defensive trench line. Thus, even if you lose a trench, you can always take it back.  There can be as many as 3 trench lines on a map. Some 32 players (16 vs 16) can fight it out in total on any map. Death Match ModeThis is by far the least popular of the 2 battle modes. This mode sees you enter into a rifle death match to kill as many players as possible. There are no teams in this one, which forces players to rely on their marksman skills. The maps in this mode, whilst identical to those of Frontline mode, are far smaller.OptimisationThe level of optimisation for PC and Laptops has improved vastly during Early Access. The developers have spent a considerable time optimising the game. It now runs at almost 60fps on ultra for me, where before it would run at a mere 12fps.Future contentWhilst Verdun is being released tomorrow (27/04/2015), the developers have expressed their desire to keep supporting the game post-release. They have hinted at possible new squads such as the Americans and the German pioneer squads. New maps have already been made and shall soon be ‘updated’ in the game. A developer has personally hinted to me that there will be a hard core mode in the near future, which will focus on even greater depth of immersion.Final wordVerdun caters towards an audience who appreciates a squad-based World War experience . From the person who wants that feeling of cooperation with their teammates to the player who wishes to be immersed in a WW1 FPS, you can’t go amiss with this title. The visual fidelity is impressive and when accompanied with the ambient sounds, Verdun surpasses most FPS shooters based in war time. The Frontlines mode whilst simply executed is genius. Never before has defence or counter-attack been as exhilarating as this. As a young man, who lost both his great great uncles to the First World War on the Western Front, Verdun for me bears testament to the sacrifices made by all the men, from every nation involved in the ‘war to end all wars’. M2H and Blackmill Games have brought WW1 to life, like never before and for that I am eternally grateful.I score the game 9.7 out of 10. My only criticism is that I don't ever play the deathmatch mode.Thanks for reading this.Note: Since this review the developers have confirmed in their 'Road map' for Verdun that many more squads, maps and realism modes will be included to the game in the coming months. A new gore system is to be added, complete with shredded limbs. The 'Road map' demonstrates the developers true loyalty to their fan base.			"

												GREAT GAME... if you can appreciate it.It's an innovative FPS because kicks away annoying players who cannot stand the way it's played, but attracts the gentleman players, those who you totally want to play with.It's totally old fashion with nowdays tech, and that's very attractive for the kind of players does not feels comfortable on Call of Duty-like games. Why? let's see:It's WW1 reallistic, so:1.-One bullet, you're dead.2.-You're going to die a lot. There's no other way to play, so if you think it's all about getting frags and firing alot, stay away (your semi rifle has 5 bullets). This is totally like the Great War, you are just another soldier between millions and you have to run to the trench crossing no mans land, that's like 70% chances to get shot, fall into artillery fire, or taste the barbwire. If you reach the trench, alone will do nothing, can kill some but you need your team to capture it. If you can conquer it, congratulations, hold it because the enemy is counter-attacking. If you fail, get back to your trench, it's time to defend against the enemy... Also, usually you don't know who or what killed you or how... so you need to relax and be patience on this game. That means all the kids, trolls, frenetic players and mainly all kind of online players you usually hate will leave soon, and only fine players willing to play properly will stay... and this is such a HUGE reward!!!If you are one of them, you'll find many good times playing in squads, with old fashioned weapons in the WW1 warfare and it's own strategy, you'll find very find people in Verdun.Bad things? Servers aren't as good as a major company, so you'll get lag many times, the technology and graphics are OK, the needed to play, and still there's some bugs... BUT, if you like reallistic games, historic warfare, and the long-forgotten sensation to play just for fun and really getting it from being part of a well made assault and get your objective in team play... welcome to the community of Verdun.

												We were sitting in this trench shooting at the people trying to take our trench, the guy next to me gets hit, i look at him, he falls down while grabbing his shoulder. He screams in agony but i try to concentrate on my aim, after a while the screaming stops and i hit a guy who was a about 20 meters away from our trench. Seconds later we get the message that we repelled the enemy attack, and we must try to take their trench now, Me and my squad jump over the top and start running.We are lucky, their machine gun saw another squad first, so they are the ones getting mowed down, I run past the guy who I shot earlier, he lays there in the mud, drowning in his own blood, I must have hit him in the throat.Suddenly our officer gets hit, their machine gun had chosen their next prey, me and our gunner jumped in one crater, our rifleman jumps in the crater next to us. we stayed in our craters untill the MG had lost intrest in us. the moment we decided to crawl out a mortar lands right into the crater next to us, i catch a quick glance of the burned torso that was once our rifleman. The gunner and me (grenadier) continue our run trough No man's land.We finally arrive at their trench, the Gunner sets up his MG and waits untill the enemy shows up, I watched his back.After a while we hear fire. I turn around, and see my gunner just before he gets taken by the Flamethrower of the enemy, I manage to get around a corner and throw two of my grenades in the trench were my gunner got killed. The explosion took two of them, I see a leg flying out of the trench.I'm now alone, i retreat from the trench, and when I'm out we get called back, our attack lost its momentum. I make it back in our trench. And it all starts again. nobody lost, nobody wins.And this my childeren is your average match in Verdun.11/10 A true masterpiece.			"

												Death is an extremely complex theme, with a lot of meanings depending on your cultural background. But in Verdun, it becomes almost meaningless, and given that its objective is to loyally represent the memory of World War 1, I'd say mission very well accomplished.I won't lie, you will die A LOT, especially in the beggining. And even that is an understatement: if you poke your head out of the trench for more than 2 seconds, you'll promptly be sniped by a top level guy; if you charge the enemy trench, you either get sniped by said guy, or get stuck in barbed wire only to be sniped by said guy; and if you lie down in your trench, trying not to get sniped, an enemy will breach your trench and stab you in the back while you were trying to counter-snipe the original guy.That said, it is still very cathartic, especially when, after dying A LOT, your team manages to grind its way into taking the enemy trench, which depicts the memory of the war it's trying to represent a whole lot better than many triple A games out there (no finger pointing).And from time to time, you'll get one of those breakthrough moments when you save the entire team from being flanked because you threw a grenade that killed 5 guys trying to force their way into the trench. And those moments are so satisfying that you'll spend the entire conclusion of your review of this game bragging about it.But if you tire of dying, you can always flee in the opposite direction to hear your Scottish officer angrily telling you to ""GET BACK IN LINE, LAD!"" and be executed for desertion.

												Verdun has excellet gameplay and graphics and all that, but what I don't see people talking about a lot is how Verdun goes beyond the screen.  The gore, for example, is not really meant to awe at.  When you shoot someone and blow their arm off, or you shoot someone in the gut and have to listen to their screams for a minute or so, you actually kinda start to feel responsible.  Seeing all the explosions, experiencing suppression, seeing the gore, and experiencing the dark and depressing atmosphere can really sort of open your eyes to what the war was.  It's not like killing evil nazis or crazy zombies.  It makes you realize that you're killing a living, breathing human being, and that's something that no game has ever made me feel.  It can make you realize that people were actually doing and seeing all the same stuff in real life.  Verdun is the most respectful and accurate portrayal of warfare that I've ever experienced.			"

												I personally don't think this game can be simply recommended or not recommended; if you are interested in an authentic (key word) WW1 shooter, then absolutely purchase it. If not, then stay far away. This game takes authenticity very seriously, and there's very little room for standard FPS characteristics. You will almost always die in 1 shot (90-95% of the time), you will die very frequently (particularly in No Man's Land), and you will get frustrated. It is undeniably rage-inducing to spend what seems like an eternity sprinting from crater to crater in No Man's Land to finally get to the enemy trench and then as soon as you hop in you take a bullet to the face and have to start the journey all over again. This will happen a lot, so unless you're in it for the historical thrill (if that makes sense), prepare to scream at your computer screen. Another major aspect of this game that gives it such a high level of authenticity is the outcome of matches. True to WW1, a majority of matches will end in a draw, with no team getting a victory, and a nice death toll at the end to remind you that all those hundreds of deaths were for absolutely nothing. Somehow, though, 45 minutes of back-and-forth trench assaults just doesn't get boring, since you always have that hope that you'll get lucky enough to make it safely to the enemy trench and root them out. Normally, that hope is followed a second later by a nice bullet to the face from sweeping machine gun fire. I definitely believe this is one of the best shooters I have ever played. No other FPS will make you hit the dirt as fast as possible than Verdun when you hear machine gun fire whizzing over your head. No other FPS will make you as terrified of sticking your head out for even just a split second than Verdun. No other FPS will make you tense up and grimace as much while you're running across a muddy field than Verdun. This game is totally incomparable to any other game I've ever seen, and that's what makes it so good.  "

Early Access Review
								This being a WW1 game and that I have a keen interest in it's history, I was determined to look for any historical flaws or gameplay flaws that contradicted anything from WW1. Well I have to say, based on those factors and the gameplay itself, I am very impressed!The maps are designed in a way that would either mean the player has to resort to trench warfare, long distance warfare or even a mixture of both, getting the player to adapt to their surroundings and making them become more tactical in their decisions and how they would approah the enemy, which is an excellent feature! The maps also contain a lot of hidden elemnts and restricitons that relate to the kinds of conditions of WW1 (e.g. barbed wire hazards and execution for desertion), which make the game very knowledgable to its historical context as well as adding challenge for players.The weapons are also historically accurate as they should be and although there is not much variety in weapon types (5-7 rifles, 1 pistol type each team, 1 MG type each team), there is definitely a sense of competitivity through its ranking systems for weapons, classes and overall all personel rank. This makes the game a hell of a lot more addicting and can make players determined to reach target ranks to unlock more classes for frontline gameplay and unlocks for more rifles in deathmatch gameplay. Although most weapon damage is quite powerful since most rifles tend to kill either instantly or sometimes after 2 shots (depedning on player distance from target), they do allow the player to experiment with different fighting tactics in which pistol classes can be used in trench combat and MGs for defensive purposes as examples.Squad systems are also a good element which gets the player to think greatly about his fellow team members rather than his own killstreaks. Squad ranking is used in each game and the more experience points recieved together as a group, the more bonus perks can be used to give them greater advantages in frontline combat. There are also a set of 4 classes in the squadron which each have different roles and weapons like the commander, who can give movement orders, mortar strikes andrecon planes but is only equiped with a pistol and binoculars. These types of loadouts in squads allow the player to think more about their class role and how they assist their team members in different situationsAll these features do make quite an interesting game on it's own, however it is an early access game and it of course will have its flaws. Aside animation errors and sudden lags during or other glitches during gameplay, the game itself does not offer you much choice as to what game modes you can play or how you can play. A the moment, there are only 2 game modes, both of which require many people to just run around and shoot people. That's more or less it. Even objectives in Frontlines is obtained through killing players, it doesnt allow player much to do and can easily become quite a boring process for most. If it were to add more game modes with extra objective features that require players to for example arm bombs, use artillery equipement or maybe even use chlorine gas artilery to get players to use gas masks or avoid certain areas of the battlefield. It could do with graphic improvement and model improvements to, but like I said, it is an early access. As far as I'm aware, apparently a free download of the game can be aquired legally on the internet somewhere, which leaves reason to suggest why they would con people to pay money for a free access beta.All things aside, this game has definitely been through a thoughtful and well put development process and is generally a great war based game. We could do with more WW1 games, and this seems to pull of it's aspects brilliantly.[EDIT: Just note that this review was written before the game's more recent major updates. Things like graphics and other features are being improved even more and the game looks more smashing every time there's a new update. Also, I doubt it was influenced by me but I made a suggestion in this review to add a gas bomb feature based on the realities of WW1 and I couldn't believe it when they actually implemented a feature like that! All said and done from this review, it constantly improves and it begins to feel more and more like a true WW1 game!]			"

Early Access Review
								What is Verdun? TL;DR - an engaging, WWI trench warfare, attack and defend style FPS game. From my own research it's pretty historically accurate too, regarding uniforms and weaponry, and the different nations' units that fought in the European theatre.- - - Not every FPS-er is going to throw down their Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare or CS:GO for the chance to go ""over the top"" with low rate of fire hundred year old Lewis machine guns or bolt action Enfield rifles, but if you're a military history buff like me who likes the occasional FPS romp (but, honestly, are sick of all the WWII games) then switching gears to The Great War is a refreshing change. Expect to spawn in, go over the top to attack, and immediately get K98'd in the face a few times. It's unforgiving like that. But then in the same match you might lead an attack on the enemy trench and clear the whole thing, racking up kills and feeling ""some type of way.""Verdun tries to emphasize squad-based tactics and operating with your squadmates by granting you perks for staying within your CO's command aura, and xp bonuses for fighting alongside your squad. There are 4 positions in each squad, always a CO, usually a rifleman, a machine gunner, and a fourth specialty class like grenadier or sniper. Not every squad's job classes are cookie cutter versions of the same thing just renamed, there is enough variance in all the different loadouts (you get better weapons for the different classes with xp/leveling, as in CoD) that most players should find something they like.  I quickly found I don't like the French squad much - their weapons are great, jobs are pretty well balanced but those damn bright blue uniforms stand out! I usually play the Tommies, British infantry, as a Lewis gunner. It's heavy, wildy innacurate when not deployed on its bipod, recruit-level slow reloads, but when I catch the enemy on the offensive and I'm prone with the bipod deployed I can cut down several squads' advances if they aren't covered properly.There's so much more I could ramble on about, but I think I'm just gonna boot the game up now! Check out some gameplay videos if you're on the fence about buying this. I also have a growing collection of screenshots ""for ze lulz"" you can glance at. I highly recommend.			"

Early Access Review
								8.7/10+Unique Gameplay+Very well thoughtout+Dedicated/ Receptive Creators+Helpful Communtiy-Few Bugs-Weird animations-Some Maps are clutteredLook, the word ""indie"" I feel has a more negative connotation. Especially when you learn about an ""indie"" game that has only a handful of developers. At that point you might start to think that the game will suck because it isn't AAA or owned by a major company. Well, this game will change your mind. It is an indie game being developed by three individuals, and their work thus far has been amazing. Verdun is a WW1 game set on the Western Front. Think of it as a mix of Battlefield, and COD with old weapons and trenches. The gameplay has some bugs, as I am writing this while the beta is out, but it hasn't affected my experience. You play on servers with up to 24 people, in squads of 4. These squads serve different purposes and have different traits. You pick what you want to play as and have at it. The maps are well designed and thought out. The community is small, but very dedicated. This game deserves to be experienced, because it is unique in itself, and very fun.Don't pass it up because it is ""indie"". Go buy it and enjoy!			"

												This game is for proper war game buffs. It gives me the same tingles as COD (the first one) and Mohaa. It insists you play as a team, otherwise you quickly become alone, exposed and as a team, fragmented and ineffectual. It is a superb game in many ways, but most importantly having played it since it's Alpha phase inception, it does one major thing right - it does not allow spammers, sprayers or any selfish people to win simply by fluke. It tells you a proper story about trench warfare; you fight together or die alone. The graphics are now great, the immersion is fantastic. Deaths are brutally quick and soul-crushingly quiet on occasion; one minute your pal is there, the next he is in a shell hole face down in the mud. Alternatively the crack of a sniper bullet suddenly halts your next step, or a shell explodes and all that is left of you is pink mist. This game brings the trenches to your computer and genuinely tries to demostrate that war is not glorious. It is sad, poignant and utterly maddening. You will care about your life. You will care about others' lives. You will hate dying and you will die over and over again. Practice hard, play hard, and you will be the one whislting ""come death come"" as you silently end life.			"

 This game is a masterpiece! I personally recommend you to get this as fast as possible if you are into history or just like FPS shooters like me (I like both of those)   Positive: + Good maps+ Somewhat friendly community+ Several classes and skills to obtain+ Challenges+ Good graphics+ Based on realistic history events+ Several weapons to choose from, from bats to mustard gas...  Negative: - Not really good animations- Glitchy & Buggy, very annoying sometimes- Sometimes makes huge FPS drops from 60 to 5, and no this has nothing to do with my computer, its the game  What I would like to see in future: (!) I'd like to see even more weapons and maps(!) I'd like to see maps where there could be small events such as passing tanks but with a rule, you can't interract with them in any way(!) Bug fixes(!) Smoother and better animations  I will give this game a neun/zehn  "

Posted: August 2, 2015
												After spending some hours with Verdun one I can definitely say that the game is very refreshing and a it feels like a new breath after playing Battlefield and CS: GO for years. The “Frontlines” game mode is probably one of the best modes I've played on a FPS in late years. Basically, in this mode, each team has a certain amount of time to either attack and capture the enemy trench or defend their own. Capturing a trench works like pretty much any conquest/domination mode in any other FPS on the market, get someone near the capture point to capture it ( I’m not sure if having more people near the capture point makes it so that you capture it faster). Defending a trench is pretty basic, you just need to stop the enemy from getting into your trench and capturing it. To be honest I believe that defending is always easier because you're supposed to be inside a trench, and because of that, it's harder for the enemies to spot you and kill you while, on the other hand, it's far more easier for you to kill them because they pretty much have to get either inside or really close to your trench in order to kill you, or, the enemy can just call an mortar strike or some gas to force your team out of the trench. The only gripe I have with the “Frontlines” mode is that there is no penalty for camping and not pushing towards the enemy trench when you’re supposed to. Besides the main game mode, “Frontlines”, you also have “Rifle Deathmatch” which is a Free For All mode and a recently released mode called “Attrition” which is just a fancy name for Team Deathmatch.Of course it's not all that simple. There's two teams and each team is divided into various squads and in each squad there's 4 slots, each of those slots represents a different ""class"" or ""role"". From the top of my head I can say there's the equivalent of the Sniper/Marksman on both teams, the Machinegunner, the Grenadier, the standard grunt and there's also two classes which I like to call ""The Officers"". These ""officers"" have the ability to request mortar strikes and gas on where they see fit, you just need to aim where you want and press the designated keybind. Do you see a bunch of enemies holding up on one spot on their trench? Just call in a mortar strike and in a few seconds they'll go sky high or, if you prefer, call in for some gas and you’ll either see the enemy flee from their trench or they’ll have to put their gas masks on and by doing that they’ll get a very reduced field of view. If your target is far from you and you can’t really see that well, you can also call these strikes with the help of your binoculars . The ""officer"" can also give move/attack orders that designate waypoints that serve as a ""guide"" to where the other players on the team should move. Verdun also introduces the typical multiplayer progression present on many online multiplayer FPS. As you play you'll gain experience that will increase your account rank and that experience will also increase your class rank, the experience that you gain only counts towards the class in which you're playing at any given moment, each class has it's own rank/level. Each individual class has it's own milestones for unlocking more gear and weapons. These unlocks consist of bayonets for your rifles, grenades, pistols, machineguns, rifles or scopes for a certain rifle. I feel like this is a great way to reward active players by giving them a little advantage. In each game your squad will also level up the better you do and leveling it up will unlock passives for the squad members, however the squad level doesn't save, in the next match you play your squad level will be reset.Graphically, I think I can safely say that Verdun looks pretty good, of course it doesn't look as good as other FPS such as Battlefield or Crysis but for an indie development team I think that it looks pretty damn good, however I'll say that one of the few gripes I have with the game is the animation quality, sometimes it looks pretty good but every now and then it looks to me like the animation doesn't match the speed at which a player is moving, perhaps it's just me being weird. Now, something I really like in Verdun is the music, from the main menu track to the ones played in game, for me, they hit the perfect spot in setting myself in the mood, they're really immersive and sometimes I find myself waiting for the track to kick in so I can launch myself to the field and run towards the enemy trench.Still, there's something that always bothered me about Verdun, even after it's official release, and that is the hit registration. Sometimes a part of me feels like it's my connection that's just bad but there's some times in which I'll be shooting people running across the fields, or inside the trenches, and I'll be getting a kill with each shot, and then there's sometimes in which I can shoot someone who has their back turned against me and there's no hitmark or anything and they just turn around and kill me. I don't know if it's the servers, the game or some issue on my end but when it happens it tends to be very annoying. Still, all credit to the developers, it's not as bad as it was during Early Access and I'm pretty sure they've done alot to improve this and try to resolve this issue.Then there's another separate issue entirely, which is the overall game performance. Regarding this I believe it's some limitation of Unity because there's been patches and patches and overall performance stays pretty much the same, atleast for me, even though there was a significant performance increase after the upgrade to Unity 5. With a i5 4460 running at 3.2Ghz, 8GB 1600mhz ram and a 970 running at factory clocks I'm averaging between 50-70 with everything maxed out with the exception of stuff like lens flare, depth of field, HDR and stuff like that. I mean, 50-60 fps is pretty acceptable but for a FPS I tend to find more confortable playing these types of games with abit higher FPS. Like I said, I believe it's a limitation of the engine itself and that the devs have done everything they could to improve it, still, I believe it should be taken into account.The developers have certainly listened to the community during the whole development process and I believe that is to be praised. The developers took into account many suggestions made by the community and adressed various complaints and added things such as a mute/block option, bullet drop and team balancing.Overall, Verdun is a great game, if you can get past the lag and performance issues, and I believe that is mainly because it brings a fresh type of experience for an online multiplayer FPS by taking place in WWI and by taking a great and well done approach to the trench warfare since most FPS out there are pretty much taking place in a modern day setting. Most of the problems I had with the game during Early Access were fixed or greatly improved and I believe I can say that Verdun is of the best FPS I've played in recent years. Verdun is certainly an example for games to come on how it is possible to make FPS games on other time periods other than WWII and the modern era and, as I've said previously, the trench attack and defend mechanic is just so well executed and it brings a whole new dynamic to this kind of game.

												Verdun, simply put, is one of the most ambitious and fully realized first-person shooters that a lot of similar games never come close to achieving.This game literally bleeds with passion for recreating one of the most horrifying chapters in human history. From the ambient WW1-era music in the main menus to the sprawling trench-lines on the battlefields to even individual soldiers' uniforms this game is truly the product of a dedicated team.The core game mode of Verdun entails capturing and holding trenches of course. The Entente and Central Powers take turns attacking and defending until time runs out or one side captures every line. Many other games have a similar ""capture and hold this area"" gameplay mechanic but Verdun takes a different approach. Soldiers can establish footholds in a trench so that their teams' overall attack can continue, and if enough defenders are killed momentum can swift in the attackers' favor by giving them more time to take the trench. The defenders can however take back the initiative by pushing all enemy players out their trench and preventing any more players from entering until the attack phase ends.In order for your team to be able to successfully attack and defend their trenches, working with your squad is an absolute must! But what is great about Verdun is how squad gameplay feels natural and fluid unlike other games that use a forced squad mechanic. Squads in Verdun are compromised of four men each assigned a role within a overall squad type. As of this writing, the three squad type include line infantry, recon, and assault squads. Line infantry squads can call in artillery strikes, have machine gun capabilities, accurate rifle fire and access to grenades. Recon squads are fast moving, highly accurate riflemen that can use a recon plane to reveal enemies positions to the squad. The assault squad is able to call in gas to harass the enemy, can be equipped with melee weapons (think trench clubs and shovels) and have access to advanced weaponry.While these squads on their own can be rather deadly, they can get much better through squad experience points you earn when you play with the same players repeatedly. As your squad levels up, each squad role will get access to better skills such as the ability to hold your breath longer and upgraded capabilities such as improved artillery strikes or a recon plane bombing run depending on what the squad type is. As you individually level up, you will unlock career points which can be used to purchase more loadouts for each squad role. This can all sound a little intimidating at first, but everything comes together seamlessly creating a highly customizable playing experience that caters to individual players' tastes.So after spending more than 300 hours in Verdun since getting the game in October 2013, what makes me continue to come back to the trenches? Every time I play the game feels fresh and frankly just plain fun to play. One of the best mechanics of Verdun is how well paced the overall gameplay is. You can easily have a slow moment in the game where you are hanging back in the trenches waiting for the the enemy to come. Next minute, artillery is raining down all over the trench-line, gas is quick seeping in creating a deadly and terrifying sensation as you quickly dawn your gas mask. You look to your side as some of your unfortunate teammates asphyxiate to death on the fumes since they were too slow to equip their mask. Suddenly you hear a shout and see enemy players charging over the top of your trench bashing in any your teammates they see leaving you only seconds to fight them off or face certain death.It's these little experiences in Verdun that really make the game worth coming back to again and again. The only real complaint I had and still somewhat have with Verdun is the thorny issue of optimization. Ever since the game was moved to the Unity 5 engine, it has always been difficult for a fair amount of players including me to get a consistent framerate with the game. The issue seems to be irrespective of what your hardware setup is, as I meet the recommended system requirements and I have seen users who more than meet recommended get a paltry FPS. However the developers to their credit have and continue to release numerous patches that have addressed optimization issues. There are sill annoying micro-stutters in framerate I encounter from time to time, even when there is not too much action onscreen. But again recent builds largely created a highly playable game and I am confident the developers will only improve the game further.All in all, I cannot highly recommend Verdun enough. With exciting new squad types, game modes and maps in the works and the possibility of expansion packs in the future, Verdun has dug its foxhole and is here to stay! With that then, see you in the trenches!			"

												I'm crawling down in the mud among the dead men. We all signed for this, some of them added a year to their age to go here, to reach this hell. The bomb struck few meters away from me. Tinnitus in my left ear. All I can hear is buzzing noise that drives me nuts. Our attack didn't succeed. Now we're defending this point desperately and I can hear enemy... I can FEEL enemy getting closer. Too afraid to raise my head, to afraid to take a look. I keep my head low. It might save my life. I've seen it before. Head goes above the sandbag line... Splattered brain showers the muddy trench. I can't move. My NCO told me to stay here. Moving away, progressing or backing up would mean I'm a deserter. And we all knew what happens to those poor souls.I see a sizzling bomb dropping a few meters away and suddenly, the trench is filled with thick green smoke. Mustard. Senfgas, as Germans call it. I feel like a trapped mouse. Panic takes control over my body. My hands are struggling to protect my face with a gas mask. I... I did it. I've started running away mindlessly from the deafening noise of shots.I feel the enemy getting clos...Bayonet strikes my chest and pierces skin, muscles and bones. The pointy, rusty blade exits through my back. I taste blood on my tongue. Thundering noise in my head, I raise it to see the eyes of my killer. He has the same eyes, just like me, hidden behind the gas mask, just like mine. He... he's me, the same frightened boy who will think of his mother the way I'm thinking about mine right now... maybe a bit later. Maybe tomorrow. Who knows... He's just been a bit more lucky than me at this moment. I can sense his misery and fear while he pulls the steel out and pushes me away. As I fall down, I see him going away. Leaving my body to be swallowed by everlasting darkness...This is Verdun.			"

OverviewVerdun is supposedly the first WWI FPS. Made by two indie companies with a total of three developers, while many think such low development wouldn't be successful, the game proves them wrong.PresentationGraphics in this game are superb, not many people expect much more out of an indie company. There are some graphic options in the menu however I wish there was just a bit more. Currently there are no sound controls, but the developers said they will add it in at a later date. As far as the battlefields go, they are rather spectacular, however somewhat bland. There is detail in every little part, with huge craters in no man's land, dead animals in the middle of no man's land barbed wire all over, it gives the player a feeling like they are actually experiencing WWI. Currently there are three maps, but I believe that they are working on adding more, all three look authentic and believable. However there are some drawbacks. Low frame rates haunt almost every player in this beta, while not unplayable it's more annoying, especially when you get killed because your fps dropped during the action. Hopefully this can be fixed before release. (UPDATE: Devs have released an update, upgrading their engine and fixing some lag, while I still experience some, it is minimized.)  The menus are a bit buggy, but overall the devs have done a superb job on the visual side.GameplayGameplay is supposedly centered around you squad and your role in it. Yet with no current voice chat and little incentive to stay with your squad, your officer could be on the complete other side of the map and it would have no influence on your gameplay. However if you play with your friends and you really drive your squad based gameplay, it can actually help, turning your squad into a cruel fighting machine. This game has a leveling up system, your squad levels up with new uniforms and tech, and you have your own level, aswell as your rifles get leveled up. The leveling system needs some work as it doesn't seem like it is that responsive or effective. The main mode (or atleast what I presume is the main mode) is what their version of what the western front is. You get a set amount of time to storm the enemy trench with your team. If you can kill everyone in that trench and hold it for a set amount of time that is now your front line trench and you have to defend for the same amount of time. However if you are unsuccessful in storming the trench, you have about 30 seconds to retreat back into your trench and defend. If you don't make it back in 30 seconds you're deemed a deserter and are killed, but more on that later. I assume the gameplay is actually decently realistic, removing some factors, but is pretty fun. The other game mode is a rifle deathmatch. Basically it is a free for fall across the entire map. This is a great way to work out the maps and practice your rifling skills. One of the problems with this game is that you die way too much. It's easy to die in a normal game 30+ times. Some would call this being realistic and I get that, but at points it can just be annoying. Another aspect mentioned earlier is that if you go outside the area of the map the game wants you to be in you can be killed because you're ""abandoning"". If you go behind where you're supposed to, you are killed. If you leave you're trench and go forward when defending you are killed. If you're attacking and you go past their trench you are killed. This can get annoying, however it does push the WWI playstyle so it is not such a madhouse. Another annoying feature is how deadly the barbed wire is. One can simply run into them and die a few seconds later, I don't know how realistic this is, but it sure is annoying if you don't see it. The gameplay is fun, although I hope they optimize it more to make it a great game.MultiplayerThis game is currently solely multiplayer, however the devs had mentioned in the forums they are looking to add a multiplayer mode with bots, which I really hope they do, just incase I can't play online. As far as online goes the players are actually extremely nice. The players on this game are no Dota players, they actually help you out, even if they are on the opposite team, and I've seen that the teams have joked around with each other creating a great environment. Most everyone in the forums are nice aswell, answering my questions and inviting me to play with them when I didn't even ask. I hope that this can remain true beyond it's release.ExtrasThe devs are working on many things, they just released a nice Christmas update where there is a new Christmas map and you can throw snowballs at one another. This is a nice little addition, and unneeded, but it was nice of them to add it. The devs say that they will add more before release and I hope they can come through, The game is really spectacular for just three devs, and I look forward to more.SummaryVerdun is a unique WWI first person shooter by a dedicated indie team that pulled it off with a great dynamic gameplay and different game modes. With a few minor drawbacks this is a great experience any first person shooter or history fanatic should checkout, and I know I'll be playing for awhile..			"

												This game is nothing like call of duty. That should be the seller right there. But anyway this game is purely based on teamwork. Not one single person can singlehandedly take out al of the enemy team and capture the trench line. Its teamwork. And When ever you see gas dont take the chance and try to charge throught it because that one time you think its Bromide gas its actually Mustard Gas and its all to late for you my soon to be ded freind. This is also Dying Simulator so yeah you will die alot tellig you now just get the game stop reading this buy it do it now . We need moar people on the front.			"

												This game is literally the reason I still have faith in 1) the indie gaming community 2) the historical community 3) the world at large. Thank you Verdun devs, thank you four-player based squad gameplay, and thank you Verdun community - never change! 2000+ hours since Steam Greenlight, and it's only getting better: love the free content, the gore update, the meticulously beautiful maps, the personal touch of the three core developers, the surreal weirdness, and most of all the constant attention to ""realism"" (whatever THAT is) that has been a priority since the beginning. It's gritty, and that's how war is too, as I understand from a distance. Keep it that way. As a PhD student in history, I could not support this game more. Thanks for making it Linux friendly - and bugs be damned. This game comes 100% recommended.			"

Product received for free
												You stand in a hole, created from what you can only guess is a bomb. Next to you is a dead soldier, his body half buried in the mud. His body is in such a bad state that you cant even tell which side he is on, or well, used to be on. Suddenly you hear that you need to push up and attack the enemies trenches. Being a soldier you emerge and blindly follow the orders given by your squad commander who is 50 meters back safe and sound with his binoculars, calling in mortar fire and is hardly in any danger at all.After setting foot in the mud above the hole you get a second to look around. Fallen comrades everywere, half of them are still alive screaming for their moms and others just screaming from the pure terror of looking at what used to be their leg. It doesn't take long for you to realize that you are all that is left from your wave of soldiers. You somehow managed to survive. After running about five meters and taking cover behind a pile of dirt you look behind yourself and see the faces of the new infantry wave starting to take their first steps out of the trenches of safety towards the fields of the battle. You feel happy for a moment thinking ""yes! reinforcments! Now I might be able to get som help and take this trench once and for all."" The happiness is soon shattered as you hear heavy enemy gunfire from a machine gun and seeing the new wave of reinforcments being slaughterd and torn to shreds from the hail of bullets. A spark of rage reaches through your body after seeing your comrads die and all you want to do is kill! Kill these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that mowes down a friend after another without any remorse. After realizing help isn't comming you think ""To hell with it!"" And with your trusty rifle and bayonnete you charge the enemy trench and somehow manage to jump down and enter it without taking a bullet in the chest. ""Look to the right and then left."" you think for yourself. The right side seems clear but there is a german soldier on the left facing away from you. And before you know it you pull the trigger, out of pure reflex. The recoil of the rifle shocks you almost as much as it shocked the german. And after realizing that he was shot the german soldier falls to the ground, screaming and crying. You hit him in the chest and it's almost like you can hear his lungs collapsing as he is gasping for air, still in shock from the extreme pain he is experiencing. The guilt starts to rise as you realize he is not much older than you are. Perhaps even younger. Immedietly you start making excuses in your head as if anyone would judge you for shooting the enemy. ""It's not my fault"", ""This was self defense"", ""I didn't mean to...."" And somewere between all of these thoughts you realize that you are no better than the people that are mowing down your comrads. You pass the young german who has now gone silent but is still moving around in pure agony. ""Another one! Another german is less than five meters away!"" you think. But it is to late. He already has his sights aimed in at your heart. And suddenly you start to fall. While you are falling you see anger in the soldiers eyes. ""Perhaps it was his friend I just killed."" But it doesn't matter. Even though you can't feel the pain you are coughing up blood. You take your final breath and a small one at that. And then you die.      In short this game is kinda cool			"

												Verdun is a game that (I think) you will either love or hate. You will die. A lot. You will fight over and over for the same stretch of land, again and again. Did I say you will die a lot? You will. A lot.Being a veteran of the Red Orchestra 2 and Rising Storm games, dying a lot is not necessarily a bad thing to me. If I take a bullet, that means that one of my squadmates didn’t. Maybe one of them was my squad leader. Now I can spawn closer to the enemy trench! I love dying in the mud of no man’s land.There are two game modes, but you will most likely only play Frontlines. In this mode, you fight over a small section of the Western Front where the goal is to advance and capture sectors, or defend those sectors from being captured. If an attack loses momentum, melts away in machine gun fire as it were, the roles are reversed and the defending team goes on the attack. Sometimes a team keeps on advancing, but mostly the teams go back and forth over the same stretch of bloody mud until the match is over.The game is at its best with a full server. The maps are fairly small, and the fights are intense. It’s probably not that realistic, but it’s gritty. On of the best (and scariest) moment so far was when I had just fallen back from a failed attack and was back in my trench. I got up on the firing step and aimed my SMLE at a green cloud of bromide gas. Out of the cloud came three gray-clad Landsers in gas masks, rushing my position. I managed to take one down, but the others jumped into the trench and shot me in the back. Damn.Are you on the fence about this game? I can’t tell you if you will like this game, I can just tell you that I love this game. Have you played Red Orchestra 2 and/or Rising Storm and liked those games? If yes, then you’d probably love this game.			"

												Tired of fast paced first person shooters? Need more tactic based movements and strategies? Remember playing CoD 1 or MOHAA/SH/BT? Then listen up:This game literaly blew my mind and took me back to my experience with MOHAA. Bolt action rifles, peering around corners, afraid to move an inch to your left without exposing yourself too much. AHH my blood is pumping agian and not from a rage endused heart attack that im used to from newer FPS games. This game has alot of balance to it, i dont even know where to begin. Imagine fighting for domination over a trench line only to get overrun and forced to retreat back to the previous line of defense. Imagine pushing forward and taking over the trench you just lost whilst shooting the retreating enemies back to the the crap hole they came from. Its simply just a great game. I would say a hefty learning curve at the begining, with no room for tactical error. Meaning, you will spawn, and then move, and then die. Lucky for you, you get to come back and learn how to manuever around in the cold, muddy, and poissibly gas filled trenches as you fight your enemy tooth and nail for the very ground you stand on.Keepin it Real, Reign			"

Early Access Review
								**updated review****posted 2014**As an early access game with a relatively small server population and only 3 developers, Verdun continues to impress me. Verdun being one of a handful of playable First World War games in existence, I was eager to fork out the $15 for the Steam beta. That was around the time the Picardie update was implemented, and I was happy to find that Verdun ran just fine on my laptop. After putting 50 hours into the three maps and finding my niche in the squad system, I can say that Verdun is only getting better. Verdun offers unique challenges and experiences that cannot be found elsewhere as a relatively simple FPS game. Currently, weapons are historically limited to bolt-action rifles, clunky machine guns, pistols, and grenades. The simplicity in weaponry helps level the playing field and keeps any one player from dominating the other team. Often when storming a trench I will cut down the first man in front of me and the man behind him will take me down while I re-chamber only to be shot by my squad mate that has (hopefully) followed behind. This unique nature of Verdun helps make it playable to most people even if they are bad at a traditional FPS, and I appreciate that. There are still things that frustrate me about Verdun. Things like prone blocking that keep me from taking cover when it is vital, inactive players blocking the trench, the multiple shots sometimes required to kill, and the inexplicable tendency for small pieces of wood on the map to get in-between my crosshairs and the enemy. I am sure any real problems will be addressed by developers because they are undoubtedly in tune with the dedicated community of players and any useful feedback given to them.To summarize, Verdun was worth my money and the positive trend of developer support and effort is showing no signs of lessening. **updated content, 2016**After a few years of playing Verdun on-and-off since my original purchase, I still recommend this game to any prospective buyer. My previous statement about the positive trend of development has definitely played out over these years. Content including 5 new maps, 8 new squads (with 4 new nationalities represented), nearly 50 new weapons, two new game modes, and an intense gore option have been added (for free) since I first reviewed this game. Lately, new content has been more rare mostly because the developers have been focusing on porting Verdun to the Xbox One (its already out for PS4). After this I'm not sure what will be added but I'm excited to see what it is. My old complaints are now outdated. Proneblocking does not bother me as much as it used to, whether that's because I got used to it or because they fixed it I'm not sure. The same goes for the multipule shot kills. I think sometime in the past few years the hit system was reworked so all rifles (plus the machinengewehr) are 1-shot kills while pistols/other LMGs are 1-to-2 shot kills. The whole thing about small peices of wood was just the past me being silly. New players will most likely experience a learning curve. Be sure to read the official steam guides on the weaponry and squad role/leveling system. Also, be aware that most people play the Frontlines gamemode (a trench-by-trench attack/defend match) and that the other three gamemodes are often mostly depopulated. Two things a new player should try to remember is that teamwork is not absolutely necessary but is always preferable, and that having a negative k/d is totally fine because you can still have a great match with 30+ deaths. Many people complain about aim-bots and cheaters, but usually these are just cases of very experienced players laying waste to less experienced/less patient players. If you get frustrated just switch lobbies, or, better yet, join their team.Finally, after playing this game for over 2 years, I've developed a deep respect for the tone of the game and how the developers have chosen to portray a ""generic"" soldier's experience of the Western Front during the First World War. Verdun avoids the dramatism and theatrics of most war films and other games like Battlefield 1 and Valiant Hearts (although I would still recommend the latter game). There is no attempt to personalize the player's experience by telling a story or by forcing the player to use charcters with detailed biographies. There are no emotional cutscenes or any dramatic music. This does not mean that Verdun feels impersonal or inauthentic. Verdun manages to respect the terrible reality that was the First World War by including details which are somewhat unnecessary to the gameplay (like the sheer choice of weapons and the level of uniform detail), heavy but realistic gore mechanics (lots of screaming and loss of limbs), and refusing to center the experience of the game around a handful of fictional individuals. I feel that Verdun's lack of storytelling and non-linear multiplayer allows my experience of the game to be more organic, and, as a result, it feels more authentic and ""real.""To summarize again, Verdun was totally worth my money and the game itself is set apart for its high level of histroically accurate detail as well as its dedicated and responsive developers. If its on sale and you are on the fence, go for it! It is much cheaper than BF 1 after all....			"

												Outnumbered 3 to 8 the germans advancing unto us with there rifles straight and spirits high. Unfortunately for the Germans the three men in the trenches were Canadian. (((Scroll all the way down for TL;DR version)))But in all seriousness this game is one of the best fps shooters I have played. I initially thought that a game about trenches would be fairly boring due to its natures of staying in one spot for most of the time. This game however is non-stop action from start to finish where at first you defend your trench and then proceed with an attack. there is so much thought that goes into trench warfare. For example: -Mounting MGs in the right positions, -placeing gas in the right places, -when and where to bomb,-when to cross no mans land,-How to fight in the trenches,and the list goes on.Pros:-Great Graphics-The sound in the game is amazing-instilled pride in me that i didnt even know I had-Gameplay is well polishedCons(minor):-Some servers do tend to lag but it is very uncommon and not that big of a problem-Learning curve is a little steep but once you get going you'll be goldenI would also recommend playing this game with a bunch of your friends on skype or what have you because I find it to be a way better experience.I highly recommend this game to anyone 10/10 would play again.[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[TL;DR]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]Game is Amazing expecially with friends. well worth the price offered.Press 4 to put on your gas mask.

												September ?, 1915""I have recently been stuck in an unknown bunker in an unknown trench with an unknown man. I have survived with the cartridges I found on my dead squad's bodies. The bunker has been encaved from mortar and artillery fire where I have survived several days by having my shambles of spirit and concrete keeping me company. The haunting laughs of Germans have become my dreams and nightmares, while hoping to survive. I would fight my way out and hopefully die as a hero...but sadly my leg is broken and my blood-dried clothes have given me false hope leading to me laying here for hours with the constant drips of blood and rain falling on my face. I dream about the warm fire and beds back home in my village near London, but what starts as a dream, ends up as a rude awakening with the moist mud surrounding me. Why was I here again? The constant pounding of fresh Earth and vibrations made me realize...Germans...Loos...a battle? Yes...a battle...Hill 70...i think? Why is this important...we failed and men are dead..why not me? Doesn't matter now, I have decided to use the broken rifles of my comrades to splint my leg, I have courage to kill any Germans I see...a couple of grenades? No problem. I see the yellow-green gas in the distance..coming to take me and be my guardian angel...10 shots in my clip...one bayonet...and enough courage to kill an army...Let's go Tommies, over the trenches again.""~Unknown Tommy, Unknown Regiment, Known Courage--Battle of Loos			"

In the Trenches, snipers shooting everyone who stands up, mortars and grenades going off in every direction. The game has a wide variety of weapons, armies, maps and many more pieces of content and is adding new content all the time.The Graphics are also wonderful, I have never seen less than 50 FPS, and I've seen FPS all the way up to 120.

								Good little game, great details was given to weapons, they look the real thing, uniforms and sceneries are ok. Could improve artillery, quite limited, only one player has grenades which is inaccurate for the days, no trench knife or club, limited use of bayonet, they could introduce tanks, gas, make the trenches more complex and have more than 5 players per side. There are hardly any games relating to WWI which is a shame considering it is a very interesting era, the end of a romanticised type of conflict with flamboyant uniforms and cavalry, lancers and swords, and the emergence of mechanised armies, modernised weaponry and for the first time use of camouflage. There would be more interest in the game if it was made more realistic also, anyway I like it, I recommend it and would like to see more people play it			"

												I'm a ww1 Australian reenactor and I love my ww1 history. This game has fufilled everything i could have ever wanted in a ww1 FPS. It feels like im in a genuine battle, you get mowed down by rifle and machinegun fire when sprinting across no-mans land. You get bombed to pieces by artillery and grenades. This is the genuine ww1 experience if you are looking for a game set during The Great War. The only thing i would like to see added to this game would be larger squad sizes. and possibly a larger player cap. Say 64/64 for example with 4 squads of 8 men. So 1 Officer/NCO, 4 Rifleman, 2 Bombers, and 1 Light Machine Gunner. It would just increase the realism and intese fighting that you see in pictures of ww1. Everyone almost shoulder to shoulder running across no-mans land. But apart from wanting to see that (only cause im a ww1 reenactor :P ) I give this game 10/10.			"

								I killed 40 guys with 40 bullets.Verdun is a great WW1 FPS. Squad system in the Frontline mode is cool. Who wouldn't want to be rewarded with extra uniforms and other things by getting more squad XP with friends? Teamwork is really important in Verdun.Not over-the-top realistic, it is accessible to anyone who likes FPS games - but it isn't so arcadey too. And that's cool.			"

												“Trench fighting is the bloodiest, wildest, most brutal of all ... Of all the war's exciting moments none is so powerful as the meeting of two storm troop leaders between narrow trench walls. There's no mercy there, no going back, the blood speaks from a shrill cry of recognition that tears itself from one's breast like a nightmare.” ― Ernst Jünger, Storm of SteelThis is a damn well made indie game. While not as polished or smooth as other AAA FPS titles, this is definitely the best WW1 FPS out there, and will continue to be even after Battlefield 1's release. The squad system is well fleshed out, and doesn't leave out many major combatants(from the western front anyway), with great variety of different classes and tactics to choose from. The classes range from machine gunners, to officers that can call in artillery/gas attacks and add ""buffs"" to nearby team mates, to melee/ close range focused assault classes, to sniper units. The different equipment and class types make it feel like you need to ""roleplay"" your role, as that's what your equipment is for. Leveling up these classes through play adds a neat progression system that gives your character more weapons, more abilities, etc. In addition to class leveling, there is a very unique squad leveling system that makes it feel like you are part of an epic war, as they are persistent across matches. Teamwork is essential, and you really get the sense that your squad is its own self sufficient unit in a much larger conflict. The variety of squad types is awesome too, ranging from U.S. Doughboys to elite Alpenjägers, to the scrappy Belgians, to the rough and tough French Poilus. As your squad levels up, your player models become better armed and tougher looking, just like a squad would in real life. The ability to name squads whatever you want, from ""Donald Trump's Royal Guard"" to ""The Really Bad Marksmen"" or something adds a lot of personality and a feeling of pride as you fight with other players on your team. It's so cool to see so many factions represented in an accurate, respectful manner, I can't believe France is out of BF1 while the Americans are in, makes no god damn sense to me.Didn't play this much in Early Access, but now it's a fun, engaging, harrowing team based experience that anyone who has a passing interest in WW1 should try out!

								The newer people will be impatient or naive, and crawl along on the dirt thinking they are hidden or charge gloriously with their comrades, only to be machine gunned down.After that, you'll will get a feel for the battle, seeing the shadows of enemy movements in enemy trenches, watching out for the flash of a rifle, knowing that the bullet sound that sounded a little 'too close' was indeed too close and that you should start crawling down for a different approach. Survival is important, leave forlorn hope to those who want it, you want to live right?And then whatever idea of self preservation will be thrown out a windowYour brothers in arms will start to swarm in, the enemy line reduced, dying by dozens trying to take one tiny foothold in the trenches. You'll see a teamate charge next to you and get sniped, and still, you'll get up and charge in, praying that the next bullet doesn't hit you. Because that trench has to be captured, even if you know it'll be hell. You'll hear the explosion roaring around you. You might see it happen in front of you, killing your squadmates. Bodies will be sprawled across the trenches, move cautiously to clear it out, The moment you take the trench, there is no reprive, only onslaughts of mortars and toxic gas, you can't see anything, you can't tell friend from ally. Shoot shots blindly into the gas, you could've sworn you saw something moving.Reload- no, he's in front of you now, charge him! Stab him! Hold the trench, you move next to an ally, popping shots at the krauts or tommies that are charging to quickly retake your position. Then a small clink, a bounce at your feet, and a spring in your foot would be an understatement of what happens to you and your friend.If you allow yourself the experience, you will receive it, every charge through no man's land, every euphoria of a shot knowing the enemy never knew what hit him, protecting your CO, even above your own life. Every moment of the WWI experience is here in Verdun, it is breath taking and glorious.			"

								Only game where you can nerd out in chat about WW1 history facts without being berated. Community is friendly and helpful, in my opinion, due to no in-game voip, which i am completely fine with.WW1 FPS that focuses on the squad and not because of your K/D or level. People who cry about dying alot belong in COD or world of tanks. Work as a team and you accomplish great things in the game.Death is inevitable in the game, only FPS game i've ever enjoyed dying. Haters have bad PCs and can't swing their rifles for the life of them. Check out the game's sponsored guides.11/10 would raid trenches in real life			"

								I normally don't write reviews but this game is really awesome!!It's very refreshing to have a fps game that is down to earth without this killstreak bs and creating icons.It is very fair balanced and both teams get their equal share of a chance to win the game and it's down to the teams ability to play as a team or at least play thoughtful and not selfish. When your team has its turn to attack, then attack and don't camp unless you give cover with an MG or mortar as NCO. When the enemy comes in numbers from the right, then tell your team mates. It's very unique and quite refreshing. Please do buy it and give it a fair go. It's already worth its price and can only go one way (better) from where it is now.  "

								What do i think of Verdun?I think ti's a really good concept that they tried to grasp and make into a video game, you don't see many fps games during WWl or before so to see this out on the market really caught my attention by itself.I'll start by saying i got this game early december and there was a update or two but that was it, i began to think the devs just took my money and ran away. However recently they just had a update and i've gotta say they've improved the game a lot and it looks a lot nicer too.The game is unique in its own way because the fighting style is just like WWl and if you don't know what  i mean well then it's all pretty much trench warfare so close combat kinda stuff and it's a attack/defend style. So one side, ex. the germans, will leave their own trench and run across no mans land. No mans land is pretty self explanitory it's called that because no one wants to be there. It's covered in barbed wire (which if you run in will slow you down and kill you) and is just an open field, the only cover you can use to help yourself are the shell holes that are scatered around. While all this is going on the french are sitting in their trench with their rifles/mgs just mowing you guys down, and you're just praying that you'll somehow sneak into their trench and capture it.The game trys to make teamplay an important thing by giving you extra points if you work as a squad. There are 4 different roles in each squad that are all unique in their own ways. You have a NCO that carries a pistol and commands orders of where to attack or can place motor fire down on a positionThere's the classic rifleman you obviously has a rifle, pretty basicYou can be the Support role which carrys an old WWl mg (which is♥♥♥♥♥♥btw) and covers your teammates as they move up or you can be that badass mowing down the enemy as they advance forwardLastly there's the sniper which is pretty self explanitoryThe game is also somewhat active, you can find games to play in and have fun and even every now and again join a full game.The downsides.Even though you can find games like i just said it's also a down side because there are usually only 3, 4 at the most you can join.The lag can be pretty bad at times and you can't vote kick people out of games. For example i was playing last night and a guy on my squad had a ping of +650. He was making the whole game lag up and there was nothing we could do and he wouldn't leave so therefor i had to leave.They only have two gamemodes to play, The classic attack/defend and the other is free for all.Free for all is a lot of fun....IF you can get a game going. There's usually only about 2-4 people playing free for all so you're never getting the full expierence that they wanted you have with the gamemode. so you're always stuck then playing attack/defendThe other thing that's bad about this game is it's community. The people you play with are either a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to you or don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ they're doing and while they should b rushing and attacking they are camping in the back with rifles sniping so you never advance and you lose every match. Every time i've told my team to push up or ask them why they aren't helping me they all tell me to stop complaining.Over all i give this game a solid 7/10I think the price may be a tad bit overpriced, i'm not saying they are ripping you off, but if this game goes on sale you should pick up a copy of it for sure.

								UpdateAfter I played for awhile I realized that each Faction has different classes. There is classes that only have a pistol with a bunch of gernades. It totally depends on your play style and preference. I absolutely love that. My favorite class is the Flanker for the Canadians. The more I play this game the more I hope it grows. It is such a fantastic experience. The community is loyal and helpful.I need to hurry up and film this for my channel so my subscribers will feel the need to get itI hope this review makes you guys want to get it!!!!OriginalThe Short VersionPros:World War One Trench WarfareAmazing atmosphereUpdates full of contentWell done voice actingAccents done rightMustard GasDetailed soldiersAs far as I can tell it's historically accurateGood GraphicsA lot of Unique FeaturesBoth:Teamwork is required to winNo BulletdropRank SystemSquads with rolesCons:[It's in Early Access so some of these Cons may be fixed]Sometimes Bullets do not registerLow populationSpawn KillingNot newbie friendlyInvisible walls around terrain block my shotsTakes a Required TasteLong Version:Here lately I have been writing reviews as they should be written. ""Do I reccommend this game?"" not ""Do I like this game?"" This is one fits both.Verdun is a World War One trench warfare shooter. There is nothing like it right now. I hear a lot of my friends say it looks like a Red Orchestra 2 with World War One skins. That is not true for several reasons.There is so many unique things in Verdun that I can not compare it to any other shooter. As soon as you spawn you look out beyond your trenches and see fog covering No Man's Land [the area between the teams' trenches] with men running then falling down. Soldiers scream war cries and charge whistles blow. Bi-planes fly over head, artillery crushes your side, and Mustard Gas lurks ever so omniously. As you gaze at the breath taking sight...you got shot right in the face.You will then try to ""learn by doing"". This is where a con comes in. Just like every Multiplayer only game--you'll die over and over again before you learn how to play. This is fine by me really but in Verdun it's really bad. There is a rank system. At first that sounds fine. It sounds like Call of Duty or Battlefield. Let me tell you--I don't want to hear one person complain about starting weapons in a First Person Shooter ever again. In Verdun--you start with a pistol. I have been a Canadian on the Entente side the entire 2.7 hours I have so far so I had a Webley which is a six shooter. You start with that or whatever the Axis variant is.So here you are--not sure what to do or where to go and you are having to defend yourself with a pistol while opposing forces are sniping you from affair. You learn to bob, weave, and hide so you can pick off a few foes with your little potato gun. Don't get me wrong you can destroy with this gun.....once....you learn how to use it.You get your adrenaline pumping with all the booms and charge whistles accompanied by war cries. You start doing work--you follow orders, you get some kills, and hey look your team won.Next comes the XP screen and there it is--no unlocks. After awhile you realize guns are class specific. You have to level up the class you may not even realized you pick in order to get the rifles. Now it comes together.This is fine by me--it is trial by fire--but this is going to leave a bad taste in some newbies' mouth and may either go play the dry rifle deathmatch mode or just stop. Once I got the rifle I was doing even more work then I was doing. It was great.The maps are all trenches but man they are all different aswell. It's so weird really. Even though it's the same concept--charge and defend--each map brings a different element to the game. Speaking of maps let me bring up the visuals. This game in my opinion looks amazing just because of the detail. The soldiers are detailed, the maps are detailed, the guns are detailed, the bi-plane is detailed, the dead horse on this one map I found is detailed, it is just a detailed game and I love it so much. The accents are spot-on and the atmosphere just captures World War One as you have seen in pictures or in films. I got so immersed.One thing that would help the immersion is no hud but you kind of need it at times. So I decided to leave that out of the pro, both, con list. A lot of the cons like terrain walls I won't discuss in detail because this game is in Early Access and the Devs are doing a fantastic job of cleaning this game up. Updates are frequent and they contain so much content. Just take a look for yourself.Overall--I love this game. While I think it takes a required taste to be able to enjoy this game I have to recommend it because I want to see this game grow. Only a few hundred play this game--I hope for more.So if you are interested--go ahead and buy it			"

Pros:+ Weapons are accurate to the era+ Multiple different game options, including death matches or more realistic wave based trench warfare.+ Lots of squad options for both the Central Powers and the Triple Entente. These squads are also balanced out through unit variety, with different units fulfilling different, usually equally important roles. + The game is balanced well, with bolt-actions dominating the field. However machine gun and rarer sub-machine guns also make an appearance, and all weapons have their upsides and downsides such as machine guns being mainly sedentry making them easy pickings for snipers.+ A large variety of environments, including the bleak, barbed wire scarred earth of Champagne and Artois, to the wooded Vosges.+ High realism helps to create an amazing atmosphere for the game, with shells causing you to dive to the floor, and bullets zipping over the trench the game certainly feels very weighted. + Obtaining equipment is easy in this game, and you'll often find you have too many points to spend on weapons, this makes it very easy for new players to play what they want to play with, unlike some more recent historical FPS games. *cough* Heroes and Generals *cough* Cons - The high realism may leave some players -who are used to other FPS games- frustrated by this game, which is extremely unforgiving. Barb wire, machine guns and artillery mean you'll often find yourself sat in a trench for a large part of the game.- The game (trench warfare, the main game type)  is also very team oriented, the squad, consisting of 4 players, votes for the squad type and faction they want to be on and this means you could, as a single player end up in a scenario where you aren't playing what you want.- Some specific squad units I feel could have some changes, the Überwacher from the AlpenJäger  squad has a negligible effect, and binoculors seem pointless. Perhaps an idea would be to have binculors spot people on the minimap or on the hud (balance at the sake of realism?) however I am aware there are those that would disagree.-Finding servers with people on can be difficult, I know this is largely down to the game receiving less attention than it should but I also feel matchmaking could be improved to allow people to see what servers have people on them. As at the moment it's luck of the draw if you get into a match with a lot of people on it.-Glitches still exist wherein you get kicked out of the match whilst changing maps, and it's extremely frustrating due to the above point. All in all for those looking to purchase this game, I would recommend it, it has a lot of replayability, and if you've got a bunch of friends to play with it's even better for getting the real atmosphere.

												I launch into my first ever game. I arrive in a trench with a bolt action rifle and a gas mask. I notice a look out post just up ahead. I set up shop, aim down my sights and look into the wastelands beyond me. I see nobody. Then suddenly the sound of a small metal object flies up next to me with an abrupt stop. I look down to my right. My comrade is laying on the floor lifeless beside me. I panic. I take aim and look back into No Man's Land; I can't see anyone. Time passes; I am still alive. I decide this is it I must make a move. I find a nearby ladder and start climbing up over the edge of my trench. I'm still alive. This is amazing, I feel not only invincible but invisible. I run as fast as I can towards the enemy trench when suddenly I stop. I look down; I am stuck, my trousers are tied up in a mess of barbed wire. I try to move forward out of it but it is of no use. A brief small winding noise flies towards me, a bullet gets lodged in my head. I have died, my corpse stuck in a mess of barbed wire, my helmet a few feet away. I respawn and return to my previous post. I take aim and look out and there he is. A head just peering over a sandbag on the edge of the enemy trench. I hold my breath, aim the gun straight at his head and pull the trigger. I've never felt so excited and rewarded for getting a single kill in my life. I stop to celebrate for a brief moment, pumping my fist in the air, only to return my eyes to the screen and see I've been killed again. Damn this game is good.			"

Or defend a trench with my British comrades only to come face to face with a flamethrower,♥♥♥♥♥♥myself, scream at the top of my lungs in teamspeak, hide behind my fellow comrade only to see him burned to ashes before my eyes and run like I have never run to the nearest little sleeping spot, cry, scream for my mummy before getting stapped to death like that guy in Saving Private Ryan while the enemy player was whispering shhhhh ""Just let it happen."" in VoIPIn conclusion this game is 9/10 but be warned it will give you PTSD			"

								(REVIEW UPDATED 1/23/15)  Btw I died while playing as a Canadian soldier and screamed EH as I died. 12 out of 10 xD.________________________________________________________________________________  This game has gotten SO MUCH BETTER.  In December, I was really bothered by how the game didn't really feel like it was simulating trench warfare in a historically accurate way but the devs have recently added chemical weapons into the game.  This does SO MUCH for immersion because it forces soldiers to use gas masks and it's really terrifying because you can die with in 30 seconds if you don't use your gas mask.  Not to mention you can't see ANYTHING if the gas is in your area which makes everything so much more tense, realistic, and stressful.  The trench warfare is so much better too because when you invade another trench you are FORCED to run straight ahead into enemy lines just like real life soldiers had to do back then.  I forgot to mention that the graphics are 10 times better than they were originally and they just make this title shine like a hidden gem.  The only technical flaws with the game at the moment are that you will experience lots of bugs, lag, occasional crashes which will be dealt with in the future I'm sure, however, there are two things that I feel the devs can do to make Verdun an even more epic game.  The one problem that I have with the game on the whole is that you can make your own squad and let anyone in it be it your friends or strangers.  This sounds good but what REALLY ANNOYS ME is that if you leave your squad or quit the game, you'll see that random people have taken control of your squad and filled up all of the spots.  You can't really control what happens to your squad which is a real pain because your squad levels each round and basically YOU LOSE ALL OF YOUR PROGRESS IN THAT SQUAD because some random players have decided to take over the squad you made.  I WANT THE ABILITY TO CONTROL MY SQUAD COMPLETELY because it's my squad!!!!  I made it so my friends and I can play together but each and every time we play I have to make a new squad because some♥♥♥♥♥took my last squad!  M2H PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!    The last problem that I have with Verdun is that I think the devs need to let players choose a secondary weapon like a revolver, pistol, and so on.  It might change the balance of the game a little but I REALLY FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT a sniper and machinegunner in WWI didn't carry a sidearm to help them in close combat should their trench be invaded.  I also think that the grenadier class as well as any other class that has just a pistol as a gun (excluding the officer class) should be given a primary weapon like a rifle.  I'm pointing this out because the pistol is horribly innaccurate and takes WAY TOO LONG to master, plus, the only close combat you'll experience is when you are invaded/invading another trench which makes the pistol kind of useless.  I'm not sure if any of the ""pistol"" classes were given rifles in real life but I think it'll make the game a little bit easier for new players and bring in more players for the game.  The last thing I'd like to suggest to the devs is that I think it'd be really interesting to let there be servers that have 32 players and then make servers that have 40 players, it'll add even more realism to the game given that the battles in WWI were gigantic, especially the Battle of Verdun  Verdun has always been one of my favorite games in general and I'm so glad that the devs at M2H studios are true to their word because they are making a really stellar game here.  ***THERE IS ONE DETAIL YOU SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE GETTING THIS GAME BY THE WAY.****  Verdun is EXTREMELY TOUGH and you'll die more often than the times where you kill another player.  You'll be pulling your hair out at times especially if your new but once you get a kill in this game you feel like you've done the impossible and it'll moivate you to keep pushing forward.  I also love the fact that this game isn't like COD or BF where people get INSANE amounts of kills, the best players I've seen can get up to 60 kills tops but they're A VERY SMALL MINORITY.  Most players get like 10 kills or so on average because you and your troops are focussed on grabbing enemy territory which is EXACTLY what WWI was about.  Playing Verdun again has really just made me fall in love with it again and I can't recommend this game enough.  This is one of the best early access games out there and I PERSONALLY BELIEVE that this game should be in the top ten charts of best pc games AND I ALSO BELIEVE that the devs should try to get this game on consoles to further popularize this incredible title.My Score: 9.2/10			"

								So there I was. I had just finished smoking my pipe and replaced my wet socks for a dry pair. My day had started off as any usual day could be in the trenches; I shaved my face and had a hole in my pants patched up. Everything was exaclty the same as the day before ever since this bloody stalemate began. That was until the whistles began to blow. The enemy trenches echoed with chants and shouting as I peeked up to see silhouettes cresting the trench line. They were beginning their assault. Our squad leader rallied us all together to take our positions on the line. We fired shot after shot. Brass was beginning to stack up at our feet until finally, it seemed that the enemy had retreated back to the safety of their trench. They fell back leaving the wounded and dead to decorate the wasteland that lay in front of us. Our commanding officer began shouting orders but he was too far away to make out the words. Before i could catch my breath we were being signaled to begin our counterattack. I climbed over the wall and sprinted toward the enemy. I could see their line clearly now. I was getting close enough to see inside and i could see an opening that looked very inviting. I dove into the clearing and landed at the feet of 3 enemy troops. They had not seen me, so I opened fire! One down, two down, three! I had cleared the way for 2 more of my comrades to make it in. We began fighting our way down the trenchline clearing out our opposition. And boy was it a fight! We worked our way, foot by foot, deeper into enemy lines. Several of the men with me were taken out by sniper fire so I found myself alone yet again. I turned around to check my flank only to see gas billowing out toward me. I donned my mask as quickly as i could manage and hunkered down in a corner way. The glare from my mask lense, the crack of machine gun fire above my head, my heart beating so loud it almost drowned out the screams of wounded men. At that moment, I realized.... THIS GAME IS GREAT!			"

												I had been sitting in these trenches for what had felt like hours, maybe it was minutes, I couldn't tell. My squad and I were tasked with defending a spot on the German Third Line. I was with the French Army, I was only 20, dropped out of the University to join. I was waiting to spot something coming over those hills, anything at all. All you could see was the smoke on the horizon, and the distant sounds of gun and mortar fire. It was close to nightfall, all I had to eat was a stale piece of bread in the past 12 hours. It was almost pitch black when I saw something, I was almost positive it was something. I brought my Enfield up to my eyes to focus on that spot. My squad was spread to thin, I didnt know where they were, I was alone.         It had been 10 minutes since I heard anything. I was starting to think I was too tired, and was hearing things. Then I heard it again, the shuffle of something in the dirt, all my muscles tensed up. It was then when I saw the helmet, barely noticing it at all. The infamous german helmet, black and crowned with a spike. The man who came up looked as equally tired and hungry as me. I touched the cold trigger, it had been days since I last used it. The gun was loud, if I missed I would've died. I pressed the trigger, it hit something, he didnt go down. It hit the cannon behind him.         He looked up, right at my position. I went to pull my bolt back, and fire again. I knew I wouldnt miss again, the gun didnt fire it was jammed. I turned and ran, I had to get out of the trench. I turned the corner and stopped, I listened for any noises, I couldn't hear anything, I crouched and walked over to the ladder and climed out. I laid prone next to an abandoned wagon, it was destroyed probably by mortar fire. I laid there for the longest minutes of my life. My heart was still pounding and I thought it was screaming my position to the world. I saw the helmet again, around the same corner I was at just minutes ago. I waited for him to come around, I had a plan wait for him to pass, then shoot him from behind, he would never know, but instead he waited for hours. It was almost dawn, you could see the smallest glimpses of the sunlight.          I thought he left to report back to a much larger German force. I was ready to climb back in to my post, and write a report for my NCO. When he turned the corner, he just walked through, he was quiet, but seemed very unaware. He passed by, here was my chance to get him. I got up, and laid down, just then I felt a sharp piercing pain in my leg, I almost yelled. It was the barbed wire, it was everywhere in between trenches. He crouched to do something, he gave me time. I sat up to get my leg out, It was hard to get yourself out of barbed wire. I then got my arms stuck in it, I couldnt get my self out, I tried just pulling my limbs, It made my cuts deeper. I was quickly losing blood, I felt my life draining. I sat there staring at the sky, until death consumed me10/10, would die from barbed wire again			"

												The sirens call of the attack whistle. Constant volleys of artillery raining shrapnel and debris over your position. Gas obscuring the attackers as they flood into your trench. Your bolt action rifle only has three shots, but you face five Huns. Sound tasty? Verdun is for you.An extremely authentic and well done World War 1 shooter. Attention to detail is high and lethality is absolute. Work as a squad and defend your trench or attack No Man's Land under the cover of mustard gas and mortar fire. Extremely robust with lots of realistic handling weapons and high levels of historical research. It is fun? Yes. Is it for your average CODerper?  No. Grow some balls and fight the flippin' Kaiser.Game needs to be slightly more optimized, but other than that, its rock solid. "

												WWI quikscope simulator Early access done RIGHT. I purchased this game around November of 2014. I tried running it and my (now outdated) gaming laptop couldn't really run it at 30+ fps, which for me is a hard thing to get over. Well, they just released an update today with an engine overhaul and it is WAAAAY more optimized. I now can run it at 720p at 60 fps! It is really great to see a dev team put so much work into optimizing a title. As for the game, it is great, very similar to ""Red Orchestra"" in gunplay. Which is a good thing. Period correct weapons, realistic damage ratios, and great maps. I highly recommend it :)EDIT: Wow, it has come a LOOONG way and Verdun has officially graduated early access. Congratulations Black Mill!  You guys are a true shining example of dedicated developers :)  I think it is time I delve a little more into this one.  WWI is a war that is generally overshadowed by its counter-part WWII in the media.  There just really aren’t that many movies, books, and games about WWI.  “Verdun” aims to change that at least in the gaming realm.  The developers have done a lot of research as to accurately emulate all the weapons, battles, trenches, attire, and sounds of the Great War.  I remember the first time I pushed into the enemy’s trench, there was mustard gas everywhere we all had to put on our gas masks.  One player in our battalion told everyone to get on the ground as he hurled a grenade forwards.  We trudged our way through the bodies before us, now to defend the newly taken trench.  The combat in this game is SUPERB.  The weapons feel real and have a sort of realistic weight to them when firing and even moving.  Even the few sniper rifles in the game have the early period correct form of scope with a somewhat “fish eye” lens giving everything in it a bulbous look.  Honestly, I have no qualms about this game.  The engine is also GORGEOUS, I can't wait to max it out on my rig I will (hopefully) build soon.  Don’t expect your standard FPS game though, it is very strategic with periods where you CANNOT push and have to defend or you will be shot for desertion.  The times where you attack, are so exhilarating.  I generally avoid giving games a typical rating so I will just say this, BUY IT ALREADY			"

												Verdun is a unique FPS set on The Western Front. This game is all about skill and using your brain. No game I have seen quite captures the horror of warfare like this game. When navigating no man's land you stumble across mutilated blood stained corpses or dead horses. The landscape is horryfyinging beautiful, and you are constantly fearing artillery will blow you and your squad to bits or a machine gunner will gun down your team in a final attack. Almost everything about the game is unique about this game. In no ways is this game ""just another FPS"" it is one of the best FPS I have ever played. 9/10			"

Verdun is an amazing FPS shooter with beautiful graphics that goes back to warfare as it used to be and focuses on cooperative squad play.Verdun takes you away from what you seem to find in modern shooters and puts you back in good old trench warfare where you must rely on your squad-mates and teamwork to survive. Rather than gathering kill streaks for care packages and loading yourself up with perks you'll simply pick a position in a squad, adjust your loadout accordingly and you're thrown right into the trenches. Instead of an every-man-for-himself approach to things Verdun keeps the focus on teamwork and it achieves this by appointing an NCO (essentially a captain) to every squad who can issue orders throughout the game.The main gamemode of Verdun (and my personal favourite) is Frontlines where you'll find yourself and your squaddies playing tug-o-war for a long stretch of land, periodically pushing and attacking or retreating and defending. You'll find yourself dug into your trenches when you start and your first objective will either be repelling the enemies attack or attacking their trenches yourself. The attacking team will have strategic points along the enemy trenches which they must assault (the other team will be defending these points during this time). Your job as the attacker is to clear out the enemy trench claiming the land for yourself and once you do your enemies will be forced to retreat to a trench further back and hold that ground instead. On the other hand if the defenders succeed at repelling the attack they will keep hold of their land and immediately be able to launch an assault on the opposing team. This will continue back and forth until one team has taken all the land from the opponents and captured their HQ or until the time runs out in which case the win goes to the team holding the most land. Instead of rushing forward you'll have to plan your attack carefully, following any helpful commands your NCO may issue you along the way. Frontlines (like the rest of Verdun) rewards you for taking your time and scouting out your enemies and if you try to take a kamikaze approach to things you'll likely find yourself dying quickly and repeatedly. This is a major advantage to the game over many other FPSs as you'll find yourself learning to play properly and focus rather than hoping that a huge amount of luck will be on your side.There are other game modes besides Frontlines and these include: Attrition which is a team deathmatch style mode where you each have tickets which are lost upon someone dying. Once a teams tickets have been depleted the opposing team wins. Rifle Deathmatch is a free-for-all upon which you choose your weapons when you enter the game and can level those up by killing other players unlocking things such as bayonet attachments. The player with the most kills at the end is victorious. The last game mode is Squad Defense where you play single player in a squad and must defend against waves of oncoming AI enemies until you are eventually wiped out. Each game mode has it own allure but Frontlines is the most popular and you'll find the majority of players spend their time in that mode though you'll not have trouble finding games in the other modes. Squads are one of the main features of Verdun and there are 12 of these to choose from (if I'm correct). Squads have different perks and abilities which are unique to that squad and the same goes with the 'classes' you'll find within each one. Each squad is made up of four different 'classes' some of which include the Oberjäger or Guide, Scharfschütze or Tireur d'élite, Überwacher or Observateur and the Aufklärer or Éclaireur and each of these squads and classes have their own load-outs and play-styles. For example the Scharfschütze is a marksman class and prefers lots of distance between him and his unlucky targets, whereas the Aufklärer excels at melee and needs things to be up close and personal. Choosing which squad and class you play will greatly affect how your outcome so it'd recommend giving each squad/class a try until you find what is right for you because they truly all do play very different. Each squad will also have an NCO who will appoint attack and defend orders for the rest of the squad to carry out. Attacking/Defending these targets and/or remaining within your NCO's command range will award you with extra points and will help your squad level up unlocking various different things for you such as perks and even some additional classes. Although the desire to do your own thing can be strong the gameplay really is geared towards teamwork and you'll find very few situations where going solo reaps a better outcome than going as a group but the choice is still yours and you are not forced to follow orders. I think one of the graphics of Verdun are amazing and I find myself admiring them every time I play. The attention to detail and sparce placement of objects adds to the immersiveness in-game and together with the artillery bombing and rifles sounds going off creates a perfect war atmosphere. Also the in-game community seems to be refreshingly nice which is a rarity in most first person shooters I've played so that was welcome. Rather than abuse there seemed to be a lot of friendly interaction between people and players were willing to help when a question was asked.My only issue with Verdun is the fact it can be very difficult at first and some may find that offputting. It took me a good few games until I really felt comfortable and at first  it was frustrating feeling like I couldn't move without being killed. This quickly changes though if you're willing to take a game or two of hardcore defeat and soon you'll find yourself playing as well as you would in any other FPS.I can see why Verdun came highly recommended to me as it is a stand out game in the FPS genre. The gameplay, though challenging, is very rewarding and actually feels like a war game in terms of realism. Anyone looking for a realistic trench warfare experience with solid gameplay need look no further as this more than hits the spot. A must try for HARDCORE fans of the genre and those looking for a true challenge, immersive graphics and a great community. "

It's cold, I can't remember the last time I had a dry uniform. I haven't slept in days. I haven't fired my weapon in awhile. I'm not even sure if it works anymore, I check the chamber – unsure if the ammo is compromised from being saturated. I steady myself against a tree; just outside the trench to gain some purchase on the ground ahead. Everything is the color of dirt. I look down the sights just to see if I can even focus my eyes anymore -- waiting – watching for a silhouette to break the horizon. Unabated, unreasoning taut muscles, tediously straining to remain steady; lest my pack betray my position...  I just want to go home. For the sake of brevity..Genre tags: FPS, WWI, semi-realistic, Multiplayer only Value Proposition: A+, Unconventional yet familiar shooter BSERC - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): WWI version of The Red Orchestra 2 Concomitant Exposition and SummationVerdun is a rather remarkable game, bullets really count. You truly need your keep your head down, for there is no shortage of people ready to give you a premature haircut. There are only a few modes, the main one being frontlines. Wherein you and three other people form squads that will fill out your extended team, each with classes with specific abilities. Having a good NCO for example, marking where enemy emplacements are and calling in artillery strikes can turn the tide. There are also grenadier, scout and gunner positions. This mode is essentially endless attrition, constant turnover of taking positions offensively and defending them. It can be very frantic, it can also be very slow and methodical. The other modes are fun but less inspired. Free-for-all rifles only or full arsenal team deathmatch. Unfortunately it's rather often that these modes have a low player count. THE GISTThis game is likely exactly what you think it is from looking at a few seconds of screenshots. And that isn't a bad thing. Personally I feel like its got a ton of heart. Its got a groove to it's step. As long as the player count stays consistent and hopefully grows this game holds a niche FPS variant that I don't think is going away.Follow my curation page for more.

												Honestly, this is the only true ww1 game on  the market, but it has set the bar high. It is fun, atmospheric and overall an amazing experience. Here are the pros and a few cons:Pros:-Amazing maps, unique and strategy changing-Amazing gear, all historically accurate-Amazing progression system, makes you want to work for it-Amazing NCO abilities-Amazing Atmosphere-Amazing Free DLC-Amazingly Consistent UpdatesCon:-Small performance issues since update 200; not a big deal :PThis is a wonderful and amazing game, great for playing with friends OR random strangers. This game deserves more exposure, and even a console release to ease the console lover's desire for more world war games, which i know for a fact they want. :D Get this game if you enjoy shooters, tactical gameplay, camaraderie,explosions and more! :DDisclaimer: Has a learning curve,and you will die a LOT. It's WW1, after all. :P			"

												The game went from peasant to billionaire a massive improvement from early acess to official release . As for someone who bought the game the moment the tag world war one popped up upon the steam store seriously caught tons of attention what can i say about it first a glitch machine. Now this game is like butter on stove by far a smooth tasty butter. Now what the game has that you want - - Historical world war one weaponary rifles/ machine guns and statics- One and only stonelone trench atmosphere- Featuring Rifle Deathmatch- Beautiful Graphics with multiple options- Afforable price for a FPS on world war one- Timeline EncyclopediaThe feels and sound effects makes this game a master piece  and is very recommended for red orchestra fans :)      9/10 Tag - Historicans gamers must get !

												I have compared this game with Battlefield and would like to address why I favour Verdun, should I get a choice of which to play with a friend (and why I think you should pick it ;D) The main point is realism.Verdun and Battlefield 1 are both set in WW1, both with varying levels of realism. The better of the two in this case is Verdun. Verdun provides not only a more realistic array of weapons, but also sets up a more authentic atmosphere over all with the anxiety and discomfort everywhere within a trench (while BF1 uses hardly as many trenches as Verdun). The recently added gore and gibs and blood (lovely sights in battle) further add to this effect of the feeling that the player feels like they're actually in the war. In Battlefield 1, there is no such dismemberment and huge amounts of blood anywhere. Battlefield 1 also generally feels way too technologically advanced on part of any country at that time to actually fit it with the authentic WW1 experience.Bonus points go for: The price of this game (cheaper than BF1 for sure).A very ""historical"" community (a lot of people naming squads after those of their relatives etc.)An actual trench layout with No Man's Land guaranteed (and little cover for maximum decimation.Pretty darn good devs and community members in terms of helping you with bugs, for example. I hope this review helped YOU in making a decision on whether or not to buy this game :)			"

												Verdun....what a gameI was late to Verdun, after all my time I cannot consider myself a veteran yet and thats how strong the community is. Verdun is not a fad, it is something you stick to and never part from. Since reaching level 100 I may not play as much anymore but everyday I check the forums for the lively community.But the game, man the game is good... I have been to Ypres twice, seen the rows of tombstones and the fields of Flanders that saw some of the worst fighting in human history. Verdun does not glorify this, it is subtle in its ways yet it is also the best representation. When gas lands on top of you, you will panic to put your gas mask on as soon as possible. It's a game, the player in real life will not actually be crippled by the gas as its in the game, yet for a moment sitting at your computer you will panic and then think ""Man, people actually had to endure that"" The same goes for the sound of a well aimed bullet killing the man next to you, you hit the ground knowing if you poke your head up for a moment you will die. This is what I mean by subtle, it doesnt exagerrate the First World War, it portrays the war as it was, a war that coined the term ""Shell Shock"" Does it lack depth? Yes I wont deny the game has its limitation with it being an indie game but what it does have is amazing. The main mode you will focus on is frontlines, a turn based attack and defend mode which is hectic and brutal. you WILL be cut down by an mg as you advance on their trench, you WILL be pounded with artillery as the enemy attempt to dislodge your defence and you WILL be in for some close combat when you are clearing a trench. The best games you have ever played can be loses, as you push back the enemy from your final trench. It is beyond hardcore, my first game saw me getting one kill and around twenty deaths as I thought ""Hey I wonder if I just poke my head up above the trench quickly I might get a kill"" *crack* headshotted. Ever wondered what the bottom of a shell crater looks like? Well get ready as thats what you will see a lot of as a Lewis gun is pumping rounds over your head in effort to push you back. The greatest rush can be diving into the enemy trench alone and doing your best to hold the foothold whilst clearing the enemy out as quickly as possible, the greatest relief being the sight of a friendly reinforcements diving in to help you.Verdun is a game that is always changing, new FREE DLC has been teased for some time by a hard working team of devs who always keep the players in the loop regarding development. So watch this space EDIT: The new dlc dropped recently! Over a good number of weeks players were allowed to work on the beta for the dlc to help the devs iron out issues and that was a great idea! It shows just how enthralled the community is with this game. As for the FREE dlc its more squads and new weapons of war which add all new play styles, a new map and Squad Defence which is a wave defence mode against bots that you can play with your friends (Like Nazi Zombies, but WW1 and no Zombies and no stupid power ups...so its not like Nazi Zombies) There is also gore which brings the horrors of war to life in powerful, shocking and yet respectful ways. Another reason to get this game, there is still more to comeOne personal note for this game. I am a history nerd and the second world war is my area of expertise (I use that for want of a better term as I am no expert and to use ""Passion"" would be cliche). I played Verdun and became enthralled with the First World War. On that note do not expect Red Orchestra, two different wars and two different games and Verdun plays very differently as did the first world war. Verdun dares to be different and it pulled it off with the best historical shooter PERIOD. It is fun, it is real, it is historical and I cannot fault this game. Buy this game, die, kill, charge into hell and back and hopefully I will see you out thereGott Mit Uns			"

The ""Horrors of War""As the nations march bodily to war, springing from their age-old places in the rich, civilised continent of Europe, the clock ticks downwards for those on the front. Swept in a wave of excitement and fervour, the gullible and hopeful grab their best clothes, train tickets, pocket watches, running to jump into a place in the new armies... those wary, those intellectuals and pacifists those who thought differently, beaten up, trodden down, bullied by their own families into taking an ill-fated place in one of the most horrific, brutish and uncaring moments in modern human history.We know the outcome now... how many of them knew? And will you let it happen again?You say you'll ""never forget"". I think you already have.At this moment, 17:11 GMT on the 23rd March 2016, the gigantic free DLC ""Horror's of War"" has just been released. Dozens of new players that I have never seen before have crawled out of the woodwork in a flurry of excitement. Over the last nine months the developers of Verdun have teased weekly snippets of information, details on mechanical changes, new features and optimisation patches. A quick ruffle of clothes, digital shouts of excitements, and this Wednesday evening has been long awaited. Time to settle some old scores.It's also my one-year anniversary of playing the game.Restocked and RelockedThe number of squads has almost doubled, with the addition of US Marines, Doughboys, Belgian troops, German schutzen sentries, and German pioniers, in addition to the previous German Stosstruppen, Landsers, Alpenjaeger, British Tommies, French Poilu, Canadian Assault teams, and more. Forty new weapons have been added, including the ""Wex"" flammenwerfer, the G88, the Mauser C96 ""Broomstick"" pistol, the BAR automatic rifle, and the T-Gewehr with hide-out penetrative bullets. New squad abilities have been added, including Big Bertha, 340mm Railway cannon, smokescreens and White Phosphorus barrages.A Revival of the OldAlmost all of the animations in the game have been renewed; overhauled, they are smoother and more realistic than before; death animations have been added, each nation now has it's own unique gasmask.The most anticipated part of the update is the key ""Horrors"" expansion, replete with and stuffed with savage gore. This includes dismemberment, improved ragdoll physics, death animations, screams, bloody pools, skin melting, and more corpses. This is, however, purely optional; if you have little interest in such a grotesque paradigm, then the toggle button is in the options menu.New ObjectivesA new map has been implemented; in addition to the recent Fort Douaumont map, the night-time Champagne region, the most ambitious map yet, complete with underground tunnels, sandbags and trench walls is here to stay. Expect high volumes of shrapnel, machine-gun fire and keep your ears open for the sound of spitting fire.A new fourth gamemode has been added, a co-operative wave-assault online mode, ""Squad Defence"", where you and some sullen survivors of a forlorn assault attempt to survive against dozens of AI opponents rushing your position. They're pretty dim, and a bit buggy at this time, but they're still difficult to defend against. The Little ThingsWith all these gigantic changes, it's easy to miss out on the smaller things. Ten new gramophone songs have been added, rifles now eject spent cases, textures have been fixed.  New loadout descriptions, you can no longer sight down your rifle and jump, buffs for the terrible French Chauchat, an extra bullet for the Ruby in the name of historical accuracy, gas blinds faster, is less slightly less visible, slightly more lethal and makes a sounds upon impact... Oh, and it's on a new and updated Unity version too.With this nine-month in-the-waiting free expansion pack, Verdun is no longer the game it was; in a digital renaissance it has become much more, building anew on the ruins of the old.Verdun is the realest, dankest most bomb-diggity Great War game on Steam. So buckle up bros, grab your Chauchats chums, strap on your helmet homies, roll up your kitbag kiddos and ""Avec moi"", monseigueurs, 'cause swaggity swooty, we're going for all kinds of booty. Olé!As a forum member once said;""So, i own this bum game and i cant stand movements and recoil crap, but this is a lesser issue than that, i mean this game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Eterosexual bane, mostly cause every player is Male and they need to get rid of their sexual needs somehow, and that obiviously mean every player had an homosexual experience at least once. Im going refund this crap before homosexuality get me too. Whoever thinks this is a good game is clearly gay/lesbian as well.""Thanks for reading. As a reward, here's some music:

Early Access Review
								Developers offer great content all the way through. Since I started playing and bought the game in spring-summer the game seemed clunky, incomplete, laggy etc. etc. However, with gas warfare and new maps, new squads it all starts to take shape. Don't listen to people who say otherwise, take a look for yourself on the effort the developers put to make this a good WW1 FPS. It is the only one, but it's good for an entry into the field. Especially for an indie company.The gameplay reminds me strongly of Red Orchestra 2 mixed with Call of Duty and Battlefield-like mechanics, but with a trench twist. I have faith that the game will evolve. It definately feels right with that ""Nothing New on the Western Front"" touch. The Christmas Truce event is a prime example of the attention to detail. It is a game well worth investing into.Update 25.07.2016: refinements upon the original structure certainly polished this product and make it worthy for comparison in it's own way to the coming Battlefield 1.In the future more content is expected here for other fronts, crossing out DLC to the maximum. The most in not free content we can get is expansions. Recently included changes are:- night battles-- a cooperative stand off mode, like survival in Left for Dead/No More Room in Hell/Call of Duty World at War- overhauled sound design, music, sounds- changes to ragdoll physics- furuther bug hunting, adjustments, balancing  and et cetera...This is stil a vastly great game not constrained by narrow profit oriented goals in development, while still providing a WW1 shooter that can be enjoyed without extreme lenghs of deapth for core  players alike in ArmA. Though I think an additional game mode would no be objected to by anyone! The road to a true WW1 experience is not yet at its end.			"

												Verdun is both incredibly good and bad at the same time. The things it does well, however, outweigh the bad.Good:-Fear of dying leads to a very unique experience-Gamemodes don't get old very quick-Great for hardcore players-Community is generally respectful and just wants to enjoy the game as wellBad:-Optimization is poor (To run at 50 frames on my laptop, I need to lower the graphics so far that the game looks like Battlefield 2... speaking of which, I run Project Reality Battlefield 2 at higher frames than this game even though this game looks worse on low graphics...)-Graphics aren't the best even when turned up (Expect lots of clipping)-Movement feels extremely clunky and poorly done, and from what I've heard, it's been getting worse in each patchThe good things far outweigh the bad, in my opinion. You'll never find another game where you fear popping your head over the trench lines so much. Gas is also horrifying - if you stand in it for about 3 seconds, you lose your vision, fall to the ground, choke for a few seconds, and if you didn't put your mask on by this time, you die slowly. That leads me to the third point - the gore (While optional) should be turned to ultra while playing this game. Seeing people squirming and writhing really hits home with the point of this game - World War 1 was hell. People get their arms shot off, people choke to death on Cyanide gas, and people get entangled in razor wire all around you. Seeing all of this will make you really feel as if you ARE this poor sap on the fronts of Douaumont Fort or Ardennes. The shooting mechanics couldn't be better - this game is 90% one-shot-one-kill. If you are hit even once by a rifle round anywhere, you end up being part of the scenery. This just makes machine gun fire even more terrifying - and that's all the fun of Verdun! Verdun also has vehicles, however they are all non-driveable. Certain squads can, for example, call in a bomb to be dropped from a plane, however they do not drive the plane - they are simply calling in an AI, kind of similar to a killstreak in Call of Duty. Certainly this game isn't for everyone - if you want a reactive, responsive World War 1 shooter with vehicles and huge battlefields, look to Battlefield 1. However, if you want a terrifying, historically accurate, realistic, and exhilarating experience full of trench warfare, you should join me on the frontlines.			"

Early Access Review
								I've done enough hours to now provide an honest review. In a nutshell -well worth the money even though it's currently in Beta. There is a small developer team that are active and constantly improving  the gameplay. The community in this game is supportive and constructive as a whole. Having come directly from Rising Storm / Heroes of Stalingrad there are similarities; differences are evident in the weapon dynamics,hit location, movement and tactics. There are no tanks to help  storm through defences , disrupt and draw enemy fire. Verdun is a meat grinder where every trench held or taken is often paid for in lives.The battlefield terrain for each map is well researched, each map is a challenge in it's own right. The graphics now are more detailed especially in ultra settings. Rag doll physics lead to some interesting positions for the dead. Animations will likely need to be improved especially those poor devils hit by artillery. Currently they fly through the air intact.Each match is a battle of frontal assault in attack and defence with high casualty figures reaped from the attackers due to the channelling effect of wire, small arms, grenades,machine guns, artillery and gas. Weapons are deadly in their own right and it is easy to see why the Mauser and .303 SMLE were retained and improved. As you progress in the game in points you get weapon and ability unlocks according to the role you choose in each team you join. There are some very good players in the game and these may tend to pack together as team unlocks are much faster. Beginners can level these masters with one shot, team dynamics, positioning  and player ability are the deciders in both holding and taking trenches.The question is can you survive the fire get through  and make a breach in the defence? Once you are in the enemy trench start to clear it - exploit the enemy backs with your trusty weapon bayonet / melee weapon team while they face and shoot your side. Reducing the firepower at your team. As a defender can you drive the enemy away within your field of fire, do you need to move and protect another section of trench? All the while remaining situationally aware of a potential enemy invading your trench. In game smoke shells or poison gas plays a deadly role in masking both attackers and defenders adding to the claustrophobic condition of the trench interiors and no mans land where you must adjust to the fighting in a gas mask.There are some very good players in the game and these may tend to pack together as team unlocks are much faster.Achievement hunters and badge collectors will get plenty of mileage from the game. So far no hackers detected apart from a bug glitch / exploit that has now been corrected. My experience of game server activity when I have been on - the US  is by far the most active; Australian / Asia Pacific servers improve in the afternoons and Europe is fairly quiet due to the time difference (gamers are sleeping). I can say you will always get a game with the ping issues not too bad. Personally I have always done well either with low or high ping when the end game scores come in.Look forward to seeing you in game.			"

												Verdun is a realistic WW1 FPS. Unlike Battlefield 1 Verdun offers a more authentic ww1 experience ( fighting is basied off of trenches and not just running around willy dilly) with almost %100 historical accuracy. PROS:-Realistic trench warfare-Huge selection of authentic ww1 era small arms to unlock-Very emersive gameplayCONS:-Not a whole lot of active players-You need a somewhat recent GPU to run this (960+)-Can be very frustrating at timesConclusion: If you care about realism a all, this game is for you. If you like being almost fully emersed into games, this game is for you. If you like WW1 history, this game is defentely for you. Overall i would give Verdun a 9/10 for its amazing gameplay and historical accuracy.			"

Early Access Review
								Verdun,This game has to be one of the first and only ww1 shooters out there as of right now.I personally have been waiting for a ww1 shooter such as this and it brings me great joy to finally have a game to review like this. So far from what iv seen the accuracy when it comes to the history is spot on, each weapon looks fantastic and almost identical to the service version issued at those times. Right now its generally Germans vs the French, but the developers have mentioned the canadians being added which is huge considering canadas roll in ww1.Another fantastic thing about this game is the way it structures the combat, making you take objectives and hold them rather than giving the player a sandbox unrealistic feel that most FPS allow. It only makes sense that once you have taken an enemy trench that you should defend it against counter attack before even thinking about assaulting the next objective. And with that being said Verdun gets 9/10 for original content and gameplayVERY promising future for this game, and is worth purchasing if your a fan of World war First person shooters.This game is worth buying, there is enough content to play this game for a long time			"

												Verdun! First looking at the trailers and such like half a year before writing this, i didn't think much of it, but i decided to give it a shot when it was on sale on christmas. And what a christmas it became....TL;DRPros+Epic atmosphere+Great core gameplay+Authenticity (To some extent)+MUSTARD GAS+Squad based gameplayCons-Arcady BS elements (Such as hitmarkers, crosshairs, score/kill feed)(Disabling above mentioned BS (hitmarkers, crosshairs) will handicap you.)-No dedicated serversAnd for those who want a little reading..!-------------------------------------------------------------Verdun has a truly epic atmosphere and it gives the player a true trench warfare experience. The game starts you off with some classic music from the era, and right from the start puts you in the right mood to crawl in mud attacking... Or to bitterly fight for every last inch of your trench. So, instead of vague flags or areas, you're fighting for actual trenches and not just some 10x10 meter area on the map. The core gameplay is very simple and it WORKS. If you start off as the attacking team, your team will (hopefully) give its best shot at attacking the enemy trench and try to capture it. If the attack fails, you have to fall back to your trench and its the opposing teams time to attack. However, if you manage to capture the enemy trench, a counterattack will be ordered and you have to go from offensive to defensive really fast to keep it. In theory the whole match CAN be just one attack phase, if the attacking team is fighting fanatically enough, and the defenders holding ground steadfast.All those times you've been THIS close to capturing the enemy trench, but you run out of momentum and have to fall back, is just what trench warfare is all about. I cannot put in words how satisfying it feels when capturing the enemy trench after a long stalemate of neither side gaining any victories, but then... You finally manage to do it and prepare for the enemy counterattack. And it feels really really good to take the enemy trench and If all goes well and you repulse the counterattack, then its time to put your skills to the test on the next trench.However, the arcady crosshairs and kill feeds and all that scoregarbage eat this atmosphere away, but not enough to ruin the experience, atleast for me. Sure, you can disable the crosshair, or bind the whole hud under a button to show it, but this puts you at a disadvantage, so it would be just handicapping yourself. And for the love of god.... HIT MARKERS WHY???????? But overall, the gameplay is nice, it could be alot better if they had decided to nurture this atmosphere the game has AND REALISM, instead of the crap i mentioned just now.It has leveling and whatnot too, but you can't get a dramatic boost over a noob with just the unlocks.... unless it's the squad unlocks. Squad level can only be raised by playing with your friends, over and over again, which is nice. The squad level can basicly turn your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little mortars into a real artillery storm. Oh and you can unlock mustard gas, damn is that deadly.Overall i'd give it a 7/10. It's very fun, Best enjoyed with friends!See you in the trenches, comrades. And remember, Keep calm & STELLUNG HALTEN!I Might Write more to this review when i have the time :D			"

												Where to start?  There's only one way to describe the decline of this game. Tragic. Why tragic? I bought this game in January of 2015 and between then and May, this game was perfect. Hit detection was not too bad, Machineguns weren't so buggy and FPS was good enough to make the game playable. However, when the DEVs started to add useless eye candy, messing around with MG deployment, fixing the hit box, etc. the game was essentialyl ruined. Playing Verdun feels more like an obligation rather than an enjoyment since I'm in a clan mainly because the pure characteristics of the game prevent me from even playing it. Point blank shots to the chest don't kill people all the time, 5 stabs in the back don't kill people anymore, barbed wire can stop a bullet from hitting someone, the actual MG can block the bullets to protect the gunner and so on and so forth. My FPS dropped from 60 FPS back in April to around 15-25 FPS these days, on all low graphics. Picardie was by far my favourite map back in April and May because it was big and open and it was fun to play. Now that map is impossible to play and less enoyable than Flanders for me purely because the DEVs added useless eye candy like dead horses, cooking stoves, chairs, tables, etc. that lowered my FPS, decreased the amount of well-aimed shots that would get registered and overall just made that map incredibly laggy. The only reason why I say all this is because I care a lot for this game. This is one of my favourite games ever and I will continue to play no matter how much worse it gets. I go back to my original statement; the DEVs have managed to ruin their own game when it was so good. People don't care about the eye candy and the graphics nearly as much as they care about actually being able to play the game properly. The core community here isn't the new players who buy the game when it goes on sale, the core community is the people who have owned thsi game for a while and play it regularly. People from clans like KK, Pirates, Crossed Rifles, etc. are constantly complaining on the forums about problems with the game yet, instead of fixing the game the DEVs make it worse. The DEVs listen more to the new players who want this added and that added and that removed and hat changed and this improved, etc. None of our concerns have really been addressed. This games ahas just recently gone competitive with a Verdun League, yet we might not be able to continue with the league fi the game basically favour speople with a better computer. How is this in any way fair? When the Verdun League was originally conceptualised, the game was perfect, it coudl be played in a competitive environment. Now, I really don't think it can. Now for those of you reading this to see if you want this game, here's what I have to say. Even if the game becomes unplayable to the point where it's s truggle to get even 10 kills, I will still play this game EVERY day because it's one of a kind and no matter how much I hate the DEVs for ruinign this game, I appreciate the fact that they care about their game and even though they have released it they conitnue to try and fix their game.

What is Verdun?It's surprisingly difficult to find a WW1 game out there, and even more tough to find a good one. Verdun defies expectations with its historical accuracy when it comes to trench warfare, and its realism where one shot can be fatal.Verdun is a Unity-based game, and as such, it runs great and looks great. Battlefields are detailed enough to create a decent environment, however they still aren't as great as other games (such as Insurgency). You play as a soldier fighting on the front lines in World War 1, where much of the war is fought in trenches dug into the ground and gas attacks are common. You and your squad need to work as a team to cover all angles and play well. Here are some of the pros and cons.Pros+ Good community+ Team-based gameplay+ Few performance issues+ A different kind of FPS, not generic whatsoeverCons- Environment could be a bit more detailed- Few full servers- Lacks return-appeal- Multiplayer onlyIs it worth it? For sure. I would recommend buying it on sale though, you can snag a great deal.So, long story short:Verdun is excellent at bringing a long past due change of pace to the FPS genre, but has a few caveats which you should be aware of.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group "

The verdict:Very solid body damage & blood spilling (though not without issues), exceptional burning mechanics. The mess stays for a pretty long while, though not permanent. The best part is the exceptionally long death animations that function as a disabled state, which is a key part of the experience.All in all the experience is exceptional.			"

												Verdun is an engaging historical shooter that makes good use of its World War 1 setting. The central game mode sees each team starting in their own trench with one team attacking and one defending. If the attackers can't get a foothold in three minutes, they go on the offense while the other team switches to defense. If the attacking team get a foothold in the enemy trench, the time is extended. If the attackers capture the enemy trench, they must defend against a counter-attack before attacking the next enemy trench line. This is a great game mode that feels historically accurate and also means that if one team is struggling on the offense, after a few minutes they will go on the defense so it never turns into a frustrating meat-grinder for either team. Trying to get across No Mans Land as the attackers is absolutely terrifying, while fighting in the trenches is tense and exciting. Several historically pertinent mechanics like Gas attacks that force you to put on a view-limiting gas-mask, or barbed wire you can get tangled in instead of just being a wall, add to the atmosphere and the gameplay in a meaningful way. The squad system means that you are given access to a good variety of weapons and abilities, although you will need to enjoy bolt-action rifles to have fun with this game. Some rifles feel all-around better than others, which while historically accurate can lead to some frustrating gameplay if you get stuck with a class that uses one of the lesser rifles. While the game in its current state is totally playable, it would benefit greatly from some spit-and-polish. Ragdolls are jittery and can break immersion. Hit detection leaves much to be desired. The current system for joining servers has you picking a squad instead of a server, and you can't see what the ping is when doing this. However I seem to have exactly the same ping no matter what server I join, which makes me think all of the servers are centralized which is not ideal. Overall if you enjoy games like Red Orchestra 2 or Insurgency and are interested in the WW I setting, Verdun is a game I would highly recommend. The central game mode is excellent and the maps are generally well designed with one or two exceptions that have huge no-mans land zones that are impossible to make it across in the given time as the attackers.

True Story- Joined a French squad called ""French Fries"".- We actually play as a team.- We start sneaking along the edge of the map toward the enemy Trench.- Our team fails to get a foothold and we have to retreat.- Gas kills one of my squad mates, his finals words were ""HOW 2 PUT ON MASK"".- We make a mad dash across No Mans Land, trying to get back to our own Trench.- Squad Leader is running beside me and he gets shot in the back, he falls over and writhes around screaming in pain.- Only 2 of us left.- I get back to our Trench.- I see my last squadmate running toward me, he gets within arms reach of me before being shot in the back of the head.- I feel the PTSD coursing through my veins.- Artillery shell lands right in front of my face and blows my left arm off.0/10 this game made me cry.

								Pure trench warfare! Your fightin in the mud, clawing the ground, inching forward to take enemy positions, just to get caught in barbed wire. Lots of fun. I have fps issues, freezes and lag from time to time. You need really good rig if you wanna run it on high settings. There are a few buggy spots on the map where u can get stuck in places where you shouldn't. It also seems sometimes you get shot through areas you shouldnt. Could use a little polish, but i reccomend. Frenchies. ;)			"

								One of the best games i have played in a while. A WW1 FPS game is a must buy. The frontline mode realy displays the mass death and destruction of the trenches. The Rifle Death Match is a great way on learning the basics of the bolt action rifles and how to fight through both no mans land and the trenches. All i can say to the DEVS is keep up the good work this game should be a reminder tom future generations what happened almost 100 years ago which help formed the world we live in.			"

Early Access Review
								Excellent game about almost forgotten era in gaming. Been playing it about a year (i think) and while its still in early access, it feels and plays out as real and finished game- did so when i bought it way back. I honhestly hesitated to buy it when it was on sale, because while as history geek i always wanted ww1 game, i never tought it actually had potential to be fun. Well, i was wrong about latter part- this game is fun as hell!Graphics are great- maybe not best, but atmosphere they create is fantastic.Sound department is also great, as is weapons, squads (basically factions- currently it has 7 squad types (3 for central powers (i.e germans), 4 for entente (2 french, 1 canadian and 1 british) split in 2 factions (entente and central powers). Each squad type is split into 4 unique classes, so you got plenty to discoverHowever, if you expect fast-paced combat like call of duty is, you have to look elsewhere, as this game plays out bit more like Red Orchestra, though bit more arcade-y. You need teamwork to win- killing every enemy doesnt bring you victory or even most points. You have to defend when, well, you defend and attack when you (isnt it obvious) attack. Always try to stay in target trench thoughThere are still some faults however, such as some classes start with only melee weapon (and melee weapons are near useless in Verdun game), you can very easily get killed when completely in cover (according to devs, it will be fixed next update).What makes this game even better, however, is multiple experience types- each class has its own xp meter, 4 levels, each with unique weapon selection. Also you have personal xp meter, which ups your rank and also squad xp (to encourage you to play with friends), which gives you later war uniforms and better artillery.Basically there is so much positive about this game that few minor bad things are basically irrelevant. I could go on and on about this game, but i stop here.buy it. you wont regret it.			"

												After more than 122 hours into the game (and this doesn't happen frequently) I'd like to share my honest opinions about Verdun - the good, the bad and the buggy.***UPDATE 12/08/2015***After the supposedly full-fledged release, I have to give to Verdun a thumb down based upon many crucial points where the game deliberately fails. But let’s speak about positives first:Pros- well-designed extensive maps inspirited by real battlefields of WWI- satisfying and challenging gunplay- broad gameplay variability based upon different classes to play with- required cooperation between squad players in order to win - friendly and helpful community - solid optimizationVerdun is a good game, very good indeed but it fails to deliver the most crucial game experience:Cons- nothing like an immersive WWI trench warfare experience Well, WWI looked anything but this. Few players camping throughout a waste battlefield make the game pretty infuriating and in time it only gets worse. Verdun will become BORING for many players as it became for me and this lack of players is exactly what buries the game underground. Not to mention another great problem with- feels like still playing BETABefore the supposedly full game release, there was a lot updates and a lots of gigs to download, containing some bug fixes but now, the game is in the same state as it was in beta. I was very disappointed about this literally forced 1.0 release and I'm still waiting for major upgrades in shady areas like- infuriating lagIn the game which is more or less about precision I fail to comprehend how it is possible for developers not to improve upon teleporting moving players which happens all the time!I'd like to blame myself for mistakes I do in game like Verdun where I die constantly, but this is deliberately very bad coding and no one seems to give a f__k.- buggy bugs The game even though it is supposed to be now in a full release state still suffers from numbers of persisting bugs and lags. I'm convinced developers will fix majority of them in time, because they really care about their product, which is worth mentioning again. Do I recommend this game? It depends to whom. I have no hesitation of recommending Verdun to anyone interested in WWI warfare even though it fails to deliver the genuine experience but for a casual player the game might quickly become boring and frustrating. I've spent over 120 hours into the game and I don't regret it, neither the investment, 'cause it was a very FUN to PLAY, but I don't think I'll play again until the core game mechanics will be improved.

												War.War never changes.I've lost count on how many times I died. I died from clubs, shovels, knives to a bayonet. With grenades, pistols, rifles or machine guns. Being gassed, smoked out or mortar shelled. Hell, even cooked by a flamethrower.Yet somehow I always come back alive. Surrounded by my squadmates, we wait for the enemy to come. We can hear the whistles, the battlecries the sound of boots running through mud, over half buried who knows what it was. It's coming closer. For a second everything is silent. And then all hell breaks loose.The machine guns start firing, officers shouting something and the sound of your squadmate reloading his rifle.You seem something moving in the corner of your eye, you turn and see your squadmate falling on the floor. His rifle laying empty beside him.You feel yourself fill with rage as you charge the enemy who killed him with your bayonet, killing him instantly. And silence once again.The fear creeps back into your heart as you know what's coming next.And then you hear it. Officers shouting the order, loud and clear:Over the top boys! Charge!You get up, start running from cover to crater to cover. You're almost there and then it starts.That dreadfull sound of machine guns firing.			"

												This game does a fantastic job of capturing the details of the weaponry, terrain, and uniforms of the Great War. As a military historian, this game is easily in my top 10 games out of sheer respect for said attention to detail and for the hard work the game developers and designers put into the game, which is apparent every time I open up Verdun. Thank you for creating such a tribute to the Great War and for building interest in the gaming community for this tumultuous, yet fascinating, period. Despite not being a dedicated FPS player, I will continue to revisit this game and appreciate the chance to shoot a Chauchat, call in a mortor strike, or clear trenches with a Ruby pistol and ""Le Vengeur."" In addition, thank you for showing your appreciation to your players by releasing such quality DLC. Again, this is soundly in my top 10 games, and easily my most played FPS. I strongly recommend this game to anyone who loves history, wants to experience the Great War, or is looking for a different kind of FPS. Keep your heads down, trompe la mort, and take the fight to the next trench. Just remember, when the time comes to defend your ground, On ne passe pas!			"

								I watched a WW1 Documentary once, and in it, I remember a veteran of the war (it was an old documentary) saying how no one was scared when going ""over the top"". I couldn't imagine how anyone could resist being scared when you're RUNNING INTO RIFLE FIRE. But then I got this game. And even though my life isn't on the line when going over the top, I can still feel that adrenaline rush the veteran described. But enough about that. Here are some pros/consPROS+ Historically accurate weapons+ Chance to mutter rascist terms about the French, Brit, Canadians, Germans, Americans, etc. while killing them. + Great gas mechanics+ Real-life gun events (e.g. rifle jamming)+ Well-done maps+ Diverse classes and specializations+ Getting revealed via pointy hatCONS- Laggy- Odd shooting mechanicsOverall: 8.2/10 game, easily. I would recommend buying it, especially if you're a World War buff.			"

												I am a big ol' nerd for historical accuracy in media, whether it is Video Games, Movies, or Television. So it's not a very big surprise that I like Verdun so much. With the realistic trench warfare and period-setting weaponry, this game provides a special era of atmosphere. I am a big fan of this game but it is a grueling mess to get into. Adapting from Modern Shooters with their run-and-gun mechanics to Verdun in it's Sit in a Trench and Pray they don't gas you harder than a bathroom at Taco Bell. This game is great for those who want variety in their FPS's.			"

												This game is not comparable to BF1 really, albeit I enjoy BF1 more, they are both great games. BF1 is large scale battles with vehicles etc... (as well as a couple smaller scale engagement modes). Verdun is strictly small engagement trench warfare. It feels completely different. I like them both, however people need to stop comparing them to try and sway people to play this game. It finds its niche among high skill ceiling fps players (of which I am not).			"

												Been having a good time in this.First.. runs great! The graphics are very nice, you feel the mud, feel the cold.. and hope your mask is on tight as you crawl through gas..Gameplay is tough, intense and fun. Actually listening to the NCO's of your team / squad works, and important... No crazy FPS action here, no rocket jumps, no wonder super weapons.. just digging / jumping / running / crawling in mud, woods, water.. digging deeper into the ground for just some cover.Weapons are as they were, basic infantry rifle is a bolt action, arty is dreaded ( DUCK IN THE DUGOUT!!! )  fighting is back and forth accross the trenches... futile, dirty, horrifying.... limbs fly.. wounded fall and scream.. gas burns at your eyes.. Amazing game. BEST PART:  No one, not a single incident of toxic community.  My team didnt hate me for being new and dying ( often ) the other side didnt try and turn the game into a 12 y/o hormone fit..  people didnt run and quit when we were outnumbered almost 3 - 1.. we fought it out.. and the other side even said.. cool.  I highly recommend this one.** EDIT ** 4/25/16Have not been able to still devote long sessions here.. but just today was my first encounter with a ...

								If you enjoyed Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm or tactical team shooters that require good team coordination then this is a no-brainer. As of now the lobbying system can be wonky at certain points, but nothing as extreme as a simple restart couldn't fix and even that isn't very often.The gameplay is smooth and it plays as you would expect a true-grit trench warfare game to play. Each person plays a special role in a squad.The squad system implements nationalities and their specialities which is a nice change of pace but still reminiscent of Battlefield's squad system if you're familiar. The attack and defend style play is also unique and really makes you believe this is how your ancestors probably got it done. Sharp rifling skills, smart MG nest emplacements, and well placed mortar, recon planes and mustard gas are required for victory.All in all, it's intense, you'll die a lot, and you'll need a good squad to pull through but it wouldn't be nearly as rewarding without it. For $20, it's a good deal, on sale, it's a steal. Buy the 4 pack, get your friends in the mud. 8.5/10 fix ya damn lobby system			"

												I went into this game rather skeptically - a lot of historical shooters tend to fall into a difficult spot with regards to the way they are played. Most games end up as a classic deathmatch or a camping simulator with old timey costumes, particularly WW2 games. Red Orchestra and Heroes & Generals, despite being two very good 'simulator shooter' games, both suffer from this problem quite heavily. With Verdun, you can set aside those worries now.Verdun manages to break away from that mold by heavily incentivising players to fight in the style of trench warfare. Every battle is fought in a series of 'phases' - one side defending, one side attacking. While defending, if you venture to far towards the enemy lines, you will be considered deserting and killed. If you don't charge forward while attacking, you essentially forfeit the round. Run too far from your trench and you will be killed for desertion. In this way, the game keeps the maps expansive, but enclosed: a perfect size for a medium-scale skirmish that captures the feeling of fighting over a small slice of a much larger war. Believe it or not, trench-style tactics work and really give this game a strong feeling of immersion. If your squad trickles in slowly while on the glorious attack, your men will be picked off quickly and accomplish nothing. But if your entire team charges in a human wave, the enemy simply cannot keep up and will likely be overwhelmed. Then comes the gritty, brutal close-quarters fighting to hold down the trench, stabbing with bayonets, bashing with spiked clubs, and desperately firing off bolt-action rifles at point-blank. A wide variety of weapons are available - pistols, machine guns, bolt-action rifles, et cetera - and you will unlock various side-grades as your soldier gains career points, keeping the game fresh and fun. Currently the game has a nice array of nations represented: The United Kingdom with its Canadian dominion troops and France currently represent the triple entente, while the central powers are represented by the German Empire. Apparently the United States and Austria are to be represented soon, though these may simply be rumours.Overall, the game is a highly welcome addition to the historical shooter genre, and is incredibly addictive and fun to play, and is, in my opinion, far superior to the other options currently available, overtaking even Tripwire's 'Rising Storm' for amazing, brutal gameplay and attention to detail. You would be doing yourself a disservice to miss this one!PS: Sadly, no ANZAC or Ottoman Empire troops or costumes are represented in-game yet, but are the Developers really surprised people are asking for them? You released your WW1 game on the weekend of the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings, which began April 25th, 1915!			"

The devs are continuously expanding on the features, the weapons are pretty balanced, the recent addition of gore and squirming bleeding out wounded people really resonates with my sadistic tendencies and the uniforms and weapons are historically accurate and look realistic. The only thing that can get kinda annoying is artillery and grenade spam which has gotten better because of the recent reduction of overall grenades everyone can carry but should still be reduced in my opinion.

												Oh boy,I got this game soley because it was the first World War 1 FPS game i have ever found.  I liked it because this time in history is virtually non-existant in the gaming world.   Seeing this was a nice change of pace.  The best part about this game, is the community.  They are helpful, and unlike most FPS fanbases, they think.  When I was mulling over the idea of getting this game, I checked the reviews, like you are now.  What I saw a lot of was ""you are gonna die a lot, but don't let that discourage you.""  They were right, but I kept trucking along.  I got better, and it was fun; then everything changed down the road.  With the new updates coming out, Verdun fell into the trap that nearly every FPS fell into: Catering almost exclusivly to the marksman/sniper class.  I made a discussion about it on the community hub, and they told me just to keep practicing.     I did, but there were still some major problems.  The biggest problems facing this game and two things: 1) spawn system is a mess.   Too many times have I spawned only to IMMEDIATELY get a mortar thrown right on top of me and have my head blown out my backside.  2) As stated before, catering to the marksmen class.  In some maps, like Duramount for example, I REFUSE to play that map as the allies.  It is such a sniper's nest.  Your game play is literally nothing but spawn, die, spawn, die, spawn...die.  To test this, I had a friend watch me and time how long it took me to die when i respawned.  I didn't move forward, all I did was spawn and immediately crouch down, and then died.  My life time?  0.83 seconds....I WISH I was making that up.  This game has(had?) a lot of promise, but so far I am seeing a bunch of wasted potential.  The devs are working, but are they doing the right work?  This game needs a lot of polishing.  As it is now, I cannot recommend it, but I hope that will change.			"

												For years WW2 shooters were all the rage in video games, Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, Battlefield 1942, Brothers in Arms, Red Orchestra, etc, but I always wanted to see a WW1 shooter and now there finally is one. Imagine extreme trench warfare, mustard gas, tons of different bolt action rifles, lugers, mortar fire, running from cover to cover in no man's land, mowing down enemies with the heavy machine gun! This is a lot of fun, it encourages teamwork even though there's limited VOIP, what I and many others will do is relay the enemies' position in team chat, such as ""LEFT SIDE"" if the enemy has breached our position on the left side of the trench, or is about to. One may view the lack of VOIP as a negative, but on the plus side you're less likely to hear any screaming squeakers on the mic and go through the effort of going in the menu and muting them. If you play as the officer class you can call in mustard gas strikes, mortar strikes or air recon (depending on the type of squad you're in) by holding Q and right clicking. The game is somewhat realistic, it only takes one shot from a bolt action rifle to kill someone and you need to use cover, but there's no friendly fire and there are crosshairs. If you like realistic, yet fun shooters, like Insurgency, you're gonna like Verdun. Like Insurgency, the developers keep adding content in free updates (they've added 2 new maps since I've owned Verdun), so I highly recommend this unique shooter as it gives you far more bang for your buck than your typical AAA shooter that charges $50 for a season pass.EDIT: I just found out that they recently added VOIP, but it's limited to your squad only. The developers are adding free expansions that will include gore, new maps, the trench gun, flamethrowers and new squads, including the Americans and Belgians and in future expansions they'll add more fronts, such as the Eastern front between Russia, Germany and Austria-Hungary and many more. More details can be found here:

												You will never enjoy dying so much in any other game. WWI FPS made with a great, authentic atmosphere with realism in mind. You will die a lot as one hit means death. Thankfully that means you can also take down enemies quickly, leading to some very intense firefights. Gas, mortars and having to attack or defend throughout the match helps the chaos. Weather you are fighting for your life to defend a trench from an incoming attack wave or if you are laying prone behind a tree sniping and covering your team mates advance, you will have a lot of fun as long as you can stick with the game through the initial constant dying while you adjust to the game mechanics. If you have played Red Orchestra/Rising Storm then picture that only with a WWI setting and you know what greatness awaits.			"

Once you get used to the fact the damage model is very similar to Red Orchestra/Rising Storm you'll be fine!So the main selling point of this game has to be the fact it's set in WW1 and Trench Warfare, it's different to other FPS's out there and that's why it's so good!Within the game you have squads which are 4 men teams and consist of different roles, the roles are named differently for each faction but they're all the same really.--[ Squad Roles ]---[ Corporal ]-The Corporal is the lead element of any squad. They set the attack orders and can call in either recon planes, artillery and gas.. It's a case of one of the other and depends on what 'faction' you play as. Generally I play as the Tommies due to being british :P-[ Rifleman ]-The Rifleman is,.. well... your bog standard rifleman, you can upgrade the class so you can get your rifle mouted with a long range scope, this effectivley makes you become a marksman. It's a fun class to play and I highly reccomend this one if you cannot get to be the Corporal.-[ Machine Gunner ]-So the Machine Gunner has a LMG you cannot sprint with this weapon due to it being heavy, but you can mount it on certain things around the map because you have a bipod. This is amazing for supressing the enemies while the rest of your squad move up to the enemy trench(es). If you get the Tier 3 upgrade for the MG (This is on the Tommies faction, not too sure if it's the same for the others) you can have a rifle and a MG. If you equip the rifle you can sprint to where you want to be, get the MG out and mount up! Another awesome class to play as when working with a team.-[ Bomber/Grenadier ]-The bomber/grenadier class is pretty much identical to the rifleman unless you go for the tier 2/3 upgrade. tier 2 gives you a pistol and 4 grenades. (Grenades are amazing! The blast radius is a nice size to damage people who try to run from a thrown 'nade) If you go for the Tier 3 upgrade you get a pistol, trench club.. Yes. a big wooden club which you beat people to death with and 2 grenades. Tier 1 is a Rifle and 2 Grenades... possibly a pistol too..In order to maximise your fun in this game you need to play with friends, you need to have communication in your team too, so make sure to press 'U' to type to your team and let them know where the enemies are pushing, you'll find you win more matches, If you're  a Corporal or equivalent. Please for the love of god ask where people need arty / tell them where you have put arty. Set orders too! It's bonus EXP for your squad mates!--[ Gamemodes ]--So far in Verdun there is only 2 gamemodes. Frontlines and Deathmatch.-[ Frontlines ]-Frontlines game mode is where you have to push and try to take the oppsition's trench, once taken you need to defend the counter-attack. After you successfully take the enemy trench, you take the next one. Simple concept but some of the maps are quite... strange and you have to adapt your play style to the maps too!-[ Deathmatch ]-Deathmatch is pretty much what it says on the tin. Every man for himself. It just reminds me of CoD... I wouldn't reccomend it unless you're seriously bored.-[ Private Matches ]-You can also host private matches so if you're part of a competive team.. Yes. It's recent addition to Verdun :P You can practice certain tactics and study the maps without the hassle of people shooting at you ;)--[ So, Downsides to Verdun ]--The only downsides I can really think of this game is when you create a squad and try to play with friends it will kick some people back to the main menu, this means your friends have to search for your squad in the left hand side when they choose to play ""Frontlines"" gamemode.In order to ""add"" people on Verdun you need to play with them in a previous squad or be in a match with them. To add them you press Tab (leaderboards) then right click your friend and click the ""Add"" button. Sorted! You can now make private squads.If you're also playing with people from different regions (EU/US) you need to make sure you change it at the top right so everyone is on the same region otherwise you won't be able to play together.--[ Conclusion ]--If you really into FPS Games which have a realistic damage model then I highly suggest this game. If you're looking to play a casual shooter, Verdun can be quite... rage inducing. BUT If you're willing to stick it out and learn the maps and how the shooting model works you'll be fine and you'll start loving the game! If you're not too sure whether this is the game for you or not. Wait until it's on sale or something, that way you're not spending as much on something you might not possibly like.Thank you for reading this review.

												Verdun is probably the most realistic depiction of WW1 in a video game ever, multiplied by the fact that it's in first person which allows for a more immersive experience. Squad variation is good although it really doesn't matter as long as there aren't four sniper squads on one team. Gameplay is pretty clunky and the graphics aren't anything special but it gets the job done. While most games have an active autobalance script in place to allow for a more balanced experience, this game uses a passive method that politely asks the overpopped team if some could join the other team while lengthening respawn times for the offending team. This can be a double-edged sword because sometimes people won't listen and you'll be stuck with an unbalanced team. Unfortunately this game is mostly dead at this point ~500 players on average isn't a whole lot when you account for the huge split between regions and the smaller splits between game modes. Speaking of which, there's really only one active game mode and the rest rarely have enough players to warrant a prolonged session. It was a whole different story when this game first came out and was alive and well.Overall, if you have or find a dedicated group of friends to play with, I'd give it a shot on sale but don't buy this at full price and expect an active game. Most similar realistic military shooters are more active players than this one so take that as you will.I should really get to bed, huh?			"

								An awesome game, it is a very different experience from your traditional shooter. The main weapon that you use is  a bolt action rifle, so there is absolutely no spray and pray idiots. There are machine guns, but you can't sprint and move much slower when wielding one, also you have to deploy it like in RO. Each team has a few squads and each squad has very different members. Some have a sniper, an observer and a scout, and some squads have a grenadier (guy with grenades not launchers) a machine gunner and a rifleman. All squads have an officer. An officer can call in gas, mortars or observation planes depending on what type of squad he is in. The maps deeply compliment the class system by having (hint WWI): trenches and barbed wire. The maps have several sets of trenches with fairly open stretches of land in-between, and when you are on the offense it is your job to charge across that land, from crater to crater and over the final hump into the enemy trenches. That gets challenging sometimes, but by coordinating attacks with your team you can successfully storm a fortified trench fairly easily. As a defender your job its to stop the enemy from capturing your trench. As you sit behind some cover with only your rifle and head poking out you are a fairly hard target to reach and you pick off attackers as they charge at you. But then you are gassed and you can't see, or a mortar hits you and your corpse goes flying, or a teammate says: BREACH LEFT and you look to your left to see an enemy rifle pointed down the trench line at your head, and sometimes simply you are sniped from a guy in the trenches the enemy just captured.I have been in a few games with the devs even! They are kind and open to any feedback, positve or negative. Overall 11/10 would recommend.			"

												It's about time i write a review here after playing a few weeks now :)I can't compare this game to any other FPS since i havent played one since ... wow *thinks *.. some game on playstation 2 lolBut I will say I was sold the minute i opened it, the graphics are great , the details in the trench are awesome sometimes i just want to run around and look at all the little nicnacs.The gameplay is so much fun I never thought i would fall in love with a FPS game like i did with this one.And i would even reccommend this to people that do not like FPS , because i am the LAST person to play a shooter up game lol, but this one has turned me around and i bet it will do the same for anyone else..I just got sucked into the commmunity and the people are amazing, I see the devs responding to allmost each post they are super involved , you can really tell they have a passion for this game.Not only do I enjoy playing the game, it has gotten me more and more interested about the great war, watching docu's , reading articles...Living in belgium  it's making me visit places i would have never visited.Thanks so much for this great game :) I cant wait for many many expansions :D			"

												First things first: what do you need for Verdun?1. A big computer screen so you can spot every pixel2. A decent enough PC, although it has problems with running GTX 980`s (sometimes), the game itself is very CPU based3. A lot of dedication and immunity to frustrationOnce you played enough and leveled up, the game becomes really funny and interesting, but you have to stay on it for a while and not get frustrated by some of the veterans running around and getting 70+ kills. It is that sort of game that can waste your entire day not even realising one day began.			"

												I'm definitely a fan of this game! I've only had it for two days, but I've almost been playing it all the time since I got it!The squad system is a lot like the one known from many Battlefield-titles: You respawn in the trench closest to no mands land or on your squad leader. The setting of the game is the Western Front, WWI. The game offers a great idea of the soldiers' lives in the trenches. If you don't keep your head down you're gonna get shot by a sniper. But the enemy's assault has to be repelled or you might just find it that your trench is suddenly overrun by enemies shooting and stabbing their way through your lines! When assaulting the enemy trench, the enemy machinegun and sniper fire will probably kill most of your comrades. When you realize you have to get to cover and you jump down a grenade hole, the machinegun fire flying over your head is suppressing you, your vision is getting blurred, and you're just waiting for your chance to get out of this place. But don't stay to long: an enemy squad leader may have seen you and called for a mortar strike right in your grenade hole.TEAM WORK is the key! Working together, following orders and staying close to your squad leader grants points to you and your squad, eventually leveling up your squad thus unlocking better abilities and heftier fire support. As in real life a squad is not better than the soldiers in it: A squad can very well be level 20, but when you split up and a soldier leaves the squad, the squad level falls drastically according to the squad points he had provided. The points are based on team work and cooperation between the members of the squad. For instance if a new man joins the squad and has never played with any of the squad members before he will not contribute to the squad level before he has been working with them. If a friend of a squad member, however, joins the squad, the cooperation points between him and the squad member will be accumulated to the squad points thus leveling up the squad. It is therefore very important to play the game with good friends if you want to make the best of the game.You can choose between 7 different squad types spread over two teams. Each squad has its own unique uniforms, abilities and special weapons. Usually, there is a:- long range specialist (sniper, rifleman, etc.) on each squad- machine gunner of some sort (or submachine gunner for the assault squads) - grenadier specialized for close combat and trench clearing. There is always a squad leader. He has the same loadout options in every squad but can issue orders and call for different support depending on his squad type.The only negative things I have to say about this game is - lack of support options (currently there is only gas, artillery and airsupport). Tank support or big NPC assault waves could be added as high level squad support intensifying the battles dramatically and really giving the player an idea of how it is to look at dozens of enemies charging towards his trench!- lack of customization options. Though the system is already quite customizable it could be even more customizable! E.g. enabling the player to choose his own weapons in stead of having three fixed weapon loadouts for each class.That said, I think this game is one of the best WWI-games ever made! If you like intense FPS shooters or war games, or if you're just interested in history and WWI, I definitely recommend Verdun!My rating: 10/10 points.			"

												I purchased this game about a week ago and was very surprised by what I had stumbled upon. What I was expecting was a call of duty set in the trenches of WW1. What I have been playing (pretty much non-stop since i bought it!) was a highly squad-based, realistic, and addictive historical FPS. It really does capture the essence of the chaos in the trenches as well as the futility you will eventually feel every time you go over the top to charge the enemy trench. Charging at machine guns, rifles, and artillery fire to gain just a few metres of ground is a very different experience than any other game I've ever played. Anyways my pros and cons are:Pros-Realistic maps, weapons, and shooting (no twitch fire, quickscoping, etc.)-Great squad play, if you do not play as a team player, you will die. Again. And. Again.-Sense of satisfaction from capturing the next trench and line and desperation as you start to lose it in the counter-attackCons-Maps are a bit too big for the team sizes, sometimes it feels as though there aren't enough people attacking or defending. This could be remedied with larger team sizes obviously, or NPC's.-Very odd squad progression system that sometimes carries on through matches and sometimes doesn;t, this is annoying especially when my mates and I are trying to get to the next level of uniform and upgrades.Overall this is a very well made game that is definetly worth its price. I hope to see future updates adding more great content!10/10 "

								Having bought this game yesterday when there were some huge bugs that were introduced with a patch some hours before, I was pleasantly surprised to see the devs release a patch to fix the issue within a few hours. As soon as I had left the game out of frustration with the bugs, a patch came through. I hopped back on and all the huge issues I had before were gone - hit detection and low latency and no server latency.. and no random invisible god mode!!!So now that these issues were fixed so quickly, I am optimistic this is going to be a great game. I loved the WW1 HL1 mod 'The Trenches' but not enough servers were ever around and not enough players. That was a long time ago so the greyness was really hard to stand with HL1 engine. But Verdun is a great game and I suggest fans of shooters like the Red Orchestra series should check it out. It's not as hardcore as Red Orchestra but features are being added regularly. It's a pretty solid game so far with only a handful of maps. The maps are pretty great though, really capture the spirit of the first world war mud fest. I might suggest some fallen horses or donkeys or other animals as some form of cover. Not too much but a war horse or two fallen would look pretty cool.I ended up playing through the night since I was enjoying myself so much after the patch. Before, with players from all over the world on the EU or US servers, it was almost impossible to hit people with the lag/latency, but now with the patch I can hit people fine. Also there is a Japan server for people in SE asia such as myself so this is great. We just need an iinet or similar Australian server to complete the region mix I think. But I get decent pings on the Japan servers.			"

								After playing so many hours of this game I thought it would be necessary to write a review. I've been playing Verdun since the early access in October 2013. I have to say the game has indeed come a long way. Verdun has alot to offer, considering it is one of the only WWI games out there. I have really enjoyed going through unlocking new rifles and other weapons. It also gives you a chance to learn what weapons the soldiers used back then. Verdun has a tactical squad system which is effective, as you can play with your friends in a four-man squad. The way the game works is clever too. You and your team have to defend your trench and attempt to push your enemy to there back trench line. The only thing with Verdun is the performance. The game should be like peanuts to run, however I struggle to run even with a high end PC build. The only thing the devs should work on now (in my opinion) is the optimization of the game.			"

								Imagine having to crawl through mud, your future uncertain, holding your breath while tracking an advancing enemy running frantically between hills, trenches, and explosions a hundred meters away and with a single bullet, like the reaper, you claim them. That is Verdun and it is as realistic as it'll ever get. Verdun is an absolute must for any FPS or WW1 enthusiast. It immerses you into the era from the beginning with the music and atmosphere. The graphics are breathtaking despite my PC's shortcomings. Verdun has a great unlock system that is easy to pick up and utilize with classes and a plethora of WW1 weaponry. The controls are intuitive if you've ever played an FPS and the gameplay is a thrill. I'm looking forward to see what the developers at BlackMill Games and M2H have in store for this game.			"

												I quit playing FPS games a long time ago because they just didn't keep my interest anymore. Too many times I spent the money and then got bored before I got my money's worth. Most new FPS games feel like re-skins of the same games we've all been playing for years... and I just couldn't get into it anymore.I'd never played a WWI FPS before and it was something I always thought would be pretty cool. So when I saw this pop up on Steam I followed it for a while. After a few months I was bored and looking for a new game so I decided to take a chance on Verdun. Personally I feel like it's the best game purchase I've made in a while. This has been the most fun I've had with a FPS game since I can remember.The trench warfare is just a totally different feel than anything I've ever played before. The pace of combat changes constantly depending on whether you are attacking or defending - and there are multiple ways to attack and defend depending on your load out. The squad system is actually pretty unique too.The learning curve isn't too steep - and so far the community has been pretty cool. I highly recommend this game!			"

												Where do I begin, there's so much to say about this game. I may as well state that I am one of the veteran players of this game, been playing this game in the early beta stages and have seen a lot of progress. A lot of progress indeed. A lot of players like me would probably look back when the uniforms were low res and any explosives did zero damage and say ""ahh those were the good days"". I've had this game for two years and I plan to keep it. This game as I said, has been through so many changes. New beligerants to the war and new regiments. Chemical warfare and an accurate suppression system that throws off your aim. Also, time accurate weaponry, along with the amount of usage of these guns. It's not Battlefield 1 where everyone is running around with a machine gun. There's few machine guns but mostly bolt action rifles, just like the real war. Plus the tactics used to play the game and win are just as accurate. Certain regiments play certain roles such as reconnisance or offensive regiments or defensive. Fire support and support in general is just as accurate. No ""killstreak"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, they can only be called in by your regiments NCO who leads your squad, and it's all timer based so use wisely. You also don't get many MLG dumbasses in the game, so that's also a perk. I mean, I am not saying there isn't any period, there are some but not as many like in COD. The community for the most part is mature, you are going to come across some rude or obnoxious people which is expected. In all of my two years I have only seen one person exploit hacks into the game and they have been permanently banned from the game I believe. Plus that was way back in beta days. So hackers are not an issue at all. The game CAN get laggy. Just adjust the graphics settings to where it runs the smoothest and you should be alright. This is also a game that is best played with friends too, so either make friends or play with friends who currently own the game. Playing with friends builds team xp and can provide your squad with better perks and support.That's my review of it, and I hope it can influence you to buy this good game. If possible, go ahead and watch gameplay videos			"

												Verdun is a great squad-based FPS, with a nice balance between realism and playability. It's harsh, gritty and unforgiving, and you will die a lot. You'll get blown up by artillery, just as you've finally managed to sneak through no-man's land while dodging the MG bullets flying over your head. You will choke on mustard gas, and you will get your head bashed in by a sneaky german NCO who's crept up behind you and is now pistol whipping you with his luger. You will hear the clink-clank of a grenade landing between your feet half a second before you're blown to bits. You will freak out as you miss your first shot with your slow-as-♥♥♥♥ bolt action rifle, while some crazy canadian is charging you with a god damn club. You will slam your mouse down on your desk repeatedly while screaming profanities as you get stuck in barbed wire for the second time in one round, but hopefully you've got a sturdy gaming mouse that is suited for that kind of abuse.At it's best, Verdun is a really intense and immersive experience. The trench warfare setting is something you'll either love or hate, and makes it a bit different from other shooters that are usually set in more urban environments. It's highly recommended to play this game with friends, as the squad aspect is really important, and cooperation is the key to being successful. You will also gain co-op xp with the people you play with, which gives your squad improved perks and abilities.This game is great fun if you enjoy historically themed FPS-games and bolt-action rifles. The learning curve is steep, but don't be discouraged. It is recommended that you read the official guides on steam before entering the game, just to understand more of what's happening. "

								This was totally worth it! Only paid 4 euros for it, and trust me, I just feel like I should have paid more for supporting the devs. This is a nice tactical shooter that won't work without cooperation and teamwork (kinda the same thing). If you're a CoD fanboy and you're expecting 360 noscopes and Doritos and Mountain Dew as rewards then go away, this is for serious gamers.       A very nice experience, I can't even get bored of it even if I try. There are currenly 2 game modes, Frontline wich is the classic, and realistic trench warfare in WW1 and Deathmatch, where everybody's going crazy, you have to hide and wait for the perfect chance. This is in BETA so expect some hackers, glitches (not many) and some bad visuals.       As many people already said in their reviews, this looks and plays like Red Orchestra 2 or Rising Storm (games I own too, so I can confirm this theory). But, RO2 was free last year on steam for 1 day, so many trolls and fanboys got into it. Still, this is not a RO2 copy, it reflects more teamwork based gameplay and WW1 realism than you think.There are people who actually know what teamwork trully is, and you can play with them right here. Man, I love this game! The developers are active and they read almost every thread on the community. They listen to us and they are trying to fix the issues and problems we encounter in-game. There are constant updates wich I love! They are the perfect example of what every developer should act like.       I'll give this game a strong 9.7/10. Developers you did a great job. Can't wait for final release!			"

												You wake up to find yourself in a war thorn land. Today is the day we charge and finally take up that enemy position. You hear whistles and run along with dozens of your battle comrades. Upon leaving the trench they start dropping like flies. All you can hear are bullets, grenades and occasional war cries. You see your friends falling one by one, running to their death. You are not brave. You crawl from a hole to a hole like a rat but alive one. You are so close to getting to that enemy position. Suddenly you see a nasty looking gas, obviously you won't go there so you try the other side. Machine gun starts opening fire killing what few of your battle brothers remained. You run back into the gas, barely putting the mask before suffocating. You can't see anything but you keep crawling, only mere steps from reaching the goal. The enemy is well etrenched but suddenly you see your commanding officer, bravely ordering the artillery before succumbing to numerous bullets. Enemy position is being heavily bombarded, you can hear screaming and suffering even though it is in a language completely foreign to you. You finally enter the enemy trench, a sole survivor of this great assault. The destiny lies in your hands. You start moving towards the center, first enemy activates a grenade and hurls it towards you. Alas, the grenade hits the cerade and bounces back to that ill fortuned soldier killing him instantly. You praise your luck and continue with the advance. God is with you, you feel invicible, you made it until the very end. Clock starts ticking, victory is so close. You hold your rifle with all your might and look for any incoming enemies. You hide in and try to set up an ambush, holding your breath and steading your rifle hearing your heart beating rapidly. Finally, an enemy soldier appears. All that hatred and suffering directed into a single shot. All that dramatic tension that has been building has been concentrated in a bullet. You, a mere private, can save the day and end this pointless war. You take the shot. You miss. You know it's end of the line for you. It was.If a game can inspire you to write something like this, you know they have done a very good job. Immersion this game provides is one of a kind. Truly unique experience.			"

												Do you want a true battlefield experience? Then look no further than Verdun. Never have I played a FPS that made me sweat at the idea of running across no man's land trying to invade the enemy's trench. This is not the kind of game where you rank up kills while soaking bullets like some kind of super soldier. If one bullet hits you, you are dead. You better get used to the idea because that's all you're going to do at the start of your first assault. You will quickly realize just how serious the situation is when you start seeing your comrades fall to the ground as the sound of mortars pierce your ears, all while trying to dodge machine gun fire and hopefully not get sniped for the 100th time as you slowly make your way through all the chaos. Your accuracy has never been more important than now. Having fast reflexes is essential if you want to stay alive. In order to improve you need to practice, so I suggest playing Squad Defense mode - it's basically where players fight off endless waves of enemy bots, which sounds less realistic, but consider it a target practice mode that will help you a lot in the beginning.Verdun set out to recreate the horror that was WW 1 by putting players in the shoes of the brave men that fought in it. In my opinion the game succeeds with flying colors and is one of the best war games you can play. Highly recommended!			"

								By now, I can safely say this is one of the best WW1 first-person shooters I have ever played; and continues to improve day on day.   Through little over a year, the game has come on leaps and bounds with the addition of various new factions including the Tommies and Canadians, as well as the German assasult Strosstrupen squad.  Various additions to the game are also in the works including a new melee system, and other, highly anticipated map releases.  Although this game is not finished - with it being in Early Access - through having slight bugs or glitches, I can safely say this game is going to be a huge success with the steam community, and if you are thinking of buying the game, know you are going to jump right in with a dedicated and reassuring community fighting it out in the muddy depths of World War one.  9/10.

Product received for free
												In this review of Verdun I will be covering 5 catagories of gameplay (Which includes game community)*** Preformance ***Although the graphics aren't that of the new Battlefield 1 coming out, Verdun is a beautiful looking game for its content and context. If there is one annoyance I have it is the optimization of the game, I run a GTX 750Ti and I can run everything at high and some ultra, and I get about 40-45 FPS when I play, but I have read where some people with higher grade cards experiance lower or even wors frames, but for me it was fine with some drops in FPS the lowest I have had being was 20 FPS but that was at the beginning of a map when everything renders. One other annoyance that ties into community and preformance, some players turn landscape and foliage quality off or too low to get an edge on players, where as if you were hiding in bushes on your screen, on another players with no foliage you would be laying in open ground. Over all preformance out of 10 would be a 7.5, due to the time it has been out and has been repatched time and time again. *** Gameplay ***The key factor Blackmill was going for in this game was realism and authentisity, and I think they hit that mark to a certain degree, which it is real and fun for both sides fighting. The guns are authentic and so are the squads and languages spoken. I understand if they really wanted to make it realistic by taking out UI and making friendly fire a thing but Blackmill I am assuming wanted to make new players feel welcome without being too harsh in gameplay. Over all score would be a 9 out of 10, the gameplay is spot on with the weaponry mechanics and realism.*** Mechanics ***The mechanics and such for Verdun are average for me. Running is a little clunky and the default keys to crouch and sprint with are assigned in a very weird place, so I rebound crouch to CTR and sprint to SHIFT. However aside from movement mechanics, the bullet mechanics are well made for a 32 player trenchwarfare FPS, there is bullet drop at long range and if you want a kill while the enemy is rushing toward you at an angle you gotta know how to lead your shots. Over all I give mechanics a clunky but not too shabby 7 out of 10.*** Realism *** (In a sense of immersion) Verdun is spectacular at immersifying me into the trenches of World War I. Sometimes when the artillery is soaring over head i'll take a second to look up, as I hear the yelling of other soldiers in the trench next to me, and there is a certain type of peace as well, looking at the whistiling wizz-bangs overhead. But me gawking usually ends with a German putting a Luger round throught the back of my head, pulling me back to reality, ""Oh, I died. Damn.""A solid 9/10*** Community ***The Verdun community is very welcoming with most people, even to noobs at the game, dont be afraid to ask questions in all chat, usually a few people will tell you the answer to put your gas mask on. But the unfortunate part about Verdun is the size of the community, its fairly small for such an awesome game, but I am seeing more people playing because of the recent announcement of Battlefield 1, which is good and possibly bad for Blackmill, but Verdun will always hold a place as one of my most favorite games ever. I am veering off track but, the Verdun community is spectacular, if you see Kaiser Wilhelm in game, he's cool as well nice guy. Rating for community 10/10			"

								Dear *Name has been rubbed off*,My love, it has been three days since I've bought this game, and I cannot stress how much I love it here. From gunshots flying by my head throwing me into a daze, to my dear friends dying (and respawning) around me, this game made feel something I haven't felt in an FPS in a game in a long while: It immersed me in its world and made me feel like a real WW1 soldier. And dear sweet lord, it feels good.I can feel it in my head, my love. The urge to roleplay seethes through me. I want to leap onto my desk and charge foward as my allies do whenever the general calls for a charge, and I can feel my heart racing when I fail to capture a point and must fall back to my trench. I feel like I must watch every single area around me. And if I fail to observe a single thing in this drab, grey/brown world, it oftentimes costs me my life. Every shot matters, accuracy is key, and knowing the positioning of my body can mean the difference between life and death. And let's not talk about how my gas mask barely fits over my head. But hey, at least it lets me breathe through the toxic yellow gas. But do not worry, my love: The medical coverage is wonderful here, so I come back with everything intact with no seeming consequence.The world is very gray, and sometimes, the textures of the world seem to flash in and out. Even worse, I can see the nether space that makes up our world disappear from the ground beneat my feet. War is hell, but by god, I hope it fixes the graphics in this texture-popping world. It's a scary sight to behold. And perhaps I have not been here long enough, but oftentimes I struggle to discern allies from foes, which often leads to my death. (Until I discovered that there is no friendly fire in this world. I must keep that in mind next time. Always shoot first and ask questions later)I cannot customize the way I look, so don't worry about the socks I requested from before. As well, I don't like my uniform the way it is right now. This blue uniform makes me look a flashing neon light in a dark room screaming, ""HEY GERMANS! PLEASE SHOOT ME"".My time runs short, so I must keep this letter brief. As time goes on, I will be more than willing to send more letters to update the progress of the war. But know that I will be doing my best here. It's an ugly world and the things to do here are very repetitive, but overall, it's quite a nice place to be in.I love you, *name is rubbed off*. I will be sure to write to you again soon. P.S. Send a football for next year's Allies vs. Entente Christmas Football League.			"

												Amazingly realistic, you have to think about flanking or where to come at them. Well scary when the guy in front of you gets shot. So fun when you get in there trench and they don't know. So cool when you run over the top with your whole army. Even better when your sqaud's in the trench. Fun with freinds (if they follow orders, I play as corporal, I'm ok but my friends don't listen to me much, but when you get put into a squad with people that are willing to follow you, it is so fun they follow you and all.). Over all there are some glitches sometimes eg a random face appearing on your screen for 0.25 secs and he's like 'Hallo'. But it is a really fun game and is better than CoD in how scary it gets, like when you're lieng down and an MG is shooting at you and you get deaf (in game) and your screen goes black and white			"

Early Access Review
								I first found out about this game thanks to FRANKIEonPCin1080p, and thought I just have to buy it. I searched for it, and bought it for a really cheap price and loved it, my only problems with it are the glitches that are still around after 1 year of being in alpha, however those can be fixed pretty easily if they already know about them. Oh, and the really bad optimization of this game really sucks.. I run it at around 50FPS on ULTRA however, I cannot use Post-Processing or any of those other tick boxes without getting 15FPS, and I currently have a really good setup: 17 4770k 3.5GHz, 8GB DDR3 2144MHz & Palit GeForce GTX 770 4GB.. Anyway this isn't for me to show off my PC specs, it's a review on this game.Day 1:After spending 1hr and 37 minutes downloading this game, it was finally time to boot it up, so I rallied up some friends to take into the trenches with me to fight along side in this very well made WW1 trench warfare game. I found out we could make a squad to play easier, so away we go with our own squad, I also found out later on how the squad leveling works, which I actually find really stupid how it works, as once you quit the game you cannot join your squad back it seems :( but apparently as long as there is someone in that squad it will keep leveling, so once you make it you cannot join it back unless you randomly find it..Day 2:After the mass amount of killing I did on Day 1, I decided to go onto it again and this time try out the snipers, found out on Day 1 that there was bullet travel in this game, which is really good.. However this game has really awkward bullet travel time, and I am saying this from a mass FPS game where they also have bullet travel time.. But this game you have to aim far too far infront of you opponent while they are running to make the shot even connect :S Once I finally got the bullet travel time sort of sorted, I began to realise that sniping is really good, and seems to be fairly easy (Coming from a ranged user on all FPS games). The only issue I have with sniping is the mouse sensitivity.. You can only turn down your aim sensitivity which affects all of your aim down sight, so for the snipers I find it best to use a very slow sensitivity on this game, as it enables you to slowly move onto your targets, however you cannot have a set slider to adjust for using snipers, or for just using rifles/MGs which I found really annoying :(Day 3:After getting over the fact that you can only adjust one slider for your sensitivity I found a few bugs, which may have only happened to me, I am not too sure :o 1) Do you all remember the ""Windows has stopped responding"" error which occured on Windows XP the most? Well, now I find that in this game (But nothing stops responding) what I mean by this is, when I look up into the sky, at a set point my weapon starts to do that motion sort of them (When you dragged that error box around the screen a lot) I kept doing this because I wanted to see if it was actually a bug and not just a 1 off problem.. It happened each time. I then found that if I look up into the sky with a gas mask on, my screen goes completely white and really does hurt my eyes, so I kept doing it again to see if it's a 1 off bug.. It happened every time sadly.Day 4:I finally found some really funny people to talk to in the server! It also had some massive♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who were telling everyone who has a problem to delete the game, and gtfo those guys were real♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who should gtfo PC. But, I am basically saying is this game has a pretty nice small community which should start to grow a lot faster now that more people know about this game, and have actually seen some good footage of it (Thanks to FRANKIE).Conclusion:Even though this game has a few little bugs, and a few little keyboard warriors on it.. You should still get this game! I got it for around £5 1 week ago so 17th December 2014, and you can too if you use the right website.. But it's on sale now so if you don't know that site, then just buy it from steam while it's on sale! It is a very good game, and I cannot suggest any other WW1 type of FPS I have ever played that was a fun and enjoyable as this.If you read all of this review and didn't just skip to the conclusion, then I thank you for your time. I am not very good at writing reviews so this was kind of my first propper one on a game, but I hope it helped out :) "

Early Access Review
								I grew up with games such as Battlefield 1942 and some of the great mods for it such as Forgotten Hope or Desert Combat and I am one of those people that just don't get to enjoy the direction that many AAA games are taking anymore.  Some of my favorite games are done by small but very competent teams such as Red Orchestra, Insurgency or No more Room in Hell. I keep having my eyes out for interesting new games to play and Verdun sparked my attention just recently. What can I say, I LOVE THAT GAME!!! Like many other people were already saying before me it captures that ""battlefeel"" in such stunning ways that it makes you feel like being right there at the front with you fellow buddies in the mud. The controls are just perfect, the ambiance is awesome. It is NOT a campers feast or a sniper orgy as I was first afraid of, the trenches and the many craters in the battlefield will work to your advantage keeping your head down while you approach the enemies trenches (or run away from them haha).  The level-up mechanism is very motivating, it doesn't take too long to unlock the different weapons that each class comes with and they are all very well balanced. As already mentioned the controls are superb and put you right in the soldiers boots without any weird clunky mechanics to getting used to. The weapon handling is great and feels very realistic.I play it alone but the way the game is build most of the times you end up fighting with some people out of your squad side on side which makes it a very team oriented experience.The graphics look super nice and I was very surprised to find out it was Unity Engine, I thought it was unreal 4 engine the first time I played. Keep in mind though that the game is done by just a handful of people so they don't have the resources to add tons of stuff nonstop but every patch I have seen so far added good features that made lots of sense. It says I only played 15,6 hours but that can't be true I played much more then that.Did I forget anything? I hope this game has a long future ahead of it with more and more people joining the battlefields and discovering how much fun it is. I hope the dev team will support this game for a long time too and keep adding maps and awesome events such as the Christmas truce.  Long story short: do your self a favor and buy this marvel of an indie game. One of the most motivating shooters I played in years without a doubt.			"

												Not sure if i'm evolving or devolving with this new ""play a ton of"" multiplayer.  I'm going from trench warfare in the skies with airships, to WW1 trench warefare in either mud, or actually pretty scenic forests.But yea, it's basically squad based WW1 trench warfare, where the squad you're in plays a major factor.  Depending on which squad type you're in, the CO of the squad can spawn people, or anyone could spawn people - provided the enemy is not right ontop of you.  You have guns locked away, but they're pretty easy to fully unlock everything.  Goal is to capture the enemy trench, hold off their attack, and it alternates between attack rounds, where you have to get across sometimes small, sometimes hugh ""no man's land"" to get to the enemy trench. once you have numerical superiority, you'll start to cap.  And defence rounds, where you pretty much snipe, machine gun, or just shoot the other side as they make their way across noman's land.  about 5 minutes each, with potential ""foothold overtime""s where at least someone is in the trench. Matches last about half an hour before mapchange, although it could be over sooner.  To get a good feel for it, i'd say play at least 2 maps per session.played it for 24 hours in the past 2 weeks, and still hungry for more. ^.^			"

												You could call me a bit of a history nut and a war buff so it's only natural that I play this game with great determination.This is truely a real Gem of a game and the Dev's should be proud of what they have accomplished here. The historical accuracy is 2nd to none and only getting better with each and every update... and there have been many.All seriousness a side though. Have you ever been picking your way across Nomans Land and got taken down by machine gun fire or an artillery strike... well of course you have and what better time than to make a quick trip to the bathroom right. Only to return back and find you have respawned in a shell crater full of water laying face down and died again. Lesson learned! xDWarningOnly buy this game if you know how to respond to a dog whistle! :PLove it! "

								I was very fortunant to get this game! Verdun is a WW1 history buff's wet dream as long as they love online multiplayer, a great community that is full of philosophical history buffs and awesome trolls, and first person shooters. It updates from time to time like minecraft. You fight on 5 maps so far; can play as the French, Germans, Canadians, and British. It is mainly a squad based game that requires the strategy and cooperation of your teammates ranging up to games that can maximize to 32 people per server. It requires a lot of patience because it is a long paced game since it tries and succeeds in creating a WW1 atmosphere. You can unlock different weapons as you level up your different squad classes. I argue however, that the squad-class rank-ups are too easy now; you can now rank up all 4 tires in one match if you do well enough while as before it used to take way longer which balanced out the game and formed as a prestiege mode for your progression. Other than that, it is a great game, definantly one of my top-favorites especially out of my steam library. Just know that back then there were mostly bolt-action rifles without scopes, so don't expect so many mobile machine guns in this game. Have fun and enjoy it, the game's price increases the more it updates so hurry up and get it while you still can!			"

And as you can see I have set Verund as my favourite game on Steam - and I have some really huge AAA kittens there.WW1 climate & gear, immersion, graphics, community, devs - undoubtable pros.Cons? Not that much of a con, it base on experience you earn, but If you are not very familliar with shooters and squad-based side-to-side action - prepare to die a lot. At least at the beginning.Got spawn killed 3 times in a row. Would get spawn killed again ;)9/10			"

												Have only just started playin this game, but so far have thoroughly enjoyed it. From the teamwork to the actual gameplay, this game brings a fully enjoyable experience, along with a slightly educational edge that really shows the player what it was like to be fighting on the Western front. Also the difficulty of sniping with an ironsight brings an extremely satisfying feeling when you start picking off the enemy players.I highly recommend this game if you are into multiplayer gunfights, history, and teamwork.

												Verdun is a different kind of shooter. I started playing a few updates before release, and I remember being disappointed when I bought it. It felt clunky and unrefined. Now it feels done. Agree or disagree, you cant say this isn't a great example of early access following through. I dont want to count how many games are on my list that have been abandoned.			"

Early Access Review
								Verdun is one of the best games iv' played. im obsessed with WWI/II! everything about the great wars interests me, The Guns, the Armour, the Places, the armys, the Individual peoples stroys! its all realy special. and when i saw this game Ages ago, i shouved it on my Wishlist streight away! But it was only  Up untill recently that i was Killing my self for not buying it! because My mate did it for me!Special thanks to RG | ConolaCoil (name may change), Your a real Goons mate! Anyway, the game. Verdun is the single most Acurate WWI FPS iv ever seen. Its actualy Quite scary, how close it gets to the real Horrors that they had to face for us, them soldiers XD.One can easely get Completely and Fully imersed in this game. Things like Being able to say things in game like little comands & Misc' frazes like a battle Cry (wich depending on what side your on will determin what could be said) & Laughing, or just saying ""good Shot, Mate!"" or ""I cant Believe ya Hit that!"" in a young British dudes exited Voice. the game just makes you smile at those pointsbut when your teammate Blows that Defening Wistle to sound the charge, You pray and Run like they taught you to in boot camp, strieght at the enimy with tiers of fury in your eyes! Guns blazing, its gonna ither be You or them.Once you get the game, Even the Main menu is Awsomely cute and Acuarate. Your Menu sits floating with a Background of the Trenches were you have been spending the Nights of your Service. Music from the radio floats from the right, and the crackling fire and murmering sets the mood. its realy interactive and special, like when you go to the Options, it takes you to a small Dugout roomwere what seems like Your Personal items are. Its realy cool! to get straight into the action, dead in the middle of the top bar is ""find battle"". Smash that one with your Mouse, and you can pick out of Death match, just Unrealistic cod like DM, and Front line, Awsome staged battles that Use Squads and souch. you Press front line and it will bring you to a map layed out on the table in your Home trench. Find battles in one of there famous locations like Flanders. Once you've done that, You have to join A squad. Each squad has its Own name, made by people who have created them. You join one, and Play a roll for that squad in a battle. You join the battle, and Diferant individual squads are on ither team. your orders dont get mixed up with theres, however the Over all goal effects all in the team (Take Ground and Prosper!). You can even go through Tiers of Classes, giving you something to play for in your time in service. each Class has 3 tiers and once unlocked, the tiers loadout is avalable 24/7. the tiers will introduce items relevent to the class, aka a grenedier will be upgraded with a Pistol of some sort and more Grenades, to get closer faster and LOB em in! a dangerous job. and rifleman can upgrade with Bayonet's and scopes, making Trench warefare as scary as Peeking your head over the trench lines.Everything about this game i love! even the guns have souch attention to detail, and realism is beond messure here. you dont always♥♥♥♥♥♥the Bolt on your rifle ither, like Automaticly in cod. you dont auto reload, everythings up to the player, like how it was in WWI. the Guns themselfs are Works of Art, looking Beautifuly realistic and sounding like it too. and its the same with the landscapes! The Trenches themselfs have steps were peopel would peak over and fire, little alcoves were people would take cover, barbed wire everywere inwich you can get stuck, and with A lot of movement tear yourself open and DIe! its all wonderfull! I happened to be more patiant when it comes to games for some reson, but i would think that Those who are used to cod may not Like this as much mainly because if you try some stuff that you can do in cod in this, well it normaly doesnt work and will ruin the game for you. so basicaly, if you want an awsome game to do with WWI thats attention to detail is Beond measure, Grab this. if your not, grab cod 1.

												Damn fine game. Basically it's Red Orcestra of WWI. It's hard to do a WWI game well and these guys have. I like the squad system, its something I would like to see in other games. I like the trench warfare and I can't wait to see what else these guys have in mind. I'd like to see tanks and planes come into it. Also, as an Australian I'd really like to see a Gallipoli/ANZAC DLC. Would also like to add that Gas brings in something very unique as well - never seen it in another game. This game can pretty much do the entire scope of WWI and it's brilliant. A few things I found a little annoying is that the movement feels a little clunky and the hit registration is a little off. Wish they had more maps as doing the current ones can get a little grindy and repetitive sometimes. In conclusion this game is a very good realistic historical FPS game and I highly recommend it! 7/10			"

								Really fun game, one of my best game purchases ever.The maps are great and while the setting of trenches doesn't change much but the size, ambience and intensity does change with each.The weapons feel good and being mainly 1 hit kills makes them feel powerful, with bullet drop and lead times it does take skill to hit targets.There are still bugs and optimisation problems but the Devs are working on it and there's patches nearly every week. The Devs themselves are great guys, fun to chat and joke with and can often be seen playing their own game, hope they do more Streams on twitch as it was great to be able to take part in the Q&A with them and helps show their active in the community.

It is 16 vs 16 divided into squads of four for the main game mode. Most weapons are one to two shot kills sometimes three depending on the range. The main goal is simple capture more trenches then the opposeing team in the 30 minute time limit or push the enemy team off the map. You most gain a foot hold in the enemies trench before the time limit runs out if you contiune to have one guy in the trench it will not call a retreat you have extra time to hold a majority number for a short amount of time. If you fail at this you will be put on the defence until the enemy team falls back or takes your trench and the bloody cycle begins anew. If you do decide for this game do not be discouraged when you die alot. What matter in the end is doing your job and winning the match. Overall fun game I highly recomend it to anyone intrested in tatical shooters or WW1 history just be prepared to die jumping into the enemy trench alot.			"

												After extensive experience with military shooters i feel the need to advert players about Verdun.As i write this the game has just left early access and is released and i have clocked in more then 18h of playing.The Pros:-Guns sound good.-Feedback of the game is fairly positive, when you hit something you can feel it.-Uniforms are nicely rendered and the progression system is interesting.-Focus on squad gameplay is pretty unique in FPS world.-Maps are fairly interesting and feel authentic.-Its the real first attempt at a commercial WW1 FPS game.-Great value for price.-Great fun when teams are balanced.The Cons:-Atmosphere feels flat.-Spawn killing is an severe issue.-Hit detection and hit boxes are very very rough, you could literally be point at some guys shoulder or chest dead on and nothing registers.-Your shots will vanish upon your death, even though you fired off you rifle before dying.-Lewis gun is unusable due to overly chunky sights, which are a poor representation how peephole type of sights actually work in reality.-Grenade throwing is very clunky and basic and doesn't allow for any nuanced approach, you are always stuck chucking the grenade at full force.-Movement is unresponsive and awkward.Going from prone, crouch and standing there are these small delays that will often get you killed. and forget about jumping into cover your character will try to crouch first.-There is a really strange disconnect in between what you are seeing and what is really happening. In the sense that when you think you have plenty of cover somehow your head is sticking out and you can be shot at? Either this is true or somehow shots can go through solid terrain and neither option is really great.-The retreat mechanic is very poorly implemented, you get very little time to get out of no man's land, its actually more worthwhile to stay behind and attempt to kill something before the inevitable doom and just turn your back and get shot like 99% of the times. This needs to re-designed for it punishes people that are actively trying to fufill the offensive objectives.-Gas seems more of a inconvenience then a terrifying weapon. You often find it being more useful as a smoke screen then  actually incapacitating soldiers like it actually did. -Maps have some really noticeable design flaws. That lead to problems of gameplay. Specially on the loser side, the further you are pushed to the back the more unlikely it becomes for you to be able to make a comeback has the reserve and communication trenches are often devoid of cover or depth. Often even resulting in predictable spawn killings.-barbed wire is counter intuitive and in some cases too effective in channeling players into killing zones.-Legions of bugs, seriously guys, you shouldn't have launched it as is.Conclusions:-I can't reccomend it based on the fact that is so bug ridden and bare bones in many aspects. Although i love what they are trying to do and the vision is very interesting and compelling with a heavy heart i have to say this isn't up to snuff. It needs a hell lot more polish and work before i can really say it is a game worth buying. If things get better over time i might change it to a positive review, but atm it is too rough around the edges.Note to the devs: Seriously work harder guys, i really want to give this a positive score and reccomend it, it's up to you.

												I'm personally very fond of this game. It's become my most favored first person shooter since CoD: World at War, but I'll try to present a fair review. This review was written following the release of the ""Horrors of War"" Expansion for Verdun.Pros:-Accurate representation of World War I-Weapons are fitting to the era and fun!-You start out with 1914-era uniforms and progress to 1916-era uniforms as you level up with friends.-Fairly easy to earn medals even if you didn't play all that well.-The frontlines game-mode really makes you feel like you're participating in the Great War-The writhing death animations and screams will haunt my dreams for years.Cons:-Sometimes your body launches up into the air after being shot. It's kind've funny though.-The community has been sort've notably infiltrated by the CoD and Battlefield community; you can spot them by their endless whining in the chat.-Getting good at the game will require you to die at the start of your career. A lot. You'll get better at it with the more time you put into learning the gameplay. Most people tend to give up within the first ten ranks. If you're easily discouraged or prone to breaking blood vessels from high blood pressure, I don't recommend getting this game.If you're a history buff or have an appreciation for well-made World War games, get it. If you're looking for an ""MVG +420 Call of Duty sequel"" keep looking.			"

												VerdunBefore ""horrors of war"":an update was release a few months before the expansion which made the game run like s**t and crash constantly. only after another few weeks was i then able to play. the game was ok; hard, buggy and a bit lacking in content.After ""horrors of war"":This has changed the game, a load of new guns, squads and a new map make this game now alot more enjoyable. The main reason i now love this game is the gore, now at first this eems wrong and gothic, what i mean is the scary and tormenting deaths, some simple and some graphic, make you realize what it may have been like. everytime you or someone neear dies a chill runs through my spine and reminds how bad the Great War was. obviously this game on shows a fraction of the struggles, but at least the developers have given the time to make detailed loading screens with pictures and desriptions of the battle that you are about to take foot in.Overall: I am just hoping that dice/EA are not developing a WWI game as i belive it would be more insulting than anything else, with more focus on getting kills then verduns focus on trying to make you experience what the horrific battles might have been like. the game is now very good and a very good edition to anyones steam library			"

												(Edited Review as of March 27th, 2016) Horrors of War took this beautiful game and cranked it to 11! Tons of new weapons, even more factions, coop wave mode, realistic gore, and my favorite thing, the death rattles and somber wails of your enemies and comrades when killed by gas, bullets, arty, barbed wire, burned alive or simply beaten to♥♥♥♥♥♥with a shovel or club. This game continues to push the hellish and brutal atmosphere of The Great War.  While optimaztion and performance has increased for me slightly (90fps avg Ultra/High @ 1440p) it does drop to 55fps in heavily crowded areas with gas and arty strikes landing but overall feels smoother. (Mileage varies) Overall I still reccomend this game heavily to anyone who adores playing this style of game alone or with friends!(Original Review)The game places you in some of the bloodiest and gruesome battlefields that WW1 ever had... An does so in such beautiful and engaging way it makes your heart pound. Pushing forward trenches with your teammates and friends, frightened that a bomb will land beside you and take your squad out while also dodging rifle and machine gun fire, grenades, and artilery as you push onwards to take your position in the frontlines all the while your NCO's drop artilery and gas on the enemy. If you are lucky enough to get into the forward trenches you fight without mercy in close quarter combat using pistols, grenades, bayonets, shovels and whatever else you may have at your disposal until you either take over the trench or forced to retreat licking your wounds until next time. Once you gain the trench or fall back you are now in charge of holding what you have with all you got. You dig in and get ready as artilery shells pound steadily across the battlefield an enemy soliders push your postion, as gas drops in your trench you frantically put your gas mask on and wait hoping to see the enemy pushing through the gas and explosions and kill them before you are killed yourself. This game is not for the arcade fps game fans, but would def recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good realistic fps game with frantic combat and smooth gameplay. Worth the full asking price or steam sale prices. Will not be disappointed. For those who didnt have the pleasure of owning the game back 2013, this is what you missed during the christmas time!

												Played only 22 hours so far. Game looks good, feels good and has a very good replayability for the price. There are no vehicles in game - it is heavily focused on trench warfare and infantry combat. Maps are rather small and you will not have problem getting into fight. Most weapons are bolt-action, so your reaction and ability to aim matter much more.The teams are divided into squads - you level them up during your session and unlock bonuses (and it's much more fun playing with your friends).There are flaws and bugs, but I never met any that can force me out of game. I recommend you to check the game out. "

Early Access Review
								This was reviewed on 120 betaThis game is awesome. It is set in WWI Western Front, Battle of Verdun, which was fought between Germans and French. Gunplay, maps and overall gameplay feels a lot like Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm so if you've liked that game you will love Verdun too. Gunplay feels verysmooth, and realistic. For now in 120 beta there are a lot of bolt actions with bayonets and scopes which you can unlock. Pistols and Machineg guns are present, but I prefer playing frontline soldier with simple boldtaction to kill my enemies. The pace of the game is a bit so so dont expect to get 40+ kills every game, but i think this is a good thing. The thing i love about this game is the realistic gamemode which is consiting of defending a trench and then after some time counter attacking the enemy. If sucessful in capturing the trench from enemy you have to defend it fromeneies counter attack. If not you fall back and defend the old position. Stalemates are common like they were in WWI. Anouther game mode that is rifle (bolt-action rifle) deathmatch free for all,this game mode is self explanotory. Overall the game is awesome and i would recommend it to all my friends to play it.

												For all of you who came here because you thought Battlefield 1 wasn't realistic enough: This is war. You stick your head out of the trench, you die. You want to run from one bomb crate to another, you best hope and pray to Jesus' holy mother that you make it. You can see the cloud of yellow mustard gas closing in, but you need your hands at your gun to shoot the incoming enemy. As you, a second too late, try to put on your gasmask, you feel how the gas turns your bodily fluids into acid, burning your eyes and mouth. I love this game. It's a harsh master, but it is a good one. It makes you realise you really don't ever want to go to war, since military weapons have only been getting better in the past 100 years. You best mentally prepare for teamwork, because that's how you get things done in this game. Sadly, very few players have voice chat and even fewer actually give/follow orders. Everybody thinks this is call of duty, everybody thinks this is battlefield. Nope. Do what your NCO says and you may just make it home. Better get used to using a bolt-action rifle! Also, most soldiers carry only a rifle or only a sidearm. Get used to that, too. Did I mention I love this game? I do. The only thing I don't like about it is the players: very few ever become an NCO (every squad needs one) so I become one. Then, as I'm giving orders, trying to win the battle, I notice nobody gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sometimes some dude starts caps-locking orders in the team chat, but I know his battle with his own team mates is a lost one. My advice: find friends. Find a clan. There are plenty around, some bigger, some smaller. Then you'll see that the war is not won by a single sniper or a single gunner. This game gets frustrating for me when I don't have anyone to play with. If you want a really challenging game to play with your friends, this is the one.Also, the Belgian soldiers' voice actor is Flemish, and speaks Dutch. That was a personal big plus for me.

												As someone that has played countless hours of this game, I do feel like I know what I'm talking about. There is surely a lot of potential in Verdun yet the developers somehow manage to bury that with their own choices. Starting from a bunch of recently added clutter to maps which then couldn't be optimised (and still isn't), to the addition of a field-of-view and movement update that discouraged aggressive objective gameplay all the way to ridiculous features like a maximum bullet travel distance, Verdun just has too many setbacks to make me recommend this in the current state that it's in. The optimisation is still completely hit-and-miss, and system requirements are just excessive given the final product. Don't even get me started on the hit detection which never seems to improve and numerous bugs, many game breaking. The anti-cheat system was also troubled recently with an influx of hackers, although it seems it is unable to ban anything besides just testing if you have CheatEngine running or not. Don't get me wrong, there are still great parts to the game and the setting is something I absolutely love. If you ignore the negative aspects it is pretty damn amazing. Sure, give the game a go if you want to try, the refund button is always nearby if you find the same issues that I have. I really can't give a positive review with the current state of the game, maybe one day. #bringbackoldverdun			"

								After seeing some the negative reviews for the game i almost considered not buying it, though something in me decided to purchase the game, and man am i glad i did!Being a lover for history I find I prefer games not set in present day, so Empire total war and Mount and blade both appealed (no matter how unrealistic) though I have always preferred the two world wars, namely WW1; this led to purchasing Rising storm/Red Orchestra (fantastic game BTW), however, when I realised there was a game which was similar to Rising storm but in the trenches I was compelled to see how it turned out.Long story short I loved this game, it has a perfect mix of realism and quick arcade fun to keep one hooked for the whole 40 minute matches (they are quite long!). The simple idea of assaulting over no man’s land and trying to capture a trench in a certain time period, before either gaining a foothold or having to fall back to defend really forces the player to advance or defend if you want your team to win. Some people do camp in the trenches when you attack but this can be beneficial to provide covering fire to your team.To summarise; I like history, I bought this game, I like this game!10/10 would bayonet an enemy officer after accidently smashing keyboard!

-Highly Recommended Title-""Now I find, I actually have to be good at gameplay,to do well in Verdun. The biggest challenge is me.""Verdun is a realstic WW1 FPS with its strengths being in it's squad - role based gameplay, and historical representation (the maps are realistic for the period, as are the character , models, weapons, uniforms etc .)One can really get immersed in the ebb and flow of the battles, the atmosphere, geography and heat of the battle.. And feel how tough and suicidal WW1 was. With that in mind, the squad based gameplay allows a good breadth of available strategy and tactics that can be employed to successfully ""gain ground""....but it does take team work, and thats what I really like. The player objects are well represented, and have had undertaken, numerous tweaks, improvements and additions. There are period uniforms, and, as a squad progresses - uniforms get upgraded. Weapon usage and realism is pretty good too. There are aspects that can be improved  (like reloading animations, muzzle flash etc.) Overall, Im able to hit my target, if I take my time - and have good cover and support.The graphics over all are excellent - quite a bit of work has been done by the dev's to smooth the performance vs quality.  Ultra settings still need to be improved - when turned on - performance is very ""laggie"". Graphic performance and quality on ""High"" is good enough though.The sounds are also excellent, with period music, action sounds (explosions, gun fire etc),  and battlecries.The game continues to be developed - the current version is 170 - I think it's pretty close to a final product - but the dev's aren't done yet!It's not an easy game to get started out on for everyone, but other players will help you out if you are new, or you can head over to the Verdun War College and enrol. Between 5-10 hours of gameplay is needed to become somewhat proficient  at Verdun :)Verdun is definately worth the money, and your dollars will help the WW1 era games to develop...they have been the poor cousin to WWII games.The Verdun community is full of passionate, helpful and decent people. Wouldn't be a community without it's trolls too, of which, Verdun has it's fair share. There are numerous official and unofficial guides available to help you understand what's ""under the hood"" .Early Access Score: 8/10 "

												Having reinstalled this well past release, the game has been completely polished compared to what I remember from playing early access.An immersive, well built team-based shooter.I don't really like the WW1 theme, but I'm not bothered by it in this game.The vast majority of players will have bolt action rifles, based on availability of weapons from the time and having to unlock weapon sets. More on that later on.This makes gameplay feel much more about skill, since that one shot counts a lot more. Can't spray and pray with a bolt action rifle!You'll see machine gunners try and surpress rather than go for a lot of kills.If you die a lot whilst playing, remember to check your cover. Since it's trench warfare, what you see directly in front of you isn't all that can see you. ;) Make sure your flanks are secured, hide next to some obstacles so that any threat is within your field of vision.The unlock system has been overhauled from what it was in early access.It is now a system that makes much more sense, you can easily unlock just the weapons for just the classes that you like, no wasted unlocks or anything. Those points you gain by leveling go straight to what you want!Playing with randoms still gives the classic problems of little teamwork, but the linearity of the maps and the objectives on it force everyone to go one way anyway. Which fits the theme.One game where linearity isn't an issue! :)Without discussing price, I recommend this game if you're looking for a less-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t shooter.			"

								Having played this game since the early days of it's beta testing I can't really describe adequately how proud I am of the developers of this game. The finished product, I think, speaks for itself. This game is, in this gamer's opinion, a finely-polished killing machine. From the painstakingly detailed period uniforms from several of the nations involved in the First World War, to the gleam of the mud in the filthy, blood-soaked trenches, this game is, simply put, beautiful. This isn't a case of some sub-contractors churning out a Call of Duty/Red Orchestra clone to make a few bucks. I believe these gentlemen perceived the absence of a quality FPS for the Great War and set their efforts to doing this over the past few years. This is quality. Considering the development team was so small it is simply amazing to me that this game is as great as it is but having played several times with the developers themselves grunting in the trenches with me, I think it is certain that this is the product of a labor of love. And their efforts have succeeded indeed. This has been my favorite FPS for the past year. There have been a few missteps along the way but the developers were always on the ball and fixed things with lightning speed. The community is definitely one of the top tier as well. If you are as fascinated by this historical period as I then I cannot recommend any other game more highly. My hat is off to you, sirs. Bravo and well done. "

								Let me start this review by stating that I play this game on the lowest possible graphics settings, so my review will not contain any real opinion of the finer graphical details.  The game is freakin awesome.  Very immersive, very fun to play, and there are a lot of very cool people in the Verdun community.  That being said, there have been some issues over the past month or so regarding performance for some players.  Fortunately not ALL players were affected, but I myself have had periods of a week or more where I was unable to play.Overall, yes I recommend this game.  Whenever there is a problem, the devs seem to fix it reasonably promptly, and most of the time, whatever issue you might experience, is relatively minor anyway.So yes, good game I love it, 500hrs playing it and it is still fun every time!

												Could be an awsome game.It has a unique theme, has great concepts, maps and the uniforms look good, and the whole trench and rifle madness just work out. Then what does make it a horrible game ?The netcode of course. Simply has the worst netcode in a pvp game i have ever seen. Players randomly teleporting all over the place, shots go through enemies, getting killed behind cover. Synchronization is plain bad.The character animations look horrible and clunky. Melee system is awful, it automatically locks the target.The first time i say, but this game really needs Frendly fire. On small maps, like Argonne, artillery and nade spam makes a mindless explosive fest.Edit: Plus The Horrors of War DLC introduced more balance issues.			"

								If you are in to tactical squad action, this game is for you. There is no bullet drop, so most of the time its a one shot kill, which adds to the realism of WW1 trench warfare. Now that it's on sale, and a lot of people are playing, the battles are intense where you have to take sectors and defend for a while. This has a rank up system, and look forward to what more patches will bring, hopefully a graphics overhaul, it's not great now, but it's not bad.You always have to watch all your diretions in this game as the enemy could come from anywhere. I would reccomend taking advantage of this sale, and would always recommend it at full price.			"

												Quite possibly the only ""realistic"" World War I first person shooter out there. The trench combat is surprisingly fun and the gunplay is extremely suspenseful. This gameplay is paired with an impressive presentation and nice maps. Frontlines and Rifle Deathmatch are extremely fun, and the Christmas Truce is also great whenever it comes around, but I don't like Attrition or Squad Defence.Overall, really fun and good value for money. If you're a history buff, a milsim fan or someone looking for a new FPS to play, this is definitely worth a look.

Posted: July 6, 2015
												Verdun is based in the tumultuous and incredibly bloody World War I, where trench warfare and the rise of the first tanks took place. The game takes you to various locals and humongous maps spanning the length of France. I have long been an admirer of history, and I must say that this game has not disappointed me in keeping to the period.To speak of the graphics, the game in it's earliest form was basic at the least. However, it has gone far from those nascent graphics and has blossomed into a grimy and bloody masterpiece of historical-based games. Gun models are very realistic and detailed, and include things such as serial numbers and maker's etchings for those that look closer than just the far sights. Uniforms, with the benefit of a scrupulous historical adviser and modeling team, are top notch and pleasant to the eye, as much as they are to the period. On top of these, much work has been done to detail every inch of maps with props and trenches that are again as if they were lifted right from the annals of time to be played by our more recent generation.Game play is formed to follow the manner of tactics used at the time, with the defending or assaulting of trenches, where the capturing of a trench by your team earns it one grueling, hard-won point. After such a minor victory has been achieved, you must then aid your team in defending your well-earned prize for a time before continuing on to the next trench or, failing that, being beaten back to start anew. In this, Verdun captures the essence of the period brutally, but beautifully. You are also able to have a variety of characters at your command that are chosen from a ""squad."" A squad, whether of the Central or Entente powers or factions, have four characters each to choose from, and are further broken down with three loadouts, two of which needing be unlocked via points that you are able to earn. Furthermore, team play is also very encouraged with the inclusion of squad voice chat and squad or team text chat, allowing you to alert your teammates to an incursion into your trench by the enemy. The deadliness of the period is also well represented by the ease with which your character can be brought down to a rather nasty end, whether it be through a bullet to the skull or a mortar round to your hapless, rag doll body. This being said, I must also mention that there are times when game play breaks down to rather nasty spamming of snipers or those that can and do use grenades to a pretentious amount, forcing the enemy team to also stoop to such levels or be annihilated. While this does happen on occasion, it is few enough times to not pose a very large problem, though one that does need some balancing in the hopeful future.Of the squads I mentioned earlier, you have seven to choose from between the two sides. Three belong to Germany, where you have the Stosstruppen, Landsers, and Alpenjagers. Another four of the Entente powers include the Canadians, ""Tommies,"" Chasseurs Alpins, and Poilus. All of these have their own four variants of characters and three variants of loadouts, which add up to eighty-four different possibilities. For instance, each squad has a leader that can call down powerful artillery, noxious gas, or recon planes to give the location of enemies to you and your entire team. Or you can have machine gunners that lay down anything within their field of fire. More squad types are on the way according to the Verdun wiki, which should be very interesting in future gameplay, especially if they also were to include the Russian faction as well, though such a squad might have some internal dissention...In any case, with the exception of a few player-based hiccups, there is little that can be said against the game, besides the occasional problems for people to connect to friends at times, which could be a rather essential bug were it not to be addressed. I recommend yes for those that are looking into this game, as it is educational and fun for all that would play as a soldier of the muddy, frightening, maddening, grueling, and wonderful Verdun!			"

												It's rare I find a first person shooter I like as they sort of all seem similar to me. Although Verdun is simplistic with it's guns (it is WW1), the terrain and the way they organized the classes is what makes this game very peculiar. The setting is WW1. The battlefront is eastern France. It's you and your squad trying to push the front lines. Well, only if you choose that game mode. Verdun boasts three game modes for the moment : front lines (where it's a defend/advance territory tactic), offensive in which your constantly pushing back defenders to take control of new areas and lastly, last stand where you and a few other players have to hold back hordes of opposing players. The guns themselves are simplistic and depending whether you're playing as an Entente soldier or Central powers soldier, will determine the type of guns you use. Some guns have more ammo than other guns but (speaking specifically about rifles) each gun is relatively the same. Each player is given a rifle and a pistol. The squad leader is stuck with a pistol and cannot holster a rifle. This player has binoculars instead. With this, the squad leader is able to tell the squad where to advance as well as launch mortar/artillery fire to his choosing. The class system is a little bit different in Verdun than other games. You are not actively allowed to jump from class to class as it may be occupied already by another player. This player has to accept your offer to switch classes. This is important as this game is highly based on team work. It is near impossible to advance or defend without the help of your team mates. Most of the guns offer a one-shot kill but head shots do count for extra points. Some classes even have some high powered machine guns if you rank up enough! I should also add there is a ranking system in place where after each match you will be given experience points to unlock further arsenals. The maps/terrain are what really set apart this game from other shooters. You can't simply start running and gunning. Everything is a calculated move and no-mans land is really dangerous. You never know whose peaking from their trench waiting to pick you off. You can however, move slowly and try to remain undetected. Moving slowly and moving with squad mates really increase your chances of winning. Some action players may not like this ""look-then-move"" strategy but it's what really distinguishes the game. I'm a personal Halo fan and love the running-gunning-blowing up sort of stuff. This gives me a little break in that and also forces me to really work on my aim. It can be quite the thrill trying to advance and sneak behind enemy lines. Don't go too far though or you may be killed by the game for staying out of the playable area. All basic controls are here. WASD provides for basic movement while the mouse let's you point and shoot where you want. ""G"" throws a grenade (when you get one) while ""V"" is melee. I should add some grenades are gas grenades in which you will need to equip your mask to avoid further damage. A great feature in this game is the ability to crouch or prone when necessary. Space will stand you up or allow you to jump. Holding ""shift"" (or sprint) while aiming down your sights will make your player hold his breath for a better shot.The graphics aren't too bad at this stage. Their up there but I think they could do a little better. I have a brother (whose really into WW1/WW2) also mentioned some of the trenches are way too clean. I understand the game has to look neat to a point but some realism would be appreciated. I wouldn't mind seeing mud being slapped up by a player as he's running, or even mud pits that can slow players down. The sounds are okay at the moment and aren't extremely immersive or over the top. The basic sounds are there but adding a few more things may take the player to another level. Hearing shots skimming over your head can't be beat. Overall, this game has some huge potential. I'll be keeping an eye on it to see where it goes. I'm hoping down the line they add a few more perks and add a few more options for players to play with. I know it's world war 1, but even adding a ""radio"" that let's you ""report"" enemy positions may be cool! Luckily, there is a system now in place that takes care of this.

Early Access Review
								A very good, but somewhat simple game. < That is pretty much the only way to sum it up.In a game that seems to be the first of its kind, I find myself having to really step up and apply myself when playing this. It's a frustrating game, in that you have to be really accurate in order to get kills. There is definitely an element of skill needed to play, but that's part of the fun. There is definitely an element of teamwork and co-op required also... which is where this game will shine for most players. COD Kiddies should find something else, because going rogue in this game gets you nothing but dead. As of the release version at the time of posting this, there is a few nagging issues that you may need to keep an eye out for/be aware of..1) MG's can, and will find you... EVERY TIME. They are wildly accurate, powerful and annoying. Currently they are bugged in the fact that you can't hear them over long distances (aka ""silent MG bug"") and they are tough to spot.2) Luger is wildly accurate, seems to 2-3 hit kill over long distances (pulling off a headshot across the map with a luger isn't a tough task) but the stopping power up close is annoyingly lacking. If you can't manage to land a headshot when clearing trenches, you can and will most likely get rolled by a crackshot with their rifle. I think the luger needs a bump in damage but then so do all pistols in the game so far. A bump in damage, but nerf their long range accuracy and damage falloff.3) The Lee-Endfield/SMLE has a weird bug when using a scope on it that seems the scope isn't aligned properly. You need to aim slightly to the right of your target (if he stands still) to hit him. Ironsights on it are also bad. I'm not entirely sure of this is just one of those usual mid-dev bugs or if it was intentional, but just keep that in mind.All in all it's a very well put together game, for a game with only 3 devs. I look forward to seeing what they do in the future with updates.

												I've heard about the game for quite some time, but never tried playing it. With the Battlefield 1 hype(btw i don't like/play BF), I asked my friend to share the game with me. Turns out to be one of the most fun shooters I've ever played. Talked with friends and we all got a 4-Pack, and it was worth it.Pros:-Realistic WW1 setting.-Nice trench warfare combat.-Very good gunplay wich rewards your skill.-Easy to get classes upgrades, you don't get locked in the early game.-Nice graphics.-Great maps.-Squads rewards teamplay, especially with friends.Cons:-Some performance problems.-Sometimes you get unbalanced teams, making hard to hold or atack a trench.-Not many people play, but atleast is suficient to have maps with full teams.-Some squad bugs.Additional Notes:-It doesn't have a ingame tutorial, but it doesn't make the game bad, if you have played a lot of FPS or games like Red Orchestra 2, you won't have problems learning the game. I found it way easier than RO2. -If you need help about the game, go to Options->Game Help, there is tons of useful info to help you get into the game.-It's multiplayer only.Overall I'm having a great time playing the game, if you have a interest in WW1 setting or you want a good shooter that doesn't hold your hand too much, I recommend it in a heartbeat, be it on sale or even full price.

								This game is a good example of a unique FPS. The squad system is like nothing I've seen it is great. there are 3 squads per team... and 4 different types of squads. leveling your squad give you tons of new passive buffs, better artilliery and veteran unifroms. The way the devs have set up the squad system opens the door for tons of new squads to be added. This is a great game. Granted it does have a lot of bugs then again it is a beta. I highly reccomend you give this game a try.			"

								Verdun is a game which is an early access beta game, but even so it is already spectacular!  It is different from most first person shooters in that it is highly cooperative on each of the sides.  Individuals must join a squad which is comprised of four people each of which have different roles within the squad.  If success is to be had, it comes as being a member of a squad, and not just one of many soloists as is commonplace in most other first person shooters.  This not only gives it a unique flavor, but also gives it a strong feeling of what it was like to be fighting in World War One.  To my knowledge, this is the only World War One first person shooter ever to exist.  Other than a few flight simulators, there have been practically no games on the subject of World War One at all.  My Grandfather was a veteran of the ""Great War"" which is what it was called up until the conclusion of World War Two.  He was an officer in a tank battalion and commanded a young tanker who would eventually become famous as a World War Two hero, tanker, and general: George Patton.I highly recommend this game.  The authors are continuously updating it, sometimes as frequently as several times a day, but never less than a couple times a week.  They are dedicated to creating a great game, and thus far they have succeeded fantastically.  This game is worth every penny even in this stage of beta, and I'm sure that when it reaches its final release version, it will rank up there with the best first person shooters of all time.  Count yourself lucky by shelling out some cash, and becoming an early release beta tester of this wonderful new game.  I assure you, you will not be sorry.			"

								Ever dreamt of an FPS set in the First World War? I know I have. Verdun, mon ami, is the answer. There's almost nothing I don't like about it. Let's get to the facts!Pros?Awesome graphics, even on low settings. Over twenty weapons, all authentic, all from the war. The maps are fun and well-planned, and really immerse you in that Great War feeling. If you're afraid of being limited to bolt-action rifles and bayonets, then fear not! There's room for knives, machine guns, pistols, shovels, even submachine guns. You can mêlée with just about everything. For example, if you don't have a bayonet fixed on your rifle, you can strike with the stock. Heck, you can kill people with binoculars! The levelling system is great. Performance is good, and I've encountered very few bugs.Cons?The movement animations always get me... I mean, when you're running, your weapon just looks like it's bobbing off your chest! They need to look less robot and more human. The crawling animation isn't good. I'd like for there to be static HMGs, however the devs have said that this is a no-go.In the end? An awesome game! Among the best games I've ever played... and it's in beta! Later we'll see more maps (including a more indoor/urban map, set in fort Douaumont), more squads... who knows what else. Suffice it to say that if games were potatoes, this would be a damned good potatoe.I'll see you on the battlefield!			"

												First off this game is early access so it's not perfect. However for the most part is is a very good first-person shooter. If you are looking for a good WWI FPS, this is it. Though it is not simulater quality, it is still a very stimulating and enjoyable game.   Second, this game hostess a higher quality of gamers. So for the most part you don't have 13 year old kids telling others to ""Get rekt"" or swear every chance they get. Every now and then there will be one or two of those people, wich is unavoidable. However there is a mute option but it is not like other games and may take some time to figure out. Though I'm sure if you ask in-game there will be people to help.   Third, this game does include clans such as 'KK', 'BW' and '+', and elite players. '+Zab' is one you may hear a lot about.   Finaly, at times it can be enjoyable, agrovating or however you want to put it. Overall it is one of the best WWI FPS games you can get.			"

								So this my old review This game is clearly not at a ready standard. As someone who likes to play Red Orchestra 2 this game was a disappointment it does have postives and I feel that it will become worth my money once they add more stuff but at its current state don't buy it. If you are looking for an intense realistic shooter do not get this get Red Orchestra 2.Developer response:M2H_Mike  [developer] Posted: 31 Oct @ 9:50pmLots has changed since your review. I would appreciate it if you'd check out the game again and let me know if we're going the right direction :)But I feel its not time to make another after playing a bit more. Even though I have not played an awful lot of time there is a clear improvement beofre I would given it a 3/10 but now i would say 6/10 I can happily say in the future this game will 8/10 for me game still feels a bit clunky but looks beautiful and does feel much better to play I will wait a couple more updates to play but it is starting to be worth cost. Keep up the good work.			"

												I LOVE this game so much! The action, the explosions, the intense moments! Sure it can get a little frustrating at time to get shot dead by someone 500-1000 yards away, but you get over it pretty quickly and get back into the fight! Getting kills in this game is so satisfying, because if you miss your shot, you might end up dead for your mistake. The maps are great and varied and the graphics, while not the best, are beautiful at times and really hit home the grim nature of this game. If your into historical shooters and are in the mood for something diffrent from the regular crop of games like Call of Duty and Battlefield, come try this game! Just get ready to die, a lot!			"

												Verdun is an extremely entertaining game, which balances skill-based and shoot-'em-up in a very nice way. The restrictions of the game being a relatively accurate WWI means that there is a bit of a learning curve from more popular FPS franchises where you might not have to deal with jamming weapons, slow reload times, swaying weapons, etc. These restrictions though come together to create a more skill intensive game, which I prefer. There's a decent amount of strategy, and as with any game, you'll find yourself dying a lot early on, but once you get the hang of it, the game is very rewarding. As of right now, matchmaking doesn't do a great job of balancing teams, but you can always try and fight that by getting some friends together and voicechatting. The ingame chat tends to be rather friendly, a lot of camaraderie and discussion, as well as being decent for strategizing. A solid game that will only get better over time.			"

								A very good WW1 simulator which utilizes trench warfare to almost perfection. Camping and tactical play play a major part in this game from a defensive perspective but when attacking you need to carefully plan your attacks and attack where the enemy is weak. Infiltrating an enemy trench and stealthily killing everyone there can never get boring with the added suspension of not knowing what is behind the next trench corner. The game rewards you working as a squad with the spawn mechanic where if the leader of the squad is deep behind enemy lines the squad players can spawn on him and help with the capturing of the trench. The game also has a one shot kill mechanic for rifles where the best marksman will be the one to get the kill to add further suspense. The developers have also added massive amount of historical accuracy in the gun designs ;  the outfits of the soldiers also look amazing. Well worth the buy for its price and the game has still got more to come from it when the official release comes.			"

Product received for free
												Although I was gifted this game, I can definitely say this game would be worth buying. (Especially if you get it on sale).This game could be considered ""competetive"". I can most compare this to Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad.Although the game is not as easy as a run and gun. It definitely has its moments of derpyness, and it is really fun to create a squad of friends and to go out charging into the battlefield (Most of the time you'll end up dead).Pros:-Forward spawn (and this varies for different squad types). This allows there to be some mobility on the map, as squad leaders advance and take cover, your squadmates can spawn on you.-Variety of different weapons and squads.-Squad Abilities capture arty spam of WW1 well.-The maps are very well balanced. Sometimes it is balanced so well, specific maps will end in a stalemate 9/10 times.This can be seen as a pro and a con if you don't like static games.-It is still in development and the devs seem to do a good job at fixing bugs that appear in the latest patches, the patches don't add pointless stuff to the game.-Squad Progression: I don't think there is an ""OP"" squad ability, even as your squad levels up. Bonuses to your squad are well balanced, but still worth achieving. How you level up your squad, is mostly affected by how many matches you play with the people in your squad. Because of this, you pretty much need to play this game with friends if you want to unlock squad abilities. As for unlocking new weapons, you will get career points over time that you can spend on particular positions in different squads.Cons:-There are still glitches that appear after each patch, but these seem to be rapidly decreasing over time. -The game is still being optimized. Even if you have a half decent graphics card, you might get frame drops every now and then until they optimize it more.-Sometimes it is hard to find a full game depending on what time you're playing, and where in the world you live. Most of the time you can just switch to another server like EU and there will be full games.-You will die a lot in the beginning.Overall people who don't like slower paced games where you die a lot won't like this too much.

												Honest review: This game has been around way before Battlefield came up with the WWI idea. In my honest opinion it executes everything better overall. Realism is this games forte, nothing arcade like in the ways of BF or CoD. There are no F1 accelerating tanks or no-trench maps. This is actual WWI, as it was intended to be. You play as a forgotten soldier in the muddy and rainy trenches of France. A bullet can kill you, or fatally wound you. Gas attacks or barbed wire can be very troublesome either. There are also several modes to play and the biggest thing they have is the trench warfare style move forwards and backwards maps. It is true that the game requires a good rig to run smooth but if you have it and if you like realistic shooters on WWI, then I say it is a must get. You get the most bang for your buck. Have fun and see you in the ghastly trenches of war !			"

								A rarely seen WW1 shooter emerges from the unknown. <- That was pretty much my mind when i saw the game first.Since i am a great fan of World War 1 shooter, i said to myself, it's worth a checkout.And it was really worth it. Even though my computer is pretty bad at the moment, i can handle this game without losing pleasure at the game itself.The graphic are not high quality but then again remember: My computer is pretty bad and it's still early acces. I would stay neutral at this point because i'm not in the position to judge over the graphic with a computer like this.The feeling of sitting in a trench...just waiting for the enemy to run into your gun is amazingly caught! Before i forget there are Squads (4 people working together...reminds me of L4D but don't mind that, it was basicly it in WW1). Imagine you are in the defense move of your newly captured trench line. 4 Squads are holding the position. But if one Squad is whiped out during the defense...you are at risk of getting flanked, so you have to look up your map more often to avoid that risk, to reinforce weakend sites of your trench.The WW1 feeling is once more amazingly caught by the gameplay itself. If you get shot, it's over pretty much 90% of the time. You need to be careful if you advance to the enemy trench, if the enemy sees you and you are not fast enough, it's over. Even if you can't see the enemy... there could still be someone targeting you, a world war 1 feeling greatly captured. And if there's a short time of silence in the battlefield... be aware! Somebody could be aiming at your head.All in all to not make this too long, Verdun is a great WW1 shooter. WW1 shooter are seen rarely and if there is one game like this, it does not capture the trench warfare, gas warfare and the psychotic warfare as nearly as Verdun! PROS  - Great feeling when playing the game (doesn't matter whether it's the Entente cordiale or the ""Axis""- Greatly capture of the units sended into the war back in the time.- Sounds are quite noticble- Great capture of the trench warfare and the combined gas warfare- historicly correct battlefields, weapons and looks of the units- nice rank up system- World War 1 shooter- Balanced gameplay (Outcome depends on the players) Neutral - Graphic which i can't judge about CONS - pretty empty servers - can be frustrating (if your hard work, to get to the enemy trench line is destroyed by one shot but then again... WW1)- Ranking up can be pretty hard if you have a skilled enemy teamI hope i could help you people out there a little bit with the decision to buy Verdun or not.Greetings			"

Early Access Review
								The definitive World War 1 western front experience. For ages I have desired a fun and authentic experience. These devs have delivered. Clear and personal communication with the community is impressive and refreshing. This game is giving me many hours of enjoyment with old school WW1 era bolt action rifles and early MG's. The cooperative team play with friends is amazing and addictive. Verdun has a small but active and growing community. Most are friendly and have met some very nice people.			"

								FInally, a WWI shooter... It looks great, feels similar to Red Orchestra 2 in some respects, while staking out new territory for historical shooters. While they're working out the bugs in the beta, that shouldn't stop you from buying the game now! Only multiplayer for now. There are French, English, Canadian, & German squads... with more on the way.This is quite an accomplishment for the small group of devs involved.The squad based combat means there are defined roles such as officer, rifleman, support gunner, sniper, scout, and fragman in each squad. Lots of fun!			"

												A one of a kind Historical FPS. The game takes its title from the most infamous battle of World War I and its prodominate feature is its historically accurate weapons, uniforms, and battlefields. Players will work in 4 man specialized squads on either the Entente or Central powers' side. Gameplay involves defending your trench and attacking theirs within an alotted time. This is more fun than it sounds at first, as your whole team will need to work together and communicate to capture the enemy line. Obsticles include enemy gas and mortars, machine gun fire, rifle fire, grenades, barbed wire, sandbags, trench works, shellholes, old vehicles, dead horses, and more.This is definately a game for those who are history buffs, FPS fanatics, or looking to die a whole lot. Not for the easily frusterated. Weapons (especially rifles) will present a slight learning curve because of the bullet drop and physics of WWI-era weapons. The news and game updates are constant and the team is highly dedicated. Devs often play matches and converse with the players.Pros:- Fun and Addicting Gameplay- Historically accurate weapons, uniforms, and maps- Devoted Developers- Great Community (League/Tournament + Plenty of Clans)- Multiple Servers which are usually populated decentlyCons:- Bugs and glitches here and there (Devs will fix major ones asap)- Slight learning curve for new players- You'll die a lot. But it's WWI.9/10 "

												After playing 149 hrs, i would like to share my opinion about this game.Right now, this is the best WW 1 Multiplayer Shooter avaible. A lot has been written about the good parts of the game, things i do not need to repeat. I do agree with them though.And yet i do not recommend it, here is why:1) The netcode is simply the worst. The server trusts the client, this means: Client A says ""I hit Client B"" and the server informs Client B that he has been hit and is dead. That Client B allready had his head down in the trench is of no interest. See the problem there ? People with high pings will♥♥♥♥♥♥you good, especially if you are on a very good connection. Because your information where you move reaches them faster, than their movement info reaches you. Also this kind of client-trust makes the game very vunerable for ""hacking-tools"" - something that had The Divison loose a lot of players. But in all my play time, i never really experienced obvious skript kiddies and i dont consider it a problem.2) The game randomly disconnects you upon map change, or when you try to join with a squad. If youre lucky and on of your squad-mates made it through the map-change progress you have to join him quick via steam overlay. Otherwise some other player might take your spot ...3) The maps are filled with stupid bugs that make you fly up in the air or randomly for example.4) All the above problems are not new. They exist for long. And yet what do the devs do ? They work on a silly console version which will fail hard because of Battlefield 1.Verdun is a great game, which is marvelous to enjoy with three friends. But if your not a hardcore fan of Simulator like WW1 with friends: Dont buy!			"

												Fantastic game. It truly gives the feel of a real world war 1 combat experience. The weapons are balenced and time accurate, all of the soldier models and faction uniforms look great. The only things I would add to make it better is more players per game, more maps like the somme, vimy ridge, and passchendaele, maybe more customisation for personal soldiers to use in game, use of stationary weapons (machine guns & artillery), and maybe a bit more rain. Overall great game for the gamer who likes realistic world war 1 combat over fast paced and full of automatics.			"

												holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game is amazing..i'm big into world war one. There's really not a lot of world war one games worth a damn on steam and besides this one they're all strategy pretty much. Verdun is a world war one game more then anything else. Muddy trenches, muddy nomansland, muddy everything. Artillery shells falling, gas floating into your shellhole, Rifles crack from all over, the occasional sound of a lewis gun firing rattles in your ears. The atmosphere is amazing, although sometimes maps are lacking players. There are several maps, each based on a different section of line on the western front. From Flanders, the muddy, stalemate of a map, to the Aisne, a rather unscathed piece of battlefield with trees growing and pretty foliage (lots of hiding spots). The mechanics are great (with the exception of one) and amazing for a world war one game. THIS IS NOT A GENERIC SHOOTER. The ballistics are probably unlike anything you've seen, and the change from assault rifles to your bolt action enfields and lebels is an awesome change of pace in a game. The game focuses on attack and defend gameplay, and can sometimes result in very trench warfare-esque stalemates. There's a time limit to prevent too much of a boring stalemate though. You can level up and unlock new weapons for your classes, and pick from one of several squads from each side, such as Poilus, Landsers, Tommies, Alpenjager, etc.If you play with the same squad members a few times you will earn squad xp earning you bonuses like better artillery, more points, and late war uniforms. The graphics are also amazing, especially for an indie game. THE ONE FLAW I have with this game is the melee. I think its pretty lacking for a world war one game where hand to hand combat was the norm. But this is a minor flaw, I just hope it gets improved down the road. And on that note my final praise. The devs started working on this sometime around 2006-7? And they finished the thing this long after? Thats a crazy feat for indie developers, and they have showed they will provide regular updates that are very good unlike many early access developers. That's all good, but even after the game has been released they have just now unveiled their plans for after the games release. A BUNCH of huge updates, FREE! Adding things like night maps, US squads, flamethrowers, gore, and more! AMAZING game!			"

												(My first review)I cannot remember when i bought this game, some time ago. Alot has changed and this game has become quite interresting. Although it is not finished yet.I have to admit, in the beginning i did not really liked it(early access/alpha/beta/bugs/cluckyness etc), but something has changed....it has become a really good game.Some people compare it to RO/RO2, i think thats true. I recommend because:If you are interrested in World war 1.If you like similar games such a RO. (somewhat realistic, it is not extremely realistic though)If you like to level-up and progress.If you (like me) like trech warfare game modes of attack and defend and vica versa.I do not recommend because:If you like quick run and gun FPS games.If you like extreme up to date graphics (personaly i care alot more about gameplay)If you don't like to die alot and quickly in a FPS game.If you don't care about history(WW1), and is only interrested in modern stuff.I can recommend this game. Gameplay:9Graphics:7 (i have to admit, sometimes a little bit weak, floating trees bushes etc. however the game is made by 3 people, so i have read. Accualy that is amazing)Sound:8Originality:9Support of Dev's:10 (active witch patches and active on steam to awnser questions)  "

												well to start off this game is actualy really fun when your a low level you  get into matches were there are only bolt action rifles (idk if this still happens or not) which is really balanced slow game mode that is increadibly fun and addictive but as you level up you run into the other classes which before was totally terrible and annoying (when a guy with a machine gun runs up and mows your entire 7 person team down)but i came back to the game seeing as i left cause im  butt hurt loser that with all the updates since ive been gone the game really got spiced up with all the newer unique weapons and maps this really balances it out in a nice unique game play that is a must have if you are into world war 1 because everything is historicaly correct and i gotta say ive had some real shell shock moments like this one time i respawned with 10 or so others and we all ran out of this trench thinking it was safe well turns out a macine gunner set up right in front of us and i accendintly went prone and the whole squad got tore apart 1 by 1 with bullets shreading threw them and artillery right on top of me i was amazed to see i was the sole surviver of that i laid there for a solid 50 second trying to fasten what happened and exprinces like that in games are just something that youll never forget and thats why i love games like these10/10 would get shell shock again			"

												It is a breathe of fresh air in the sea of Modern Shooters to see a shooter from the World Wars. However, this isn't World War II but the Great War of 1914-18. See the harsh and violent war right at your finger tips. This game gives a glipse into the hell of Trench Warfare as you play the soldiers of the Central Power Germany against the Entante forces of Great Britian, Canada and France. (Soon the United States)Verdun uses a squad base system with each squad having it's own unique weapons and classes to fill with seperate abilities to use to help claim victory.There are three game modes to choose from but only the main Trench Games are where you're going to find people playing with 16 on 16 battles. 32 players slugging it out in the trenches. (I wish for maybe 32 on 32 but not a real complaint) The enemy charging your trench is the least of your worries as gas attacks, recon planes, mortars and bombardments can rain down on you at anytime. Once you repeal the enemy charge, it's now your turn to charge in the Counter-Attack. Beware though, you can lose your head to a sniper and machine gun fire.I am glad to see a game that covers over the Great War as it's often looked over for World War II. The game is a blast but it does have it's own share of problems in my opinion.The boundaries can often get annoying as you are executed for sticking your pinky toe in the red for too long or when an attack fails, you have so many seconds to retreat back to your trench before you are executed for desertion, so it doesn't allow you to stick around to slow down the enemy's counter attack. Games are often one sided with the game asking people to switch sides. It's counter to this is putting a penalty on the outnumbering side to prolong their respawn. From what I see is there is no voting system in place to allow you to vote someone out of your squad. For example, my friends and I often play in the same squad but on occasion, one of us suffer a disconnection from the server. A new player will join the game and take our friend's spot. You can ask him to leave the squad but you often told ""No."" You can't vote him out of the squad now and your friend is out of luck again.What I'd like for the developers to add in and I know this is primarily done over the Western Front but I'd like something to show the Eastern and Southern Fronts of the war.The snowy mountain battles in the Carpathians between the Germans and Austrians against the Russians.The German Push against the Russians in Poland and Lithuania.The Urban Battles in Serbia and Poland.The Gallipoli landings of the Entante against the Ottomans. So much more.The game is a solid enjoyment for History lovers and shooter fans. I highly recommend it.			"

Why has no one tried games like this before ?Attacking, defending and holding trenches - which btw is very hard unless your team works together.If you like tactical shooters that punish poor decisions this is for you. Your team is divided into4 man squads of slightly varied equipment. TEAMWORK is VITAL.Putting AAA games to shame with 4 FREE DLC 's under development.Smaller aussie community but there is always a couple of matches going with good connection.I really wish this game had a larger aussie community but have had no issues thus far.To all those who served in WW1 Lest we forget.

												Verdun is a tactical WW1 FPS with an emphasis on teamwork revolving around 4 man squads. The gameplay and visual style of the game is similiar to Red Orchestra 2\Rising Storm, although there are several unique elements involving trench based combat and some unorthodox class loadouts (get used to using handguns and revolvers, which are quite handy in some circumstances). Getting your head around these unique elements might take a few hours and you'll probably die a lot, much like the real inexperienced soldiers of WW1, but after gaining a bit of experience Verdun is a very exciting and rewarding gaming experience.Highly Recommended unless you suck at games			"

												This game is amazing. I was initially skeptical that a WWI game could ever be fun considering how the battles played out in real life, but the map design is so good that you can actually attack without getting mowed down if you take the right path and find the right cover. Still though, there are times when your entire team gets mowed down, but then you get to mow down the enemy team when you're on the defense so it balances out. It's just a wonderfully crafted game.

If you like making friends and don’t mind moments of intensity (when you’re forced to rush the battlefield) and having motor blasts and gas attacks every 5-15 minutes this is definitely the game for you!

												I followed this game through most of its development over the last year.  I was originally drawn to it for the subject matter, and despite its, at times, quirky aspects, such as somewhat crude character models and cartoonish animations, I found myself sticking with it.  The gameplay always drew me back, and I found myself devoting more and more of my limited gaming time to this intriguing game.Slowly, over more than a hundred builds(!), the developers changed one thing, then another and another, in a steady march to completion.  It hasn't always been a straight line to the finish - sometimes two steps forward, one step back - but these guys perservered, and succeeded, in ways both surprising and impressive.What started out as a clever, quaint little Indie game, fun in its own right, has blossomed into something much different.  The talented minds behind this effort could have stopped trying to improve things long ago, and still have it be considered a success.  Instead, through relentless hard work and obvious devotion, they have produced what, to me, is the best looking, most immersive, fun (and intense)  multiplayer FPS I've ever had the pleasure to play.  From the choice of a graphics engine to attention to gameplay elements, they've managed to do what virtually everybody said couldn't be done - create a compelling FPS based on the First World War.  Graphically, this is hands down the most gorgeous game I've ever played, of any genre.  Fantastic artwork, gentlemen!  You've put the big-budget boys to shame!There may still be some elements that are less than perfect, but it has been a real pleasure to follow the development of the game through beta to release, and I suspect that development will continue.  If you like multiplayer FPS games, you owe it to yourself to try this absolutely stunning effort.  I highly recommend it (as if that was in doubt)!Thanks to the devs for bringing this game to life.  Thank you, thank you.  I only wish I had the time and the stamina to play it more!			"

												Can't remember when or how i found out about this game but i am so happy i did! The maps (for me) do an incedible job of creating and conveying that ""feel"" of a heavily bombed and trenched landscape. As for being a beta the only thing that i've even noticed were some lag spikes. And thats no biggie for me, annoying but not game breaking.[[EDIT]] I have been having a bit of a problem at the end of battle which sometimes results in the game hanging in such a way that i have to (manually via alt-tab) close it down and re-start the client/game. Again annoying, but not game breaking for me as it seems to only happen once every 5 or 6 matches. [edit] Two days and an update later the issue is completly resolved. If by some miracle the devs read this you guys rock!Also the graphics are beautiful all around with some nice animations for a beta too. Although the movement and associated animations can feel a bit sloppy (reminds me a bit of arma 2) it's a good starting point. Sounds are great as well. Again it's a beta, but probably the most stable and playable beta i've ever had the pleasure of being a part of. Just in case it matters to you, I run Verdun with everything turned UP as high as it goes![My PC = i7 4770 + GTX 770 4GB oc]Here (as in the real trenches of WW1) if you are silly enough to poke your head up to take a look over the trench, you will most likley catch a bullet in the face. So team work, timing and caution are key. Also the fact that every one is packing a single shot bolt action rifle means that running blindly around a corner, or skylining a ridge or hill top will result in you getting shot (again) and possibly giving your squads position away. I also love the way the battle flows in a similar way to the battles of the first war. Men were massed, a whistle was blown and they went over the top to take the enemy position. The gameplay is a similar series of attacks and counter atacks with little to no ground changing hands (just like the real deal). Many will not like this as a shooter for many different reasons and thats ok. But if you're looking for something a little harder than the usual shooter Verdun offes what i feel is a refreshing take on the trenches of the first world war. This game requires a more thought out and ""calm under fire"" aproach. Move as a group, don't bunch up, cover your corners and listen for the gunfire. I can't wait to see what the developers (who are very active and open to feedback) add to the game next! 22/07/14 - Still loving this game. Animations and sounds have been improved and some time soon (I hope) they will be adding gas attacks. This should really shake things up in terms of game play and make storming that trench all the more deadly!15/02/15 - It just keeps getting better! Now with a new engine this game is starting to really take shape. The graphics are better, the physics (bullet drop/lead) are good and getting better. Gas attacks, trench clubs and to top it all off they now have an Australia/Pacific server. Constant updates and feedback from both the community and the devs keep this game evolving and moving in a very positive direction. Thanks for reading!			"

												Verdun is a massive multiplayer first person shooter in set in the world war one. loading into a match, you get placed into a squad and fill a specific role. The summary of this game is trench warfare because you're forced to stay in the trenches You live in the trenches and that is why I love this game. Don't trhow yourself in a open battlefield only to be a ""rambo"" because you will get instantly killed, this is a tactical game not cod. one thing sometimes you need to use a gas mask yeah the gas mask obsucured your vision, but it's better than choking death.i recommend this game for lovers of World War I. vote 8/10			"

								To stand out amidst a sea of generic shooters takes a bit of work. Fortunately, Verdun stands out by virtue of the setting - World War I. Despite being almost ideal for translation into gaming, Verdun is the first FPS to really put a player in first-person WWI combat. The attack/defend system is ideal for the core gameplay, and the different abilities within a squad is a nice take on a familiar mechanic. The small dev team is evident as soon you start the game, but really the appeal of Verdun is that it takes place in an oft-overlooked period of history. By that fact, the sort of player that is attracted to this game is also the sort of player who can look past a lack of polish and just enjoy what is a very rare, and very fun gaming experience. Immer weiter Kameraden.			"

								If you've ever romanticized about the first world war as a story of how brave men left their wives and significant others to go slug it out against the forces of the German Empire and win a victorious battle then Verdun might just be the game for you. Just like the millions of brainwashed idiots that signed up to fight in this ridiculous war you too can reimmerse yourself in the horror of trench warfare. See comrades ripped to shreds by mortors and machine gun fire, experience the fear of being forced out into no mans land by your commanding officer and become entangled in barb wire sharp as razors while bullets, mortors and grenades rain down on your p'iss soaked position. Witness death and destruction on a scale never seen before as the devs are soon to include mustard gas where animations of violent choking and vomiting are almost a surety. Increase your squad XP by sticking with the same lonely cun'ts who play this game day and night to unlock horrifying artillary weapons that unleash total destruction upon your enemies. I recommomend this game to anyone who believes in gentlemanly warfare.			"

								Verdun is a lot of fun, especially for the casual gamer such as myself.  Although, if you enjoy CoD (the only other modern shooter I have played) look elsewhere.  This is not a free for all shooting match.  It actually takes skill more than luck to have a high Kill-Death Ratio.  That being said, the history buff and late 19th/early 20th century fan will thoroughly enjoy Verdun.  Good graphics, fun player base, and definitely worth the $16.			"

								A lot of people on the forums are asking if this is ""like Red Orchestra"", so I'll address that here:It's a bit different. It's more about attack/defend. If you decide to camp in the trenches when you're supposed to be assaulting, you essentially screw your squad and your entire team over. When you start the game you can choose a squad of 4 players, from a long list, to join and then you fulfill a role in that squad. There's a grenadier, marksman, rifleman, assaulter (3 round fixed magazine with a long bayonet affixed to the rifle), commander (can call in mortar strikes and tell the squad where to go and what to do, when you're around your commander you receive a boost), etc. (there are a few more classes that I forgot about). As it stands, I'd say it's a little less realistic than Red Orchestra since there's no blood/gore and the explosions need an overhaul. There is also the possibility of them adding mustard gas in the future. Once they add those then I'd say it's on par or even better. Gameplay wise it's more squad based, and there's a lot more emphasis on teamwork and moving forward. You will not be rewarded if you sit back and watch your teammates die. Don't be that guy sitting in the trenches while everyone else is trying to seize the enemy front.  Hopefully they integrate an anti-cheat system soon, since there are occassional no-life, pencil armed, basement dwelling, losers that ruin the experience.Game can also do with a little optimization, since there is occassional lagg here and there on Ultra, and some strange texturing/shadows. The death animations (at least for my computer) look a little strange (e.g. like they're ragdolling in slow motion...sort of like Mount&Blade). Hasn't detracted from my experience at all though. I'm also hoping they add some bullet physics, since you don't need to compensate at all. The rifles are primarily bolt action and you're required to hold down the reload (R) button to fully reload the fixed magazine.  In my opinion, this adds to the realism, since it takes more than a split second to reload fully.  I'm hoping there's a little more recoil added to the rifles, since in my experience you can stay on target no problem, when in reality you'd need to reacquire the target and adjust your aim.The grenades are great.  As mentioned, they need a bit of a graphical upgrade, but hot damn are they fun to use.  Just toss a few of them into the enemy trenches where you know a group of namby pamby's are hiding and then revel in how incredibly useful you are to both your team and your squad.  There's now a huge gap in the enemy defenses and it's all thanks to you.  Assaulting enemy trenches is more strategic than you'd think.  Running straight at them is, surprisingly, a very bad idea.  You'll be cut down EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.  Instead, you are required to find a gap in their defenses (hopefully you have a skilled grenadier with you) and push towards that position.  Take the Rambo's with you and let them go first if you want.  They'll clear the traps and smoke out the aforementioned namby pamby's.  I'd say if you're a fan of history, Red Orchestra, and WWI then go for it.			"

								this game plays well, from the sound of the guns to the pace of the battle, the only issue I have found, is being in AU, the game is all but unplayable with the current lack of servers in the local area. ""cloud based muliplayer server"" sounds great but a ping of 320-450 is not.If local or SEA servers were providing steady pings under 100, sure this would be a no brainer to recommend, at present though if you are in AU, avoid this until such an option becomes available.as a MP only game, it is very disappointing to not be able to run a local server or find a low ping server.while I am clicking on YES I recommend the game, I am doing so on the provision you dont live in Australia.

With so many moderm FPS games they get a bit drab this addition spices up the FPS market! Only playing a few minutes of the game I can tell it is good. If the steam workshop if implemented it would only improve the game further. I would love to see this game one day become a AAA title.

								Verdun takes us back 100 years ago, durning ""The Great War'"". Personally I'm glad to finally see this period of our beautiful history taken onto digital entertainment.At first you may think it's one of those Red Orchestra title, with unsteady recoil and other ""realistic"" implements, however the answer is no. Verdun aims to be in the middle between ""realistic"" let's say Red Orchestra style and bit casual Call of Duty 2( no bullet drop and etc)  and it does it very well. Therfore both groups of players should find Verdun suitable for them. Yes, we have seen it with RO 2 where the devs tried to make the game more ""easy"" to attrack casual players and we all know how that ended. Verdun is different.The key of the game are so called squads, now before you start playing you might want to read very well written guide about it, trust me it will save you being confused when you start playing the game. In other games for example Battlefield the squad thing is optional with Verdun it's a must do thing, you can't pass it. Squads in Verdun make gameplay both tactical and dynamic, if you already have some friends to work together the gameplay expierience will be really pleasant. If not then I'm sure after a while you'll find some friends that will play with you.  One of the things that I really liked about the game is the ""Counter attack"" mode, where you take the objective and then have to hold it and vice versa if you lose it, just like in WWI, huh. The devs are constantly working to offer us more and better therfore the future of the game looks promising. If you are into ""WWII"" shooters definitely give it a go, no matter if you are into realistic or casual shooters. Verdun offers fun and ""epic"" gameplay for both.			"

								I love playing Verdun.  It's frenetic, in your face, brutal, compelling, sounds amazing and genuinely makes me feel like my♥♥♥♥♥is on the line..  I'm a long time Battlefield 1942 / Vietnam player with the occasional Modern Warfare mod from years ago.. years of early Counter Strike AWP'ing around..  I played Battlefield 4 multiplayer very briefly and went back to Battlefield P4F - Call of Duty Advanced Warfare got all of 45 minutes before I said 'what is this cr*p' and went back to finding something interesting which is where I came across Chivalry Medieval Warfare and thoroughly enjoyed the 'oh.. he's going to hurt me' gritty close range fighting but always felt it a bit cliched, with Verdun it's got the intensity of Chivalry without the moment to look each other over.. if you stare into someones eyes in Verdun one of you is going to die and that happens a lot.  The maps?  Glorious.. some are wide and expansive rolling fields of carnage, some are watery graves of face crawling, all with layer upon layer of attack and riposte.  My only frustration is people seem to not acknowledge the game for what it is - a rolling to and fro of attack and defence - this means as the attack phase timer ticks down, 5 or 10 team mates will be laying prone, meters from the enemy trench seemingly frozen in space and time..  if the timer ticks out and you haven't got the trench, you loose your attack wave (and eventually the game)..  the historical trauma of WWI was the obscene body count due to hurling massive numbers against each other ..  as this is a WWI game, sitting on your♥♥♥♥♥meters from the objective does nothing except frustrate your team mates and amuse your enemy.  Get with the program - Take the trenches (and die trying).It might be a worthwhile feature to have a 'ground covered / advanced' counter so everyone could see who was covering the most forward ground and potentially, that NCO's could execute those who refuse to attack.  You want to hide in a trench and not go forward when the whistle blows?  Bullet for you buddy.			"

								A nice game that's currently doing a good job in its beta stage. This is my first game to try out bolt-action weapons from WWI, and I will say that they are quite ""Noob-friendly"" and easy to adapt to. The new models on the Central and Entente powers look great! The only issue I have with this game is the optimization. My PC can run Red Orchestra 2 on Ultra at 60 fps but this game runs at 20 fps on high for me. It's not that much of an issue since I can get 35 fps on medium graphics and barely notice a difference, but I suggest that the devs keep working on improving the optimization with each update. Another addition that i think would be nice would be bayonet/trench club charges to give another option while traversing no man's land.			"

Truly, there was not a more normal day here on the western front. I crouch in my dugout with my buddy Hanz; we have a picture of glorious Kaiser Wilhelm captioned, ""Gott Mit Uns!"" hanging on the wall. I stroke his majestic waxed moustache for good luck. The whistle blows. Stuffing the picture in my jacket, I leap over the top with Hanz following right behind me.      There is a boom. I am showered in a torrent of blood as Hanz is blown apart by a mortar round directly to the sternum. Lying on the ground with most of his ribs and vital organs nowhere to be seen, Hanz shouts, ""Nice mortar!"". In the distance, I hear a Brit shout back, ""Thanks mate!"". RIP Hanz. Nevertheless, I charge on right at the baguette twirling Poilu, who, glass of wine in one hand, white flag in the other, cry ""Mon Dieu!"" as I jump into the trench and begin skewering them for Der Kaiser. All surrender. None survive. The incest-ridden Tommies are coming now. One shouts, ""Oii! It be 6'bong ya git! That's tea time, you damn hun!"" and he fires his Lee Enfield at me. Not being of superior German quality like my Ruhr made Gewehr, the bullet invariably bounces off my Pickelhaulbe and kills the Canadian's goaly. I then take a shot and blow all of the crooked teeth out of the Brit's mouth. The Canadians are mad that their goaly's dead though, so they run at me hockey sticks drawn, shouting, ""Eh! You hoser! You ruined our game, eh!"" Sadly, most, drunk on maple syrup, trip on the slippery ice and crack their skulls. Those that make it to me begin to beat me with their hockey sticks. I feel numb. Then, all is white. All is quite. Der Kaiser reaches his hand out to  me and I take it. I have no fear for Der Kaiser is with me now. Der Kaiser sees all. Der Kaiser hears all. Der Kaiser is all. Heil Der Kaiser!-=November 11th, 1918=-NEWS FROM THE FRONT:     Germany's forces prevail as the French all surrender and the British swim back home to watch soccer, using their teeth to carve boats out of trees. The Canadians summarily abandoned their posts and beat each other to death after a controversial hockey game. German boots beat on the streets of Paris! Heil Der Kaiser!			"

												Verdun is excellent WW1 FPS game and its for sure my favourite history war shooting game ever. Graphics is very good and atmosphere is perfect. Maps are great and for every map there is historical explanations about battle whos going on there. Game have options for ""gore"", so when its On it shows the bloody picture of the war what is big plus for the game effect, and that makes body parts to be all over place after bomb or mortar explodes, when you shoot some soldier he starts screaming like in Chivarly medival warfare, here just a bit longer etc.. Game have 72 types of weapons what includes rifles, pistols, machineguns, bombs, mortars, poison gases etc.Its based on trench warfare what gameplay makes static in some sort of Red Orchestra 2. There are 3 game mods and a co-op modes based on hold the ground against AI. Developers are still working on the game and recently they release (for free ofc,) new pack what game makes even more exciting. Also after sometime they release updates for the game for imprvements.Community is great, mostly nice and chill people. There is no co*ksucki*g little♥♥♥♥♥s who f*ck your mom every match.Things I dont like in this game is there are still some minor bugs. Biggest issue what I experienced, but very rarely, maybe 2 times, that weapon disappears from your hands and you are disabled to do anything except walking. But in the end game is playable and awesome.Like I said, gameplay is statical warfare. If you are some fast jump shooting killer player guy who dont like old guns SPECIFICALLY bolt-action rifles, then its better for your wallet and your nervers to skip this beauty. In this game many dies, A LOT. But you never know, maybe when you start playing it you may like it, so besides this review play some youtube video about gameplay of the game.			"

												A few days prior to seeing Verdun on the Holiday Sale, my friends and I were discussing the lack of any WWI shooters available on the market. When I saw this game on the Steam listing, it was like seeing our discussion come to life. With the historical aspects of the Great War as well as the cooperative aspects one looks for in a multiplayer game, Verdun has reached every expection I set when discussion the ""hypothetical"" WWI shooter. The squad system allows for extremely balanced gameplay in addition to promoting teamwork. Furthermore, the in-game mechanics revolving around trench warfare allow for a sort of ""flow"" not present in most multiplayer games. Overall, grab a few friends (3+ for maximum efficiency) and have fun travelling back about 100 years to fight alongside others in one of the best multiplayer games I've played in a long time.			"

												Not your typical first person shooter, in a good way. Nice gunplay and fun to play with friends as a squad since everyone has a different role to fullfill. Also the WW1 setting is amazing, never seen that before. Occasionaly I encounter some ping problems but besides that solid performance (45-60 fps on ultra with an HD7950 and i5-4960K).			"

												Verdun is a First Person Shooter game set during World War I. The developers have a large focus on authenticity with this game, trying to create an accurate representation of what it may have been like in the various brutal trenches and No Man's Lands of the conflict. In terms of gameplay, there are four different game modes that can be played with friends or solo. Frontlines is the main game mode where the objective is either to leave your (somewhat) safe trench and sprint across No Man's Land dodging gunfire and bombs into the enemy trench and capture it for your side or defend your trench from the attackers by sniping, calling mortar fire, using recon planes to spot enemies and using mount machine guns to mow down the numbers. One thing that many new players may dislike at first is that you WILL die. It more or less cannot be avoided in this game, although, I think it adds to the overall experience. This mode is awesome fun, especially with a four man squad of yourself and friends. The other modes include Attrition Warfare (which is effectively a Team Deathmatch mode), Squad Defense (a wave survival mode against bots than can be played with friends) and Rifle Deathmatch (a free for all gamemode). Squad Defense is pretty fun and can prove to be quite a challenge as you progress through the waves. The other two are pretty simple and if you have played TDM or FFA gamemodes before you know what to expect. The player can create a four man squad from a variety of different countries involved in the War, comprising of the Entente Side (Britain, Scotland, France, Canadian, American etc.) and the Central Powers Side (Germany). Both sides have different classes unique to certain countries, for example, the German ""Pionere"" Squad has a Flamethrower, other squads don't but have some other unique weapons or classes. One smart feature of the squads is when playing with the same players, the squad levels up and most of these squad ranks offer advantages like smaller cooldown times on abilities, different uniforms, longer hold breath time for sniping etc. There are still a few factions missing but they will probably be added in due time. The NCO of each squad can set a marker on areas to advance towards or defend as well as call in a mortar strike, a recon plane or a gas bomb on a highlighted area. However, only certain squad types will get to call in each attack which allows different squads being able to do numerous things for their allies. The gas attacks are just awesome, requiring anyone nearby to equip their gasmasks and hinder their visability. There are a variety of different weapons that can be used by the player. From the SMLE rifle to the MP18 machine gun to the trench clubs, spades and bayonets to the close quarters Trenchgun, there is so much choice and you will find that some weapons work way better on certain maps (snipers will be more useful in long, open No Man's Lands but may be harder to use in a close quarters, mazelike trench system). Nothing quite beats the adrenaline of driving a bayonet into someone's neck in a deep, muddy trench.The maps are very atmospheric and look like they have been completely modeled off of the photographs of the battlefields. These maps range from huge, open, crater-filled fields to deep and damp trenches. While there is a small number of maps, they are randomly selected so you are pretty much always playing on a different map.One thing that is specifically awesome is the extreme level of detail in the gory aspects of the war. Heads getting blown apart, bullets shatter skulls, grenades and bombs blow off limbs and flamethrowers leave a path of charred corpses behind. There are animations for various ways you can die. These animations, while can be glitchy, really create an intense atmosphere and are quite immersive. One example of this is while myself and another player were sniping, the other player was shot in the neck and fell backwards grasping his throat as blood spurted everywhere. That, paired with the distant screams and gunfire, created a fantastic, cinematic feeling.Technically, the game runs fairly well for me, only slightly dipping in fps at the start of a match. The online connectivity is relatively stable and I've only had one or two disconnects. The game feels pretty clunky at times and could probably be smoother, especially when you're having an intense melee battle with an enemy and you both look like foosball players in the process.Overall, the developers did a great job of creating an intense, authentic World War I experience and while it is clunky at times, it still is a great game for a World War I enthusiast.I recommend this game, especially if it's on sale.

								Before we get into the details, I want to say that this game is still in beta, with more content and bug fixes promised to be coming. With that said, Verdun is still a very fun and addicting game. The weapons are accurate for the time, so if you do not like bolt action rifles, this may not be the game for you. The gamemode frontline is unique in the way that you alternate from being on the offense and defense, and this simulates WW1 very well. Overall, this game is a great addition to anyone's game library, and it has the potential to get even better, so get it now before the price increases.			"

								Verdun (beta) is set in the middle of WW1 on the frontline of the western front. It offers both realism and casual gameplay and is fun for all. It tries offer trench warfare and does to some success. I think that's why the game has a unique taste and why I enjoy it, I haven't seen any other game offer this different perspective before. My only problem with the game at the minute are the servers. I recieve lots of lag and jumpyness from other players and slow reaction time. Hopefully when the game is fully released there will be more servers and more local ones too.8/10			"

								This is the best fps game I have ever played. The graphics may not be perfect, but the gameplay is amazing. I love the WW1 trench warfare gameplay. Verdun is the only WW1 fps game I have ever seen. The attention to detail that was put into the game is incredible. The historical accuracy is great; the maps and guns awesome. I love using the old rifles. And now they added gas. The gas added a whole new aspect to the game. The squad gameplay in the frontlines mode is great and keeps the game organized. One thing that I think that they should add is the ability to create a squad for a specific map. One thing they could also do is have all the rifles unlocked in rifle deathmatch, I'm sure that would get a lot more people to play it. I would recomend this game to anyone who has enough money to buy it! ~BASED GOD			"

												Verdun is a blast to play. It's not like most games where you just run and gun and those with the quickest reflexes win every time. Each kill is a thrill because you spend time sneaking up into a good position with cover and fire support. Half the time, the enemy doesn't know what hit them. Or you don't know what hit you.The game mechanics sound a bit limiting at first but they channel you into the type of warfare that Verdun is supposed to model -- gritty, dirty, muddy, freezing cold trench warfare. You feel the helpless vulnerability while slogging through open muddy land, and it's a relief to drop into the relative safety of a sodden trench. Most matches are quite evenly played, too, so the auto-balancing system is well developed.The only downsides are that there is an occasional crash and it's a little confusing for the first couple matches. Once you get the hang of it, though, this is a solid game to have in your Steam library and play regularly. "

												Do you like the idea of Call of Duty, but hate the execution?  Do you like to mindlessly kill hordes of people, but think that all the other games that provide that experience suck?  Well Verdun is for you!  I have had this game for about 5 months now, and while it is not a game you put hundreds of hours into in that span of time, it is a great game to play casually in some down time.  I have only recently actually played it with friends, as the game was on sale and they finally bought it, and it is an even better experience!  The game is so addictive and immersive that you begin using callouts and other advanced strategies, no matter whether you wanted to or were conscious of the action or not.  Highly addictive, great fun alone, and an unimaginably awesome time with friends.  Solid 10/10, and there aren't even that many maps or guns, and it doesn't matter at all.  There could be 1 gun and 3 maps, and this game would still be 10/10.  Gameplay is amazing, and there are so many awesome moments that at times this game puts Battlefield to shame.  Must buy, especially on sale.  Would rather buy 4 more copies of this game for no reason than ever buy another Call of Duty in my life, because this game is so worth it.			"

It handles well and is fun IF you're prepared to communicate and work as a team. The graphics are good, but once again the game is not finished and not an AAA movie-budget game. Besides, the graphics should not put you off Verdun at all. The price might put you off, but it's worth it even at this stage.In short, it's good.

												UPDATED : Logged for almost 970 Hours now and still find this game really enjoyable, even finally joined a clan for my continous support for playing Verdun. This game IMHO would be destined to be somewhat Semi-realistic version of the upcoming BF1 AAA-title and most probably enjoy the similar success to their counterparts, the RO series. If you really like fast-paced, detailed and historically correct weapons and loadouts, you will definitely join the ranks in no time :)Pro's:1. Authentic weapons and loadouts, somewhat really detailed models and audio is still WiP.2. Main selling point of this game is still one of the game mode : Frontlines. Tug of War type of battle, different pace it offers from certain attacking/defending phase is really awesome IMO.3. New weapons have been rolled out! Horrors of War DLC has been a huge success and you should try the Wex (Flamethrowers) to roast some ""Baguettes"" ^^4. New Game mode: Squad Defence. Agains hundreds of AI hordes when defending your trench, how long will you survive? ;)4. Although it's been released for some time now, Devs have been working on new Spectator Mode, Audio updates, collaborating with Othais from C&R Arsenal, and probably tournaments as well!Con's:1. Lack of Guides and Tips for new players. So make sure you follow your NCO in the trenches and communicate with team all the time to increase survivability in No Man's Land!2. Updates sometimes makes the game buggy, but thankfully Devs are on point interacting with the community lately to smooth out the transitions in Unity Engine.Hope you can get  a clear idea what the game looks like now and I'll see you in the trenches ^^finally after 75+ hours or so playing this game, I can give this a thumbs up review. If you like WW1 or history of it in general, you should buy this game immediately :)Pros :1. Rifles, Uniforms, and some of the audio is really authentic2. Best game mode: Frontlines. Changing of pace between 'campy' in defence and suddenly enemy breach your trench and you shouting to ur mates, typing like crazy.. one of the best feeling playing this game or on attack when u try infiltrate the flanks and try to clear their trench.. Verdun you did good :)3, FREE DLC!!Cons:1. Some of the movement and MG placement are glitchy, but hey, look at F1 2015 in comparison :))2. The fact you are still reading this review. Go buy it, for god sake! :D "

								Verdun is something fresh in the FPS market. While there are AAA titles like Battlefield and COD going on, all set with their ACOG sights and HOLO sights and Ergo grips and other tacticool crap on their automatic weapons, there is Verdun. Verdun is a game set in the First World War, also known as the Great War. There aren't any fancy sights, or getting a mag emptied on somebody and not killing them, or airstrikes and tanks. Instead, there are bolt actions, early machine guns, and semi-automatic pistols. Even though this game is in Early Access, and has some bugs here and there, this game is a blast and has a lot of potential in future updates. In addition, the group of three devs have done more work on this game than some entire companies do on their game, and it shows in the quality.  If you want to finally play a game that is in WWI and authentic, then get this game.			"

								Verdun is probably the current World War 1 FPS Game i would really say is highly recommended. It has the thing in it that makes players feel like were really in the great war. But so far as ive played through out the months of beta and research. The MG-08/15 is still missing the Bipod and lack of firing speed also goes for the chauchat with its low speed of fire. but everything else is just fine. As a player in his review i highly recommend to this game producers to please add vehicles/destructive terrain/usable artillary/naval battle to improve combat experience. For example Battlefield with all its destructive weapons usable in combat, do not change anything else considered up and running. Conclusion is to the question should i buy it? YES you should.			"

												Seems like lately their patches have broken the game more than fixed it. Heavy FPS drops, join bugs that require you to try rejoin or exit out the game completely to get it to work, bad hitboxes, invisible objects at a distance. It's a mess. The melee system is also atrocious, that uses a sort of auto aim system which simply turns into who ever clicks first or the fastest wins. There are melee specific classes and the best method of actually using that weapon is if you lay prone around a corner and wait to hit someone in the cankles to kill them.Also there's no friendly fire on. Meaning there's no need to be careful to rain massive amounts of artillery on your own squad to shield them from the enemy, or care for where you spam grenade and machine gun fire.			"

												It is day 16 of the attack, the Jerries are attacking taking immense losses but the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s keep on coming, slowly forcing us back. But we know if we surrender we will be shot for cowardice....Then comes the gas. It rains down from above, as I scramble to put my gas mask on I see others around me are not as fast and slowly succumb to the horrific gas from above. After the gas the enemy starts to pour into our trench for one more push. I shoot 3 as they scramble in but 4 more take their place. I try to reload but it is no use, one turns to me and stabs me through the chest, and as I lay dying in the muddy trench that has been my hell of a home all I can think is this is a pointless way to die... This is Verdun 10/10			"

Also it's great fun to play with a group of friends. There are two game mods, One being rifle deathmatch, a free for all with rifles. The next is a game mode where you fight on the front and have to charge either the Prussian's or the French's trench and capture it. 10 Silences on the Front out of 10			"

												WOW! What can I say!The atmosphere and reality of WW I is absolutely incredible. If you have watched the WWI scenes in Downtown Abbey and other WWI series/movies, you really understand what these ""kids"" yes they were young, went thru.It was so cool to see a large map showing the War and the battles where real players in squads are deployed.Although, i am not sure just what else it does other than showing what squads are deployed and where.There is also a ""unlock"" system where the more XP you earn playing the more different weapons and uniforms you get.Really makes you feel part of the larger effort and meaningful.When you first start playing you really feel like a conscript...a new green soldier, as you have not yet gotten used to the game and its environs.Moreover, you are afraid to get out of the trench... you are afraid to lift your head up, you are afraid to move.And just like in real life as you get more accustomed and experienced your situational awareness gets better and you actually begin to peer out from the trench, move, attack out of the trench etc.And also get your first kill.This game is not like other FPS games, you will think and learn about WWI trench warefare and as you do you will get better.Barbed wire does what it was supposed to, i.e. tangle up poor guys so you can shoot them...but it can be your friend also keep ing the enemy from bayonetting you or getting to close to you.Exploding shells and chemical attacks are a threat and the game tells you what color the gas is, thus indicating what it is.So put that gas mask on!Just as human nature will be, you sometimes cannot resist and run that extra few feet to another crater for cover, or pop your head up for a look one too many times or for too long....and bang you get hit.Human instinct and learning does take over and you learn and feel that just right moment to duck.It is quite amazing and realistic to say the least.

												Trigger warning: may contain observations and opinions that hurt feels.Updated almost two and a half months later after playing again recently.Also the comments section is not there to waste my time discussing every little detail. This review is there for potential customers who have never played Verdun. Enjoy being ignored if you feel like flamebaiting or trolling.TLDR: 6,5/10. Good, but not great. Very atmospheric game with lots of undeveloped potential that has issues. So a red thumb because Steam forces me to be black and white like that.I feel strongly about this game and I really used to like it, so that is why I write this as a warning for potential buyers and as constructive criticism toward the developers. The positive reviews show many people ""want"" this only WW1 MP FPS available today to be good and so do I, but I am at a point where the bad outweighs the good. This game has tons of atmosphere and potential but it is being dragged down by some of its flaws. You can read several reviews citing poor optimisation, no spawn protection getting you in a loop of being spawnkilled over and over again, clunky controls etc. that are also correct. But these are my personal five reasons that mar my enjoyment of this game to the point of not being able to really recommend it anymore in descending order of annoyance.- glitchy weirdness, exploiting or worse in PvP: in a significant portion of sessions I have played, for instance an invincible guy around level five with two hours on the counter or with a similar profile joins and starts killing people who are hiding wherever they are on the map, not a single shot missed at high rates of fire. They end up with K:D scores like 55:0 against people level 80 and above. This game also lacks vote kick options so you are left with people who use exploits or such cheats for as many matches as they wish to stay. One option that does not explain everything my regular squad of four has seen is that these people are using low graphical quality settings and terrain clipping exploits. One example of the other mysteries that remain unsolved to this day is how players who are perfectly hiding at the bottom of a trench with no enemies around get shot from far away through ground and sandbags. Update: friend with 275 hours showed me footage of aimbotting (immobile player making stab kills in the distance) post-summer sale...- nonsensical spawns: I am not even talking about the lack of spawn protection, rather there are circumstances where you have to defend a trench and the game decides to spawn you about a 100 m away from it and you have to run through a stretch of no man's land that has no cover whatsoever to attack the trench you are supposed to defend. That is not what defence or holding your ground means. Yes, that also means GG because the opponents can mow you down with impunity.- classes and weapons: some are clearly meant to be under- or overpowered. The German side has very few portable MGs that take too awkwardly long to set up and to be effective except for heavily prepared and dug in defence scenarios, and all of their rifles have only five rounds (Entente usually eight to ten). While this is historically correct, it is very annoying to see there is no balance when confronted with Entente soldiers that can fire basically all MGs like the Lewis, Chauchat and BAR while running, they have an OP semi automatic rifle and do not need to reload as much. Reloading can be deadly because it is an awkward procedure that is harder to interrupt than in other FPS I have played.Some classes are not even assigned a firarm which I feel is a poor choice. A source of minor annoyance is that you cannot pick up dropped weapons or restock on ammunition (but you typically do not live long enough to run out of it).- silly suicides: instead of invisible walls some games have added a warning system with or without a timer to return back to the zone the game wants you to be in. In Verdun not getting back to the zone in time instantly kills you and the game says it is a suicide that costs you XP. I have noticed these timers often are too short to get back to the map. I have also charged at the beginning of matches into the right part of no man's land only to discover I am getting suicided.- bots in coop: they teleport. One moment they are thirty meters in front of you, the next they respawn next to you in the trench and stab you. Obviously at this point the coop mode is relatively new, in general has very rough edges and needs work. Update over two months later: flying, teleporting, invisible bots and invisible weapons galore. This mode still needs work unfortunately.Positive bit: - We can hope these things will change because the game is still actively being supported and expanded. But for now if you ask me with the things I have mentioned: thumbs down for the current state of the game which tends to annoy or frustrate just a tad too often.			"

												This game is not finished. If it is, then the developers simply do not know how to make a game. Major issues for me:Spawn-killing. This is majorly ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating. On several maps you can be killed a second after spawn by a player with an MG or Sniper Rifle. This is extremely frustrating, especially when your entire team spawns back at the same time and then all get killed a second later by an MG.The game has massive problems with lag. I've not played a game without someone jumping around all laggy. It happens too often with too normal ping observed for it to be the players problem.The hitboxes seem kind of wonky, coupled with the lag make it frustrating when you clearly hit someone only to have them lag-teleport elsewhere. Even without the lag I find shots that clearly hit not even registing a hit.The character class system is annoying and damages the WW1 asthetic. There are 16 players per side. There are 16 classes per side, for a totaly of 32. All are different. Most lack basic things like grenades or a bayonet. Only one person can play a class at a time, so you can't have most people playing a grenadier - likely you would just have 2-3 per team. It's needlessly complicated, especially when each squad has a different uniform representing a different nation so you have to learn 8 different infantry uniforms and 8 different officer uniforms.There are problems with the terrain. I don't know what causes it, it's certainly not my computer, but the terrain will only partially loads in. It's not a draw distance thing, because terrain behind it loads in perfectly. But I see a dude's head pop-over a hill, shoot it, only to find I get nothing by the bullet-hits-ground effect. Sure enough, I take a few steps forward and the hill in between use loads a foot higher than it was, and that's what was seperating us.See through terrain, related to the previous point. You can't shoot through it.Barbwire is handled poorly. One small contact with your leg starts killing you. I've been killed without realizing I'm caught  on any because it was so small that I didn't even see it. Also, jumping over it is a waste. Apparently stepping on with thick army boots won't stop it from tearing your flesh? It could've been handled better is my point.Game feel. There is next to none. No sloshy mud, no soldiers cussing as they reload, no screaming deathrattles, no weather, no nothing. It feels like an empty, quite world devoid of anything that makes me feel like I'm part of it.There are other issues, but I can't recall them right now. I'll update if I remember anything new.I feel like the developers are lying when they said this game was out of beta and finish. I feel ripped off because the game is clearly not finished or polished. I feel you would be better off saving your money. "

Even though the general community is currently great to play with. When the game starts to get bigger and bigger, the chat is going to become more and more painful to read. Some more personal requests are character customization, and possibly a create your own class gamemode, where players chose the weapons and perks they use, but only in one gamemode, the rest of the game should remain the way it is. In conclusion, this is honestly the best game i have ever played, and im sure that it is just going to get better and better.

								This game has great potential. The genre is virtually untapped in FPS (I vaguely remember a poor WW1 mod for the original Half-Life) and I hope it continues it's current trend. It's already come on leaps and bounds since I purchased it.Really good for a bit of bolt-action fun. Unlike DoD Source, Red Orchestra/Rising Storm or a ""rule-based"" Battlefield 3/4 server, no♥♥♥♥♥♥can suddenly pull a G18 or L85A2 out and auto your face off.Only gripe at the minute is there would appear to be either some poor match making or a lack of servers. I'm on high-speed fibre with at worst a ping of 20-40 but there are often players with pings of upto 300-450. I really think this could do with some attention.Would certainly recommend for anyone who likes a skillfull shooter and is prepared to watch a game develop in the long run.			"

								AWSOME. This game is historical, and alot of fun to play. From the massive battles to rifle skirmishes Verdun is the best WW1 game yet due to its clever and intuitive trench warfare game design. Also the developing team keeps modifying the game and soon the game will be comprable to any war related massive multiplayer game.			"

												Verdun, though not yet fully released, is a WW1 fps which offers satisfying and challenging gameplay individually and as a squad member. Tactics reflect Western Front reality - frontal assaults - so some may find that limiting. The devs are doing a good job of refining an already solid game.If you like RO2, there are similarities which would merit your taking a look at Verdun.THE GAME HAS BEEN RELEASED A LONG TIME NOW. The graphics and performance has greatly improved making it much more satisfying to play. There are now some highly experienced and competernt players who know every inch of the maps. Consequently, this game can only be described as ""hardcore"" , newcomers especially will have to invest a good amount of time and effort to become familiar with the game.Squadplay is rewarding and frustrating in equal measures at times. Deathmatch is satsisfying especially when there is a fair balance between rambos and campers to mix things up!Verdun is the best WW1 fps available; you will die a helluva lot before you become the scalp-taker everyone falls to!  :)Highly recommended especially if you like investing time to develop the skills required by the game!

												by far 1 of the best fps i have played. u attack and defend trenches. dont think its call of duty as in all u need to do is kill. ull need to hold or take trench by having more men then the other team or buy killing em all. it is ww1 so exspect to just get murdered from time to time but ull get lucky n murder them too lolpost free Horrors of war expansion: i dont have words for it. it is just crazy made it 10 times better gore n new squads added its so great plus the new weapons i rock with the 45.By far best thing about this game you buy once! no payed dlc n only 20 bucks U.S. so worth it even at full price			"

								Verdun is a multiplayer FPS, but unlike other games this one is set in WWI which gives it a different style. It isn't about running and gunning. The basis of the game is to attack and defend trenches which is very important, When the enemy attacks, the defenders must defend. This means that players must play the objective which doesn't always happen in games.An important aspect of the game is that it is based around squads. Each player is in a squad and each member of that squad has different skills. Each squad also has an NCO who issues orders. Players are rewarded for working with their squad which increases the squad level and unlocks new equipment.Overall this is a very fun game with a largely ignored setting but that is very interesting.

												8/10 solid game - not just a WW1 RO clone, it has plenty of its own features and a uniqueness to it. Personally I really like how the assault/defend phases work in the team mode and there is a real feeling of teamwork and coordination.Free updates have been promised also, which is very commendable in 2015.Oh and bullets actually kill people.. its not arcade style, so thats a huge plus.2016 edit: feels like youre getting shot behind cover, you can be sitting in a trench totally safe and some guy across the field kills you. Then it happens 20x, to your entire squad.I searched ""shot behind cover"" on the forums and there are a lot of complaints about this, back to 2014. I had the game uninstalled for a long time, and had just reinstalled it. Felt frustrated, this doesnt happen on other games, I know the difference between something like this and RO where you may just not have seen some guy in the bushes, but this is perfectly in a foxhole or w.e and being shot in the head when your head is 4 feet below the top.

								Gamers of all strokes will find a role to enjoy in Verdun. Strategic movement is rewarded, and teamwork emphasized with the in game spawning mechanics. There are times where you will hear the whistle, stand up to leave the trench, and immediately collapse from a rifle shot. It only makes the final push more satisfactory. You may especially enjoy the back and forth dynamic, as defending and assaulting are quite different experiences. Performance during the waves dictates attackers/defenders respawn times and wave duration, rewarding a team which is able to efficiently elliminate many enemies. I would label this a 'Tactical FPS' though it lacks the typically strong learning curve of such games.			"

												This will be my first in depth review of a game so fasten your seatbelts.Verdun is one of the best games I have ever played (no joke) the WW1 authenticity matched with FPS mixes to create a fantastic batch of awesome. This game is a must buy for WW1 history buffs. Weapons are modelled to be historically accurate to the counterparts. One of the best parts of the game is the immersive trench gameplay, you could be in the muddy hills, rain creating muddy puddles and boddies stained with blood and gore around you. Or you could be in mountainous terrain charging up hill as fire rains from above you, these moments make the game. The game also features a blood and gore mod which just enriches the gameplay further. The game explores all aspects of WW1 from guns and gas to the terrain and conditions. If you are either a fan of, 1.) FPS which are semi-challenging or 2.) A WW1/2 fan, this game is for you! The gameplay is fluid and feels good and the satisfaction is so high when you kill someone! The suppression system makes you feel like you are really under fire, and the weapons have a great feel. However there is one thing that may deter players, that is the repeative deaths. Yes this game is in WW1 and WW1 featured many massacres across no mans land, so does this game. You will constantly die in this game and if that bugs you an astronomical amount, that may take away from the game, however if you can get past this frustration and I won't lie, it will make you want to end yourself, then this only enriches the satifation of eventually making it into the enemy trench and going bezerk on those Jerry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. So In Summary, if you are a fan of FPS's, have a few spare keyboards to either throw at your closest wall or break over your head or a huge WW1 history buff (like I am) do yourself a favour and BUY THIS GAME!!!!

												This game, is absolutely amazing.While not exclusively in Verdun, It's literally THE Best WW1 game I've ever played. Which to be honest isn't really saying much because there are only few I can really mention right now. Sadly other developers of games think it's a boring time to make games, which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to me, being deeply interested in the timeframe and the history behind all of the nations. But It's a very great game nonetheless. It has mechanics that absolutely match the setting of the game, 1 hit from a rifle means you're most likley going to die, although 2 shots that means you're lucky and just stay in cover and hopefully your ally can save you or the enemy who shot you gets distracted or something. There are 3 mechanics that make it one of my favourite games I've played this year...1- Bullet mechanicsAs I've mentioned bullets do extreme amounts of damage and you can't just go run out in the open like Rambo/CoD style like a retard, however there is also bullet drop in the game, along with the foggening of the screen and more of a dark tunnel when being shot at rather jelly blood literally being thrown at your face when bein shot, which adds more of the WW1 feel about being in a trench. Which makes a Pistol really deadly in a trench, and a machine gun a beast when shooting at attackers, and the rifle is a good weapon to use all around depending on how you use it2- Atmosphere/Map designAs well a prior statement, however with this I mean by when your running through the trenches, it makes mud sounds when running through them, and even makes it awesome when artillery fires on it and you need to duck and cover from it or you will 99% of the time die. However, No mans land is even more awesome to run through durring an assault on the enemy trench, because you have to worry about barbed wire ripping your legs apart and being left on the field for dead, or using artillery craters as cover because small abandoned, unfinished trenches can't guide you the whole way. Another reason not to run out as a retard rambo/4 Year old CoD player.3- Chemical Warfare UseMy Personal favourite part of the game is the fact that there is different gasses used such as mustard gas, or chlorine gas on the battlefield against your enemies or at you and your allies. What really makes it interesting is that you can go through it so long as you have your gas mask on and you aren't being currently shot at. It doesn't even just come and go also, it stays and lingers the area of impact for about 3-4 minutes and if you die and spawn in it, you need to get your mask on fast or you will certainly die. It's not scripted on each map thankfully, there are special units that can call it in like calling in artillery or commanding squad members, so it will either appear multiple times in one battle or none at all.  That's really on your own opinion whether it's bad or good though.And that's really it, I got the game the day before I made this review, and I think it's better than most of the CoD's combined already. Other than it being a WW1 game, the 3 game mechanics are the best I've seen in a long while. So I highly recommend this game for the stated reasons. The only problems I've seen so far is the body mechanics on when people die, and the melee weapons are a bit overranged, like a small shiv can reach like an officers sword which is strange. But nonetheless this is the greatest WW1 shooter ever made in my opinion. I hope the're a lot of people who agree with me and I don't doubt it at all, considering the countless of positive reviews aside from mine. Final Rating: 9/10 for Verdun			"

												An amazing game with both depth and innovative gameplay unlike any other that you will find. Rather than change the events to fit a set framework for a game, the devs have produced a squad based game thta is cohesive and where the benefits of proper squad play are substantial and intrinsic, whilst also being fun. I want to play this game to death, and really wish there were more plays to play with. That is not to say the community isn't great: most people are responsive and helpful, with little to no players to ruin the gameplay. This is definitely a niche, and may be hard for some at first, but after sinking in some time and little bit of effort one can become adjusted. The game has no scorestreaks and is very hard for one person to comletely own the game, easpecially in the signature ""Frontlines"" mode, which adds to the balance. Even dying a lot can still be fun, as much of the game is about strategy and tactics, along with communication: where to push, when to push, when to call in covering artillery, where to place machine gunners, where to place the NCOs for effective spawning, etc, while unlocking classes is neither grindy or arduous, taking much of the extra time and though out with set classes. Overall I wish the graphics and/or look were a little bit better, otherwise this is an all round great game, especially when played with a friend.			"

												Game is well done, maps have a lot of detail, battles give you a good feeling of being a soldier in battle during WW1 on the Western Front.  The organization of the game is interesting.  You can join of up to any of the 4 squads on each side during a multilayer game, each squad has 4 men with various skills.Few things I wish were added.  For example, why not being able to control some of those early tanks (like in Red Orchestra 1 or 2), what about being able to fly planes?  What about mud and flooded trenches?  I haven't played enough to tell but it appears the game does not have too many maps yet.  Where are the tunnels of WW1?Overall though the game is a must have for anyone who enjoyed playing Red Orchestra games, or similar historic oriented 3D shooters.			"

												First and foremost: You are going to die. There is no point in trying to deny that in this game. You will be shot at, blown to bits, stabbed, hacked at, cut down by wire, mauled by a blunt weapon or cut open with a trench spade. This game is brutal. You will feel some kind of shell shock when french 75ers rain down on you and your squad. You will grasp quickly for that ""4"" button when gas comes up. You will hate yourself for not reloading properly and having no round in the chamber in a pitched situation. This game is gloomy , dark and unforgiving. The maps are brilliantly orchestrated to only allow a few tactics that almost always end with hundreds of deaths by you and your teammates. I've seen pros complaining and yelling about the unfairness of the game. Men and women with hundreds of hours on their record. If you get hit by a bullet, you'll most likely die. One hit, one death. No mercy. So why do I do this? Because it's supposed to be like that! WW1 is everything but a nice place. This game gives you a glimpse into that dark, unforgiving time. Into the trenches and back out again.But is it fun? Oh yes! Tactics are limited, but must be performed in great accuracy. You can  outmaneuver the enemy if you play it right. You can be the hero of your squad or team by being the first in the enemy trench, spitting them with your Rosalie because you have no time to reload. You can stop a whole team with a well places MG 08/15 or some SMLEs in the right place. You can kill 5-7 people at once with a nice mortar hit. But in the end, it's your squad and your team that you have to rely on. They as a whole decide if they attack or if the are dead. This is no game for people to sit in their favorite spot. This is a game in which you have to attack. Or you'll die. Oh … and die you will.  "

												This is a wonderful little shooter. It isn't polished to within an inch of its life, it's a bit janky here and there, and it can most definitely feel very unfair sometimes. What it does very successfully is create an atmosphere of verisimilitude that allows for what seems to me like a rare thing: a game that is simultaneously historically faithful and mechanically satisfying, with a main multiplayer mode that roots the action in a tangible objective, simulating the back-and-forth of trench warfare as best it can. Again, it's not perfect by a long shot, but compared with other, more generic shooters, this feels full of personality.			"

Early Access Review
								In it's current state it's unpolished and clunky, but surprisingly responsive and playable. There is a good deal of response on the rifles and after your first few games you can see a lot of depth and potential to the game. This game has some potential for the future, but if you are turned off by non-AAA shooter titles you might not be interested in it just yet. User experience wise it can be confusing at the beginning, but it's very balanced and features skill-based rifle game play.			"

												Verdun is the best WW1 shooter we currently have. Capturing and defending trenches is exhilarating, atmospheric and as you can imagine slightly depressing. Eduring a high level artillery barrage is a highly memorable experience. Unfortunately the game has some major drawbacks. The controls are somewhat clunky and the sound design needs major improvements, especially artillery sounds. Communication from the developer is fairly non-existant, although small updates and fixes do arrive fairly frequently, but silently.The biggest drawback is the absolutely toxic festering community of high level players and clan-boys. Expect to hear childlike phrases such as ""git-gud"" repeated at you endlessly, with sporadic pointless arguments in chat. The overall voice is that of the braindead ""gamer-teen"" stereotype. Members of clans such as '{lp} les poilus' or {pirates} also have really disgusting attitudes and the game suffers severe balance issues at times due to abuse of the flawed co-op XP system that allows people who play together frequently for many months to have certain gameplay advantages.I absolutely loved the game for a few months, it definitely fills a void in the gaming scene and can be really enjoyable. Lately however I don't recommend this game, the developers don't do enough to keep it fresh or encourage a good-spirited community. The lack of official forums is huge downside aswell.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  This game has a bug causes server disconnects for some players.  If you are one of the unfortunate players to be affected by this bug, you will be always be disconnected from any and all servers, game types, and maps in under 30 seconds of joining a match.  This bug, which renders the software from a game according to a reasonable interpation of a game into nothing more than semi-interactive menus with music, loading screens with music, and very brief glimpses of other people having fun.  The developers are aware of this issue and have gone from saying they are working on it to a position that because they are not getting as many people reporting the issue that it must be fixed on their end despite the fact that each game update they send out changes the average time to disconnect bug, and are now blaming the issue on end user firewall, router, and internet issues without providing requested information that would allow an end user to troubleshoot connection issues on their end.  Because of this known issue even though I like the idea of a world war 1 first person shooter, I cannot recommend buying this game.  This do not buy this game recommendation would have been removed if the issue had been fixed before exiting early access and if the developers had not repeatedly removed discussions on these issues.  For those of you who encounter this issue and are unable to play this game, I recommend you join me in asking for the issue to be fixed or refunds for the purchase price be given.			"

												After only 9 hours of playing Verdun I can safely say its an incredable game and its still only in early beta stages. The game is divided into two different modes FRONTLINE is squads of four guys attacking trenches and trying to take them from the enemy you have 5-6 minutes to attack then you must defend for around that amount of time. Each class plays a great role in this game the riflemen pushes into the trench trying to take it the sniper kills with range and in my experience are the most deadly players the commanders or whatever you call them are greta being able to order strikes on weak points and call in morter strikes to sometimes great effects as for the machine gunner I have never seen anyone use it to great effect so I can't say anything about it. The tactics for FRONTLINE revolve around using your whole squad in a combined attack but since their is no voice chat yet this rarely happens ^^. As of now there is only four maps Picardee Vossges arrgonne and I always forget the last one they are all fairly fun to play on although I must admit Picardie is the most fun ;). The next form of game mode is RIFLE DEATHMATCH no not the crappy COD kind really nice FFA bolt-action rifle greatness no killstreaks and crap just good old fashioned fun. You get to pick one rifle you want to unlock and you get that you level it up and get new things. Moving on to the community I FREAKING LOVE THE COMMUNITY ON THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Almost everyone in game and on the forums are incredably nice and helpful people offering new players tips and very rarely bad mouthing ( you notice I said rarely it does happen ;) ). I go on the forums vcet players ask me to play with them and they'd give me pointers really nice people online. Probably the funnest people on Verdun are the history buffs I love history and watching these people talk about French battle tactics ETC ETC ETC... is really fun and enjoyable. Moving on to Graphics how are they you ask? They are good I would tell you I myself don't care for graphics as long as the game is fun but I have to say the game is rather good looking the guns are well detailed and look amazing the facial textures and models are terrible but who cares when the gameplay is so fun. The graphics option menu has a bevy yes bevy of graphics optins which is very nice. Over all as a person who usually detests FPS games I find this game very enjoyable it has very few bugs that I have noticed there are a few graphics glitchs but these are rare, And what bugs there are a quickly being fixed by the amazing developers I have looked at posts of when this first came out in alpha and it was terrible but since then the three devs yes only three have worked hard adding new things and fixing bugs making this game very enjoyable. Overall I think this is the bet WW1 shooter your gonna find anywhere and I highly reccomend it to anyone even if you dislike FPS games like me I think you might enjoy this nice game. I hate giving scores but that what most people want but I won't because this is only a BETA everything I say might change in three days in a new patch so I won't bother to give it an overall score till it officially launchs but I still highly reccomend this game anyway I'm out have fun dying to snipers and the OP commander pistols PEACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!EDIT: Game released yesterday and its amazing. Haven't played it since August of 2014. The graphics, gameplay, and new features all add a lot to the game. Totally worth buying at full price. Only early access I have seen that is this loved by its devs.			"

Early Access Review
								Verdun is a bloody spectacular game. It includes a large reliance on social, objective, and challenging game mechanics which the game has fused together solidly. The objectives in the game are completely based on the capture or defence of trenches, which can only be done by teamwork.Teamwork is the main focus of the game, with squads of four players cooperating as a subsection of the team, where two opposing armies fight in trench warfare. As a social basis, the reliance on teamwork forces leadership and forces cooperation between the players, which also forces people to restrain themselves from the general tendancy of anonymous gamers to ♥♥♥♥♥ and to spend their entire time complaining (excepting situations in which this is justified).Teamwork means that the squads are engaging and helpful, noobs (as long as they are willing to learn) are accepted as future functioning members of the squad—with people ordering or recommending courses of action. The influence of social and objective considerations is only possible with a challenge, something brought by the fact that in this game, one bullet means death. This is not a CoD or TF2 clone in which your player character can absorb an entire clip without dying. This ups the stakes and forces teamwork, coupled with the game's 'desertion' mechanic, which means that players are where they should be.The developers did a good job in balancing the game, though there are still issues in it, where maps are unbalanced and a lack of a tutorial means that noobs proliferate. Yet, for an early access game in open beta—this is a spectacularly done job. Verdun's developers listen to the community, and the game itself is spectacularly engaging, something I heartily recommend for anyone to add to their steam library.Other than percieved balance issues, there is one issue to the game which I feel cannot be overlooked. There is a web-client available for free on Kongregrate. While this is used to 1) fill the servers, 2) promote the game, and 3) draw people in—I myself was drawn in from the web-client, the presence of a web-client means that you can try the full game for free. I feel there should be more limitations on the web-client; and for a game in open beta, with only about 200 regular players, this is acceptable.			"

								Verdun is that special game that you will proably not see something like it for a long time if at all.The Game is set in WW1 and is an FPS, the setting is nice and hardly ever done. Something I wish other games explored. The game tries to do its best to fit the setting. With songs from the era playing in the menu and people shouting in German and French as Mortar Shells and Rifles sound thorugh the battle.Now gameplay wise the game is very simple. It's a squad based FPS. With 4 men squads consisting of 1 Officers and 3 Troops each with it's own specializations, unlocks and weapons difrent for each type of squad and each faction. The battles play out in a push defend way. One side attacks, the other defends if the attack succedes the other team has to push the enemy out if it fails they get to counter attack.Gun play is very simple but yet fun. The game is set in WW1 so Most people Run around with a Rifle with the exception of MG's and Officers. You aim, fire and bolt. Repeat till you kill someone or have to reload then repeat the proccess till you are killed. The game adds flavour to this by adding Bayonets, Scopes and Grenades even Pistols to some Classes and Types of Soliders. All in all I found the gun play fun and entertaining.Now on the bad side.Graphics are mediocre. This doesn't bother me as in my PoV the gameplay makes up for it.Sounds are mediocre as well but at least the weapons sound well enough.Maps are repetitive so far but this is understandble as the game is Early Access.Like any Early Access Game bugs are there and there isn't enough bug spray.But over all the game has potential it is fun and you can clearly see what the devs want to develop this game into. But this game is not even half way finished. I would recomend you get it on sale or keep an eye out for the game to be fully released but as it stands at 20 Euro's its not worth it. Potential is there but there is not enough value at the moment for that price. "

												Verdun is a wonderfully addictive game. The trench warfare is authentic, the environments feel real, and the experience is always enjoyable. No matter how well you do in a match, it is entertaining enough to run around in the trenches of World War One. I could easily say Verdun is one of my favorite games.Unfortunately, the game is far from perfect. The amount of glitches and inconveniences greatly diminishes the experience. Trying to join a friend's squad can sometimes send you to a seperate match. Trying to make your own squad can kick you out of the game. The leveling system is complicated and there is no explanation for it. It is hard to figure out and remember which squad does what without reading a few extensive guides. While charing across no-man's land you sometimes teleport around, ruining your advance. Some parts of the maps are angled awkwardly, causing clunky movement. The ""hold your breath"" system is pretty much the only way to aim well, but it hardly lasts long, is loud and annoying, and makes it harder to aim when you're done. The map rotation can send you on an endless loop of Champagne and Douaumont and never include certain maps like Flanders.There are so many other downsides that I didn't name here, and they all become very annoying when trying to play successfully. With more improvement, and I sure hope the devs get on it, this game could be even better than it already is.			"

Early Access Review
								tl;dr: If you like FPS and WW1 you can't go wrong with this game. While lacking a bit of depth gameplay-wise it's still a solid shooter on it's own and the unique setting definitly makes this worth buying.As someone who played this games early, early pre-alpha, when it still was browser based I have to say it improved greatly.There has been A LOT of new content and even a few new game mechanics and to me this shows that the developers definitly have a vision for  this game. But now for the actual review:Gameplay:I won't lie the gameplay is more or less generic shooter, the gunplay definitly is. Sure bolt-action rifles are uncommon in FPS but by no means completely new. The Squad mechanic is a nice little feature, it actually makes you bond a bit with the people you play, IF you or them don't leave the squad after a few minutes, which is why I'm not sure whether or not the join-in-progress mechanic was a good idea. Verdun lacks the depth of a Red Orchestra concerning health and wounds and the movement system is a bit clunky compared to RO, this shows especially when you try to make your way through No-Mans-Land and get hit because you didn't crouch as fast as you wanted. Even though this does sound rather harsh I don't mean to discredit the game. If you have any experience with shooters you won't find this game to be very different, apart from the obvious fact that the weapons aren't full auto of course. It's real strength (for now) isn't the gameplay but the setting. Also I have faith that the Devs know about these 'issues' and will address them in the future.Setting and Environment:Like I said this is what makes this game unique: the World War 1 setting. The Equipment is highly detailed and fairly accurate, and so are the uniforms. The maps are ugly, muddy wastelands, full of craters, wire and tranches which really sells the setting. The maps are also rather diverse, ranging from true trench-riddled wastelands, where lurking over the top will get you killed in a few seconds, to rather open maps which feature a little less deadly razor-wire and a bit more nature. This game only features the western front, where most of the gruesome trench warfare took place. One can play as either different German squads as well as French, English and Canadians. The Voice-acting is rather good, with all sides featuring good, propably even native, and diverse voice actors. This may not seem like a big deal, but nothing helps me more to create immersion than an angry british NCO yelling to 'get my♥♥♥♥♥over the top and smoke out the bloody jerries' Graphic:While I don't care too much for good graphics, this game looks rather nice but is has really bad optimisation, be warned.I would also like to add that this games has one of the best main-menu screens I ever encountered, but you'll see what I mean by that.

												Well-polished game that's definitely worth the $20. The weapons are lethal, which means that cover, tactical thinking, and teamwork are essential to succeeding. The gameplay feels very well-balanced, and the squad system is impressive compared to other FPS games. The maps are pretty diverse too, ranging from lush forests to apocalyptic landscapes. Don't forget to turn on some of the post-processing effects!			"

								Except for CS, this is the only FPS game I will play. Not only is it a beautiful game but It is great fun to play. There is also a real skill aspect to the game with shooting bolt action rifles. You need to make sure you hit the first shot or you can be at a real disadvantage. I've been waiting for a good trench warfare game for ages and I'm glad that is has finally come.			"

												Very enjoyable, very satisfying shooter.Verdun is different enough to be refreshing while still grounded in fundamental mechanics. It punishes those who are less skilled, but offers an enjoyable experience to most players. Both the team-oriented and free-for-all gametypes are a lot of fun.Highly recommended.			"

												Not like most FPS games, you need to focus on positioning and teamwork in this game rather than running in and getting killed (which will happen a lot). That said, kills are very satisfying and the abilities/weapons each squadmember has make it pretty cool too.Grab this game if you want a realistic WW1 game, if you can't handle the idea that you'll probably die to gas, barbed wire, invisible snipers etc. then just keep being a cheeky scrub. If you want a challenging but rewarding FPS, get it!!			"

								It's a fun shooter and does a good job representing the WWI style. Games can go on for quite some time depending on how skilled each side is. The only problem is when you get stuck in a role you hate as each squad can only have one of each soldier type. I only really play it in small doses but each time I have a lot of fun. Not the prettiest game as of yet but it's only in Beta however they are still working on it and it shows. Still some bugs and annoying times where you can't turn properly for no discernable reason but totally worth checking out.Also if you wan't I recall this game being free to play in the browser however the difference between that version and this are huge at this point.

								When a game is Indie, some people think the game is not so good. When a game is at beta stage, some people think the game is not so good yet. Verdun is an Idie game at beta stage, and no matter what you think, the game is just great. Of course it has some glitches, and things to be improved, fixed or removed, but anyway, the game is just great. It like the only FPS game I've played about WWI (except for BF1918, but that was a mod). It is like some old shooters with bolt action rifles and one shot-one kill, but with an objective and squad based gameplay. As you can imagine, the main weapons are bolt action rifles, but there are also some other stuff like pistols, machine guns, grenades and mortar/artillery strikes. It makes you feel, when shooting with rifles, if you don't kill an enemy with this shot or if you miss, he is going to kill you. And it is usually that way. Sometimes it can be frustrating, when attacking an enemy trench and not being able to capture it, just like WWI, but it doesn't represent the horrors of trench warfare.There is only one thing I don't like: there are too few players for a such a great game.

								Don't be fooled to thinking it's a bland FPS. Get this, it actually uses alot of tactical strategy,so there's balance and limitation. This isn't a bland a circle jerk FPS like most are,but a game of alternating objectives of capturing and defending in a single round. There's no running ahead before you hold you post for the objective amount of time,and attacking requires planning every foot step. Sprinting hole to hole trying not to get shot while giving supporting fire. There's also different squad types,and specified classes. All of the clases are fun to play,and they play an important purpose of their own.			"

												I've been playing Verdun since shortly after it appeared as an Early Access game on Steam, and while I have written a review for this game before, I decided that with the game being fully released, I should update it.Verdun is a squad based World War I shooter. There are four members to a squad and four squads per side (Germany and the Entente (currently the game only focuses on the Western Front.) Both sides take turns attacking and defending their trenches, and the side the takes the most ground will win.Throughout my time playing this game, I have seen many complaints about the difficulty of this game and how they are nothing but cannon fodder for experienced players. Unfortunately, the game does not have level based matchmaking (it would be impossible with the player counts as they are,) and so as a new player you will face off against veteran players. But, while initially this could be very difficult for new players to handle, most players are using the same (or similar) weapons, and once you learn how to use those weapons, you will be at an level playing field with veterans.This game has glitches and other stability issues, but overall is a beauty. You will die, a lot, but that is to be expected from a game about the trenches of the Great War. I would recommend giving Verdun a shot (pun intended) as it is a unique FPS experience.			"

								Verdun can be compared to.... hmm Red Orchestra perhaps. Set during World War I. And it does the time period in a very good way.Trench war is displayed very realistically, and most of the guns kill in one shot, so poke your head out too early and bam, you're dead.The main game mode is called ""Frontlines"" which pretty much is, attack the enemy trench on command, and if that doesnt work, retreat and defend your own trench line from the enemy counter-attack.There are several factions in the game, with their voices very well done, as well as the weaponry of the time.And if You happen to get bored of the frontlines, you can always hop in for some bolt-action rifle free-for-all deathmatch, like in good old CoD1 or 2.Also, there are few minor bugs within the game,  mostly being sometimes really awful hit-detection.Pros- Very original idea about bringing WWI to a shooter.- Realistic trench combat- Squad based gameplay that favours bold squadplay.- Very well done weapons from the era.- Several Factions- Mostly, fun and enjoyable maps.Cons- Sometimes awful hit detection- Master server sometimes gets very ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, making it impossible to find a match.But in total summary, the game is a strong 8+/10. I'd recommend it for everyone that likes a bit more serious shooter, with a large emphasis on team and squadplay and cooperation.			"

												I started following Verdun back in 2011, when I first discovered it. Back then, it was thought to be Dead, Leo having moved on. All the footage we had was a short, soundless demo. The forums were nearly dead. But then in 2013 something magical happened - It came back to life. There was a free Alpha, which was of the rifle deathmatch mode. It was fun, but showed SO much had to be done. And since then, so much has. This game is a tense, quasi-realistic FPS set in WWI, and as a WWI buff it has my seal of approval. It's fun, especially with friends. Playing with friends allows you to level up your squad together, and thus have access to newer uniforms, slight stat increases, and increased firepower (deadlier gas, more arty, etc...). Seriously, this game needs and deserves more players. Buy it!			"

Verdun doesn't and the devs don't seem interested in losing their control over servers by implementing dedicated servers.

												While the game itself has promise and I love the theme of the game I cannot support it at this time.  The tutorial if you can call it that is exceptionally useless in actually instructingyou on how to play the game.  It gives you no useful information with which to see how to make any kind of decisions about what to do.  Furthermore when I went to the steam forums to seek help in attempting to learn how to play I got almost exclusively negative commentary about it.  ""Just go in the game and run around"" or ""Watch the tutroial noob"" or other unhelpful and confrontational comments.  Even after making my own cheatsheet of the keyboard commands for the game and attempting to not just immediately die I was frustrated to no end by the fact that I cannot identify who is friendly and who is not.  While this could be a fabulous game it is not due to the issues mentioned above, a wasted of whatever I paid to get it.			"

												The game really doesn't deliver the experience that was shown in the trailer. For me at least all i've played so far has been poor, it doesn't matter if you are good at these sort of games or a newcomer, you will most likely find this game frustrating.There are some good parts, for example; The maps feel authentic.The weapons feel realistic and sound good.Everthing in the game is too its time setting.Graphical quality is great.That however is all the good i have to say about the game. The bad points really show more than the good and are more likley to take your attention of the good points. Here are the things in the game i take issue with;No matter where you get shot, one hit means dead.Spawn killing is a big issue.The battles are spread thin and doesn't capture the true nature of the war.Gameplay is very slow.The only way you can get from one play to another without dying is going prone. (Even so you will still die a lot)Iron-sights for the most part are useless.etc.. etc..I wouldn't recommend this game at all especially if you are thinking of getting it at its full price. I got this on sale and it still doesn't feel worse the £9 i spent on it.			"

												This game does some much right, thats not a lot of other shooter give you.This is one of few games that creates a trench style WW1 shooer game in an acceptable way, wave spawning and certain classes that allow for auto fire weapons only.However, this game is not fun after the first 6 hours, the game just gets boring with a very little amount of content.I start to get annoied with the game when the UNOPTIONAL spawning on your NCO or back at your line kicks in as I have spawning multiple times on my NCO right into enemy fire with a life of about a 0.5 second, only to have to wait for another respawn in 20 seconds! The spawning at home trenches is even worse sometimes as it does not even spawn you in a trench but out in no mans land causing you to get shot before you can even make it to your trench to defend. The shooting feels off and the iron sights on the weapons are awful to where you see almost nothing at a longer range. The auto fire weapons are a nice feature, however they are way too overpowered compared to the other weapons, they cause a lot of suppression, the suppression is so bad in this game that it make you almost unable to aim.A lot of the time you also get really crappy teammates who decide to camp your trench instead of attacking, the team balancing is awful with NO FORCED TEAM CHANGE...ARE YOU KIDDING?! If the teams are unbalanced its down to the players if they want to balance the teams, and no...they won't.This game has a really good idea, but it needs more content and some serious tweaks to the gameplay to stop spawn camping. More maps need to be intoduced and no mans land needs more cover, games are supposed to be fun, not accurate representations of historial battles, thats why this game for me got boring after 6 hours and made me want to rip out my eyeballs after any more. Other maps could include some more things out in no mans land such as more destroyed tanks and planes as I have only seen these about one or two times on two different maps. Some more things could be added into the trenches like some more living quarters and other smaller features that makes the trenches fun to fight in, instead of an almost straight line shooting mindlessly at the enemy.PS. The motars and gas is the worst, NCO's can throw down a strike like every 30 seconds and you can have like 4 on a team at once. A lot of deaths will incude you spawning, getting in trench (if you can), motar spammed in your general location.			"

								*UPDATE*  the full release of this game is coming and i must say it has really come a long way. the graphics have improved exponentially as has the gameplay. It is the most immersive WWI experience in a game i have ever played. The weapons, the music, the ambiance, the landscape.. every detail is given perfect attention. The devs really hit one out of the park with this game. With so few WWI games out right now even with it being the 100th anniversary of the Great War, i can only hope that many more great titles will follow suit with this one. I couldnt think of a more exceptional game to lead the charge in revitalizing the Great War as a genre!Original review: as we enter the centenial anniversary of the great war, it only seems fair that we should expect alot of great ww1 themed games to start appearing. this is one of them. very engaging gameplay, authentic weaponry, coop squad modes, and its only going to get better from here. this game shows alot of promise and def deserves a try			"

												SO, Verdun the game.Well let me start off with mechanics.The game feels VERY clumsy to new players and that because it is, you can barely see the sight post on your first rifle and the guns take up more than half you screen when aiming down said sights.Melee is also pretty broken, when you stab or hit someone there is a split second lag before it registers that you hit them, so the animation for your bayonet or club going into their gut shows up, BUT they onew shot you anyway, and you didnt even get a hitmarker.Also, dont even TRY to use the melee system without using a bayonet as they are all two hit kills or more and like i said the melee system is extremely slow and buggy.Then we can move onto new player friendlyness, there are no hints to start with and you basically have to learn how to use Artillery Binocs on your own, which did take me a bit to figure out because i had to check the key binds.Another thing is that just like WW1 everything on the battle field is cluttered and strewn about, making it very easy for campers to just lay down in no mans land and snipe your team one by one if they peak above the trench.Graphics and player models look solid colored and saturated which gives the game an unfinished feeling and look which gives the game a sort of open beta feelingDuring my first few hours i was playing i was actually thinking that.""Wow this is all very buggy, hah look at the dying animation, he just glitches into the ground while his limbs wriggled around his body and crunched into the floor....i wonder when the next update is...?""But no despite numerous connectivity problems for EU and other country players besides US, a buggy melee system and bullet lag system weird unfinished looking graphics and player animations in first and third person THE GAME IS THE FINAL PRODUCT, THERE WILL BE NO UPDATES FIXING THESE PROBLEMS.One more thing is team balancing.Im sure you all remember the issue with TF2 team autobalance happeining when it wasnt neccesary, and then the mistake of Valve of removing auto balance all together causing some teams of 7 or 8 to go up against a full 16 player enemy team that refuses to even out the teams just so they could stomp the team with less players.Well that repeats itself here in verdun, and it happens ALL the time.Teams of 6 to 9 players will go up against a full enemy team making it a one sided slaughter.All in all the game had a lot of hype but was extremely dissapointing in a lot of ways.It can be quite fun but after all the problems listed here the game really just starts to be annoying.I even regularly get 16 or more kills per game but honestly you pulling your weight in this game doesnt ultimately contribute to a win, because your team got killed off by a German team full of level 80's to 100's that pushed you back 4 trenches before holding them in place.Veteran players simply take advantage of a less experienced team with almost half as many players as their team.Like i said though it can be fun but you want to avoid servers that arent atleast part way full.TLDR: The game feels unfinished, not forgiving to new players and very buggy with alot of connectivity issues for non US players (im a US player but my friends have alot of issues with it) and can only be sparingly fun if the teams are even and have the same amount of experienced players.

												Verdun is a stimulating game, with a few glitches around movement and terrain clipping.It is focused around trench warfare during WW1, and the game does a great job of exhibiting this while being fun and challenging. It creates some of the most intense experiences I have had in a Multiplayer FPS.During a battle as a Landser unit (German) my buddy and I got a good rhythm and fought, crawling through withering fire into no mans land - breaking the enemy hard point, and finally entering into their trenches... Only to be laid into by a massive artillery barrage that the enemy had called on to their own position... I saw my comrade at arms hit the dirt as around him my entire squad disintegrated into bloody parts flying through the air, landing in the hellish mud. This barrage of hell just barely over.. the enemy counter attacked to regain their trench... I watched as, in an instant - my battle comrade, who had survived MG fire, grenades, artillery barrages and fought through the enemy line... was killed. By a lunatic armed with a f*cking Spade.A Spade. I knew my death was imminent, but putting a bullet through the mad spade wielding, comrade killing lunatic made it all worth it.This game is hell.This game is awesome.			"

												I was at first kind of mixed about purchasing this game, but after playing it for only 20 minutes, I am in love with it!I've seen many complaints from some of the negative comments and my conclusion is that this game is not for everyone.  For all of you that love CoD or games that are constantly in action where you just run around and spray people, Verdun is not like that at all.  For all of you that love Battlefield type games, Verdun is similar in that squad based gameplay encourages people to always use strategy to find the best way to attack.  Another complaint I've seen is that you die fast, and to answer that is that it is true, you do die REALLY fast if you don't use a strategy.  People cannot just run around and spray people or else you're dead meat.  But that is because the game is incredibly realistic.  Damage is very realistic as well where any hit you take from a rifle instantly kills you, pistols and machine gun fire can kill you in about two or three hits.  Like I said before, you do die EXTREMELY fast if people decide to run around without a strategy.Another positive is that the game changes from large battlefield shootouts to close quarters gameplay quickly.  Sometime's you will be defending your trench and are trying to pick off enemies all the way across the battlefield in the opposing team trench.  Sometimes you are clearing out a trench and are surrounded by enemies.  To conclude, if you are someone that loves realism and strategy based teamwork, this game is definitely for you!! For those of you CoD players who love running around and spraying, this game is definitely too slow for you.			"

												Great game! To me every kill seems satisfying and it's just something I love to play. It's want a group of friends in game for sure. It can be frustrating at times but I think it was well worth the money. It runs pretty smooth on my older computer so I'm really pleased with this! it's a small community but everyone seems pretty laid back. No matter how far you are behind team members don't rage and its just fun. If you're new to a ""class"" or ""position"" team members or even the enemy team will help you get better at it all you have to do is ask for help!  One of my best experiences in this game was when I made it into the enemy trench, they called gas on us and charged! Most of my team was dead I was one of the few still alive in the trench, I had my gas mask on and my rifle posed and ready, then out of no where 5 guys round the corner one after the other, I have to squint to see them through the gas then I proceed  to just rack in the points mowing them down as the come around the corner, during all this I was being fired on by mortars! Was such an intense moment!			"

												I really love how much work was put into this game and the amount of history that comes to life. I for one study World War One so much that half the time I think you studdied the battles that go on in this game. After all of this work I'd really love to see something like a gunning run with airplanes. If that's not possible I understand. Anyway, to wrap this up I'd recommend this game to any history buff or fps lover.			"

												Verdun is the greatest World War game since Medal of Honor in my opinion. While it is simplistic in nature, its mechanics and weapons are on point. Nothing like getting through 4 of the 5 bullets in your bolt action rifle's clip and knowing you need to reload, but also that you may not have time before another foe comes around the corner of the position you are looking at.I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a classic shooter and people who have squad goals.

								*April 13, 2014 Early Access Review* (Review will be updated when Verdun is off its beta)Verdun can be explained in one sentence. A World War I first person team-cooperative shooter with some similarities with Red Orchestra franchise in a sheer blend of fast-pace pitch battles and gunfights. Initially, I really like this game mainly because of its setting and reliance of using instincts in order to survive (like Red Orchestra). However, as I play more, the game seems a bit more like a World War I version of Call of Duty. The previous sentence sounds harsh, but it's not as bad as it sounds. While the game seems to tackle in a semi-realistic gameplay that relies on teamwork, it is unfortunate that the majority of players in the game only cares about K:D ratio and selfish ambitions. Players do not use their roles properly and the only way to win is kill the enemy players as quickly as possible in order to take enemy positions before the enemy spawns. The texture is ""alright"" and the human faces need significant improvements in terms of facial structure. So far, the community for Verdun is fairly tiny/small but the majority of players are pre-teenagers and immature players who are arrogant that may or may not lead to your team's downfall. What I dislike about Verdun the most is there is little or no teamwork, and that needs to be addressed. Strangely enough, I continue to come back and play the game mainly it has the potential to become a great World War I shooter that can be compared to World War II's Red Orchestra franchise. The game will be good if there are no arrogant players with the attitude that you see in Call of Duty and stronger emphasis on teamwork. The game has my recommendation only because of its potential to become a great game...but by a short margin due to the immaturity of the community. *Review will be updated soon*			"

								A fun game that goes in a different direction than most shooters these days. If you are a fan of WW1 this is a game you should give a try. It stays true to the attack, try to hold, retreat or advance trench warfare tactics used in WW1. If you can not decide you can always try the free broswer version at the link below. The game includes a deathmatch mode for those who enjoy playing solo.http://www.kongregate.com/games/M2Hgames/verdun Those of you interested in the future of the game should know a real DEV was playing in one match and was eager to answer our questions and hear our suggestions. He was not just standing around talking to us either. He was shooting at enemy players with his gewehr 98 enjoying playing the game, and answering our questions. I have never seen any DEVs do this in any other game. He talked about the addition of gas to the battlefield later this summer, and the addition of more factions such as the British. His communication with us the players is something the industry has been lacking. They seem focused on making a WW1 game that players want to play and will enjoy playing.			"

								*UPDATE*  the full release of this game is coming and i must say it has really come a long way. the graphics have improved exponentially as has the gameplay. It is the most immersive WWI experience in a game i have ever played. The weapons, the music, the ambiance, the landscape.. every detail is given perfect attention. The devs really hit one out of the park with this game. With so few WWI games out right now even with it being the 100th anniversary of the Great War, i can only hope that many more great titles will follow suit with this one. I couldnt think of a more exceptional game to lead the charge in revitalizing the Great War as a genre!Original review: as we enter the centenial anniversary of the great war, it only seems fair that we should expect alot of great ww1 themed games to start appearing. this is one of them. very engaging gameplay, authentic weaponry, coop squad modes, and its only going to get better from here. this game shows alot of promise and def deserves a try			"

								This game is a lot of fun. As a beta it doesn't look the greatest and has a few bugs. That being said, this game being made by 3 or 4 guys is a huge accomplishment. I think I can only recommend this game for anyone who enjoys WWI history. The gameplay is different from most games. there are only one or two automatic weapons in the game. most weapons are bolt action rifles and one or two shot kills. I would describe it as a super linear capture the point game where you will move up on sets of trenches to try and capture them and then defend against a counter attack. It is fun to attack the trench through the no mans land populated with dead animals, barbed wire, and shell holes. It is also a lot of fun to defend from the trench. As an attacker getting a breakthrough and then pushing down the trench is thrilling, everytime you feel like a MVP. The gameplay is similar enough to otheres that you will know what to do but different enough that it'll be new. I recommend this game for fans of WWI but if your not, it is still in beta and not for everyone. This game is definitely for history buffs. I cannot wait for the final version.			"

												An immersive WW1 tactical FPS. What more could you ask for. Verdun is a welcome change to a genre dominated by modern-themed games. In Verdun you go back to the trenches and ditches of the ''The Great War'', as you battle from one trench line to the next. Grab 3 friends and form a squad, level up individually and as a cohesive fighting unit, the more you play with your friends the better your abilities will be with them. Or go solo, and join or create a server for others to join.Verdun truly captures the atrocities of the First World War, as you might navigate through ensnaring barbed wires, risking a quick peek over the trench, and even the dreadful ''No Man's Land"". Where you can be cut down by an MG as soon as leave your little hole you call home.			"

								One of the only WWI games out there, and certainly the best. Squad combat is great and the different roles feel unique. However, it's the Front-Lines Game-mode that really makes this game shine. One team has to capture a trench or position. While the opposition has to hold them back. Either way, the attacking team has to face a counter attack, whether it's from they old lines after being beaten back, or simply the new one they've just taken!However, this is an early access game. It does have a few problems. Some of the weapons such as the MG's can take a bit to get to, even after selecting that class. The animations are still a little shoddy too. But, overall. I have to recommend this game if you have interest in anything WWI related, the fighting is simply to well done to not recommend. You can try and sneak into a relatively weak are of defense, or run out like a madman lobbing grenades everywhere.			"

												A fresh experience if you are in to shooters. The Frontlines game mode is the cream of the crop, while the others (rifle deathmatch, co-op, etc) are otherwise insignificant. Despite this however, there is a good amount of content and, while there isn't a huge amount of maps, there is replay value in playing with 11 different squads, with 4 different classes per squad, and of those there are 3 variations of kit.I could mention other things, such as the squad levelling system affecting squad bonuses as well as the SL abilities and the uniform your troops are equipped with, but ill keep this brief: I bought this for £15 when it was on sale in Early Access, however I can recommend it for the current price point now that it is full release (plus the recent expansion) and I can safely say this has been one of my best purchases I have made from EA. Absolutely superb.			"

												Great game! To me every kill seems satisfying and it's just something I love to play. It's want a group of friends in game for sure. It can be frustrating at times but I think it was well worth the money. It runs pretty smooth on my older computer so I'm really pleased with this! it's a small community but everyone seems pretty laid back. No matter how far you are behind team members don't rage and its just fun. If you're new to a ""class"" or ""position"" team members or even the enemy team will help you get better at it all you have to do is ask for help!  One of my best experiences in this game was when I made it into the enemy trench, they called gas on us and charged! Most of my team was dead I was one of the few still alive in the trench, I had my gas mask on and my rifle posed and ready, then out of no where 5 guys round the corner one after the other, I have to squint to see them through the gas then I proceed  to just rack in the points mowing them down as the come around the corner, during all this I was being fired on by mortars! Was such an intense moment!			"

												I was at first kind of mixed about purchasing this game, but after playing it for only 20 minutes, I am in love with it!I've seen many complaints from some of the negative comments and my conclusion is that this game is not for everyone.  For all of you that love CoD or games that are constantly in action where you just run around and spray people, Verdun is not like that at all.  For all of you that love Battlefield type games, Verdun is similar in that squad based gameplay encourages people to always use strategy to find the best way to attack.  Another complaint I've seen is that you die fast, and to answer that is that it is true, you do die REALLY fast if you don't use a strategy.  People cannot just run around and spray people or else you're dead meat.  But that is because the game is incredibly realistic.  Damage is very realistic as well where any hit you take from a rifle instantly kills you, pistols and machine gun fire can kill you in about two or three hits.  Like I said before, you do die EXTREMELY fast if people decide to run around without a strategy.Another positive is that the game changes from large battlefield shootouts to close quarters gameplay quickly.  Sometime's you will be defending your trench and are trying to pick off enemies all the way across the battlefield in the opposing team trench.  Sometimes you are clearing out a trench and are surrounded by enemies.  To conclude, if you are someone that loves realism and strategy based teamwork, this game is definitely for you!! For those of you CoD players who love running around and spraying, this game is definitely too slow for you.			"

												Verdun is the greatest World War game since Medal of Honor in my opinion. While it is simplistic in nature, its mechanics and weapons are on point. Nothing like getting through 4 of the 5 bullets in your bolt action rifle's clip and knowing you need to reload, but also that you may not have time before another foe comes around the corner of the position you are looking at.I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a classic shooter and people who have squad goals.

												An immersive WW1 tactical FPS. What more could you ask for. Verdun is a welcome change to a genre dominated by modern-themed games. In Verdun you go back to the trenches and ditches of the ''The Great War'', as you battle from one trench line to the next. Grab 3 friends and form a squad, level up individually and as a cohesive fighting unit, the more you play with your friends the better your abilities will be with them. Or go solo, and join or create a server for others to join.Verdun truly captures the atrocities of the First World War, as you might navigate through ensnaring barbed wires, risking a quick peek over the trench, and even the dreadful ''No Man's Land"". Where you can be cut down by an MG as soon as leave your little hole you call home.			"

The level of detail in this game is amazing, from the weapons, to the environments, and even the hobnails on the soldiers' boots. The game is gorgeous, and is a ton of fun; so if you haven’t played it, you should give it a try.			"

												I was an American grenadier, carrying two hand grenades and a Springfield m1917 rifle without a bayonet.  Gas shells landed in our trench, shoving our squad into the field as we struggled to smash our '4' buttons and put on our gas masks.  We charged the enemy pillbox, a German with a machinegun cut down our squadleader and rifleman, leaving our own gunner and myself to finish the job.My friendly gunner used his BAR to lay down suppressive fire on the German position, spraying down multiple enemies from the hip, giving me the time I needed to throw both of my grenades at the entrance of their pillbox.  I heard two explosions, and the screams of the dying enemy machinegunner.  I looked back to check on my comrade, but he had been cut down by enemy rifle fire, so I finished the sprint into the enemy pillbox.  No enemies were inside, yet I knew they were near, finishing off whatever remained of my brothers in arms.  I crouched down and pointed my rifle towards the entrance of the pillbox.The barrel of a Gewehr 98 poked into the doorway, followed by the German wielding it.  Ready, I took my shot and killed him instantly with a clean hit to the chest.  Just as I finished cycling the bolt, another enemy ran in, my next bullet killed him just like the last.  Realizing that an entire squad was entering the pillbox, I began to smash my left mouse button, firing and cycling a new round in as quickly as I could, missing once and killing two more enemies as they entered.  The last man to enter caught me out of ammo, so I charged him and bashed his face in the butt of my rifle, ending him in two clean hits.  All four men were dead or dying on the floor.  The sight of their bodies thrashing around and the sounds they made as they died haunted me, so I took a second before heading back to reload.Just as I slipped a new clip into my rifle, a German officer sprinted through the door, leaping over the pile of his dead squadmates.    He fired his c96 at me, but there was little I could do, so I jumped twice before catching three rounds with my torso.  I promptly died, ready and waiting to be reunited with my fallen squadmates, in approximately twelve seconds, assuming there was no balance timer.10/10 game, more virtual PTSD than ro2 imo			"

												Fantastic game with a great community. The setting and atmosphere is perfect, all the weapons/outfits are historically accurate, and even the use of language is impressive. When you can't see them, you know the nationalities of your allies and enemies by their shouts. If you're a German and you hear French and English in your trench, you'd better get ready to fight. It's a small detail that I personally find very immersive. Brutally simple gunplay. Most weapons are bolt action rifles, and you die in one shot most of the time. I think the setting and mechanics of the game turn away cancerous ""COD-kiddy"" type players who crave killstreaks and fast paced gameplay, ludicrous guns, etc. You can usually spot them whining for 2 or 3 matches in the chat, and then never see them again. I really doubt this was intentionally done, but having these players naturally phased out dramatically improves the community. Good job, Devs!Speaking of which, the community is full of proper gentlemen, the type of guys you feel proud about capturing a trench with. The overwhelming majority of players are friendly, helpful, and non-toxic, Something nice to see in a modern FPS game.This game requires patience, and you will probably die a lot when you start playing. It plays very differently than shooters like COD or CSGO, and therefore it won't appeal to everyone. Having an interest in history also improves the experience, but definitely isn't necessary to enjoy. I think many FPS fans will appreciate this game because frankly, it's just a lot of fun.It's clear that the developers wanted to create a proper WW1 shooter, something that many people, myself included, have awaited for years. Thank you for fulfilling this wish.TL;DR: Amazing game, don't buy if impatient or diehard ""COD kiddy""Edit: Came back to play after missing it for a few months, and the community has devolved into absolute cancer. What the ♥♥♥♥ happened, guys?			"

												Verdun is honestly one of the funnest games I've played. It feels different to a lot of other FPS games, not only in the theme but in the gameplay mechanics too. I particularly enjoy the NCO role in squads giving access to command auras and abilities such as mortar strikes, smoke screens, air recon, and gas attacks.It's very fun to play and has a few different gameplay types although I spend a vast majority of my time in the frontlines type in which you fight for control of enemy trenches.The weapons are very fun to use and I feel there is a good and interesting variety, with the vastly different fire rates of weapons, along with the different requirements of no man's land and trench fighting, I feel there is a lot of tactical thinking that can go into gameplay and deciding how and when to take your battles.I really enjoy the team focused elements of the game and I feel that the Verdun community is one of the friendliest and more welcoming communities in online games that I've experienced.Progressing, gaining ranks, medals, etc. All of that is nice as well and gives a real sense of achievement and I often screenshot the scoreboard and my medals when I've done particularly well, and looking at the screenshots in the community hub, I'm not alone in doing this.All in all, it's a very wonderful, sure there is the occasional bug but I feel the developers are pretty good at fixing these and I wouldn't say they impact gameplay much at all.I would definitely recommend Verdun!

								excellent game if you like military history, even though the graphics may feel kind of arcadish, they have improved and they probably will improve until the final game is released. this is one of a kind, the only game that is kind of red orchestra/battlefield-such that you can play battles situated in world war one. currently there are only germany and france, but it is likely that great britain and some other nations will be added. it is a lot of fun to play. the first person shooter elements are definitely authentic if not the best, and there is hardly any spraying bullets in the game because most of the people are using bolt-action rifles.currently there are two kinds of squads for both germany and france: regular army squads and mountain infantry squads, there are 4 people in each squad. NCO(commander/officer), gunner, machine gunner, grenadier mountain infantry wield shorter, faster-firing rifles, better for shorter range engagements, and they have superior stamina, their officers have recon plane abilities that can reveal enemy locations on the map. regular army squads have 4 people as well but they are better for long-range engagements, their officers have mortar strike abilities.the game is set around trench warfare, you will either defend or attack a position. if you accomplish the objective, you earn a point as a team. therefore, the match scores are usually like soccer game scores.there is also a deathmatch mode where you unlock your own rifles and attachments. pros: -authentic gameplay,trench warfare-decent visuals-unique game-concerned developers, even though there is a grand total of 3 of themcons:-bugs and stuff. your progress may get reset.-certain roles are picked up by people who have absolutely no clue what they are doing...if your officer does not advance, you keep spawning on him, and you will have to walk a lot. it can get quite annoying-no automatic team balancing, you can have plenty of games where there is twice as much of the enemy,mostly french outnumbering german teams-french rifles have better sights than german rifles. thus, it is easier to hit targets with them. this causes balancing issues where most of the great players will prefer shooting with french rifles. i always play as both german and french and get kills easier with french rifles at range			"

												Fun lil trench warfare shooter. It's not quite Red Orchestra and it's definately not like COD. This game is a slower paced, semi-realistic shooter with some lovely sound and graphics to boot. The community is respectful, people tend to know what to do, and if you're a noob you likely will not be berated for it. Overall, this game reminds me of my days playing paintball with its one-shot-one-kill mechanic and having to use the land (as opposed to boxes/buildings/walls) as cover. It's hard to see enemies and if you're leaving yourself out in the open you can consider yourself as good as dead. I often find myself looking for vantage points where I can shoot a couple times and then leave as to not leave myself open to return fire. It's a tense environment, yet deceptively relaxing and not many games pull of this feeling for me.For the price, why not give it a spin? You might be pleasantly surprised.			"

												I like this game particularly because of its setting. World War one is a undersubscribed genre for gaming as of late, especially with all the centenary  it is getting. With more units, weapons and nations available this game will only get better and better. It is also fun to play with friends, but can get rather frustrating if you have a team consisting of new players. The fact i am in interested in the era this game is set in helps its case a lot of course.			"

												What can I say... the graphics on this game could be a lot better. That said I don't know of any game on steam that quite captured the essence of WW1 trench warefare, it's futility, it's brutality, it's sheer mindnumbing horror. You stay in the trench, you get an artillery round and your dead, you stick your head up to have a look, you get your head shot off, you jump out of the trench to attack across no mans land you get shot... you go the wrong way you can caught up in barded wire you get shot or die...you get the picture.... Great game... the graphics need a bit of work.. but awesome game if you feel like some self traumatisation every now and again.			"

												You're crawling across wet stinking mud into a waterlogged shell crater while the screams of your dying teammates drown out the blast of a creeping artillery barrage, desperately hoping the hail of lead from the machine gun tearing your comrades in arms apart doesnt find you in its sights. Suddenly infront of you, an enemy soldier. He fires first, but in panic, misses you. You leap up and beat him to death with the butt of your rifle. Staggering and out of breath, you take a second to get your bearings, but behind you, you hear the shrill whistle of the Commading officer, and the call to charge. Ahead; a yellow mist wafts across the trenchline. You know it is certain death. Yet onwards you go. Through the Fire and Smoke.One of the best games I've ever played. Reminds me of the original Red Orchestra in terms of gameplay. Great Community, great developers.			"

								While the First World War setting gives an element of novelty to this online multiplayer shooter, what is truly innovative is the ebb and flow that is baked in to the gameplay. At any one time one side is in their trench defending, not allowed to advance towards the enemy, while the other side is in their own parallel trench being forced to run, crawl and walk over no-man's land towards their (almost) certain doom. Once the attackers reach the enemy trench it becomes a tense game of nerves as danger lurks around every corner. Succeed in capturing the trench and the enemy fall back to another; fail and you are sent back to your own trench to this time defend. In this way a map is played across a set of parallel trenches with advance and fallback, capture and defend.The first world war elements are all there - bolt action rifles, hand guns, primitive hand grenades, mustard gas & gas masks, binoculars to spy the enemy position and calling up of mortar strikes. And the maps are full of mud, duckboards, sandbags, bomb craters and burnt out tanks and crashed bi-planes - truly desolate. The sound track is full of French and German commands and cries, with whistles alerting you to your officer's commands.It's a truly innovtive game and well worth a try. Do yourself a favour and buy the multi-pack and share the love.			"

								Verdun is Amazing Upcoming Trench Warfare game. It is game that any Gamer who enjoys Classic World War 1 game must obtain! It feels like a Classic WW1 shooter right off the bat, Reminding me of Call of Duty 1 and Medal of Honor Allied assault with the Different Squads based on real squads from the Verdun war.  The game runs on the Beautiful Unity 2 engine which is used for Cross-Platform gaming and also features the ability to play on Mac and Linux! The Graphics are stellar and I extremely enjoy it since I've been waiting for a Next-Gen World War 1 game for years now.  There is a basic System unlock tier for all weapons and different types of attachments. The controls simple and easy to play with, It's just like any other FPS game.  The server system is very unique, Where you select a gametype on a Big Board and then select a Map to play on as opposed to a specific server, making it much easier to play with Friends. My favorite part of any FPS game is a statistics counter, Which Verdun has! It keeps track of all your kills, Melees, Deaths, Stats for specific gamemodes etc. It even has achievements and medalss within it!  Verdun is absolutely a must have for the current price of $22.99. M2H and BlackMill games are hard at work developing it and making it better with each passing day!  -Please remember it is an Early Access game so there WILL be Bugs/Glitches and impending changes to the content and gameplay.

												I've been looking at the forums, and, to my amazement actually found bad reviews. To set things clear, here goes my review (700+ hours gaming time; specs are: let's just say zombie-like craptop).I admit I got this game when it was on sale, paid 7€ (9 dollars) for it. My first shooter ever and my first k/d was 1-41 on Picardie. This is one issue about the game which bugs most people: If you are new, you have to get used to the gameplay (1 hit 1 kill rifles, 1-2 hit 1 kill pistols). This usually lasts a few matches, and *zack* ""stupid game, don't buy, blah-di-blah-di-blah"".I hammered on (also because all my other games were rts and I wanted a change in terms of game genre; still.)Now I have played... a lot. Even if this game was 50 € / 54 bucks, hell yeah buy it! It will become AWESOME in the next years due to many planned updates; get it while it's still at 20.Why, you may ask.Here we go:- 90% of all the veteran players are nice and will give you tips if you don't troll around and don't camp- REALISM- Awesomly well-made maps, uniforms, weapons- cool squad system (it's better than the ad says)- unique setting- it simply won't get boring, you keep discovering new tactics- when it gets boring, an update comes- very cool graphics even on low, as my craptop would most certainly explode if I take them any higher (also, they improved a lot since I started playing this)Downsides:- for me?: none- things that might bug you: initial ""shock"" as described above (but you quickly get over it); one or two annoying bugs every now and then (such as insta-kick before you get to a game due to ""squad missing"", whatever that is); some players lag a bit.My rating: 10/10 would be lieing, it actually is 11/10. Why? I only have an understatement to answer this: it is AWESOME. (Depending on how much you hate bugs, the worst-case scenario rating is 9/10)			"

Brutal WW1 Trench Warfare experienceOne of the best FPS games I've played in a while, albeit it being not too friendly for new players, because the game is fairly difficult. A keen eye is required to play this, since most of the time you scan the environment for enemies. Classes are varied and it's tied to a ""Squad"" system, where each squad is consisted of different country soldiers and each have their own unique traits, weapons, appearance and so on. You can also rename and create squads any way you like. Also, each squad has to have one of each class. For ex: Officer, Rifleman, Machinegunner and Grenadier. This is great, because it keeps the game naturally balanced from everyone picking snipers or grenadiers. There's also Rifle Deathmatch, Attrition Warfare and Squad Defense, but I did not bother with them, because they have a smaller player base. Frontlines is probably the mode that defines Verdun anyway, so I highly recommend sticking to it.Maps are fairly varied, but they are repetative, due to their nature - trenches, trenches everywhere... Also, you will die - a lot. 8 out of 10 times, you won't know what killed you, because you die very quickly. Played this game solo, but had no problems communicating with players and even rejoining games with people I enjoyed playing with. Game has a built-in history of recent players.Variety of weapons is crazy. So many rifles, MG's, pistols, grenades, types of mortar and even gas. Hell, you can even pick a class with 5 grenades, but only a spade as a primary weapon for smacking people. Highly recommend playing this with ""Gore"" enabled, because it highlights the horrors of World War 1. Soldiers screaming and twitching in the battlefield with either their heads or limbs missing. Absolutely horryfing when your team gets shelled by a mortar that managed to directly hit 3-4 people and showers the whole area with body parts. Graphics also look nice, the sky boxes are well done. Shadows are wonky, but the lighting itself is quite good. Do not recommend playing with a high FOV, because it reduces the size of your weapon, and also your iron sights which is CRUCIAL. Playing with 70 FOV, but it still plays and feels nice, due to it's slower nature. Peripheral vision is not the main thing here, since most of the time fighting takes place in front of you. Unlocking new items is very easy, you get ""tokens"" which you can use to unlock class specific loadout ranks. Each costs 1 and it's very hard to run out of tokens. New players are not inherently at a huge disadvantage, which is nice.All in all, a very good and solid FPS game. Would definitely recommend to anyone.			"

												Verdun is suprisingly easier to pick up than red orchestra 2. The gunplay is generally nice (especially with the mgs), the sounds for the other guns are a little weak though and it sometimes feels like you're shooting a peashooter that kills in a shot. There isnt as much teamplay as I would expect however generally people move towards a their goal. Oh and it runs really well on my crappy macbook air (with low settings ofc).			"

												Are you looking for a WW1 fps shooter that is actually historical?? This is the game for you!I just returned to this game and man do I still like it. They have added so much since I played the last time which I got so impressed by. This is probably the most realistic WW1 fps shooter you can get today. The fightingsystem they have in the trenchbattles makes you attack or defend on order and it makes it unique and act like a real ww1 battle! It is hard and unforgiving but that is also what makes it good. Shoot a guy with a rifle and he is down. The gritty feeling you get when you run through the trenches and you can see your recently shot down teammates laying in gore and bodyparts. There are plenty of weapons options and cool squadplay. You really get the feeling of how horrible the war was when you see others and yourself die time after time in waves. Although of that you can still get some epic moments where you kick some serious♥♥♥♥♥For the cheap price it is a must buy for people who like history and fps or just if you want a real challenge!I will keep playing this game for a long time.

								Yeah, it's the best game about the 1st World War!  You should buy this game not because of graphics (yes, sometimes it's very poor) but because of gameplay and specific atmosphere - ordering an air support as a german Unterofficer only with Parrabelum, or maybe killing an enemy with a butt as a french soldier? This game is suprisingly good, but red poppies pulled me to the reflections about how many people died in the Verdun battle...8,5/10+nice gameplay+specific atmosphere+possibility of creating your own team+must have for every history enthusiast-bad graphics even on extra (remember: it's still BETA) - I hope that game studio will improve this-many bugs			"

												Ensure a significant amount of players is playing in your region before buying this, I've been here since early access and considering the players in my region started to decrease dramatically at one point, I started going to the only populated servers at that time EU, and Americas. It was good despite my ping delaying everything I do for a few miliseconds - regular seconds, but once they added Ping limiting I could never play the game since then, if anyone shows up on my region it would be 2 - 4 players TOTAL, and that's on a week-end, when you expect the servers to be flooded.

								  With a lot of the early Access games coming out I've noticed that it can be very difficult to judge progress within the given title. If you've only ever had the pleasure of seeing this game on steam, you may fall under this statement. Originally this was a browser based game and the amount of distance it has covered since then is substantial.   Has it been polished to a shining gem capable of reflections? No, but its a great example of what the early access section is capable of; Marked improvement over the duration of its development. It has a lovely community, and the devs listen and provide feedback, covering issues the community sees as most important (bullet drop is a great example).   The settings are great and immersive, bleak and unwelcoming. The gameplay is unique and really hits a niche with its first world war era backdrop. Charging trenches with grenades and bayonets, then defending against onslaughts of furious counter-attacks is thrilling.  Now I do admitt, the price tag is a little steep, though it isnt to waste. This has the potential to be a great full release, and as of me writing at this moment, it WILL be a great title. Spend the money and help us make it that shining gem that reflects our gleaming smiles.			"

Only problem i have with it is that it needs more gore, i want limbs in the trench and faces melting off from gas, and more blood, everywhere.   8/10 would be 9/10 if more gore*Edit*They added gore.Significantly improves game.9/10 as promised.                                With that thought in mind, might I also add that the devs are constantly patching this game and keeping it up to date, while also adding loads of new content.

Early Access Review
 tl;dr -> If you want a WWI trench warfare simulator, then look no further. Machinegunner was mowing down our troops, so we called for a mortar strike on his position and rushed the trenches. Enemy responded with a gas attack on the immediate area, but we were able to get our masks on in time. Our attack wave ended, so we had to double back and repel the enemy advance. 11/10 for gritty realism.I got this game gifted to me, and was looking forward to a chance to dive back into the competitive FPS genre. I was very satisfied with the work-in-progress, and am hopeful for the future direction of the game. If you like WWI trench warfare, brutal, unforgiving combat, and heavy teamwork (player interaction is more Battlefield-style than Call of Duty's lone wolf, rambo playstyle), then you will enjoy this game. Although the game is very much an early-access product, the development seems strong and consistent, and there is definitely a lot of potential here.The aesthetics are pretty good - the amount of detail in the environment is well-done, and the textures have a decent amount of work put in. There isn't any music, however, the  sound assets are fantastic - with practice, you can even distinguish which kind of weapons are being fired just from hearing it. I tried going underwater and firing my weapon, and the sound changes accordingly. Hiding underwater and listening to the difference in gunshots when you come up is pretty cool. The grenade mechanic - if one goes off next to you - is very good, and shooters can even sneak up on you while if they are careful. The controls are typical of your generic competitive FPS, and don't take a long time to get used to. There is no tutorial, but there are plenty of helpful members in the community willing to help you out if you just ask. Matchmaking can be a bit confusing at first, but understand that each unique squad (Canadians, Germans, etc) have their own set of 4 classes to choose from, and your squad-class-specific experience carries between matches. Higher levels in a class unlock better loadouts - for example, I reached level 2 in a rifleman class and unlocked a sniper scope. Squads can also level up, and they will receive things like mortar/gas strike abilities. Classes have a maximum of 4 levels to unlock.The checks and balances (trade-offs) are very impressive in this game. If you use the sniper scope, for example, it will increase your viewing range significantly, however, it will almost completely eliminate your peripheral view - making it easier for people to sneak past/toward you. Machinegunners are a menace to the trenches, but are easy rifle fodder because of the large muzzle flash they create. The Canadian squad is lightly armed with mostly pistols, however, they are excellent trench rushers and flankers. You can try jumping over barbed wire fences, but if you get stuck or land in one you will take significant damage.During gameplay, you will have to alternate between attack/defend waves, which require the attacking team to try to capture structures or critical areas by having more soldiers within. When the wave timer runs out, the roles will switch, and any attackers caught too deep in enemy territory are automatically executed (defenders also cannot run out too far). You will most likely die from a single rifle/machinegun shot, but can take one or two extra pistol hits. Combat is very satisfying, especially if you can get into a superior firing/kill position overlooking the enemy. Overall, if you are interested in historical trench warfare, I would strongly suggest you check out this game. I look forward to what the developers have in store for the future.Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

								Each update makes the game better. Such a great WW1 game. Really captures the trench warfare aspect. Matches feel great as both sides just push and defend trenches. Rifle firing seems spot on. Even free for all servers are a ton of fun. Quite challenging trying to watch all sides in the vast maps.			"

												Short version: very poor optimisation ruins the game for many people.I come to Verdun from Red Orchestra 2, Operation Flashpoint (2001) and ARMA (1-2). If you enjoy these games you will love the gameplay of Verdun. It is more realistic than Red Orchestra 2, slower and more unforgiving, but more casual than ARMA which is good. I will keep it short: if the game would run how it should I would give it a thumbs up - but it does not at all. It stutters from 70fps to 8fps and back every few seconds now [25.11.2015]. So if you are in the middle of a trench combat it can screw your gameplay completely. This stuttering is permanent and probably for everyone. Many people in the forum and the game complain about this issue, even people on powerful machines. The reason is probably some bad written code. The game is not in early access anymore and because of that I can not forgive this, if I knew about these issues I would have not bought it at all. Great idea - badly realised. For now I go back to Red Orchestra 2 and hope that the developers will take it seriously and fix the heavy performance issues. When it is done I am willing to return and give it another try. Stay away from this now or buy it with this in your mind.Added flaws that I have found:There is also no way to refill your ammunition, nor a way to pick up weapons from dead friends or foes. When you use normal rifles that is seldom a problem, but there are classes that use a machine pistol or only grenades with a melee weapon. A machine pistol user is an attacking class and runs out of ammo very fast, that means once you used your 4 or 5 magazines you are left with the weak melee attack of it until you die. And that happens immediately, since chances to survive in a 1-shot-1-kill game with a melee weapon are zero. The same goes for the class that uses 5 grenades and a melee weapon - once the 5 grenades are gone you will die pretty fast and you will not be able to take a rifle from somebody. I see it as a clear design flaw that is breaking my immersion in the game.One point that is not so important for the gameplay, but for immersion, is that the ingame interface looks very modern and like from 2003. Something could be done about it, making it look atmospheric, using old maps instead of this red/green gps radar.At the default settings there is a crosshair (!) turned on. I switched it off immediately since I think that it is not compatible with a realistic game, but other players might let it on and probably have an advantage because of it. I dont know how precise shooting from the hip with the crosshair is.The animation for throwing grenades is very bad. I like the one in Red Orchestra 2 much better, since it is easier to estimate the throwing strength and distance. In Verdun it looks and feels very unnatural and I have difficulties estimating the distances right. Check youtube videos for it.The players I saw were pretty passive about teamplay. Nobody was ever talking on a microphone, people are mostly running around and doing their thing. Maybe it is because of the many new players coming from the sale. But what I saw is this: there is a great squad teamplay implementation that forces you to become a member of one squad all the time, but the people in this squads are not really working together. I had difficulties calling for help when we were flanked a few times. I was sitting alone on the right side of the trench, the other guys all on the left and not listening. Maybe I am doing something wrong, have to figure it out. But thats not the fault of the developers and can happen in every game.This game is still in beta, folks.			"

												I'm sorry but with the poor performance that has degraded since release, generally unfriendly and all-but-dead community and severe balancing issues - including the explosives (read: Mills) abuse - I can't recommend this game.It doesn't have any single player component to speak of, and I did not see any way to set up a private server with bots or anything. These points really wouldn't be such a big deal if the community were larger - but I just played a match of Frontlines at 7:30pm EST on a Saturday evening and there was only 61 other people online. That's total players on the game worldwide, not regional.I know, downvote me but here is the ugly and inevitable comparison: Battlefield One. If you have the money and an itch for WW1 combat, that is your ticket. Thousands of people online regularly, better balance to the weapons and gameplay mechanics, and significantly better performance. And no - I don't care about the graphics, (at all!) I am talking strictly performance - BF1 runs better. In my humble opinion, Verdun was good but now that BF1 is out there's no reason to get Verdun - BF1 will last longer, making it a better investment.To be fair to the developers of Verdun: if you want to look at which dev is better, it's them. They have released quite a lot of content for free, and continue to support their game with massive game system additions and tweaks like the gore system. Despite the declining player base they maintain their game with regular patches, even though sometimes the patches backfire a little. It should be noted here that sometimes the patches do significantly degrade the game, making it (personally) unplayable for stretches, but they fix what gets broken. In the end, neither EA nor Dice will provide this level of loyalty to you as a customer - however, in an online-only multiplayer shooter like this, the game's worth to you as a potential buyer ultimately come downs to the community, and most importantly it's longevity. Verdun, despite the best efforts of the devs, is dying. And that means, in my opinion, it isn't worth your money.			"

												 It's not very much do you see a video game for WWI. If you enjoy the Red Orchestra series you will enjoy Verdun, if you   aren't familiar with the style of gameplay it won't take too long getting used to. Although there are some bugs in-game it's work-in-progress, like for example registering hits on an enemy can sometimes not work but not too much to where it handicaps gameplay. Great graphics, scenery, I get pretty immersed into it. All in all, it's a great game.			"

VerdunVerdun is a WWI fps that places you in trench warfare.  This game is unique in that it is one of the few WWI games offered and that it is trench warfare and not just an open map yo run around and shot everyone.  The game is designed on the Unity engine and looks decent.  The engine provides good physic effects which makes the experiences that much more enjoyable.  Developement CycleThe graphics and gameplay have improved a lot over the last year.  The developers have released several patches since I made this video in June, 2014.  The game plays and looks better today than in my initial video review but still feels last gen.  Improvements have been made in areas like bullet trajectory/hit boxes which was a huge improvement needed in this game.  The GoodThe game brings a unique gameplay/experience in a very competitive war FPS genre.  Playing a WWI game is very cool to experience as most World War games are based on WW2 or something  sci-fy. The Devs really hit the mark in providing a trench war experience. I really enjoy playing this game. The BadMy biggest dislike is a lack of maps/battle locations. But unfortunately, this is a realistic game based on the actual WWI battle of Verdun so more maps is most likely not going to happen. ConculsionIs it worth your time? If you like the idea of playing a WWI game in the trenches of Verdun then yes I do. I really like this game and recommend it for any fan of war themed first-person shooters.

												I first played Verdun when it was in its early stages, the only gameplay available was rifle death match. Even though I was not all too good, I loved the game. When I found it on Steam, getting it was a no brainer. I love this game even more now than I did then. However, this game is not for everyone. If you can't handle dying constantly then you have no business playing Verdun. In Verdun (at least for me) you are dead for just about as much time as you are alive. The weapons it this game are not ""Call of Duty"" type guns either, you can't just go in guns blazing or you will be dying A LOT. However, if you love WWI games or just games that feature fast paced trench warfare, then Verdun is the game for you. The maps are detailed and expansive, as well as difficult. With all this being said, I would strongly recommend that you get this game, it is very fun. If your not sure about whether or not you would like this game, I know YouTube has a good amount of gameplays and tutorials you can watch. I hope you get this game, and I hope to see you on the frontlines!			"

								8.2/10+weapon and setting detail (simply amazing)+huge maps offer diverse gameplay+unique gameplay, never seen an fps quite like it+cool fx+If you stay with your squad amazing stuff can happen-weird animations on some occasions-no real incentive to stay with your squad at first-few maps (for now I guess)-potentially low frame rates-Lacks certain forms of realism (which I guess is due to everyone trying to play individually)Summary: This is a game intended for different types of people if you are looking for some realistic fps set in world war 1 then you may not get what you want, if you are searching for a completed game with tons of maps and a huge community your wishes might not be fulfilled. If you are looking for a balance of the two then you should buy Verdun asap. I believe that in most cases it is well worth your money. Lots of fun and the quality of the game is getting better by the week.			"

												If you want WW1 trench combat, this is basically the only game you can get. Thankfully it's a good game. Classes feel mostly balanced and maps are mostly decent. There are obviously good maps and bad maps. The majority of the maps are good but some are still absolute stinkers (looking at you Fort Douaumont). Verdun feels mostly finished, but there are some things still missing such as only the British character models have gask masks, missing sounds, iffy netcode, reload animations don't sync with audio.. etc. It's all nit-picky stuff, apart from the netcode issue. The core gameplay is bug free and solid and I can only suggest a couple of improvements (i.e. one I really want is having an indicatior if your bolt isn't positioned correctly since the gun model always has a closed bolt even if the game thinks the bolt is open).I've been playing Verdun on both Windows and Linux and as expected, performance is utter trash on Linux. Maybe with some tweaking and better drivers the game will perform better, but bad performance is a common theme for me and games in Linux. Crashes are extremely frequent on Linux but I've never experienced a crash on Windows 10.			"

												Just your standard Canadian rifleman in the trenches of the Somme.  The German's attack had lost its momentum and, with the sound of a trumpet, they were in full retreat.  It was our turn to charge.  We formed an unorganized line at the ladders of the front-most trench, joined by a few British units and some Frenchmen.  When the whistle blows, the first soldiers scale the walls to enter the chaos of No Man's Land.   But the only place they get to is the muddy floor of the trench.   The next group climbs the ladder, only one makes it out.  The pattern continues until our Corporal gives us the order to attack.  And we do.  The four of us rush to the nearest crater amidst artillery, gunfire, and the roar of a passing flying machine.  Only two of us arrive; the Corporal and I.  And soon that too would change, as, with a faint snap, the Corporal is hit by a stray bullet. So, with not a friend in sight, I pull out my trusty shovel and charge.  Germans bullets whiz by and smack against the dirt.  But they do nothing.  I make it into the German trench and wildly swing my entrenching tool in the general direction of the nearest Kraut.  There was a thud and a clang, and he falls dead.  But he was not alone.  His fellow Huns were quick to put me down with their handguns.  But the Jerry that I snagged was their Machine Gunner.  And with that gun unmanned, even for a second, our forces were able to make it further across the ruined fields.  The trench was ours.  And I was a Canadian martyr.This is the kind of crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥that happens all the time in Verdun, and it's absolutely great.  Verdun is truly great, as cinematic as it is challenging.  If you want a quick run-and-gun, a game with little thinking and heavy competitive play, do not buy this game.  This is not Battlefield, and it is not CoD.  But if you want to experience a realistic depiction of the war, a challengingly realistic FPS, or a team-based game of strategy, Verdun is a must-buy.			"

Early Access Review
								Great game, lots of fun to play. The community is good, players are typically pretty friendly. The maps are interesting, long trenches with tons of ways to sneak / break your way into the enemy position. Good diversity of weaponry: artillery, gas, recon planes, numerous rifles and carbines, pistols, sniper rifles, machine guns, knives / clubs / shovels, grenades, bayonets, etc. There is incentive to play with friends or people that you play with a lot, you gain extra perks such as better uniforms, better offense / defense, etc. The incentive to play as a squad really isn't there, 90% of the time people run off and do whatever they want even though you gain a slight edge when you do play as a unit (faster reload speed, longer breath hold time for snipers, quicker trench capture, etc.).Pros:-Lots of fun, not your typical shooter, it's king-of-the-hill style, but the hill is a a long trench (unless you're playing deathmatch). There is a lot of back and forth.-Authentic period weaponry. Most guns are semi-auto, 3-10 rounds, and typically using iron sights. The machine guns are not terribly over powered, you have to deploy them in the prone position for decent accuracy, they also give away your position pretty quick. Sniper rifles are checked by terrain and lots of close-quarters fighting.-Great atmosphere. The trenches are claustrophobic, no-mans-land is generally a fatal place to be, popping your head up generally results in being shot, gas attacks generally suck to fight in. If the corpses didn't disappear the game would probably look a lot like a typical WWI battlefield with lots of casualties.-NCO's can spawn their teams. Nothing is more frustrating than being mowed down multiple times and having to start back at your trench every time. A good NCO will find a safe place to spawn his squad either in the enemy trench, or in no mans land, it cuts down on the running and frustration.Cons:-My connection quality fluctuates. I've got a 50 mb download rate with a ping around 45 on a computer that has a duo-core processor with a 1 gb graphics card, sometimes I get 30-60 frames per second, sometimes I get 5-20 frames per second. It's about 50/50 for me.-About 20% of the time you don't hit people who are right in front of you / directly in your sights even if you fire multiple shots. It's pretty frustrating-Barbed wire, my worst enemy.			"

												Opinion:In my opinion this game is better than BF1 in some areas. For example, the combat may be more slower paced but I actually feel like I'm in WW1 ,whereas in BF1 it feels like a WW1 to WW2 hybrid.The gore and bullet damage are both very realistic and the graphics are not too shabby either. Sure you can't run this game on a potato PC and the FPS isn't the best but if you want a realistic WW1 FPS shooter then this game is perfect for you. Pros:RealisticImmersiveFunGraphics are not too shabbyGore can be turned off if you don't like itGGCons:FPS could be improved idk if this is just me but the mouse seems a bit accelerated even when mouse acceleration is turned off which really gets to me sometimesSummary/Conclusion:All in all this is a wonderful game and would recommend it to anyone who wants a realistic and immersive WW1 experience.9/10Could use a little tweaking though			"

												Very fun game that gives a new perspective to the first great war and also a great innovation in the gaming community. It was a bold move to make a game where customizable load outs and spam fire are not an option. You really have to focus each shot and make it count in this game because 99.9% of the time you wont last more than a couple of minutes or run out of ammo. The times where you are invading a trench or defending one really gets your heart pumping because just around the corner there might be 1 or 5 guys waiting for you. All of the weapons are fair and balanced because each load out has its own pros and cons. I highly recommend this game especially if its only a couple of bucks.			"

								This game is like no other, the gameplay runs great, everyone uses bolt action rifles, with either a sniper scope fitted you are almost safe to stay in your trench sniping the enemy while you and your team defend yours. or fixed bayonettes. With this you have a buch longer melee range to stab the opposition, yelling ""OVER THE TOP"" as you rush towards the enemy trench. personally i like to charge into their trench and stab them all with it. I die easly but i usualy go down with 3 or 4 kills.10/10 would charge again			"

												A shining example of a games developer who loves what they've made and want to continually improve on it. The only downside to this game is the lack of people online. The latest patch added a co-op vs bots mode is a good solution to the lack of players but ultimately, a full team deathmatch server is when this game is in its prime.This game is not for the weak hearted. Early in the game you will probably die 5 times (or more) without a kill. You will die to artillery as soon as you spawn. You will get your head blown off for just peaking over the trench. If you survive no-mans land and make it to the trench you'll probably die as soon as you get inside. This game is not easy but I think it rewards you enough to get over the pain along the way.			"

It is an extremely unique game, with a WWI setting, which recives constant updates for performance and new features. I have seen games by M2H before, but I thought that this was the best yet! With highly dynamic multiplayer gameplay and unique weapons, this is definately a good buy for any FPS lover. And, as an added bonus, it is made by three indie developers! 5*'s everytime!			"

												Verdun gets compared to Red Orchestra a lot and I think that this game would appeal to RO players. Verdun shares some of the weapons selection with RO but this game has a rigid pace and the guns are EXTREMELY lethal (once you get hit, you die and there is no saving you). And that's the fun of this game, it captures the WW1 trench warfare perfectly with the waves of men attacking at the sound of a whistle, the bleak hellish battlefield, and the things that made the battlefield so hellish like gas, machine fire mowing down soldiers, and barbed wire everywhere. The graphic and sound detail are top notch. There is lots of foilage without it hampering the performace, and the little audio details like the clanking of the soldier's gear while he runs is nice. My biggest gripe with this game are the menus and that they tend to make things harder to reach than it should be.The game runs at steady 60 fps for me at medium settings x 1080 on a GTX 750TI.			"

												French faction is in a game made by indie developers. DICE/EA Have millions but will put them for DLC. But honestly, this game is great. Sure at times it may be glitchy and clunky but my god, the gameplay is actually so much superior than battlefield/COD.... And its a ww1 game. There is more of an emphasis on flanking the enemy and lining up your shot with your bolt action rifle. Every bullet counts. You even have to look at the enemy's uniform to see if they are with you.The landscape,gore,sound effects and attention to detail for the era really highlight the horrors of the Battle of Verdun. Try to have a few friends with this game and enjoy. Yet this game appeals to many people- casuals, arma players and people in between and everyone seems to enjoy it. My fav game at the moment for sure			"

												Verdun is by far one of the best games I ever played. After all the modern and ww2 first person shooters the ww1 setting is very refreshing and works surprisingly well for the genre. The core gameplay is very solid and especially with some friends to fill a squad it can be enjoyed for manny manny hours. The gameplay feels pretty realistic and really gives you the feeling you'r in the middle of the first world war. Maps are well designed and guns feel really good and well balanced. The squad system really brings a deeper level to the gameplay as each member has a different role with different weapons and it rewards teamwork in a great way. I never felt as good winning a game as I did when we took that final trench. Totally worth my money.10/10.			"

												So what is verdun? Well, for starters, its a ww1 infantry fps game, that mainly focuses on so called ""trench warfare"".And just to make it clear if it already wasent, when i say its trench warfare, and is a infantry fps game, i mean just that, there are no vehicels or any thing of the sort. The only thing that exists out side of the players equipment that it can use (like grenades,rifles and melee for example, that are directly used by the player), is the artillery strike which one (or more, i cant remember if there are mulitible classes that can do so) of the classes can call.The game is very immersive, and fairly true to the real thing (at least compared to video game standards), and all of the factions in the game, do actually use the rifles, pistols etc, that were used and manufactured by them. So the british use the lee enfield, and the germans use the .98 mauser for example. Which is to be expected from a historical game, but either way its in there.And as i mentioned before... The characthers are divided in to diffrent classes in small squads (kind of like in bf, but here the classes can only be occupied by one person at a time). and these classes have diffrent types of weaponry and perks to them, for example the grenadier can have up to four grenades on him, but then maybe just a little pistol as a primary, or you can be a machinegunner mowing down your enemys with for example a large lewis gun.The game has two game mods one which is basically just team deathmatch, so jsut running around in a trench and blasting eachother away, and then there is the bread and butter mode of the game. Which is a bit similar to almost something a bit like ""Rush"" form the battlefield franchies, but not really at all, but a nudge. But what you do is that either you start by attacking, which consits of you jumping out of your muddy, stinking, comforteble little trench and run out in to the ""no mans land"" and try to survive and take your self to the otehr side and then capture the enemys trench. Which is a lot easier said than done. And then if you succed in taking the trench, there will be a enemy counter attack, where the enemy try to take back their old trench through the same procedure as the attackers did.And here sadly the game starts lacking....The game is otherwise fairly well balanced and well patched at least i cant actually remeber myself rnning in to bugs while i played it).But the gameplay it self really lacks. Why? 1# the game is trying to be a realistic ww1 infantry shooter, and let me ask you, do you think it was very fun storming a trench? The answer is no. Most die, and so will you, over and over and over again, getting sniped by a sniper you dont see or mowed down by a mg, or maybe you get killed by morter, or maybe even gas if you dont throw on your gas mask quick enough. And when you finally think: ""oh my god, im so close, i can even hear those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. And soon i will get my revenge for them killing me 30 times, and i will teabag them so much that from here on out they will be reminded of this very momnet"". but then, you and your friend that are all cramped up in a little crater/foxhole, get blown up by one single well placed hand grenade.And the game is just really redundant to, because its the same thing over and over again, and the enviorment might change abit, but the experince is generally the same.And the combat isent to god either, since its really quite clunky, and grenade spammy once you get into the trench, and it mostly comes down to who is camping in the best spot.2# some of the classes are quite similar, which also contributes to the repetetiv nature of the game.I dont know what to say really, like the game has really lacking gameplay, but then again, its a almost one of a kind game, and there is not really any other game that offers the same experince. In the end maybe it isent really a bad game, just a game that wants to be historically accurate, and at the same time try to make one ofthe most brutal wars ever seen, feel enjoyble.But this is my opinion on the matter, are you just a general fan of fps games? You might want to skip this one. But if you are a person that wants to experince trench warfare, and a historically accurate game, and is generally intrested in history (specificly the first world war), then this is probably the best game to date to potray that.So the review will be positive, because its a game that offers a experince that almost no fps games do, and i to be honset cant come up with something like it that ive seen. Conclusion: The game has a very atmospheric feel to it and is well crafted immersive experince and can be quite fun at times when you get a equal amount of both sides of the gameplay that is offerd, that being to trench warfare, and the very intense and very punishing gameplay of the no mans land. A very unique game, But as most unique things, it is not for everyone.			"

												Verdun is a brutal experience. The reality of trench warfare is brought to life in vivid detail, from the obliterated landscape, to the murderous modern weapons, to the disorienting gas attacks since outlawed, everything about this game feels authentic to how a real WWI front-line engagement would have been fought, and it's awesome!  Verdun abandons the mindlessness of the twitch-shooter in favor of a more tactically-minded approach. Alone, you are quite under-powered, since the sluggish weapons mean you're likely to get yourself killed if you take on the enemy alone. Only with teamwork, by multiplying your force, can you hope to overcome the enemy. Thankfully, Verdun presents players with plenty of ways to do that.  In Frontlines, the game's flagship mode, the Entente and Central powers are divided into various squads of 4. Each squad is unique and each of the 4 squad members has a unique role. Oh, and if you were thinking of picking a weapon off someone dead, forget it. You're stuck with the weapons you have. It's easy to see how players with a more competitive mindset could take advantage of the potential strengths of various squads to create a strong all-around force.  All of that would be useless if the game mode weren't as well designed as it is. You will attack the enemy line, then hold it or fall back depending on the outcome. The attack will then be stalled until the enemy counter attack has been dealt with. (This is enforced through automatic execution for desertion should you remain outside the boundaries the game has set for too long.) These attacks are desperate sprints across no man's land; trying to avoid rifle and machinegun fire. Defense can be equally terrifying should smoke or gas cloud your vision, making it almost impossible to distinguish friend from foe in the trench, (though I will criticize the lack of friendly fire, which would have made these moments feel more tense.) It's not uncommon for matches to end in a draw. Overcoming an enemy position and holding it can be difficult indeed.  As for the other modes, there is a squad defense mode where a player squad fights off endless waves of progressively stronger bot attackers, in a way that invokes my memories of Call of Duty Zombies, but without turning the enemy into bullet sponges. Players can take more hits here without dying, and with only 4 players, the battles have much less lag relative to Verdun's massive 16v16 multiplayer modes. (i recommend a strong internet connection to play the game on ultra graphics, the way it was intended, but lower options exist of course.)  There's also a team deathmatch mode, which I haven't played much yet as I haven't played enough of the game to unlock a more suitable set-up. (It seems to be exactly what you'd expect; getting kills is the only thing that matters, so teamwork is less important here.) Overall, it feels a lot more stale than Frontlines. Finally, there is rifle-only deathmatch, which is another great mode for newer players to get more accustomed with the most common weapon-type in the game. It is here I must say Verdun's weapon diversity is one of its strongest pros, and a breath of fresh air considering so many gamers believed for so long, (and so many still do,) creating a fun shooter experience in a setting saturated with bolt-action rifles was impossible. Let me assure you now, Verdun did it. Weapons feel unique, and useful in their own ways.  The only con I can think of is the steep learning curve. Considering the setting was largely ignored by developers, and that the war itself happened over 100 years ago, WWI seems completely alien today. It comes as no surprise that players have a hard time adjusting then. Some light reading on how the real soldiers fought could help, and there is an official guide covering the game on the Steam forum. However, there doesn't seem to be any in-game tutorial to speak of, unless you count the slideshow of sorts when I started the game for the first time that did little but explain the most basic details, and lasted less than a minute.  Even so, Verdun surpassed my expectations. I thought it would more or less be a Red Orchestra 2 clone; realistic to the detriment of fun, but I've had way more fun playing this than I did RO2. Take it from a Call of Duty fan (before CoD lost its way.) If you like historically grounded shooters, this game manages to feel both authentic and fun to play. Also, at the price, ($12.50 for me thanks to the summer discount,) your wallet will thank you for all the DLC you won't have to buy.			"

												This is a fantastic game, and a unique one too. A realistic WWI PvP FPS game is very hard to come by, and Verdun captures the unforgiving nature of fighting trench warfare. Stand up for 3 seconds, and expect to die. I give this game a 10/10 for sure! Very well made and true to the weapons used at the time, not to mention the encouraged (because it's necessary) teamwork between squads and their NCOs. It may take some getting used to, but once you've played it for a bit and understand how to navigate the battlefield, it's truly an immersive play!			"

												A very intense multiplayer game based on the battle of Verdun which lasted for quite some time.  In Christmas Time, the game actually replicates what the soldiers did which was come out to No Man's Land and play soccer with one another (Allies and Axis) and trade gifts. The game itself is very deep with realistic ballistics of the guns. Also the soldiers (Both Axis and Entente) look authentic. The experience system makes you come back for more. The gameplay itself is straightforward as both teams attempt to takeover the other. The Entente (Allies) go against the Central (Axis) and both teams attack one another until one team has enough momentum to full on crush the other team. However, they can lose that momentum thus they become the hunted!If I had one complaint, it would be that sometimes, there are not enough people playing! Overall, I think everyone who has played Red Orchestra before will love this game and for those who are new to this type of shooter, I think you guys will enjoy it!Edit The devs have some how managed to compress this game into 3 gigabytes, 3! Kudos!			"

												Personally this is best WW1 game for me and i doubt BF1 will be better than Verdun for me. Reason is most of all immersion and atmosphere that this game creates especially when your whole team is attacking enemy trench (mostly more than half of us dies in that process). Devs are constantly bringing new updates and new content so i am glad that i bought a game where devs are so devoted. I would wish for better physics and 64 player servers (now its 32 max) but i LOVE this game even with these (minor) flaws.All glory to Kaiser and his Sturmpioneers! "

												All the fun of old Call of Duty and Medal of Honor Games wrapped up in a surprisingly fun and historically accurate FPS. There are more than your basic TDM and Free-for-all modes, it includes a cool, more real feeling capture mode where you must gain momentum storming trenches to move the frontline toward your enemy. Great fun, especially with friends.Edit (10/10/16): Last I checked this game is near dead, and one could expect it to be entirely dead once BF1 is out. :'(			"

								This game is like no other, the gameplay runs great, everyone uses bolt action rifles, with either a sniper scope fitted you are almost safe to stay in your trench sniping the enemy while you and your team defend yours. or fixed bayonettes. With this you have a buch longer melee range to stab the opposition, yelling ""OVER THE TOP"" as you rush towards the enemy trench. personally i like to charge into their trench and stab them all with it. I die easly but i usualy go down with 3 or 4 kills.10/10 would charge again			"

												Very fun game that gives a new perspective to the first great war and also a great innovation in the gaming community. It was a bold move to make a game where customizable load outs and spam fire are not an option. You really have to focus each shot and make it count in this game because 99.9% of the time you wont last more than a couple of minutes or run out of ammo. The times where you are invading a trench or defending one really gets your heart pumping because just around the corner there might be 1 or 5 guys waiting for you. All of the weapons are fair and balanced because each load out has its own pros and cons. I highly recommend this game especially if its only a couple of bucks.			"

												I will just tell you who reads this about how I feel about this whole game. I wont be talking about classes and how the game runs, just how it feels for me.So. You sit there in the trench, taking pot shots at the germans on the other side of the no mans land. Your whole squad around you, you got to know them over the training and battles you been in so far. You feel in your gut that sitting in this trench wont be and that you and your friends have to brave death once again.First its the French, the whistle is blown and they storm out of the trench shouting and swearing as machinegun fire and rifle fire destroys their advance. Only their bodies left in the mud. You take a deep breath and as your corporal blows the whistle you rush out from the trench and into no mans land. You run, screaming and shouting with the rest as members of other squads fall around you, luckily the bullets seem to evade just you. You throw yourself in a nearby ditch, picked by the corporal as a rally point. You turn around as see no other in your squad and you assume the worst. Steeling yourself you stand up and run into yet again. No mans land. "

												Dearest Wife of Mine,Today I sat in the fetal position in the middle of a dirty trench; rocking back and forth and crying while listening to my comrades scream in pain as they lay dying in a hole or somewhere else amidst no man's land. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Really though, I recommend this game. It's a historical FPS set in WWI that'll entertain you for quite a while.Sure, you'll be running through No Man's Land hoping you don't get shot or blown up while you try to get to the enemy trench, or you'll be defending your trench from the enemies...and hoping you don't get shot or blown up. But hey, look on the bright side! Even if you are bombarded by artillery, shot to death, blown up, burnt alive by a ""Wex"" flamethrower, gassed, cut up by barbwire while trying to escape or be sneaky, or shot while stuck on barbwire, you'll be able to return the favor! This game may be hard at first, but once you get used to it, you'll have a grand ol' time!So, if you're looking for a good FPS to buy, I recommend this one. Have fun going over the top!			"

												I first played Verdun when it was in its early stages, the only gameplay available was rifle death match. Even though I was not all too good, I loved the game. When I found it on Steam, getting it was a no brainer. I love this game even more now than I did then. However, this game is not for everyone. If you can't handle dying constantly then you have no business playing Verdun. In Verdun (at least for me) you are dead for just about as much time as you are alive. The weapons it this game are not ""Call of Duty"" type guns either, you can't just go in guns blazing or you will be dying A LOT. However, if you love WWI games or just games that feature fast paced trench warfare, then Verdun is the game for you. The maps are detailed and expansive, as well as difficult. With all this being said, I would strongly recommend that you get this game, it is very fun. If your not sure about whether or not you would like this game, I know YouTube has a good amount of gameplays and tutorials you can watch. I hope you get this game, and I hope to see you on the frontlines!			"

												French faction is in a game made by indie developers. DICE/EA Have millions but will put them for DLC. But honestly, this game is great. Sure at times it may be glitchy and clunky but my god, the gameplay is actually so much superior than battlefield/COD.... And its a ww1 game. There is more of an emphasis on flanking the enemy and lining up your shot with your bolt action rifle. Every bullet counts. You even have to look at the enemy's uniform to see if they are with you.The landscape,gore,sound effects and attention to detail for the era really highlight the horrors of the Battle of Verdun. Try to have a few friends with this game and enjoy. Yet this game appeals to many people- casuals, arma players and people in between and everyone seems to enjoy it. My fav game at the moment for sure			"

												If you're a fan of World War I or of squad based tactical gameplay in general, Verdun is definitely a game worth owning. It's a historically rooted game that display's the horrors of the First World War while allowing you to participate in the full scale battles that many of these men had fought through. Pros Real WWI Experience for fans of its history Fast paced gameplay in some areas while maintaining tactical gameplay at other times Intense combat for crazy in-game moments Good amount of classes, squads, weapons, and a variety of other things Maps that throw players into many different scenarios for new experiences Has Replay Value Cons Small server population sizes at certain times in the day Ping is high for many far from the source Spawnkilling WILL happen in many cases A lack of tutorial mode or of other better game modes other that Frontlines Squad setup and game finding is slightly frustrating at times No shortage of bugs and glitchesDespite the flaws that are pointed out, this game is still a good experience for those who are willing to play with friends and work together to achieve an ultimate goal as one. Would recommend.			"

								8.2/10+weapon and setting detail (simply amazing)+huge maps offer diverse gameplay+unique gameplay, never seen an fps quite like it+cool fx+If you stay with your squad amazing stuff can happen-weird animations on some occasions-no real incentive to stay with your squad at first-few maps (for now I guess)-potentially low frame rates-Lacks certain forms of realism (which I guess is due to everyone trying to play individually)Summary: This is a game intended for different types of people if you are looking for some realistic fps set in world war 1 then you may not get what you want, if you are searching for a completed game with tons of maps and a huge community your wishes might not be fulfilled. If you are looking for a balance of the two then you should buy Verdun asap. I believe that in most cases it is well worth your money. Lots of fun and the quality of the game is getting better by the week.			"

												This is a fantastic game, and a unique one too. A realistic WWI PvP FPS game is very hard to come by, and Verdun captures the unforgiving nature of fighting trench warfare. Stand up for 3 seconds, and expect to die. I give this game a 10/10 for sure! Very well made and true to the weapons used at the time, not to mention the encouraged (because it's necessary) teamwork between squads and their NCOs. It may take some getting used to, but once you've played it for a bit and understand how to navigate the battlefield, it's truly an immersive play!			"

Posted: July 2, 2016
												Verdun is a brutal experience. The reality of trench warfare is brought to life in vivid detail, from the obliterated landscape, to the murderous modern weapons, to the disorienting gas attacks since outlawed, everything about this game feels authentic to how a real WWI front-line engagement would have been fought, and it's awesome!  Verdun abandons the mindlessness of the twitch-shooter in favor of a more tactically-minded approach. Alone, you are quite under-powered, since the sluggish weapons mean you're likely to get yourself killed if you take on the enemy alone. Only with teamwork, by multiplying your force, can you hope to overcome the enemy. Thankfully, Verdun presents players with plenty of ways to do that.  In Frontlines, the game's flagship mode, the Entente and Central powers are divided into various squads of 4. Each squad is unique and each of the 4 squad members has a unique role. Oh, and if you were thinking of picking a weapon off someone dead, forget it. You're stuck with the weapons you have. It's easy to see how players with a more competitive mindset could take advantage of the potential strengths of various squads to create a strong all-around force.  All of that would be useless if the game mode weren't as well designed as it is. You will attack the enemy line, then hold it or fall back depending on the outcome. The attack will then be stalled until the enemy counter attack has been dealt with. (This is enforced through automatic execution for desertion should you remain outside the boundaries the game has set for too long.) These attacks are desperate sprints across no man's land; trying to avoid rifle and machinegun fire. Defense can be equally terrifying should smoke or gas cloud your vision, making it almost impossible to distinguish friend from foe in the trench, (though I will criticize the lack of friendly fire, which would have made these moments feel more tense.) It's not uncommon for matches to end in a draw. Overcoming an enemy position and holding it can be difficult indeed.  As for the other modes, there is a squad defense mode where a player squad fights off endless waves of progressively stronger bot attackers, in a way that invokes my memories of Call of Duty Zombies, but without turning the enemy into bullet sponges. Players can take more hits here without dying, and with only 4 players, the battles have much less lag relative to Verdun's massive 16v16 multiplayer modes. (i recommend a strong internet connection to play the game on ultra graphics, the way it was intended, but lower options exist of course.)  There's also a team deathmatch mode, which I haven't played much yet as I haven't played enough of the game to unlock a more suitable set-up. (It seems to be exactly what you'd expect; getting kills is the only thing that matters, so teamwork is less important here.) Overall, it feels a lot more stale than Frontlines. Finally, there is rifle-only deathmatch, which is another great mode for newer players to get more accustomed with the most common weapon-type in the game. It is here I must say Verdun's weapon diversity is one of its strongest pros, and a breath of fresh air considering so many gamers believed for so long, (and so many still do,) creating a fun shooter experience in a setting saturated with bolt-action rifles was impossible. Let me assure you now, Verdun did it. Weapons feel unique, and useful in their own ways.  The only con I can think of is the steep learning curve. Considering the setting was largely ignored by developers, and that the war itself happened over 100 years ago, WWI seems completely alien today. It comes as no surprise that players have a hard time adjusting then. Some light reading on how the real soldiers fought could help, and there is an official guide covering the game on the Steam forum. However, there doesn't seem to be any in-game tutorial to speak of, unless you count the slideshow of sorts when I started the game for the first time that did little but explain the most basic details, and lasted less than a minute.  Even so, Verdun surpassed my expectations. I thought it would more or less be a Red Orchestra 2 clone; realistic to the detriment of fun, but I've had way more fun playing this than I did RO2. Take it from a Call of Duty fan (before CoD lost its way.) If you like historically grounded shooters, this game manages to feel both authentic and fun to play. Also, at the price, ($12.50 for me thanks to the summer discount,) your wallet will thank you for all the DLC you won't have to buy.			"

There are times when servers are full (night) and empty (mid day)Overall i would recommend Verdun for most people, it is great for casual players, gunplay is incredibly solid, teamplay like no other game and can be very intense.

												This game is probably the best representation of WWI in a videogame in existance at the moment. Great maps, great trench layout, awesome authentic weaponry, and a great development team make this game a winner. This game also has free content updates with new squads, weapons, and maps being added every few months. The squad gameplay is awesome! Squads are split into 4 classes each with its own weapons and different playsyles like some have grenades, machine guns, and even can add a scope to their rifle and play as a sharpshooter (there is also standard weapons that you can use if you get attached to a specific weapon). You can rank squads and get different abilities and passive perks as you play with friends (as well as late war uniforms for your soldier). Each squad gets its own special call in abilites that the officer of each squad can use. Canadians and Stormtroopers can call in 4 different types of poison gas depending on squad level ranging from Chlorine gas all the way up to Mustard gas. Landser, Poilus, and Tommies get artillery strikes that become more powerful the higher the rank your squad is. Lastly the Alpenjager and Chasseurs are able to call in recon planes that reveal enemies underneath the planes path and at higher levels can become a precision bomb strike as well as a recon run.Trench warfare is where the game excels. It forces people to think tactically and not the run and gun mentality so many first person shooters force upon people these days (You can try but more times then not you're going to get killed). You will be crawling or sprinting across no mans land A LOT. Stopping in no mans land usually means instant death, unless hiding in one of the many ditches or craters strewn about. You will have to dodge bullets from enemy machine gunners and snipers, while at the same time praying the sharpshooters on your team can take out the enemy MG or sniper. Battles in the trenches are fantastic, with trench clearing and holding the trench from counterattack being the best part. Some squads like the Canadians and Stormtroopers are specialized in trench assault with some roles coming with melee weapons, tons of grenades, in the case for the Canadians a revolver with a bayonet attached, and for the Stormtroopers the MP18i SMG is available. Another effective tool for clearing out trenches is the bayonet and pistols become deadly in tenches between some with high stopping power and others with a faster fire rate. And don't forget about poison gas. When gas hits it becomes don your gasmask quickly or die. Gas will limit visibility in the trench and will result in close quarters and oftentimes hand to hand combat.I personally rate this game 10/10. For a small developing team to produce such a high quality game and to be able to produce new content for free every few months and to bring out performance patches every couple of weeks is aweome! This game is all about patience, precision, and to make the first shot count. Those who like Red Orchestra  will love this game. You will die, and when first starting out you will die a lot till you get used to the pace and tactics. Those who like Call of Duty and Battlefield, while the gameplay tries to deter a run and gun playstye, the game makes up with a killer action packed, bullets flying everwhere, explosions all over the place WWI experience that you will never forget.I highly recommend this game, its worth every penny!

												Verdun isn't quite finished yet but I definitely recommend it.  It's particularly good if you can get one or more friend to play with you- there is a mechanic that allows you to get bonuses to certain squads if you play with one or more friends.  They're going to add the Belgians and Americans soon, as well as a new map.  The devs add content at a decent rate and plan to continue releasing stuff for quite a while now too, so there will be more and more content as time goes on.  A must play with friends (four is the best number).			"

								Verdun is absolutely amazing for an alpha. The game demonstrates trench warfare perfectly, while the whistle blows I'd hop over the trench and charge the enemy under machine gun fire. Once in the trench, the enemy would drop gas and I'd put my gas mask on. Then my squad and I would take the trench and prepare to charge for the next one. It makes me feel like I'm actually there. This game is entirley unique because, sadly, there are barely any fps set in WW1 out right now. Some cons about the game are the fps. I have a high-end gaming rig and I still manage to get 20-40 fps depending on the map. I know this is still in alpha but I'd like it fixed. Some things I'd like to see in the game are aerial dogfights, and more gore. I think it would look awesome to look up and see planes firing at eachother. But I would definetly like to see more blood and gore the most. It would be more immersive to be pinned down in a blood filled with guts flying everywhere, considering how brutal and rutheless WW1 was. Overall, I do recommend this game in it's current state. I'm sure the devs will fix the fps issue and add more content later on. I rate 8/10.			"

												Alright, here goes another review.I like this game. It is immersive, besides a few glitches here and there, but still pretty cool. I am going to steer clear of the word simulator though.The variations of squads is cool. You have squads for punching through the line, squads for recon, squads for clearing out the trenches. Along with these squads comes with a variation of rifles, pistols, grenades, and equipment. Some of these squads also have Machine gun units as well as Sub Machine gun units. Very nice.The uniforms are nice too. They look worn just as they would after a battle.Although this game is pretty good, it is no where near perfect. In fact, it almost seemes like the devs abandoned the PC version of this game and went in search for gold in the new world of next gen consoles. I'm not sure if I can entirely recomend this game for PC but it seems okay for the next gen. Keep in mind, this is my opinion, and I think the game is good. If you enjoy war games that immerse you as this one does, then you should get it, though I would recomend geting it on a sale. Hope I catch you in game!			"

								Verdun. A game that describes the first World War, this is a truly amazing game even though its in beta, this is definitely a game worth you´r money when its on sale and when its on its base price, the battles moving from the Fields of Flanders, Picardie, to the forests of Argoness, attacking and defending on the map from you´r trenches to the enemy, this game has smartly implented combat like in World War 1, on the maps there´re muiltple layers of defense line with cordinated defense making it almost impenetrable. i recommend this game anyone who like realistic first person shooters what requirs teamwork and good cordination, this is surely a great game for anyone who likes both World Wars, the negative things are not many in my opinion, this game is definitely misssing a report button as i saw people with numerious buthurt comments, also a clan option would be nice as this is a game about teamwork, the prone and crouch movements should be lowerd as it more feels like a cod game with the movements, this is overall a great game and i give personly 8,5/10 from what the beta already has to offer8,5/10 a good game i you have money to spare			"

								Sitting in my trench listening to everyone yelling at each other, hearing shot's land too close to my position I move down the line. Next thing I know chlorine gas explodes on my positon and i hear the pitter patter of at least a squad of men coming towards my position. I slip on my gas mask while listening to my squad get wiped out, out of nowhere two whole squads of germans coming charging in down the trench with their mace's and bayonet's swinging away. I yell holy ♥♥♥♥ and proceed to run away while hip firing my Lewis gun at the charging Schnitzel's, as i start to change my magazine while still being chased I realised I had loss track of two of the charging men and then out of nowhere two German's coming flying into the trench in front of me and proceed to bash my skull in with their maces.10/10 would be slaughtered again			"

												Charging an enemy trench with my stormtrooper squad; Lewis gun rifle rounds whistle  past me and hit one of my comrades and he goes down. The sounds of him choking on his own blood resound out behind me as the last three of us jump over the top of the enemy trench, landing behind the Lewis gunner who had to stop and reload. The first man in bayonets the gunner and kills him, his lifeless body falling to the dirt, groans of pain following. Shots ring out from down the trench as two brits open up with their Enfield,  my two team mates go down, blood shoots from their chests as the rounds make impact. I charge over their writhing groaning bodies and open up with my mp 18/i, closing the gap to render their rifles useless. I empty my 32 round snail drum spraying from the hip and watch the two soldiers drop. I reload and get to the top of the parapet just in time to see two french squads charging towards me to retake the trench. I take aim an fire.10/10 would get PTSD again.This new update completes the game. Get it now.			"

												This game...is great...if you don't mind a bit of out of date firepower and overload in rifles then this is the game for you. This game offers a lot and i think the devs put a lot of hard work into it as there is a history for this game. The game is only multiplayer but that's the fun of it as you cant play trench warfare on your own. The maps are some of the most detailed Ive ever seen and the amount of guns at your disposal is insane. The game is truly amazing, there is 4 different modes at the moment... front lines/attrition/rifle deathmatch/ and Coop survival. Though in the future i hope they add more. There is a wide range of squads from 5 different nations. If you get 3 other friends to play with and work as a team, you will find yourselves winning alot if your team also does the same. Teamwork is whats grants victory. However running rambo with a flamethrower and be a blast as well. If you love history and have a soft spot for WW1 then i strongly think the money you have is worth giving for this game. "

I crawl throgh muck and mud until I get to the other trench. I see the machine gun that shoot most of my comrades and I shoot it dead.

												Verdun is the perfect WWI simulator.My most memorable game was a battle that was going poorly in Ypres for the Entente. They were pushed back to their final defensive line with the Central Powers practically dominating the field. The Entente barely survived what should have been The Central Powers' final push to victory and were given the opportunity to counter attack. And then something just... Happened.The Entente's counter attack was aggressive and unwavering. Their morale bolstered a thousand fold with nothing left to lose. After resecuring the Support Trench, the Central Powers were unable to keep the Entente at bay, being pushed further and further back, right into their inital trench line, the score dead even with a 3 to 3 ratio. Both sides reorganized themselves and ready to break the tied game!And then time ran out and eneded in a draw. Hundereds of men dead for aboslutely no gains. 10/10.			"

												Verdun is in general a good game to pick up. First of all, there are not many FPS in WW1 setting: Verdun is the first to do this. The gameplay is really realistic, more than Red Orchestra but less than Insurgency. In contrary of what many people think, Verdun offers a variety of weapons: more bolt-action than automatic. However, the game is clunky and I feel more like playing an unfinished project: AI navigation, Hand-to-Hand combat, animations aren't smooth at all. There are only four game modes, which is due to its realism feature: it needs to add a casual mode with gametypes like CTF or SND. To conclude, I would give this 8/10, due to the lack of smoothiness, but still recommend Verdun to others.			"

												Although I have only played this game for a little bit, THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS. The trenches feel so alive and the secnes although horrific are breathtaking (literally because you might be in the gas). I absouletly reccomend this game it is alot of fun. If you cannot wait for BF1 and need a game to satisfy the splendors of WWI and trench warfare this is your game. SOmetimes it might feel like people are cheating because you peek through a hole and boom you're done, that is not the case, I've caught people trough crevisis and trust me it is really rewarding. Long distant shots are difficult to make but not impossible also rewarding. If you like running and gunning you will be shot down instantly. This game you must have patience and prepare to hid in a ditch like a scared dog because bullets are flying anywhere. This game stays true to its form as basically everything is a one shot.			"

												Verdun is a great game that hits that sweet spot between realism and annoying ease. The squad system makes the game unique and encourages you to build relationships with the people you're playing with. Unlike most FPS games, there's a lot of patience and tactics that go into attacking AND defending, and if you don't like to wait around, you may not like this game. However, if you have a group of friends who enjoys squad play, this is a great game to get.The biggest downside to the game is the lack of player base; I would also like to see some different game modes, and I hope to see those in the future. At $22, it's a fair price. On sale, it's a steal.			"

												I first played Verdun when it was in its early stages, the only gameplay available was rifle death match. Even though I was not all too good, I loved the game. When I found it on Steam, getting it was a no brainer. I love this game even more now than I did then. However, this game is not for everyone. If you can't handle dying constantly then you have no business playing Verdun. In Verdun (at least for me) you are dead for just about as much time as you are alive. The weapons it this game are not ""Call of Duty"" type guns either, you can't just go in guns blazing or you will be dying A LOT. However, if you love WWI games or just games that feature fast paced trench warfare, then Verdun is the game for you. The maps are detailed and expansive, as well as difficult. With all this being said, I would strongly recommend that you get this game, it is very fun. If your not sure about whether or not you would like this game, I know YouTube has a good amount of gameplays and tutorials you can watch. I hope you get this game, and I hope to see you on the frontlines!			"

												Verdun is in general a good game to pick up. First of all, there are not many FPS in WW1 setting: Verdun is the first to do this. The gameplay is really realistic, more than Red Orchestra but less than Insurgency. In contrary of what many people think, Verdun offers a variety of weapons: more bolt-action than automatic. However, the game is clunky and I feel more like playing an unfinished project: AI navigation, Hand-to-Hand combat, animations aren't smooth at all. There are only four game modes, which is due to its realism feature: it needs to add a casual mode with gametypes like CTF or SND.

HighlightsOne of the most intense and realistic FPS set in an historical era, in this case the unexplored World War I. It has the perfect combination of realism and acion, giving us something close to Red Orchestra. It features big maps inspired by historical battlefields, a good amount of weapons, and a lot of different squads, each one with 4 soldiers with their unique habilities.Pros:-Realistic, and an extreme attention to details-Immersive (among the best voice acting I've ever seen)-Good variety of weapons, squads, maps...Cons:-It's really hard to get used to this game. One hit kills, and it can lead to frustration-The squad exp system is interesting, but punishes solo players (a little bit)			"

												Although I've only played 9 or so hours at the time of me writing this review, I can confidently say that this is one of the best FPS games that I've ever played.In my eyes, it is only matched by games like Insurgency.  Other than that not many other games come close to the immersiveness and inventiveness that this game brings to the table.As an amateur historian and lover of all things war history, it is really refreshing to see a very well done video game about WW1.  To take that point even further, it is great to see a WW1 game be done with incredible historical accuracy, unlike a certain AAA title that is coming out in a few months...From a technical standpoint, I'm playing this game on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop, and I can still get decent framerates and nice textures.  So I would have to say that it is well optimized.  I have yet to come across any technical difficulties as well.  No glitches or bugs.I would also like to add that the community is very nice and welcoming.  Everyone is a team player.  No trolls or asshats.  Everyone is immersed in the game and makes it a nice experience.Dim the lights, put on a good pair of headphones, and prepair yourself mentally to get PTSD from this realistic depiction of war that seemingly lives up to, and pays rememberence by simply existing to a collossal point in history.9.5/10			"

								Excellent and unique multiplayer fps experience. Slow rate of fire weapons, no vehicles or crazy perks, high lethality and minimalistic UI.Rushed through no-mans-land, crater to crater, allies dropping all around me. Shot a man in the trenches from a crater, had an HMG fire at me, took cover, waited a while, peeked over. Got shot at again but saw where from, dropped back into the trench and waited slightly longer, peeked over, shot him and ran to the trenches. Made it to the edge of the trench, allies comming up too now, got hit by an allied gas bomb aimed at trench. Frantically put on gas mask, decided to use the cover of the gas to storm the trench, made it over with 3 others, cleared out a few people and held the trench waiting for reinforcements.Never have I played an fps that felt like that, it was truly different from my experience of CoD/BF etc shooters.

												Ok. I think with my time in this game I can write an honest review. For starters with the latest update, the game has improved. It's got a fresh look and feel. Not to mention its super epic with all the gore. Yes there are bugs, as with any game under an indie developer. Just give it a chance, the team is small and super dedicated to their cause so the problems wont last long. Give it a try, support the devs and this game will soar.Pros:- Various battlefields modelled after real areas- Lots of guns.-Gore. (looks nice could use some more tweaking)-Fun gameplay, super fun with friends)Cons:-Somewhat buggy. (they will be ironed out)The occasional toxic player (not really a con just ignore them)Not every nation is in the game yet. They have quite a few and more planned probably in the future to come)TL:DR Try the damn game. Is fun.			"

												You can capture them with easeeeee all you need is just a little limburger cheeseeee Been on this game since it was 6 bucks after it first came out on steam.  Thanks to you goons I've been searching local pawn and gun stores for a G98 and a full size Berthier.  This game's atmosphere is SPOT ON.  Uniforms and weapons are SPOT ON.  Verdun is geared more towards realism, but it's not enough to drive anyone away.  A history nut like myself can drink this game by the liter.........The developers are doing a fine job, I'd buy another pre release game from them if it was a historical shooter.  This game is WORTH IT.			"

												Verdun is a very fun objective based shooter. You battle through the trenches, attacking or defending based on your teams momentum. If as an attacker you manage to push into a forward trench and hold it, then the enemy will be forced to retreat to a further back trench. While advancing or retreating you may find yourself in no man's land, where explosions and gunfire tend to tear you apart, but it's still exciting when you survive. There is a good mixture of camping and rushing, due to the offense and defense phases.The classes are predefined, so you can't use whatever weapons you want. They are locked to different squad types, and to the different classes within those squad types. For example, a squad leader might only have a pistol, but they also have he ability to call in an artillery strike which can make the difference between holding objectives or not. I personally think it's a good move to have weapons locked to classes, because that eliminates the possibility for everyone to just use machine guns. It allows for a good variety of weaponry on the battlefield, and gives use to the squads.It's by no means perfect, and there are really annoying querks like not being able to shoot through barbed wire that happen at times, but overall it's highly enjoyable. Patches come out frequently, and it really feels like the developers are doing/want to do the best they can with it. I certainly recommend it, especially if you have a group of friends you can squad up with.			"

												Although I've only played 9 or so hours at the time of me writing this review, I can confidently say that this is one of the best FPS games that I've ever played.In my eyes, it is only matched by games like Insurgency.  Other than that not many other games come close to the immersiveness and inventiveness that this game brings to the table.As an amateur historian and lover of all things war history, it is really refreshing to see a very well done video game about WW1.  To take that point even further, it is great to see a WW1 game be done with incredible historical accuracy, unlike a certain AAA title that is coming out in a few months...From a technical standpoint, I'm playing this game on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop, and I can still get decent framerates and nice textures.  So I would have to say that it is well optimized.  I have yet to come across any technical difficulties as well.  No glitches or bugs.I would also like to add that the community is very nice and welcoming.  Everyone is a team player.  No trolls or asshats.  Everyone is immersed in the game and makes it a nice experience.Dim the lights, put on a good pair of headphones, and prepair yourself mentally to get PTSD from this realistic depiction of war that seemingly lives up to, and pays rememberence by simply existing to a collossal point in history.9.5/10			"

												Verdun is a very fun objective based shooter. You battle through the trenches, attacking or defending based on your teams momentum. If as an attacker you manage to push into a forward trench and hold it, then the enemy will be forced to retreat to a further back trench. While advancing or retreating you may find yourself in no man's land, where explosions and gunfire tend to tear you apart, but it's still exciting when you survive. There is a good mixture of camping and rushing, due to the offense and defense phases.The classes are predefined, so you can't use whatever weapons you want. They are locked to different squad types, and to the different classes within those squad types. For example, a squad leader might only have a pistol, but they also have he ability to call in an artillery strike which can make the difference between holding objectives or not. I personally think it's a good move to have weapons locked to classes, because that eliminates the possibility for everyone to just use machine guns. It allows for a good variety of weaponry on the battlefield, and gives use to the squads.It's by no means perfect, and there are really annoying querks like not being able to shoot through barbed wire that happen at times, but overall it's highly enjoyable. Patches come out frequently, and it really feels like the developers are doing/want to do the best they can with it. I certainly recommend it, especially if you have a group of friends you can squad up with.			"

								Basically loving the game having played 174 hours at this stage.....but don't tell anyone.Really appreciate the on-going support and interest provided by the developers.Have come from a COD gaming background but 'they' have lost their way....very disappointing.With Verdun i've really enjoyed that it wasn't easy from the start and ranking up, hours put in, are rewarded.Seems their are no hackers which is refreshing....limited bunny hoppers....applaud aim down sights being rewarding etc....old school HC gamer :)Graphics and audio are very pleasing.After release i hope there is continued support including some new maps....Would love to see more than one AUS server too....maybe different some how.Have already recommended this game to many and will continue to do so....keep it up!Thanks for many hours of gaming fun.

								Sitting in my trench listening to everyone yelling at each other, hearing shot's land too close to my position I move down the line. Next thing I know chlorine gas explodes on my positon and i hear the pitter patter of at least a squad of men coming towards my position. I slip on my gas mask while listening to my squad get wiped out, out of nowhere two whole squads of germans coming charging in down the trench with their mace's and bayonet's swinging away. I yell holy ♥♥♥♥ and proceed to run away while hip firing my Lewis gun at the charging Schnitzel's, as i start to change my magazine while still being chased I realised I had loss track of two of the charging men and then out of nowhere two German's coming flying into the trench in front of me and proceed to bash my skull in with their maces.10/10 would be slaughtered again			"

												This shows the true gunfights of World War I, unlike Battlefield 1, which is full of intense action with guns that existed on blueprints,  Verdun's gunfights can be slow or fast.   This game should be more popular than Call of Duty Infinite Warfare.  10/10			"

												Five of us stormed the trench. I threw myself to the floor under a volley of rifle fire, my team dropping like flies all around me. ""GAS!"" I pulled my mask over my face and wildly fired my pistol into the green fog, into silence. I frantically tried to reload, unsure whether the combatant was doing the same, or I had managed to kill them. Then, through the green nebulous haze came a mechanical whine, a tall figure emerged, the expressionless gas mask veiled by the gas. It was the last thing I saw before the orange flames engulfed everything. ""You have been killed by Adolf Hitler"".This is without a doubt the single best shooter I've ever played. The gameplay is tense, the action immesnse. In a single game you can go from intense firefights, to silently stalking the trenches in a terrifying life-or-death version of hide-and-seek. The atmosphere is on point, and the maps well-designed. If you're on the fence, then I would say 100% go for it, you won't be disappointed.			"

												Charging an enemy trench with my stormtrooper squad; Lewis gun rifle rounds whistle  past me and hit one of my comrades and he goes down. The sounds of him choking on his own blood resound out behind me as the last three of us jump over the top of the enemy trench, landing behind the Lewis gunner who had to stop and reload. The first man in bayonets the gunner and kills him, his lifeless body falling to the dirt, groans of pain following. Shots ring out from down the trench as two brits open up with their Enfield,  my two team mates go down, blood shoots from their chests as the rounds make impact. I charge over their writhing groaning bodies and open up with my mp 18/i, closing the gap to render their rifles useless. I empty my 32 round snail drum spraying from the hip and watch the two soldiers drop. I reload and get to the top of the parapet just in time to see two french squads charging towards me to retake the trench. I take aim an fire.10/10 would get PTSD again.This new update completes the game. Get it now.			"

												This game...is great...if you don't mind a bit of out of date firepower and overload in rifles then this is the game for you. This game offers a lot and i think the devs put a lot of hard work into it as there is a history for this game. The game is only multiplayer but that's the fun of it as you cant play trench warfare on your own. The maps are some of the most detailed Ive ever seen and the amount of guns at your disposal is insane. The game is truly amazing, there is 4 different modes at the moment... front lines/attrition/rifle deathmatch/ and Coop survival. Though in the future i hope they add more. There is a wide range of squads from 5 different nations. If you get 3 other friends to play with and work as a team, you will find yourselves winning alot if your team also does the same. Teamwork is whats grants victory. However running rambo with a flamethrower and be a blast as well. If you love history and have a soft spot for WW1 then i strongly think the money you have is worth giving for this game. "

Thanks to you goons I've been searching local pawn and gun stores for a G98 and a full size Berthier.  This game's atmosphere is SPOT ON.  Uniforms and weapons are SPOT ON.  Verdun is geared more towards realism, but it's not enough to drive anyone away.  A history nut like myself can drink this game by the liter.........The developers are doing a fine job, I'd buy another pre release game from them if it was a historical shooter.

												Verdun is an immensely fun game with a dedicated and friendly playerbase. The graphics are beautiful and the maps and trenches are very detailed. The game runs surprisingly well on a middle-aged Macbook Air not at all designed for gaming. There are very few to zero hackers, I don't know why one of the other reviews says there are. There is a bit of a learning curve and you will die a lot during your first games (keep your head down!) but a bit of patience will take you a long way and give you hours of fun.Recommended if you like:Tactical Squad Based ShootersA Great Visual AtmosphereWW1 HistoryTeamworkWould not recommend if you want:Driveable vehicles.A deathmatch style of gameplay. There are team deathmatch and free for all modes but they are not played as much by the playerbase.			"

												There is a sore lack of authenticity in video gaming. Major game companies want to focus on creating 'fun experiences' more than experiences that might last with you. Verdun is one of the latter. It sits comfortably in the vein of games like Red Orchestra or Insurgency, but shifted into a WWI trench environment. It bends slightly toward realism. On defense, you will find yourself picking off incoming dots on the horizon, sitting comfortably in your trench. The anxiety builds as a few enemies slip through your lines and begin setting up seige lanes at the flanks. Anxiety turns to full blown panic as enemy raiders begin running through murdering your teammates with semi-automatic pistol fire, sometimes accompanied by grenades or in rare cases SMGs or Flamethrowers. You engage in frantic close quarters combat against a crazed enemy, and lets say you make it through. Your lines survive and you manage to repel the invaders. Well, now YOU have to attack. You will run through machine gun fire and crawl through craters as your team tries to drop gas on the enemy. If you manage to make it through the hail of metal, you don your gas mask and sharpen your bayonet before jumping into the enemy trench. You shoot one or two men in the back, before one turns to face you. You stab him and he screams as he falls. He continues to scream. He's still screaming when you are shot in the neck running through the trench. You never saw it coming. You are bleeding out on the floor of a muddy wooden trench of France's most godforsaken hellhole. You hear your own screams as the camera pans out to look over the trench. There are limbs being blown off by mortar fire as torsos fly through the air. You respawn. Time to do it all again.			"

												I finally made it into the enemies trench, after running through a no man's land filled with gunfire, explosions and imminent death. Me and the few soldiers that made it into the trench now are  highground, the enemies main trench is below us, connected through a narrow path. I put my mashine gun on top of a small sandbag barricade and open fire on the enemy below us. They seek cover first and then shoot back, willing to drive us out of their trench. It's no use, their blue helmet make good targets along the dark mud and moldy planks, and they drop dead within seconds. My comrades start charging forward. I stay behind, giving them cover if needed. They run down, making it into the main trench without resistance. I wait a few seconds, then decide to catch up to them, as there are no targets for me anymore. I put my mashine gun aside, and instead take out my Luger. I start running down, my comrades in sight. Suddenly, I hear several shots and see my allies falling to the ground. Alerted, I stop moving and aim my luger around nervously. A french soldier suddenly runs past me. He notices me too late, I give off three shots in his direction, two shots hit him in the chest and he drops to the floor. ""Five shots left in the magazine"", I think, just before another enemy soldier comes from the other side, his rifle aimed straight at me. I panic, and empty the rest of my magazine in his direction, while he fires his rifle at me. I manage to hit im in the arm once, his shot luckily misses me. He takes cover again. I't dawns on me that my magazine is empty, and that he come out of his cover any second to finish the job. I head back, going up the path I came from as fast as I can. The path is narrow and small, there's no way he will miss this shot. Suddenly, I hear the sound of a german rifle next to me. Another soldier must have made it through the no man's land while our enemy was too busy fighting us off. I see my chance and run back to the hillside fortification while the enemy seeks cover from the rifle fire of my comrade. I make myself as small as I can, and try toreload, hands still shaking. I once again hear rifle fire, and see how my comrade makes his way back into our small sanctuary. I don't know if he managed to kill him or not, but at that point I don't even care anymore. I grab a magazine and put it into my Luger, when suddely a french soldier jumps in from above and stabs his bayonet right into the chest of my saviour. The magazine is in place, and I pull back the lock to avenge my fallen comrade, but it's too late: The soldier runs toward me, and before I can pull the trigger, he stabs his bayonet in my chest.Probably the most intense shooter I've ever played, 10/10 would get stabbed during reloading again.

												Back in Beta the Snipers weren't ever a problem, but now there's too many people equipping that scope, and going to town on anyone that's defending, from all the way on the other side of the battlefield, this means that on the bigger or more open maps, (Picardie and Aisne) It's almost impossible to stick your head above ground level for more than five seconds without losing it, this is GREAT Historical Accuracy, but is still extremely annoying.

												Great game. Intense 1st person shooter that explores the all horrors of real warfare. I've had this game since beta and have not been disappointed. Of course there are games where you can hardly make it out of your own trench without being slaughtered, but you will find that in every shooter out there. It's best to play with friends, because you can level up your squad and have better chances at fighting off your enemy. Servers always have a few matches going and during peak hours over 20 games will be going. Lobby of 32 players, in squads of four with a decent variety of squads.			"

												Dearest Wife of Mine,Today I sat in the fetal position in the middle of a dirty trench; rocking back and forth and crying while listening to my comrades scream in pain as they lay dying in a hole or somewhere else amidst no man's land. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Really though, I recommend this game. It's a historical FPS set in WWI that'll entertain you for quite a while.Sure, you'll be running through No Man's Land hoping you don't get shot or blown up while you try to get to the enemy trench, or you'll be defending your trench from the enemies...and hoping you don't get shot or blown up. But hey, look on the bright side! Even if you are bombarded by artillery, shot to death, blown up, burnt alive by a ""Wex"" flamethrower, gassed, cut up by barbwire while trying to escape or be sneaky, or shot while stuck on barbwire, you'll be able to return the favor! This game may be hard at first, but once you get used to it, you'll have a grand ol' time!So, if you're looking for a good FPS to buy, I recommend this one. Have fun going over the top!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is FANTASTIC. That's not an understatement! It's a squad-based FPS that takes place in the trenches, with many dynamic maps. Not as many maps as I'd like, but i know that they will come out with more maps soon! There are 4 different classes per squad-type. First one is Corporal (at least that's what it is in English!), second one is along the lines of a sniper, third is a Heavy-Gunner (machine gun) and fourth is the dude with the grenades! BOOM! As of now, you can choose to play as Canada, Great Britain, France, and Germany. The countries each have their own weapons and specialties. The devs never cease to amaze me!Hope this review helped,Mega			"

												Gonna be 100% honest, This one of if not the The Best FPS I have ever played. It has the imerssion of a hardcore game, but also slightly arcady so that it isnt that slow paced (besides that one map called flanders).  The Devs of verdun almost always listen to the suggestions that we throw at them even though the team is really god dam small. but the best part is the community, on most games that are hard to get into have a fairly or really toxic community,   *cough* counterstrike *cough*  but the verdun community on the other hand is almost always willing to help you if you have a problem or if you just want to makes some friends. Notes/Tips Get a computer that has a good CPU or else it will explode Learning the maps is the best way to get good at verdun Kills dont matter so much if you want to win the game, but doing the objective is Shoot, crouch, bolt, stand up, repreat Dont stand in the middle of nomansland, youll get shot to bits (especially if you have gore on) Don't be rude and saying stuff like EZ Use your inner  Elan [www.worldwar1.com] to save the day! Always say ""gg"" at the end of a round Have fun!So in my opinion Verdun is a Must Buy so get it now!if you really can't stand it you can always get a refund since it's now a thing.see you in the trenches!

												As the title says Verdun is a game set in WW1 Between the years of 1914-1918, I enjoy this game not only for its impressive historical accuracy and theme but also for what the game has to offer gameplay wise.Gameplay wise the gunplay is a more advanced system than the average FPS today. It relys on a slightly more advanced aiming system similar to that of Red Orchestra, bullet drop physics are present so accounting for bullet drop is a nice touch of realism, overall the mostly rifle based combat just feels weighty and satisfying when you crack off that longshot and headshot someone from across the trenchlines.Progression wise there is alot to unlock, squads offer a very nice diversity to the game, each squad you can level individually and get special perks for doing so. (My favorite being that the uniforms slowly change as you level up your squad from their 1914 versions all the way up to how soldiers looked in those types of squads by 1918, all historically accurate. A small thing, but a really cool thing to me as a history nerd.)Individual progression is as simple as gaining points to unlock a new rank, new ranks unlock new classes and subclasses (Although you have to spend career points to unlock them) Each class and subclass has a unique twist on it in relation to the squad type which is very nice to help keep the gameplay fresh.Overall I thoroughly enjoy this game, when I went into it thinking I was going to find a backwater early access title with lackluster FPS mechanics, but Verdun is different and for that I am thankful. Now it is a fully released title with wonderfully dedicated developers (Who mind you during access, usually had updates EVERY 3 DAYS. Which is insane.) who are continuing to work on this game. They plan to release multiple FREE DLC packs that will add even more content to the game ranging from weapons and maps, to new squads and game modes. I'm fully confident in the Verdun team to deliver more great content to an already outstanding game, and for you this gives only more reason to buy it now.Support this team, support this game, they truely deserve it. Verdun is one of my favorite titles of this year and I wish for many more people to know about this game, because it deserves it.			"

												This game is pretty good overall for what I have played.  If you are looking for a high speed twitch shooter then this game isn't for you.  That said it has plenty of action, a good mix of strategy, detailed maps, and a fun squad based system.  That said, you definitely want to bring your friends for this one, being in a squad with people you play well with will increase the enjoyment of this game immensely since so much revolves around the squad gameplay.  Rough around the edges, but solid at its core Verdun is a game I feels bring some freshness to the otherwise stale modern FPS genre and will keep playing it well into the future.			"

												This game is by far the most realistic game ive played in a while, which sets it apart from other shooters. You are defending your trench against all odds or pushing in no-mans land to attack the enemy's trenches with artillery and gunfire whizzing past you. There are 12 different squads to choose from, with each squad having 4 classes. These classes are all important and all have different weapons and roles to fullfil. This game is extremely challenging, and most of the time you don't know where you are getting shot from. That makes the game even more rewarding. If you are willing to push through all the hard when you first get the game, it will be one of the most fun things you have ever played.			"

Verdun RevisitedMy initial review was pretty sparse on details, plus the game has been updated and added to so much since that I decided to re-review.Verdun is a realistic World War I multi-player first-person shooter trench-warfare simulator (Whew!). You either play as Entente Powers (French, English, Canadian, Belgian, and American) or as Central Powers (German). As of this review, there are four game modes:1) Rifle Deathmatch: Free for all, rifles only, no teams. New players start here, as all weapons except for one rifle are locked at the beginning of your Verdun career. You have to earn career points to unlock weapons, and you earn career points by doing well in matches.2) Attrition Full-Arsenal Team Deathmatch: Play on a team as either the Entente or Central powers. Choose a primary & secondary weapon from a variety of authentic weapons used at the Western Front. It's important to note that these weapons are locked to new players. Again, you use career points to unlock weapons.3) Squad Defence Co-operative Wave defence: Basically a practice mode for Frontlines. Play in a squad of one to four players against endless waves of AI bots. You can still gain XP, medals, and unlock weapons and achievements in this mode.4) Frontlines Squad Based Trench Warfare: The most complex game mode. I recommend getting experienced in all other modes before even attempting this one. Play in a squad of up to four players as either the Entente or Central powers against other squads. Capture trenchlines and defend trechlines. Teamwork and communication are very important when playing Frontlines.PROS: -Realistic: One shot, one kill with rifles. Bullet drop at long ranges. You have to lead moving targets, expecially at distance. There are suppression/shellshock effects (vision and hearing partially goes out, and you can hear your heart pounding). -Authentic WWI Weapons: Gas, trench melee weapons, flame throwers, artillery barrages, and of course machine guns to name a few.-Authentic WWI Battlefield Maps: There are nine total maps at the time of this review: Vauquois (only available in Rifle DM and Attrition), Vosges, Douaumont, Argonne, Champagne (Night), Aisne, Picardie, Artois, and Flanders.-Gore Mode: A gore option was added in the last major update (which is off by default). Burnt bodies, limbs blown off, caved-in heads, lotsa blood, etc.-Immersive Sound: Great sound effects, making the game all the more immersive. Sometimes when a player is killed, he'll lay there screaming and writhing in agony for what seems like minutes. Quite demoralizing! (Gore mode must be on).-Great Community: Compared to other multi-player games I've played, Verdun has a really good community. Most experienced players are friendly and will offer advice to new players if asked.-Developers Are Very Active: Devs are constantly improving, tweaking, adding to, etc.-The Only WWI FPS Currently: ""Currently"" because I just found out that Battlefield 1 is set in WWI, and will be coming out soon. I don't count NecroVision because, well, if you've played it or even seen the store page, you'd understand.CONS:-No Friendly Fire: For such an otherwise realistic game, this is something that really needs to be added.-Default Keyboard/Mouse Layout: You'll save yourself a lot of aggravation if you modify your keyboard/mouse layout for at least melee before playing. Also, you may want to change the crouch and prone keys.-Difficult For New Players: There isn't an in-game tutorial, but there are helpful guides and gameplay videos, as well as a spectator mode in-game.-Glitches/Bugs: There are definitely some issues, rarely something happens that breaks a match. I have had to exit and restart the game a few times due to glitches though.-Multi-Player Only: This game is really built for multi-player. If the devs did make a single-player campaign, it would probably be similar to Red Orchestra 2 single-player - separate from the multi-player game, and not much fun.-Small Community: Weekends are the best times to play on the US server. Any other time, & all you'll be able to play is Frontlines and Squad Defence.BOTTOM LINE:I highly recommend Verdun. It's a frustrating learning experience at first, but stick with it. When you get good at this game, it's a lot of fun! See you in the trenches!****Original Review Below****Great WWI game! If you like to snipe without a scope, this is the game for you! I've played 5-6 times as of this review, & it's a blast! Devs are CONSTANTLY upgrading/updating. For a beta, it already feels like a finished game.			"

												Take the excellent shooting mechanics that Call of Duty developed over a decade, add a dash of realism, the crisp graphics of this year's latest shooter, and base it around a game where team work and cooperation is vital and you have Verdun.This generation's answer to the big-budget, big explosion shooter, Verdun goes back to the roots of historical shooters by offering dozens of period accurate bolt-action rifles and cutting back on the pyro-technics and kill streaks. Verdun isn't without its explosions though as every new player will find out when they are on the receiving end of a massive creeping artillery barrage that forces them to hug the dirt and claw over thier squadmates to find a safe place to hide.Being historically based this game focuses less on team balancing, certain nations just have benefits. The allies will have a better time being on the receiving end of a gas attack as their masks have large single pane lenses, while the German's are forced to use lenses held together by solder, obscuring vision even more. However, the Allies, often have rifles and machine guns that lagged behind some of the cutting edge weaponry of the Germans (including flamethrowers, box fed machineguns, and a high-caliber anti-tank rifle).My personal favourite ascpect of the game is the reliance on teamwork, you wiil actually get to know people you play with. Kill/death ratio amount for such a small amount of the score that they are almost irrelevant. A player can have almost no kills but be the highest scoring player in the match because they supported thier team and took the most ground.If you want a shooter with great graphics and sound, historical accuracy (for a game), and are looking for a cooperative experience, this is for you.

TLDR Version:Great gameplay despite questionable stuttery gameplay at times. Not perfect, but still a game that is worth your time.Proper version:First of all: Why do I even write this review? I feel like it's important to mention it first. It's a very simple reason. After playing for a while and taking a break, the game asked me if I liked it, and if yes if I'd write a review on steam. So following the orders showing up on my screen, I now am here, writing this.I won't go over what Verdun is as you simply can read that a bit above the reviews, I don't need to repeat what is written there. Instead this will reflect my thoughts on it.World War 1 for me personally always has been a very interesting topic, and unlike many others I find it to be more interesting than the war following after it. The first modern war that changed all that followed after it, giving a horrible example for how cruel humanity can be towards itself. A game in this setting easily can go wrong in many ways though and simply fail to do what a game is supposed to do: Make it worth your time playing it. And in that point Verdun is very successful.Back when I bought the game it was still in Early Access, and frankly I didn't spend too much time with it because of a few performance issues. But as I recently got into the mood for the setting of this game again (thank you for that, Battlefield 1 trailer), I once more gave it a shot. And I don't regret it in any way. In fact for me this game most likely will be superior than EA's upcoming title because it captures the feeling of the horrible war quite well while still giving you a game that you have a lot of fun playing.My biggest issue with this game though is the performance, like mentioned above. Frankly my computer may not be high-end any more, but there isn't that much of a big difference between the lowest and the highst settings. But if it has to sometimes drop way below 20 FPS no matter what, it at least should look great. And that it does.Overall I easily can see that this game is not for everyone to enjoy, if you expect a Battlefield 1 or CoD like shooter, then you're at a very wrong place here. It's more a combination of assaulting recklessly so that at least a few manage to get a foothold in the enemy's trench and sticking together with your squad and together defend the weak points in your own trenches. Most of the games end in a draw, and all I can say that it's not even a bad thing, it's quite fitting for a World War 1 game. I personally recommend this game and wish the best of luck to both this game and its developers. I want to see both of them prosper. "

												I wanted to get this review out before the winter sale expires, Verdun is a pretty decent game for it's price (specially the sales price). The game play itself reminds me of Day of Defeat except you die a whole lot more and less machine guns. The bullet points the game designer has left in the “About this game” is rather accurate and describes the game play nicely. The only real gripes I might have with this game is the spawning and map size. Sometimes the game will spawn you right in the face of enemy fire, and obviously this can be rather maddening to spawn and die instantly. The other minor gripe would be map size, it would be beneficial for there to be smaller condensed maps to force more combat when there aren't enough players to fill the large maps. In Verdun there are 3 different types of game play (technically 4), trench which is your basic 4 man squad team play with different army specific weapons (the French, Germans, whatever use time period faction specific weapons). There are two different death match modes of game play which have their own specifics but it's still death match so I only count it was one. And finally a team defense mode, kind of like capture the flag but with murder. So though I'm not going to rave about Verdun being the best first person shooter ever I will recommend the game because it's rather cheap and the game play is solid so you will get your money out of it.

Early Access Review
								This is a great game.  Innovative in a way with the trench warfare style of play. The squad based functions are implemented perfectly and once you pick up on how the game works with retreating and advancing, you can use the squad functions to brutal effect.  Overall this is a refreshing take on FPS gameplay, and I highly recommend it. Try to nab it on sale. However, I do believe it is worth buying full price.    P.S .     Patience is a virtue in this game!!			"

												I will just tell you who reads this about how I feel about this whole game. I wont be talking about classes and how the game runs, just how it feels for me.So. You sit there in the trench, taking pot shots at the germans on the other side of the no mans land. Your whole squad around you, you got to know them over the training and battles you been in so far. You feel in your gut that sitting in this trench wont be and that you and your friends have to brave death once again.First its the French, the whistle is blown and they storm out of the trench shouting and swearing as machinegun fire and rifle fire destroys their advance. Only their bodies left in the mud. You take a deep breath and as your corporal blows the whistle you rush out from the trench and into no mans land. You run, screaming and shouting with the rest as members of other squads fall around you, luckily the bullets seem to evade just you. You throw yourself in a nearby ditch, picked by the corporal as a rally point. You turn around as see no other in your squad and you assume the worst. Steeling yourself you stand up and run into yet again. No mans land. "

												Dearest Wife of Mine,Today I sat in the fetal position in the middle of a dirty trench; rocking back and forth and crying while listening to my comrades scream in pain as they lay dying in a hole or somewhere else amidst no man's land. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Really though, I recommend this game. It's a historical FPS set in WWI that'll entertain you for quite a while.Sure, you'll be running through No Man's Land hoping you don't get shot or blown up while you try to get to the enemy trench, or you'll be defending your trench from the enemies...and hoping you don't get shot or blown up. But hey, look on the bright side! Even if you are bombarded by artillery, shot to death, blown up, burnt alive by a ""Wex"" flamethrower, gassed, cut up by barbwire while trying to escape or be sneaky, or shot while stuck on barbwire, you'll be able to return the favor! This game may be hard at first, but once you get used to it, you'll have a grand ol' time!So, if you're looking for a good FPS to buy, I recommend this one. Have fun going over the top!			"

TLDR Version:Great gameplay despite questionable stuttery gameplay at times. Not perfect, but still a game that is worth your time.Proper version:First of all: Why do I even write this review? I feel like it's important to mention it first. It's a very simple reason. After playing for a while and taking a break, the game asked me if I liked it, and if yes if I'd write a review on steam. So following the orders showing up on my screen, I now am here, writing this.I won't go over what Verdun is as you simply can read that a bit above the reviews, I don't need to repeat what is written there. Instead this will reflect my thoughts on it.World War 1 for me personally always has been a very interesting topic, and unlike many others I find it to be more interesting than the war following after it. The first modern war that changed all that followed after it, giving a horrible example for how cruel humanity can be towards itself. A game in this setting easily can go wrong in many ways though and simply fail to do what a game is supposed to do: Make it worth your time playing it. And in that point Verdun is very successful.Back when I bought the game it was still in Early Access, and frankly I didn't spend too much time with it because of a few performance issues. But as I recently got into the mood for the setting of this game again (thank you for that, Battlefield 1 trailer), I once more gave it a shot. And I don't regret it in any way. In fact for me this game most likely will be superior than EA's upcoming title because it captures the feeling of the horrible war quite well while still giving you a game that you have a lot of fun playing.My biggest issue with this game though is the performance, like mentioned above. Frankly my computer may not be high-end any more, but there isn't that much of a big difference between the lowest and the highst settings. But if it has to sometimes drop way below 20 FPS no matter what, it at least should look great. And that it does.Overall I easily can see that this game is not for everyone to enjoy, if you expect a Battlefield 1 or CoD like shooter, then you're at a very wrong place here. It's more a combination of assaulting recklessly so that at least a few manage to get a foothold in the enemy's trench and sticking together with your squad and together defend the weak points in your own trenches. Most of the games end in a draw, and all I can say that it's not even a bad thing, it's quite fitting for a World War 1 game. I personally recommend this game and wish the best of luck to both this game and its developers. I want to see both of them prosper. "

												I wanted to get this review out before the winter sale expires, Verdun is a pretty decent game for it's price (specially the sales price). The game play itself reminds me of Day of Defeat except you die a whole lot more and less machine guns. The bullet points the game designer has left in the “About this game” is rather accurate and describes the game play nicely. The only real gripes I might have with this game is the spawning and map size. Sometimes the game will spawn you right in the face of enemy fire, and obviously this can be rather maddening to spawn and die instantly. The other minor gripe would be map size, it would be beneficial for there to be smaller condensed maps to force more combat when there aren't enough players to fill the large maps. In Verdun there are 3 different types of game play (technically 4), trench which is your basic 4 man squad team play with different army specific weapons (the French, Germans, whatever use time period faction specific weapons). There are two different death match modes of game play which have their own specifics but it's still death match so I only count it was one. And finally a team defense mode, kind of like capture the flag but with murder. So though I'm not going to rave about Verdun being the best first person shooter ever I will recommend the game because it's rather cheap and the game play is solid so you will get your money out of it.

												The game is very similar to Red Orchestra II, as it consists of holding and attacking cap points within the game. It is also similar in its realism. One shot with a bolt action rifle will kill you, while the game makes you reload each individual bullet into your rifles. It's not fast paced like BF or Call of Duty, this game is much more realistic and hardcore. It's unforgiving, relentless, but very rewarding if you have the patience to learn the maps, work together as a team, and figure out the different weapons. Right now there are eight maps on Frontlines, which is the main game mode where you attack and defend positions. There are several squads to choose from, such as Americans, Canadians, Belgians or French. Each squad has its own unique classes such as sharpshooters or machinegunners. Weapon upgrades can be unlocked using experience points gained within the game. I highly recommend this game. It's a good alternative to arcade shooters like Battlefield or Call of Duty, and essentially the only WWI shooter out right now. 10/10 would WWI again.			"

I have played a lot of Red Orch 2 and this is the next best thing.  They are very similar in the way the 'frontlines' game mode, but Verdun is much more squad based and obviously in trenches.  One of the most immersive FPS games I own tbh.  As a seasoned FPS player this game was very easy to pick up and much more challenging and immersive than the likes of some AAA shooters out there today.			"

												This has become my go to game for any WW1 video game cravings as it is highly accurate to the historical time period and offers some very good graphics for the eye candy aspect.  The workings of the guns in this game impress me because of all the little details that go into working the gun, for example with the German Schutz  class Kar 98 sniper rifle with a scope the animation shows you having the gun move up as you cycle the bolt since they were not exactly light, straight pull bolts and needed some muscling to cycle them. The sounds and visual effects of the game help with immersion and I can easily play this game for hours without a regret. The general multiplayer community is actually decent and much better than a World of Tanks community for example. Most people aren't confrontational or accusing. Most people just play the game and avoid the world chat which is fine with me. As for lack of players, I haven't had a problem finding games though some of the other game modes besides Frontline can be sparse at times.However I feel the gameplay can feel a bit clunky at times and isn't as smooth as a Battlefield or COD game would be but I don't think it takes away too much from the enjoyability of the game. I think the game would benefit from a larger userbase and maybe smooth out the controls but otherwise I don't see any other problems that would bother me.			"

								Here is my reviewFirst off I would like to mention that if do not like historic FPS games then this game isn't for you. For all the rest of us this is an excellent game. In my perception this is currently the best WWI FPS game. Please note, do not compare this with RO2 for two main reasons, first RO2 isn't in WWI timeline but in WWII, second RO2 has had more time to mature so it is a more polished tactical game at this point. WWI has been a time era that I have wanted to be able to play in with a modern FPS game, and now I can. :-)			"

												Verdun: 1914-1918 is a game that takes place during The Great World War/The First World War. It is to my knowledge the only commercial game out there that deals with the Great War from a first person perspective (that is not NECROVISION or BlackOps II Zombies). It has been in development since 2006 (thank you developers for releasing that little timeline video) but with all of this in mind you can look at Verdun with the rose tinted glasses of being a “special snowflake” or “gem in a sea of coal.” I have been playing since you could play with it in the browser version of Unity a few years back and I have seen massive changes in the game for the better.The Good:-It is a fun game, it is an exasperating game, and it is a game that gives you some semblance of what it would be like to be in the trenches and play in the gas. It has a very fair amount of historical accuracy behind it and the developers are keen on keeping it that way. -As you level and the people you play with level your squad (the people you choose to have in the same squad with you) will in turn level and unlock all sorts of nice little abilities such as better gas/arty/reloading times/etc. Oh and let’s not forget the uniforms. -It has been updated to Unity5 and feels a lot more polished and looks great.-It is a hard game, and you will get mad at it, there are some people who nade spam a bit but in all reality it is not un-justified; it is one of the very few ways of trench clearing without putting yourself or your squad in danger.-Call of Duty tactics will get you nowhere, communication and coordination is key to success in this game.-The voice chat system is squad only and is frankly good enough.The Bad:-It is kind of buggy and wigs out for some people.-You might run into server joining issues due to some issue with the matchmaker.-It runs on Unity and tends to have its moments of temper tantrums with rendering anything. (I play on all Ultra with a very nice rig and I still get issues)-Optimizations come and go as patches are released (though the dev's are keen on fixing new issues that arise) -Waiting around for the massive updates to be released.Overall:-Buy the game it is fun, it is stressful, IT IS VERDUN!!!

Verdict:Buy now! Buy on sale (if you like FPS)Save your moneySummary:Verdun is a good game that does what it sets out to do - simulate WWI in a FPS. It does an ok job of doing this but there is always a sense that the potential is far greater than the current experience.Graphics are functional but dated, the squad system is good but not intuitive. The thing that will frustrate you the most (apart from the ever prevelant bugs) is the very thing that is pivital to the game - running over no mans land and dying again and again in order to get a glimpse of the enemies trench. Although released at the end of April 2015, it still feels a little unfinished with bugs and poor optimisation. The devs were active but I would say seem less active after release (which is understandable). The test will be if they can continue to polish and add content to the game and take it forward incrementally to take it from an ok game to a really great game. Whether they have the time and effort do so will remain to be seen.In it's current state however, it's worth picking up on sale if you are a fan of FPS, if only to experience something a little different.Overall Score:6.5/10The Good:Interesting and unuique WWI FPS themeIf you have a good team you can get some really good matchesThe Bad:Dated visualsBugsContent feels limited at the moment (bring on the tanks!)The Ugly:Poor performance optimisation "

								Have you ever stabbed a man, ever smashed someones face with a trench club, ever chock someone with gas, ever play as a Frenchman? Neither had I until I played Verdun, this game offers the full WW1 experience. If you're interested in some bolt rifle action or want to play in the trenches then look no further. Very friendly community who try to help out newer players. I recommend this game for those who like FPS and history. This game has taught me a greater appreciation for my great grandfather and for J.R.R Tolkien. Give it a try and I'll see you out on the battlefield!!!			"

												Verdun is, as it stands, an fun game version of combat on the Western Front of the First World War. It naturally takes historical liberties and these make it not simply a bland historical simulator. The 'frontlines' game type and the maps it is played on is balanced enough that you get these great tug of war scenarios, so every victory really feels like a success. The maps are surprisingly diverse considering the setting, though for being named 'Verdun' there aren't as many sprawling forts as you'd expect.There is room for improvement in the squad system (which is far from intuitive) and the way the game deals with team balance.While I play and enjoy a range of games set in historical and current day conflicts, this of all I felt the most uncomfortable about, which is odd. I guess WWI has a particular place in, at least Australia's, cultural psyche.Overall it is a fun game and I would recommend it.			"

												A fun exploration game involving wandering around a barren landscape. It comes with a very wide selection of explorers but admittedly all of them are Caucasian. After a couple hours I found a large network of crevices that, although having no loot or reward, had some enemies to fight, and at one point I was enveloped in a large smoke cloud and was forced to become a TIE fighter. I eventually levelled up, and the system was interesting, but I found the shovel I was given at the start to be too useful to replace.Overall very positive experience!			"

Verdict:Buy now! Buy on sale (if you like FPS)Save your moneySummary:Verdun is a good game that does what it sets out to do - simulate WWI in a FPS. It does an ok job of doing this but there is always a sense that the potential is far greater than the current experience.Graphics are functional but dated, the squad system is good but not intuitive. The thing that will frustrate you the most (apart from the ever prevelant bugs) is the very thing that is pivital to the game - running over no mans land and dying again and again in order to get a glimpse of the enemies trench. Although released at the end of April 2015, it still feels a little unfinished with bugs and poor optimisation. The devs were active but I would say seem less active after release (which is understandable). The test will be if they can continue to polish and add content to the game and take it forward incrementally to take it from an ok game to a really great game. Whether they have the time and effort do so will remain to be seen.In it's current state however, it's worth picking up on sale if you are a fan of FPS, if only to experience something a little different.Overall Score:6.5/10The Good:Interesting and unuique WWI FPS themeIf you have a good team you can get some really good matchesThe Bad:Dated visualsBugsContent feels limited at the moment (bring on the tanks!)The Ugly:Poor performance optimisation "

												A great WW1 shooter which requires tactics, teamwork and a bit of luck. Beinga lonewolf, I, too, enjoy this game very much. Sure, there are several bugs here and there but it doesn't take away from the game. If you like WW1 era games; being it sneaky in the trenches or just charging down the no man's land like a madman, you will enjoy this game very much. So, to keep it short, Yes I recommend this game wholeheartedly.			"

								So this is probably the best WW1 game to have been made (even though that list is VERY small). The weapons are very realistic, and the gun play is second to none. The back-and-forth pushing and retreating to and from the trenches across No Mans Land is just as it was. It really gives a sense of the type of warfare conducted 100 years ago. Proper WW1 trench warfare with accurate weapons including chlorine gas attacks, various pushing and retreating cycles, and if you get stuck in the barbed wire, you either die from being stuck and bleeding or get shot. It's only in Beta but it's pretty well done. Think of it like Battlefield, you join as 4 player squads within the server, and have 4x squads on each team versing each other.			"

								Here is my reviewFirst off I would like to mention that if do not like historic FPS games then this game isn't for you. For all the rest of us this is an excellent game. In my perception this is currently the best WWI FPS game. Please note, do not compare this with RO2 for two main reasons, first RO2 isn't in WWI timeline but in WWII, second RO2 has had more time to mature so it is a more polished tactical game at this point. WWI has been a time era that I have wanted to be able to play in with a modern FPS game, and now I can. :-)			"

												Awesome game. Very interesting mechanics. You work in a 4 man squad, with each man having a different role. From the pistol-brandishing officer, to the trench club wielding Raider, you should be able to find a loudout that fits your playstyle. A couple of things to be noted though:The game is going for realism, which means 1 rifle bullet kills you, so expect to die a lot when you get started (you can survive a couple pistol bullets).THE GAS WILL KILL YOUSO WILL BARBED WIRESo be smart; gas mask-up and be careful around the wire.The graphics are good, and the game is extremely fun.

								I thought I was done with FPS games. I'd given up thinking that anyone could make the formula fun again. I'd asumed that any online multiplayer FPS would be populated entirely by jerks intent on making your gaming experience miserable. Verdun proved me wrong. So very, very wrong. Verdun is a seriously brilliant team-based FPS. The game mechanic of opposing forces attacking and counter attacking; driving each other out of a position and having to hold it is terrific. It really makes you think of your role in the team and not just racking up your kill count. Also, if like me you're a history buff; the developers have spent a lot of time getting the setting, uniforms and weapons to feel authentic; but they've still managed to balance the ""game"" aspects excellently. As for your online gaming experience  - the players are, almost to a person, a friendly lot. They won't give you a second chance if you mess up (bang!), but they're not going to grief you or otherwise make your experience unpleasant.One note for new players - there's a very steep learning curve. You will die A LOT. You usually won't know where that fatal shot came from, either. That can be frustrating. Stick with it. The game rewards ongoing play.  I can't recommend this game highly enough. Buy it, buy it, buy it. Support an indy dev team with a great idea and a great product.			"

												Its a tough game if you either dont know what you're doing or you are not good at long range combat. This game can be a bit frustrating but with some patience and good marksmanship, you'll be able to come around. In this game, you have to rely on rifles and probably a few pistols. There are classes that will provide you weapons, whether you will get rifle, sniper, pistol, melee, etc.You cant really choose guns (besides Deathmatch, And i think Team Deathmatch (havent really tried it due to servers there being dead most of the time)). If you really are bad at the game, you can always play defense mode, where you and your 3 teams need to survive and defend the trenches. It should be noted this game involves Trench Warfare from the first World War.Theres rarely hackers from what I've played through, normally I can tell if theres so many kills from that same person (i give like, 7 or over though its not possible to kill so many with some bullets that usually holds up to 10 depending which gun you use). Just the only thing you will put up with are people that knows how to aim well, which you can randomly die if you are not careful or cautious. Sometimes, you are better off running forward than cautiously walking forward as you aim. The field is very open, with hills to use for cover or any objects.The field is pretty much sniper heaven (or hell, whatever you think of it). Whether you snipe someone or they snipe at you, its dangerous. Close range combat is rare, which can happen if enemies are in your trenches or nearby. It can also happen if you are at their trenches.The Trench Mode is where it usually gets most of the players from, it becomes more or less populated. Probably the only mode where it is fairly populated, Defense mode is second considering all you need is 4 people. Deathmatch is free for all so if you want to kill everyone. And Team Deathmatch, hardly populated.Servers through countries are also varies. Because the usual populated servers from what I seen are US and EU. The rest is usually dead far as I know (havent exactly seen all). If you are not in US or EU, you will probably get dead servers that is unless you bring friends (though that'll help on Defense Mode well as it requires 4 people for the fun to start, but other modes i am not sure).As for Defense Mode, its simple. As I said it requires 4, and you are fighting bot controlled players through waves. Survive as long as you can, and whatever you die at is your record.Get this if you are in US or EU, servers are fairly good.Edit: Forgot to mention theres machine guns you can get, though some can either require you to mount it or allow you to shoot or mount it. Aiming down, you cant do.			"

												If you are a fan of First Person Shooter during war time, this is a must to have !In my opinion this is the first real FPS using WW1, realistic sounds, weapons, maps and more. A really interesting squad feature, with a very friendly and mature community.This is an indie game, so you may find some bug (but really not so much) while playing, but the devs are really close to the community and they are patching the game on a regular basis.Interested in competitive ?! Come in Verdun, join a clan and give a try to Verdun League ! For North America and EuropeAnd guess what ? Free DLC are coming ! I havem't heard about DLC being free for years, and the devs in Verdun are making them free....sounds like the perfect match ;-) !If you are a fan of FPS and looking for a fresh new game to play, you should try Verdun, it's a whole new FPS experience !

OverallEspecially recommended to lovers of history, first person shooters and maybe even indie games. It's a stressful and at times difficult game, but I find myself coming back to it frequently because it can actually be relaxing. The slower paced, trench warfare allows me to take a sip of tea while crawling through bombed landscape, then put my tea down and stand up to charge through the front lines with my handgun drawn. The game is definitely better than when it first came to Steam, and watching it grow up has been pleasant.If you're on the edge about this game and you don't have a good computer, I would opt for not getting it. Being able to see far and well is pretty important.The idea of the game is to take the place of a front lines Great War (World War I) soldier, either for Germans, French, English, and I think even Polish and Canadians. I can't always tell because the names of the squads are in their native language and description. The game falls short sometimes with the actual multiplayer battles, as sometimes a stalemate is impossible and sometimes sniper rifles can dominate, etc. But I do enjoy it, especially when everything goes well. The game attempts to keep squads together, but that doesn't always happen. When it does it goes more well, but that's only one factor.Each squad has a squad leader who can call aerial support and lead the others for point bonuses. Then there's usually a rifleman/spotter, grenadier, and machine-gunner. With increase in rank allows you to easily level up each class (each class only has 2 upgrades past the initial set).Usually, rifles are a 1-shot kill to make progress through teamwork as slow, and really divides skill well. Snipers may be too strong, sometimes, and machineguns may not have appropriate motivation to be set up. Sometimes as the machine gunner I just switch to a rifle instead.Pros Extremely immersive and accurate. All guns, weapons, and infantryman are from the Great War itself, including the guns, chemical weapons (it even tells you the name) and squad names. The game punishes ""pacifists"" and rewards following the directions of your commander. Switching roles has a nice setup, and when teams are unbalanced the game attempts to force a balance, but only with the consent of the powerful team (which receives are point penalty until a balance). Semi-tactical gameplay. It'll never be Counter-Strike, but it is loads farther than Call of Duty or Battlefield.  Great gunwork. Sometimes I have trouble aiming from far away, but bullet drop is the only fault. That and maybe imprecise gun iron sights that I'm not accustomed to. Nice variation of weapon combinations, albeit not really that many. They feel different for what it's worth. I like the casual leveling system. It has a lot of freedom and it's quick. You'll never feel like you wasted time unlocking something pointless. I always have leftover points. Teamwork is really felt when capturing trenches, and it feels nice to all charge in together to see your teammates mowed down, but your enemy mowed down even more.Cons This is about the playstyle, but if you are one that doesn't like to rapidly get back into the action, you may not like this game. Impatience hurts you a lot. Charging through fortifications and hills is a call to instant death unless you're careful. It can be really annoying to be killed by the same sniper 10 times, and just as annoying to be killed by a stray grenade. Dying is easy. Wionning is slow. Ties are frequent. Game isn't that balanced when it comes to winners vs. losers, but again, that's a minor complaint. Verdun is more akin to an experiment than a story. It has its progressions and I hope it continues to improve.  Not really any variation to playstyle or matches. There's Deathmatch and Advance-through-the-trenches-one-by-one-mode, or whatever they are called. Slow computers have a big disadvantage in not seeing as far or as quickly. Each fight is like a pounce, and a lag could kill you easily. Not enough skills. Each class feels the same except for the guns. Matches are long. A bad squad leader makes me angry; although doesn't actually ruin the game. It's like not having one at all, which is okay sometimes. "

Early Access Review
								This game is frustrating and wonderful. It is not COD, and it shouldn't be. Every battle begins variously with charging at the enemy and definitely getting gunned down or gunning down the enemy who is charging at you in a near hopeless, but sometimes fruitful attempt to get into the ruddy trench you are in. That's just the experience of the game, but there is far more.Want to shoot a machine gun? You'll have to work for it. No-one starts this game with machineguns or SMGs, they either end up with a pistol and a bundle of grenades or with one of the bolt-action rifles each of the various entente and central powers sent their boys out with. You'll ask questions like: Why the hell did the French design a rifle with only three rounds that could not be reloaded in between? Why? Then you'll realize the beauty of the Lee Enfield and the utilitarian vigor of the G98. The choice of weapon is decided based on which power your squad is with, the role in the quad you get, and how well you have fought in that role to garner various specializations. It's a nice system, and I have enjoyed the fun of trying to level up every specialty. It's a good way of promoting experiementation which I appreciate.What about Beta?This game has some obvious bugs which can screw up the sky and ground, but for the most part, the game still needs development in it's matchmaking capabilities. Too often, players are sent into battles without enough other players, and the game doesn't seem to send new players where they are needed, because you stick with your squad into the net battle. That design has its pros, but the con is that empty games, while uncommon, occur too frequently for a good release.Oftentimes, the servers time out and you get dropped from a game, or your squad doesn't get a position in a battle, and you therefore have to retry making your squad.The friend function in the game is skeletal. The developers obviously have the buttons there to make everything else functional, but there is no easy way of connecting players with their steam accounts and getting steam friends into games can sometimes be difficult. There are great examples of how to make this system function, and I think the developers will do it justice.The community on the game has been largely understanding of the beta status, as well, and in in-game chat, I've seen the regular amount of trolling and criticism, but it seems that most of the players are pretty into the game with all its drawbacks, and would rather have a good game and some fun, than ruin the experience for anyone else.Verdun is a great game. There are some problems, but it has the makings to be the first truly successful game set in the Great War. If you have a love for realism, and can deal with being shot repeatedly, you should get it.

								I have fallen in love with this game. If you are looking for something that is different than  a lot of first person shooters then this is the game for you! If you get some friends on as well then you can make a squad and really go far. The game does have a few bugs, none are gamebreaking however and it is still in early access. I would highly recommend to anyone who likes true objective based first person shooters.			"

								So this is probably the best WW1 game to have been made (even though that list is VERY small). The weapons are very realistic, and the gun play is second to none. The back-and-forth pushing and retreating to and from the trenches across No Mans Land is just as it was. It really gives a sense of the type of warfare conducted 100 years ago. Proper WW1 trench warfare with accurate weapons including chlorine gas attacks, various pushing and retreating cycles, and if you get stuck in the barbed wire, you either die from being stuck and bleeding or get shot. It's only in Beta but it's pretty well done. Think of it like Battlefield, you join as 4 player squads within the server, and have 4x squads on each team versing each other.			"

												It changed a lot since 2013. A LOT.I miss the old rifleplay, but the new one is not so different. Maybe the sensitivity settings make it feel different.Generally, it is a lot more stable than it was before, even tho the low end PCs may not be able to play it above 12-15 fps average.Overall, it's a damn fine game, and all the frustrations with ranking up in 2013/2014 just for the progress to be lost because ♥♥♥♥♥♥ server hosting sorted itself out, and you get a lot of points to spend on your weapons.

												Edit: The only con that really bothers me is the ""You are entering restricted area"" warnings. I understand why they are important in video games, but they are OVERKILL in verdun, i can't even run around a damn barbed wire without the desertion message.The desertion boundaries need to be loosened. They are borderline game-breakingOk usually i am a♥♥♥♥♥♥about games, and i go against the grain of good reviews.But this game is genuinely awesome, if you are concerned like, oh its indie it probably does not have much content it probably has only like one gun and bad graphics.This game is amazing, the graphics are awesome and it runs buttery smooth. You know how its kind of a b1tch to aim your mouse in games like red orchestra and cs? because the mouse movement is too smooth and a bit slippery?  In verdun the mouse movement/aiming is PERFECT, it has a certain type of weight to it that makes aiming so comfortable, I was able to pick off seven guns with pixel perfect bolt-action accuracy one after the next, without that loose wobbly mouse movement issue.This game is very rich in quality, the graphics are awesome, the gameplay is smooth, there are plenty of weapons, players DROP like a sack of potatoes after one well placed shot.It's not one of those games thats so focused on realism that its boring like red orchestra, the weapons in verdun don't swing around your monitor like in red orchestra and you can comfortably fire semi-accurately without aiming down your sights.  In red orchestra the developers think that you HAVE to aim down your sights in order to play, which is not true. In real life you can aim fairly accurately with a rifle if you do not aim down the sights, and this is how it works in verdun, you can fire fairly accurately without using iron sights which is just much more enjoyable for close quarters action.This game is just awesome, with the right skill you can DOMINATE the battle field on your own, its not like all those other shooters where you can only get 1-2 kills max before your health and ammo runs out. You can literally change the tide of  the match by yourself with a rifle.This is a great game.			"

								Great game. Most early access games are pretty bad, but this one is great. It's a mix of battlefield and RO. It's not as hardcore as RO where you bleed to death and everything, but you can't tank a bullet. You can take up to 2 shots depending on how far the shooter was. The game is really well made and really makes you feel like you're in the middle of the great war fighting in the trenches. If you're looking for a decently realistic shooter then Verdun is your game.			"

Early Access Review
								For an indie game still in development, Verdun is pretty well done. It is a First World War fps based around the French-German battle of Verdun in 1916. I'm going to say this straight off the block, the game it seems most like, is Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad, just with lesser quality graphics, less polished gameplay, and funny running animations. This is not a bad thing. Infact it is a good thing in my eyes, whilst not being a big fps fan I was able to enjoy this due to my enjoyment of RO2. The game puts you in squads of 4 men, one person in each squad plays a different class from NCO's, Riflemen, Machine gunners, and Grenadiers and your aim is to keep pushing your enemy back through the lines of trenches, without losing your own. Straight from this you can tell the developers are encouraging teamplay, which is a very good sign. The system works ok on the overall, as you attack a trench, if you take it before the time limit you defend it from counter-attack before moving on, if you fail to attack it you have to defend against a counter-attack also, pretty basic. However I believe the spread of classes into classes that were not very common in WW1 has caused this to change slightly. The 4 man squad 1 per class has meant that 25% of the battlefield are each class, now whilst this goes for teamworking balanced gameplay it lacks that WW1 stalemate kind of authenticity where you get riflemen (the common conscript taking up a large percentage of the army) charging in masses against an enemy trench, clearly in view, getting mowed down by machine gun fire. This means you instead get people sitting around in shell holes with machine guns and shooting at the defenders who can't move far unless they are ""executed for deserting"" when the machine gunner should be attacking. Whilst I would have loved to see the masses of soldiers charging over no-mans land to the sound of the officers whistle with machine gun fire rattling and men falling head over heels all around you, it is something we have to live with and is evident that is not the path the developers have chosen, it would be hard for that anyway with the terrain being so devastated. My only other grope with the game is the fact that it is purely based on Verdun (hear me out), as whilst this is intentional, I have seen many people complaining about the huge numbers of German players as France seems very unpopular, also a number of German and British players have been complaining at the lack of Great Britain. Maybe when the game expands they will add the somme as a dlc or something, idk. Overall I thoroughly enjoy playing Verdun and feel as though it is one of those games you go on for a quick match, purely for the light hearted (I meant the gameplay not truth behind it) gameplay.My rating: 7/10Buy it if you appreciate that it is still under development, enjoy fps games like RO2, have a fascination for the historical time period, and are willing to give it some time at first. It is a good game and worth paying the cheap price for it.			"

												A very nice and challenging Realism FPS, following in the footsteps of games such as Red Orchestra (1!!!) and Darkest hour. Essentially contains two game modes: Frontlines - a mode in which both sides take turns in trying to take each others trenches or positions. The attacking side/defending side has 3 minutes to take/hold their objective after which roles are inverted if a position is/is not taken/held. The second mode is a FFA deathmatch for training purpose or whomever might enjoy it. (Frontlines is the true essence of the game) Graphics have considerably improved since it got out of early access and is in my opinion on a 2011 AAA standard. Sound effects are clear and create a believable background of WW1 battlefield in terms of noises/sound. The only downside I see at this point in time is the lack of new maps which will sooner or later cause me to loose interest. Nonetheless for an Indie title and a WW1 definately the best so far made and out at this moment. If you enjoyed RO 1 or Darkest Hour, you will also most likely have a ball with Verdun.			"

								The game is getting better and better (Beta V164), I really do look forward to the new features coming from that indeed small developer team - again hats off!Verdun is comparable to Red Orchestra and the classic Call of Dutys. The gameplay, involving capturing enemy terrain, is pretty simple and can be learnt is a couple of minutes. Mastering i,t though, is another thing. You'll be dying pretty often if you don't make efficient use of trenches, craters and other forms of cover. Then there's the gas, machine guns, mortar strikes, .....Some details need a bit of refinishing though, like the interface for switching sides (pressing TAB+ESC in-game is quite awkward if you ask me) or the use of the Command features like calling in mortar strikes. Maybe a tutorial would be a help to confused newcomers?Anyway, if you're looking for a decent Multiplayer-FPS based in World War One, then Verdun is your first choice by now. And it's getting better with every update!			"

								Verdun is a game in the making, but for a game being made by such a small team, it sure is well put together and fun to play. Now with that being said, don't forget this game is being worked on as I type this. So be catious of various bugs/glitches and report them when you can.This game has accurate guns so far and the gameplay seems to be balanced, Looking forward to seeing what the future holds for this game.

												Ignore all these negative reviews. They all come from sweaty scrubs who don't even does quickScOpes. Only way 2 win is 2 get a scoped rifle (Never use the scope) rush into trenches and get as many noScOpes as possible. Afterwards complain how your team is not as good as you then you trash talk the enemy team. For enhanced results drink GFuel® and experience G-Fuel Energy, Sports Drinks, eSports, pro athletes, vitamin and supplements. Step up your game!			"

Early Access Review
								At first, the frontline was an alien place, I charged over the top only to be mowed down by enemy fire. I tried again, shot by snipers whilst cowering in no mans land.Being used to normal FPS play, I tried to apply it to this game, and first felt a little frustrated, but then once I learnt the game a little more after a couple of hours play, changed my tactics and motions to trench and muddy no mans land fighting. The game became amazing, and amazed me how well it was working.First joining the squad, and the squad being automatically placed in to a frontline battle where needed seemed bizarre, but after a couple of hours I felt we needed to win the war, I needed to lead my fellow men to victory.The experience system does work well, although it takes a while to unlock new weapons, you do constantly upgrade your other abilities gradually, wether its skill with guns you have or artillery called in. Also each squad gains experience as it goes along also, adding abilities to all those in the squad.For a cheap early access indie game, it is incredibly good quality, with little bugs in it, and great fun to be had. It's climbing closer and closer to the quality of Red Orchestra 2, but with a new gameplay style, with world war one trenches, which for the first time I have seen, working well in a FPS game. Revolutionary style of gameplay with classic FPS ease is a garanteed winner for any FPS player, and currently the early access price is very reasonable.If your a FPS fan, I wouldn't want to miss out on this.

												I purchased this game because I saw Seananners playing it and thought it would be cool. I played the free to play alpha on Kongregate.com before this had even come out and enjoyed that too.Biggest disappointment I've had in an age. The game is horrifyingly bad for a shooter game, and that's saying something. I've played some pretty bad shooter games in my day, including very, very old ones, but this one is genuinely awful. Coming off Red Orchestra 2's gun mechanics for bolt action rifles you realize how much of a dream it is in red orchestra compared to this. The controls feel stiff and jerky when you try to move around, like your character never quite does what you want, and at times even delaying your movements which is a huge red flag for a FPS shooter. The weapons have♥♥♥♥♥♥controls, iron sights you can barely see that zoom in slightly when you hold your breath, but for some reason your trained soldier can't control his breath for more than 3 seconds before he starts panting like a ragged dog. Reload time is ridiculous, and you can't reload while you move, meaning you have to sit still every time you need to reload, which often gets you killed, because even pistols in the game kill you in one hit. Every weapon in this game kills you immediately in one hit. The game promotes camping not limited to spawn camping because there is no spawn protection. But let's not forget the community. A game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gun mechanics could still be fun and enjoyable if the community is nice, right?It's not.The community in this game is horrible and abhorrent, cursing and yelling in the chatbox 24/7 and only get worse if they realize there's a new player in the game. Many of the players either have superhuman vision or are capable of seeing you from the length of the entire map away, and seeing you clear enough to headshot you with a pistol. Yes I said pistol. You pop out of cover anywhere and you get headshotted before you can react because someone already knows you are there. You can't move anywhere. The Class system is broken and ineffective, leaving certain players unable to do anything properly because some idiot is the NCO telling you do defend your spawn while dropping mortar rounds on top of friendly troops. Vet players blame ""newbs"" for all their problems in this game. 97 players online in the main game mode. It's safe to say the community for this game is dead, possibly worse than Heroes and Generals, since when I played that, it only had 250 people active on the server. I refunded this game as quickly as I could, and hopefully never have to experience an overhyped mess like this ever again.			"

												This game feels like a ghetto version of Red Orchestra 2. The animations are stiff and robotic, the voice acting is horrible, the movement is clunky, etc. One of the biggest problems that I have is how arcadey it feels compared to other ""realistic shooters""; you have a crosshair on screen for most weapons, you can jump like it's Quake, and all the weapons produce hitmarkers. However, I really enjoy the weapons themselves (the models are nice and they sound fine). I like how the squad leaders have a more offensive role than in RO2. I like the weapon and class diversity among the different factions.It's a shame that this game has so many issues, as it really has the potential to be great. In its current state, I cannot reccomend it, and I don't think I ever will be able to. Fundamental issues like bad jumping physics and bad animations are not likely to ever be fixed. If this game is on heavy discount (<$10), and you're tired of better games, I suppose you could have a few hours of fun with it, but expect to be frustrated as well. tl,dr: Playing this game is like eating an ice cream sundae that you pulled out of a rotting animal carcass; some bites taste great and you would really like to have some more, but then some taste like rotting meat mixed with fudge.

												Did not enjoy. Camper's delight. Poke your head out of a trench and you'll be killed while trying to scan for enemies. Seems like everyone has a scoped gun (except me).... Large learning curve to this game, so it's not clear how squad progression works, how to play as a squad leader, unlock things (like a scope), etc. Iron sights help with accuracy but not effective at zooming into targets, so enemies are extremely small and hard to hit at a distance without a scope. Adding to this, it's not immediately clear who your enemies are. Extremely slow-paced tactical shooter, so shooting, movement, and reload speeds, while realistic, take ages. While this works for this genre, it can be extremely frustrating due to the campy nature of this game. There's a huge skill gap here. I'm not terrible at FPS games but find it easy to go sometimes 5 minutes or more without a single kill, meanwhile there are players with 30 or more kills.Graphically this game is much too dark without the HDR option checked and/or a brightness/gamma bump. Even then enemies are still hard to see. Most maps comprised of extremely muddy gray and brown tones. Wanted to like this game but it's getting uninstalled. "

												Interesting concept, and the dreary and brutal nature of trench warefare is represented really well in this game... visually speaking. It may not be cutting edge pretty, but it's good enough.This game is basically Frontlines in WWI. For obvious reasons the Frontlines style of territorial progression is ideal for this era of warefare... the actual handling of the game is not.Movement is clunky. It's not at a horrific, untweakable level, but it's not great. There are times moving through some of the tighter trenches or ""over"" terrain... it feels weird and... clunky. Clunky is the key word here. Running through the trenches (and there's a lot of running and confused navigation upon respawn) feels, again, clunky when you're amongst other player models.The leveling up of classes does not help that. On its own the levelling up would be alright as a challenge, but combined with the extended, clunky running (again, not terribly far, but enough considering this is a one hit kill type shooter)  leans this game towards a tedious feeling.The tweakble issues felt kind of beta-ish to me.It clearly appeals to a decent enough number of players to populate servers, but if you have a personal standard of FPS movement and handling that you just can't go below, this won't feel fun.Not a bad game, it just needs more than a little tweaking.

Product received for free
												I started playing Verdun over three years ago back in it's infancy in the browser version. I picked the game up in December of 2013 on steam. A few months after it's initial release on steam. I was instantly hooked. The gunplay, maps, and everything was an enjoyable and amazing experience. It was a beta and as expected it had bugs and issues. Fast forward to April 28th 2015. The game was released out of it's early access and was no longer in any form of beta. Surely if the game was being released from beta it would mean the bugs had been fixed? The game had been polished? Unfortunately no. It's not really understood why the devs decided to release the game out of early access so fast. A quick playthrough would have shown that it wasn't ready upon release and was still a game that played like it was in early access. It still does to this day. Although this isn't where my actual sentiment with Verdun comes from. While the game still had issues at release it was indeed as bug free as it had ever been. I still commend the devs for what was probably the smoothest major update ever in the games history. Basically no new issues to be heard of and we got a fantastic new map Aisne. Release was an optimistic time as the game was in the most polished state it had ever been, while still buggy and playing like a beta, it was still playing better than ever before. Many new players came to check out the game, as did returning players from the early access, and things looked to be on the up and up.The real issues begin at the end of August in 2015. This first major update after Verdun’s release in April. This update was known as the attrition update. It introduced a new gamemode which known as ‘’attrition’’ hence why it was the ‘’attrition’’ update, but furthermore it also introduced clutter to the maps. Clutter consisted of random trash and crap scattered all over the map. Things like bullets, gear from soldiers, and dead bodies. Admittedly it does make the maps feel more lively and more authentic, but this update was the beginning of trouble with Verdun. It was very clear in the test branch for this update that the clutter added mainly to Flanders and Artois was absolutely destroying the FPS performance. Despite very clear warnings to the devs the update was released. As a result the performance of 2 of the 6 maps in the game at the time had been majorly compromised. Logically you would have expected the devs to rollback the update with no immediate fix to the performance problems in sight. Unfortunately they chose to keep this update in the game and as a result performance of the maps was ruined. People with medium to high end PC’s struggled to run the maps above 60FPS even on lower end settings. This nightmare continued on for four entire months. During this four month period the devs actually made performance worse on other maps, and continued to break the game further. Despite what this added clutter had done to Artois and Flanders the devs still felt it was a good idea to continue on adding it to other maps. After this four month struggle had ended the player base had seen significant drops and losses, the competitive scene was all but dead after it had been cancelled due to the performance problems, and the game had been through hell. Despite this it was still alive and I was still playing. It was in December of 2015 when performance was fixed finally and I thought we had been through the worst. Going back to a few months before this in September the devs started a campaign known as weapon wednesday. Every week they would tease images/gifs of new weapons and features coming in the future. This would last well beyond December and into March of 2016. This was a rather questionable decision as it really annoyed more people than it hyped as it lasted too long and people became frustrated and impatient. In November they released a new map Fort Douaumont. The map had basically no testing or feedback and it was released in the middle of the games performance issues. To this day the map has never been reworked and is incredibly unbalanced and an unenjoyable experience. After the performance had been smoothed out the game was gearing up for the biggest content drop it had ever seen. The beta for Horrors of war came out in January of 2016. You would have thought that I would have been excited for this, but I wasn’t. Back when they released the game in April of 2015 they had planned for individual DLC releases. All of them had their own name and were all nicely packaged. I believed that this would keep the game content supplied for years to come and as was advertised with their roadmap they would be split up and released at different times. So what did they do? They decided to release almost the entirety of the content in one go. Rather than split it up so there would be several major content drops over time everything was being pushed out at once. This made it impossible to beta test everything and give this update any chance of coming out smoothly. Furthermore they decided to change core game mechanics for no apparent reason. This would go on to drive veterans away from the game as Verdun was no longer they game they were used to playing. Despite very clear warnings from players that the beta for Horrors of war was still buggy and not ready for release it went through anyway. As a result on the 23rd of March 2016 we got a very buggy and broken update known as Horrors of war. The fact is that the devs were continuing on this path of bad decisions and shortcomings. It wouldn’t take long for the next bad decision and questionable move to come out. In early June they announced the console port. Why would they do this? Hard to say when the PC version was more buggy than it had been in a year, there was still PC content that needed to be released, and the game was nowhere near stable enough to be ported over to consoles. Over of the course of this summer essentially nothing happened. The PC community was left out to hang and dry while the devs focused all their efforts onto the console port of the game. Days before the consoles were set to release they actually postponed the Xbox release. Their rushed console port which was supposed to cash in on BF1 was amusingly being delayed because it straight up wasn’t ready. The PS4 was released on time and initial feedback from players was relatively unpositive. Despite less graphical fidelity the game was locked to 30 FPS and was very buggy. The PC owners were being left out for a buggy and broken console port only being made to cash in on the new interest in WW1 following BF1 being announced. Recently it was discovered that the devs had intentionally added a distance where bullets would be deleted from the map. This was added to help solve performance issues. The distance was 150m and 150m is a relatively common engagement distance on several of Verdun’s maps. As a result players could not take long range engagements simply because the game no longer allowed them to. As opposed to removing pointless clutter, our ability to engage long distance was removed. While Verdun has hit detection that is abysmal, the game is being ported to consoles, Verdun has netcode that makes the early BF4 netcode look decent, but we get gamemodes people never asked for and clutter which ruins the FPS. We might have gotten lots of content with Horrors of war but ultimately when it comes out buggy and is released all at once as opposed to splitting it up to allow sufficient testing and to keep players coming back for more frequent major content drops we get it all at once. It’s been a year since the game first came out on steam and it’s still a buggy game which feels like it’s still in beta. The devs do not seem to want to ever address and fix some of the biggest issues plaguing the game and I myself cannot run out of bad things to say about Verdun at this point.			"

												Verdun has a lot of great ideas.  Yes, it's definitely not for everyone, but the immersion and setting are astounding.  Core gameplay is fun if not frustrating.  Dying over and over is OK, even expected.  What's more important is objective play.  Gameplay consists of two teams wrestling for land, using a timer system.  Capture the trench and you then must prepare for the counter-attack.  Lose a trench, and you must retreat and regroup.  Dropping people from long-range is extremely gratifying when you pull it off.  There isn't a ton of room for creativity due to it's era, but what's there feels true to form and genuine.  Have your NCO call in a artillery strike, or mustard gas, throw on your gas mask while the enemy is still confused, and start stabbing them with your bayonet.  This game is one-shot-one-kill unless you're using a pistol or MG.  Liken it to similar FPS's like Red Orchestra 2.  What's holding Verdun back from being great?  Not lack of content or creativity, a game about the war that coined the term ""trench warfare"" is to be expected.  It's optimization.  Frequent stutters and dropped frames hinders this game's immersion and playability greatly.  Optimizing your game should not be ""turning everything off"".  This game is incredibly CPU heavy, a quad-core CPU is absolutely required for a smooth experience.  With these glaring performance issues, I simply cannot recommend Verdun despite it's extremely gratifying core gameplay.			"

												The game is commendable for being much slower and tactical than most FPS games, especially since it captures the reality of trench raiding fairly effectivley. The class and squad progression system is interesting as well. The accuracy of the weaponry, uniforms, gears and maps is a great positive.It encourages squad cohesion and discourages lone wolf actions, which makes the gameplay more smarter and tactical. Assaults are made or broken by squad cohesion and support, or lack thereof. The difficulty of the gameplay however carries both positives and negatives.As a positive? It's more challenging, forces you to think more about your surroundings and approach combat with more care and consideration. It makes you more aware of where you are, what the risks are. It keeps you on edge the entire time and it makes for what could be called a very authentic experience of war. I highly apprciate and commend the game for this. I can't stress that enoughAs a negative? Well, at the end of the day it's simply not fun to die twenty times for almost no gain. You could argue this was the point, to show the common reality of the stalemate that plagued The Western Front from 1915-1917, but the game itself has a win state.You put effort into capturing trenches, so clearly there's an end goal with a purpose, so the idea that 'dying constantly is the point' doesn't hold up.I doubt the game is some sort of philosophical deconstruction of the FPS and has valuable things to say on how cruel it is to use real wars as backdrops for FPS games (which is a valuable and important thing to say), because the game incentivises killing by giving you points. Saying 'it's not supposed to be fun because it's WW1' is at odds with the games entire system.The ranking system is there to encourage progression, you get points so you can unlock better weaponry so you can kill more stuff with more ease. There's an end win state, you get points for advancing, following orders, killing people, helping other people kill people etc;If you want to say the game wants to make a point about how horrible WW1 was, maybe don't give incentives to players to kill more people in the game... It's the exact opposite of an anti-war message.So then the simple issue is that, as a game and from a purely game design standpoint, it's not going to be fun for most people. Realism is great and again, i admire, respect and appreciate the game for it's 'realism', but 'realism' does not always mean 'good game design'.I appreciate the game immensly, but to say i always have fun while playing it is inaccurate. The fun is incremental and depends severely. In some games even if you're losing you can say you had fun. In Verdun, losing is an exercise in frustration, soul crushing futility and fury.Maybe the question is should this game be 'fun' at all? Maybe the question should be to define what 'fun' means? Those are questions for a more philosophical essay. Maybe i'll write it one day.The game arbitrarilly deciding your 'attack lost momentum' and theatening to execute you and deduce your progress if you don't retreat back in time (which is almost certain death anyway because you'll most likely be shot in the back as you move with haste) is IMO, completely unneeded in the game. It would be better to simply leave the squads to do their own thing, assault at their own convenience and decide the battle based on their own terms and abilities, and not when the game tells them to.At the end of the day it's simply not fun. There are plenty of hard games that manage to be more fun than this.Ultimatley, even with all the positives, the gameplay is severely hampered by a janky engine and incredibly sluggish movements, to the point where even the niche appeal of difficult gameplay is nullified. I think the game would benefit greatly if the movement speed of the characters and the movement of the aiming was smoother, more fluid and more human. It would give players, IMO at least, a more equal playing field. It would be easier for all players to aim and function better as players on the field.The quality of the gunplay depends severely. Others work fine, some others have sights that are too large for you to actually see anything. Not to mention that aiming in this game is almost literally painful, slow, sluggish, and actually hitting something feels more like luck than any actual skill. Even at the highest aiming sensitivity it never makes much of a difference, your character still moves like a robot with rusty gears. It doesn't fee natural, it doesn't feel fun and it will get you killed at the most inopportune moment, not because the enemy is more skilled, but because the stars aligned and they managed to fight the sluggish aiming to get a good hit on you at that specific moment. Not to mention that hit detection itself is atrocious and some of the weapons are so hampered by beefy, chunky sights and recoil that aiming down the sights is useless, while also being unviable while hip firing, like the BAR.Spawn points are poorly constructed and you can often be picked off by snipers from the other side of the map as you respawn.A lot of the maps are also very poorly constructed and either impossible to defend or to assault. Despite them looking very accurate and appealing, as gameplay maps, they're heavily unbalanced.Most of the roles in the game don't offer much variety, perks or agency. The only class with real agency is the NCO and to me personally, is why it's the most fun to play. It's the only class that makes you feel like you're empowered or useful besides just being a walking murder machine. As a consequence, the lack of an NCO is what destroys squads. There's no system in place to account for it.The machine gunner class is, IMO, counter intuitive to the gameplay. It's a class that often times rellies on being visible, in a game where being visible is a death sentence. Most of the time you will spend with your head, shoulders and arms perched on an incline and failry visible for the MANY sharp shooters, which the game favours heavily.Moving from one spot to the next to avoid being shot is torturous due to the sluggish engine and slow movements of the character. The only actual use for the class i've found is to deny entrances into the trenches, rather than as an implement to deny movement across the whole of No Mans Land.As an aside, the game is utterly unwelcoming to new players. There are a limited ammount of servers and none of them are organised based on skill level, which means new players will get stuck in a server with no knowledge of the map, pitted against veteran players. It doesn't give new and casual players any actual chance to like the game.Another aside, having more representation of Colonial troops would be a welcome sight. Africans and Asians all fought in France and Belgium, and the game would benfit from more variety in roles and abilities.So would i reccomend it? Only as a niche interest to history buffs who don't mind frustrating gameplay, and even then it's not certain. A friend of mine who loves this era of history as much as i do hates the game and described it as 'feeling like you're moving through molasses' and honestly i couldn't agree more.I'm sad that Steam only allows you a binary choice, because it's not as simple as just saying 'don't buy this game' or 'buy this game'. If you're a history buff who appreciates accuracy and a different and more methodical FPS experience based on WW1 you may wanna check it out. But if you're looking for casual fun, please avoid this game.			"

												Verdun is a great game for anyone who is a fan of Military games and the First World War but is willing to play a more realistic game than battlefield 1.GOOD POINTS The devs have put enormous effort into player models and the maps but also they taken care to have distinctive classes for each nation even if some are clearly better in battle. The game runs smooth and looks amazing at max graphics however i would warn players with bad computers that the experience wont be the same because at lower graphics setting the game doesnt look that good. One thing i enjoy is the one shot- one kill approach the devs have taken which is a refreshing break from games such as Battlefield or Call of Duty where it takes several shots to kill a player.BAD POINTSI have a few problems with the game however they are not massive. The first one is that at certain times during the day it is hard to find servers with many players in. This therefore doesnt make you want to play the game as much. The second problem is that the respawn times on this game can be as high as 25 seconds which is a very long time to wait. Also i think the core gameplay would benefit from variety in objectives while playing because in the main gamemode you can spend a very long time just advancing, then retreating, then advancing again without that much enjoyment. It would be nice for side quests maybe.OVERALLTo conclude i think Verdun is a very good game for a reasonable price in the steam store and it is highly underrated as a game and i feel like it deserves a higher user base. It has a dedicated userbase and if you enjoy slower, more tactical combat this is the game for you.			"

												With all the ""cash grab"" games out there today, its nice to support an organization that truly seems honest towards their continued support of their product and their customers. Will be looking for more from these guys in the future.I bought Verdun some time ago and was initially thrilled and disappointed. Thrilled for all that the game did right and the more historical/realistic feel. Yet, I was disappointed/frustrated rather at how difficult the game really was due to optimization, frame rate drops, and just the skill required to make it fun. The game is not so bad once you get the hang of it, but its hard to get the hang of when initially you're getting killed constantly. So, I put Verdun away for a while.  I recently began playing again and cannot begin to explain the improvements that the DEVs have made. Not only is it much more playable, but the tension that is the grind is altogether more fun.  Looking forward to playing more, see you in the trenches!			"

												In my short experience with this game I can say this: You won't know what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on half the time and even if you do you'll probably be curled up in a ball hiding in a bomb crater while artillery shells blast around you or mustard gas burns your lungs out.In this game you either get ♥♥♥♥ed or you do the ♥♥♥♥ing, you will either dominate completely or get bent over and called Mary Sue. The guns are solid and very fun to use which is good because you if you miss a single shot you will probably be sniped, machine gunned, burned alive, or embedded with enough shradnel to be the first piece of human modern art, possibly all at the same time.Sometimes death is inevitable, your NCO says charge and you sprint across no man's land while your comrades are pelted down in a blaze of lead and all you have left is your bolt action and the double stacked sandbags seperating you from 15 guys in one big kill box. Toss a grenade, leap in, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, 6 enemies go down to you before you get sprayed to death by a luger. Then you respawn, walk 5 feet and get your head blown off by a sniper from a mile away.You either GET ♥♥♥♥ED or you DO THE ♥♥♥♥ING. There is no in-between.			"

								For hundreds of years, warfare was seen as a right to manhood. A glorious undertaking. Some would even call it ""great."" As funny as it may sound, the so called Great War would be the very conflict to change our view of, and the history of war, for the rest of time. Sure, some could say that we began to question how glorious war really was with conflicts like the American Civil War, through photographs of the battlefield that made it possible for everyone to see its terror. But it was World War 1, with its global scale and modern technology, that brought the idea of civilized or glorious warfare to a permanent close.   Now, with the release of Verdun, an impressive little game released for harmless recreation, we have another testiment to how horrible the battlefield truly was. While you may have fun charging across No-Man's-Land with your friends, there's no doubt that you will take a look around from time to time, and you can't help but take notice of the blood-soaked fields and mangled corpse-wridden trenches that defined a dark era of our history.   Verdun is a competive team-based game that takes place in the waterlogged trenches of the First World War. The game introduces an interesting squad system that rewards players for working together, improving the gameplay experience and accurately representing the warfare of the time, two effects which give the game tremendous appeal. The game also features engaging and highly-enjoyable gameplay, as players must adapt to the battlefield and the era in order to survive an enemy onslaught, or simply reach the next trench over without joining the ranks of the fallen.    While the game has many attractive features to point out, it's impossible to avoid taking note of the flaws which currently plague an otherwise genius game. Connectivity errors, gameplay glitches, and a few other systematic bugs can greatly damper and even ruin the experience for some players. However, it's also worth mentioning that as an early-beta game, these kinds of things should be EXPECTED to happen, as the development team works to correct key issues and improve the game for everyone.   Overall, I would give the game an 8/10 rating; the best feature of the game being its ability to accurately represent history in a fun and engaging manner, while the worst being the lack of elements that could greatly enhance the game's overall variety and immersion, such as possible units like field medics or engineers. All in all, I would definitely reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys a good multiplayer game, or needs an introduction into the world of pc gaming.    So whether you shout Viva la France or Fur Dass Vaterland, I think it's safe to say that Verdun is a masterful game that anyone can enjoy.			"

This game is fairly realistic not to mention the world war one setting so bodies everywhere. You will be killed by one shot pretty much all the time. This game is brutally challenging but unbelievably enjoyable! Do not play this like CoD or you will keep on dying you rage quit. You must consider your tactics and think rather than just run and gun. Everyone has long ranged accurate weapons that will kill you in about one hit. Cover is a must! Crouch is your best friend when crossing no mans land.

												Excellent game! Likes: - Historical weaponry. Lots of single shot weapons, - Constantly getting killed, quick lesson in the necessity to take cover and calculated risks.- The squad based fighting - got to work in teams. Can be an individual but teamwork gives the enemy other people to shoot at! (Murphy's law of war!).- The backwards and forwards of the battle. Sometimes defending, sometimes attacking, but there is always something going on, and you always have to be active!- Having to ""go over the top"" and the appreciation for fighting your way over no-man's land.- Use of indirect fire support and chemical warfare. GAS GAS GAS! (would be good to have a gas alarm!- Leadership of the NCO is a good feature.Dislikes:- How do you resupply ammo, except for being killed? Why not pick up ammo, or have resupply in the trenches?- Its too clean. Seems all the battles are in summer, in good weather. What about rain, snow, and other adverse conditions?- No mud? The trenches are too tidy. Why not have some flooded?- Why not introduce a medic class? So if a player is wounded, they could be patched up?- There was a learning curve to get to understand some of the games key features. For the first few hours I was just getting killed heaps trying to figure it out. Would be beneficial to make learning the game a bit more intuitive, or to introduce a ""training"" mission so that newbies can learn the game mechanics prior to battle.- After 17hrs, I've reached game level 7 and I still don't know how to level up and change weapon loadouts... how? Could this be better explained in the game?In summary an innovative and enjoyable game. The attention to history is good. WW1 is an often neglected computer game theme. There's an oversupply of WW2 games, and yet this is the only FPS WW1 game that comes to mind.Overall, excellent game. 8/10.			"

								Fantastic game!  Challenging - You die a lot, but keep on going, wave after wave.  After a while you figure out why you are dieing so often.  Then you see the new recruits, like you were once, doing what you did, and shake your head.  Just like I would imagine being in the trenches.Cooperative gameplay - Each role has a part to play.  Play together with your squad and team for best results.  It is hard to do, but that is the next level I am working on.  When you do, it is even more fun.Realistic - In many ways, such as fatigue, breath holding to steady your shot, bullet drop and aiming in front of a running target, flinching when being shot at, confusion when mortars are falling...  Very exciting.  The developers seem to have realism as a priority, and I am grateful for that.  This is no CoD, that's for sure.Historical settings - Gets me reading about and respecting the soldiers who were there, and what they went through.Nice community of players - I don't know why, but most people who play this game are quite nice and helpful.  Maybe it is the cooperative element, or the historical content.  I don't know, but it is a refreshing community. I hope this doesn't change after release.Fun - This game is fast.  Lots of reaction elements mixed in with thinking about the best move. I can't seem to stop playing... "

												The game is really fun, the main problems I have with it though is the ammount of players, and the clunky movement.Sometimes its hard to get into a game because of how little the player base is, and the movemnt on the game is a little too stiff.Other than those two things this game is great and I really like it			"

												I just want to finally get around to fixing this review. About a month or two ago, my problem was fixed.Verdun is a squad-based FPS in which you attempt to storm the enemy trenches, or defend your own. It is a very fun game, and it is definetly worth the buy. This is one of the best games I have probably ever played, and I can't wait to see where the developers will take this game in the future.So, if you like defensive/offensive squad-based FPS, then this game is definetly for you.

												Verdun is an incredible game based around World War 1 trench warfare. really gets your blood pumping with how immersive it can be. it can only take one shot to kill someone. it's important to follow your squad and work together. this isn't call of duty, this is real war. so no puss footin' around in this game, we become men!The devs are awesome and very helpful. I had noted an issue with my game and the issue was resolved within the week with a reply on my forum post assuring it had been fixed, and it certainly was. Highly recommend this game to all players who love fps, ww1, easy kills and easy death and awesome community.			"

												I bought this game on a whim and it is fantastic! The game is almost like a simulator instead of a normal FPS game, because the battles tend to be very slow and drawn out, much like the real World War 1 was. You also die in 1 hit if it's from a rifle or flamethrower, which can be hard to adjust to, but makes the game more immersive and forces you to adapt to the games more tactical nature. I wholeheartedly recommend this game.Also, I don't think the recommended GPU is correct. It says a GPU with 2 GB of video memory is recommended, but I run the game on Ultra with a GTX 550 TI.			"

												Get a shovel, a handful of grenades, and charge in. Throw grenades, get nicked by a bullet, die, respawn, go again. Pretty fun. In all seriousness Verdun is a damn fun game, The guns feel great, grenades feel great, the shovel is awesome, being a meat shield is awesome. The game just feels good, and its hard to find anything to criticize.			"

												Verdun is a ww1 shooter based around realism and immersion. I'm always happy to play this game, as gameplay is usaully fun. I enjoy playing as Machinegun classes and snipers. This being because it requires positioning and skill to play. And because it is very satisying to kill your target without them realising where you shot from. Although like evey game, this game has a couple flaws. I don't like the amount of grenades a class can have and so grenade spam becomes a problem. The movement of characters is a bit cluncky and feels like an early medal of honour game. And barbed wire sucks... You should explain how to remove yourself from it because alot of people die because they didn't know how to clear the wire from themselves. But overall this game is pretty descent and i know i got my money's worth.			"

If you don't want to pay the 17 bucks without having tried it, you can play it for free online. However, the Steam version has better graphics and runs faster.

Lovely game and great maps, weapons and characters!The maps are very raw and unforgiving when it comes to the combat, the core tactic is to keep your head down and advance through the trenches.There are two gamemodes as of now,- Deathmatch, pick a rifle and spawn somewhere on the map and combat with up to 16 other players. Fast paced and very good to learn the weapons and maps.- ""Squad Combat"", two teams where each team is built up on multiple squads. Each squad has it's own theme and abilities and this needs to be taken into account when playing a map since too many of one squad can be bad for the outcome of the match.SquadsThere are different types of squad in the game, each one has their own playstyle. Some are based on calling in mortar strikes or gas, some are recon based and some are more offensive. The right mix of these really makes the matches more enjoyable!One thing though...Only downside at the moment is that there are too many players picking the ""Squad Combat"" mode and playing it as if it was deathmatch, which sucks for the players who want to play the mode as it was intended to be played. This can result in some salty chat and boring experience but most of the time the matches go on and hopefully the players change their playstyle to fit the mode!			"

You will get your moneys worth, the community is mostly mature and the game is really encouraging teamplay without forcing your hand.This game has now become stable, populated and refined. Gore has been Added, the battles are intense and the devs are continously updating it.See you in No Mans Land.			"

The goal of this game is to bring down as many people on the other side with you lol.My only negative comment for this game would have to do with the constant prone blocking that at times can pin your player and force you to stand up into the gunfire of the enemy.Other than that, I for one had a wonderful experience on my first playthrough. I would definitely recommend this game.			"

Certain things may bother some in game. Though it's got nice cosmetics, doesn't require a super high end machine and is relatively easier to learn.

												With over 154 hours on record, I think it's safe to say I know what I'm talking about, when I say that verdun is one of the best competitive shooters, you can buy for authenticity, and a true feel of war. As the quote goes, ""War is hell"" and in Verdun there is no exception, often while storming an enemy trench, you will pause and hear the screams of dying soldiers crying into the sky as their bloody corpses stain the wooden planks, and if you hate chat, simply press f8 and your worries are gone, with chat gone and no minimap, grab some hard tack, a brody helmet, and some webbing fellas time to take a trip to the war to end all wars. To be honest, the devs are from time to time balancing guns and improving the game, but it's safe to say there won't be much else to add to verdun, as the game has been released on ps4 and xbox1 with no sign of upcoming dlc. With the base factions of, Doughboys, Marines, Cheussers Alpins, and many more for the entente, as well as Alpenjager and others for the Central Powers, to counter the Entente. There are a plethera of maps to choose from, that provide you both merciless trench warfare, and relentless onslaughts in the night. All these provide a well grounded playing field for more, ""squad"" based gameplay, where no one man can change the tide of battle. Where well aimed mortar fire, and well placed mg fire can change EVERYTHING. So, what are you waiting for? Buy this game! Hopefully I will see you on the battlefield...

This game is brutally challenging but unbelievably enjoyable! Do not play this like CoD or you will keep on dying you rage quit. You must consider your tactics and think rather than just run and gun. Everyone has long ranged accurate weapons that will kill you in about one hit. Cover is a must! Crouch is your best friend when crossing no mans land.

No major issues...What's so fun about it? Not sure, it might be either the dying or the 'attempts' of hiding, and yet getting caught... Anyhow, you die, a lot... Not just 'a lot' but very, very, very, very often. Most of the time you're alive for about four seconds before either killing someone, or getting killed yourself. Verdun is the kind of game you like from the second you click 'download'.......Or not at all.Over all however, I liked it good enough. A lot of fun playing with friends, highly recommended on my opinion. But who cares about my opinion? Experience it yourself!			"

												Day One : Enlistment As the call to battle came, many brave young souls purchased the game Verdun. Some even took their friends into this war with them, it will be fun they said..Day Two : Deployment Those friends I dragged along into this war were deployed into the same unit as me, the ""Trench Devils"", to fight for king and country. At first it was ok, we were in the trench, the NCO was barking orders to keep our eyes forward, and we had no idea of the slaughter to come.Two Hours Into Day 2 : We heard a whistle go off in the trench infront of us, the Germans began to climb out and charge at us. I let the bullets fly from my Lewis, watching as German after German would fall in death. My comrades were next to me, firing their rifles in perfectly aimed shots. The NCO told us if we keep this up, we may push them back.Three Hours Into Day 2 : The Germans all of a sudden stopped running out of their trenches. The ones left out in the field were picked off, and we didn't quite know what to do. We looked around, unsure if we should celebrate or watch for more. Then the NCO shouted ""Time to climb out and charge!"" as he blew his whistle. We all started running out into the field, I managed to pick a good spot next to a rock to set up my Lewis to provide cover. Soon after, I had ran out of ammunition, so I picked up a nearby rifle. I hadn't realized how many of our own had been mowed down by the dug-in Germans. I looked for my comrades, and finally I saw them about to enter the German trench, so I ran to them while bullets whizzed past my face.Five Hours Into Day 2 : It's over, we have taken the trench, but our NCO is dead, and they put me in his place...

												This is quite possibly one of the best games I've ever played.I started playing this game back when it was on browser and despite the fact I was getting 20fps (I upgraded my PC now), I still loved it.As soon as the game came to steam I decided to buy it and I am glad I did. This game has the most active devs I have ever seen :) They're constantly updating the game and they reply to all your questions within hours (my experiences).Overall I highly recommend this game and if you're still contemplating on whether you should buy the game or not. Just go for it! It's a beast of a game :P			"

								I highly recommend Verdun. A simplistic game of trench warfare and attacking and defending them. Plenty of different tactics available such as rushing in to your death, or tactfully navigating the battlefield. Also, the atmosphere of the game is great. Everything is so dreary and dreadful, to really put you into the mentality that this war was the most horrible thing to happen. The guns are accurate, and sound wonderful. Great visuals, and the updates for this game will only make it better from here.10/10 would get gassed again.			"

												Verdun is a game that really aims to be a realistic depiction of how war was fought during WW1. I think in that respect it succeeds brilliantly. This is trench warfare as it really must have been: - waiting around for the enemy, and then getting shot in the head from somewhere you never saw coming. - going ""over the top"" of the trench on command of your squad leader, and getting mowed down almost instantly.- Capturing an area, only to be hammered with chemical gasses- putting on your gas mask, obstructing your visibility so you can hardly see where (or who) you are shooting.The gameplay is brutal and unforgiving, but hey, this is war! I love how the game doesn't make it ""arcady"" or easy. This makes it all the more rewarding when you get to kill someone. The graphics and lighting are really nice too, being nice and muddy in the trenches, but has a good selection of more colorfull maps as well. If you are not afraid of a challenge, I recommend it!

Best of all, the french are included absolutely free of charge and not as a $20 DLC.			"

												Do you want a COD WW1 ? YES? Then get the fluff out, because this isn't . You can't go waltzing around with your sniper rifle, the only thing you are  going to get are holes. That's why I loved this game so much.Pros:-ww1 setting, and trust me you won't be disappointed-Realism: sometimes I fear leaving the trenches, because you won't even notice when you are dead. There's gas attacks, mortars, snipers, LMG... -Friendly community Cons:-Hard at the beggining, don't worry if you die all the time-Squad system, I actually like it, but it's better with friends- Snipers are freacking impossible to use, if you can crack a kill with it you are mofo proThings you could add:- More guns-I would like to say more factions, but since the game is set in Verdun, it would probably be weird to see some Italians or Ottomans here.-I would like to see more diversity in the rolesOther than that, great game, buy now !Add me when you have done so to play with a friend :D "

												This is ♥♥♥♥ing insane. Gut-wrenching screams everywhere, mass mutilated corpses with some still moving among the bunch, gargling, half burnt people and people with their chins blown off. This is a true representation of the horrors of the Great War. The combat is slow-paced and realistic, you actually need patience for this game. You die mostly with one shot with a rifle, 2 shots with a pistol though. Frontlines is the hardest game mode of them all, it's like you're on an actual battlefield. You have to mostly crawl and crouch your way through the map, one mistake and you're done for. Squad Defence is fun for when you want to just kill some bots without actually getting killed the instant you pop out of cover. You can stand there and farm some kills, then when you go through the trench there's a bunch of bodies just annihilated lying there and writhing. Amazing game, you should definitely buy, especially if you're into historical and realistic games that give you the sense of ""Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this guy's leg just got blown off by a grenade, better not go there"". Absolutely no other game that can give you the same authenticity of the horrors of World War I.			"

The gameplay might not be for call of duty fanatics but I'd say battlefielders could like this and anyone hardcore will like it too. The gas is crazy atomospheric the artillery is great, not alot of games have the balance that Verdun has, no squad or gun is overpowered and all are required for an effective team. My only complaint is that this game doesn't get enough love, this is a masterpeice and needs some appreciation.			"

												After about a solid 100 hours in the game and im still rather a new comer to the title I feel like I can write a solid review about verdun. If your looking for a flashback of simpler times where your skill, accuracy, and timing were rewarded this may be the game for you. Growing up I would spend countless hours on cod, cod2 and all the medal of honors. Although this game is set in ww1 the core mechanics of playing verdun seem very familiar and almost nostalgic to me. The weapons are simple, upgrades make sense, squad work is essential, and everyone has their role. Objectives are very simple and are a constant tug and pull style frontlines that are pretty realistic for the time period. Maps are well designed and balanced for the most part and utilization of cover and map placement is the key to sucess in the frontlines. Graphics are impressive and youll only have a few glitchy textures at far distance but that varies from rig to rig. Sounds are pretty good aside from a few stale sounding explosions (artillery and grenades will kill you alot) but im sure theyll add more. The Historical accuracy of this game was a thing the developers took seriously and it shows, Im a huge history buff and I haven't really noticed anything a miss. The thing that is this games selling point is literally its price at only 22.99USD you can't go wrong with this game and its still in beta with a steady supply of new content. The only real downside is the games small player base or community. Late at night you'll often find it difficult to find full matches even when changing servers EU, JP, ASIA, AUS.  But im sure the games community will only grow from here.			"

												A very fun, fast paced WWI trench warfare first person shooter.  The game has a unique progression system; where not only you progress through levels gaining the ability to access different weapon setups, but you also gain squad levels through playing with other players.  The more you play with the same players the higher your squad rank will progress.  These squad levels are not reset after leaving the game, but each set of players you have played with squad rank is saved and when you team up with them again your squad levels resume where you left off.  All 4 members of the squad are counted in the formula.  The action is fast-paced and brutal.  The enviroment is beautiful and the graphics are very good set at either low or a high.  If you are a fan of first person shooters or WWI or historical warfare games, this game is for you.			"

												One of a kind. First played this at Eurogamer last year out of curiosity and even back then I was impressed and bought it pretty much as soon as i got home. Even though it is super realistic (one shot death) it is still so much fun. You find yourself sneaking around the trenches stalking people and when you finally get that kill on someone yards away, there's no greater more satisfying feeling. But at the same time it's extremely infuriating when you die time after time but that's mainly because you're not used to games being this realistic but you soon adapt. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for an online shooter where it actually is 100% fair. If oyu get shot, you die, it's that simple.			"

								Fantastic game!  Challenging - You die a lot, but keep on going, wave after wave.  After a while you figure out why you are dieing so often.  Then you see the new recruits, like you were once, doing what you did, and shake your head.  Just like I would imagine being in the trenches.Cooperative gameplay - Each role has a part to play.  Play together with your squad and team for best results.  It is hard to do, but that is the next level I am working on.  When you do, it is even more fun.Realistic - In many ways, such as fatigue, breath holding to steady your shot, bullet drop and aiming in front of a running target, flinching when being shot at, confusion when mortars are falling...  Very exciting.  The developers seem to have realism as a priority, and I am grateful for that.  This is no CoD, that's for sure.Historical settings - Gets me reading about and respecting the soldiers who were there, and what they went through.Nice community of players - I don't know why, but most people who play this game are quite nice and helpful.  Maybe it is the cooperative element, or the historical content.  I don't know, but it is a refreshing community. I hope this doesn't change after release.Fun - This game is fast.  Lots of reaction elements mixed in with thinking about the best move. I can't seem to stop playing... "

												Verdun is a very realistic fps of WW1 on the western Front. And in that they do very well. If you like BF1 but wish it was accurate Verdun is for you. However I would like more diversity, particularly in playable countries. I'd like to play as Austrians and italians as an example. Even without that Verdun is a great(but difficult) game.			"

								Verdun is placed in WWI, and it's trench warfare to the max. Maybe I'm a little uninformed, but I think this is really one of a kind. It's very realistic, and almost always a one shot kill. The attack sequences are turn based, in which you have time to charge the other team's trenches and if your attack loses it's morale you defend or if you take the trench you defend your new land. It's a little laggy, but barely. If you're looking for new, multiplayer, and fun gameplay this is for you!			"

												I have been playing this game since Alpha and I am in love.  The develpment team is small but dedicated to putting out a functional product with historical accuracy and enjoyable gameplay.  This was the only ww1 shooter until BF1 and while it may not win a beauty contest, it wins in accuracy and originality.  Weapons are mainly bolt action rifles and pistols, so dont expect Call of Duty.  Combat is extremely unforgiving, almost weapons kill in 1 or 2 shots, but it is extremely satisfying when you get a multikill or win a close quarters duel.  My largest complaint would be the tendancy of teams to get lopsided, but that's mainly a player problem.			"

								Great game, but very glitchy.Before I rain praise on this game (which I will, trust me), Let me get the negatives out of the way. CONS:-Beta, so it's very glitchy at times.-Character roles are not clearly defined (What's a Grenadier do, exactly? What's the difference between Line Infantry and Assault Infantry?)-Sound needs work at times.-Voluntary (?) game balance feature that can be easily ignored.-No land mines (remember, those were introduced in The Great War).And now, the praise:-FANTASTIC use of the Unity Engine-Historically very, very accurate.-An emphasis on realism, not gameplay that makes this that much better. -Heavy emphasis on squad-based tactics and infantry combat. -No player controllable tanks, aircraft or cavalry, keeping the game very balanced in firepower.-A true war sim that showed the horrors of trench warfare, chemical bombardment and constant shelling, along with fighting on grounds that obviously have been fought over for weeks to months, with little to no cover, using bolt-action weaponry.For all the Call Of Duty's, Battlefields and Counter-Strikes in the world, this is a fresh alternative. As a Yank, I would love to see an AEF-themed General Pershing Expansion in 2017 (100 years after the US got involved), along with an expansion into the Eastern front, pitting the White Russians against the Kaiser's troops until the Oktober Revolution ended the war on that side. I furiously recommend this game to ANYONE who likes realistic history-based war games. To the programmers & my fellow players; Great job, guys. See you on the front. "

								There aren't a lot of WW1 shooters out there so I was surprised to see this, and even more surprised to see that the servers were fairly well populated. Oh, it's also pretty fun. That being said, its not for everyone, as afterall it is a WW1 shooter. The guns are all single shot rifles or heavy machine guns, and as a result you'll find yourself getting killed pretty often. Its also not the easiest game to get into and does require teamwork inorder to win, one guy with a bolt action rifle isnt going to clear a whole trench by himself. While the game is pretty fun, the battlefield is ruled by snipers which means that you will never see any machine gun nests since they all get sniped out pretty quickly. I think they should add some night levels to make the machine guns more playable and to reduce the amount of snipers, or add rainy levels or something. Overall it's pretty fun, however I think some balancing is needed and sometimes it crashes, although since it's still in beta I'll let that slide. Definitely get this if you're into WW1 history, and even if you're not you might want to consider it.			"

								An interesting concept, but the creators fail to make the game interesting, At the current state is not worth the 20 euro.But it is only early access, i think this game has potential, we just have to wait and see what the developers make of it.none the less it is good to see a WW1 game amongst the thousands of WW2 games.The mechanics of the game needs to be worked on, you can make a headshot with a WW1 pistol from 500 meters away, there is no bullet drop at all and the bullets seem to fly in a competly straight line.The maps also needs to be worked on. It's not very historic, it's more like a WW1 looking map where everyone just runs around freely and shoots. Don't expect any disipline or proffesionalism.It's a hard choise to recomend this game or not, but i choose to recomend it because there is no game like it and because it has great potential.			"

								Super fun game. I've been waiting for a long time to play a World War One shooter, probably since Medal of Honor Rising Sun. This game is what I've been waiting for. There's a good squad element, and more strategic than other shooters out there. Verdun is very similar to Red Orchestra 2, with different roles and classes that specialize in certain combat situations. The community is for the most part helpful, there is more material on the way, and overall it is a fun game to play, especially with friends. The game is still in Beta, so not everything is perfect, there are sometimes frame rate drops, glitches(especially with cover system), and hit detection. I think I've only experienced glitches that crashed the game once in the past 70 hours. If you buy this game get used to being shot out of nowhere or shelled inside a trench, there is a bit of a learning curve. Overall it is worth the money. Follow your NCO, keep your head down, and charge for the Kaiser!			"

								I have wanted a good World War 1 first person shooter for a long time, and for a long time I heard people say ""Oh it would be so boring. You would just charge and get shot down every time.""Well now a World War 1 first person shooter is out and just in time for the 100th anniversary. They were partially right. I do charge and get shot down MOST of the time, but just as it says in ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" the new troops just charge across the open and die. The veterans know how to move along the ground from cover to cover, and getting into the enemy trench and clearing it out with bayonets, knives, clubs, and shovels is so satisfying. Some people say its hard, but if you work with a squad and move as a team its quite easy. The graphics have improved immensely since I first got this game but alas I am currently living over seas for a year and my good gaming computer is back at home so I can't witness this game at full graphics for another 5 or 6 months. The attack and defend with multiple layers of trenches makes for a fun game. You advance. If you are stopped then you fall back and prepare to defend your original trench. If you take their trench then you dig in and prepare to repulse a counter attack. The front is somewhat narrow to give you that World War 1 trench warfare feeling but its not so narrow that its completely impossible to move without dying. Sometimes you can sneak around if the enemy neglects a portion of their line, or you can gas or artillery barrage their lines to force an opening.All in all, if you are looking for a fun, squad based World War 1 first person shooter with a surprising variety of weapons and classes for a war 100 years ago then get this game, and I will see you out in no man's land.

								Verdun is a shining example to other developers, showcasing what a successful 'Early Access' title looks like.Countless numbers of games have entered into 'Early Access,' only to see their developers lose interest once they've already made the bulk of their profits and have no real financial incentive to continue. That is absolutely not the case here--the development team on Verdun clearly has a personal commitment to seeing an online WWI FPS actualized. The most notable part of my experience playing was seeing how often updates and improvements were pushed out, as well as the sheer quality AND quantity; tons of new content, updated textures and animations, improved and balanced gameplay tweaks, performance patches, and even a large overhaul of the game's engine. Not at one single point during the development did it appear as though the developers were living off of their unfinished game, or abusing their fan base's loyalty to work extremely short hours. I'm thrilled to see the official release of this game, as well as it serving as an example of how 'Early Access' was able to positively influence a game throughout development.The game itself is quite fun; the mechanics are fleshed out and very unique. The game modes are nicely objective-oriented without feeling forced or arbitrary. Everything ranging from the game's graphics to its audio feel cohesive, giving an immersive feel of the era. If you've ever wished you could check out a WWI shooter, or simply want to support an indie developer that deserves it, this is your game.Other 'Early Access' developers, TAKE NOTES!			"

								Verdun is a trench based warfare game which is all based in WWI. The weapons in this game are chronologiclly correct and provide many ways to improve and hone in all of your gaming skills.Also this game you must be a bit stealthy and work together with your squad and team. This game doesn't consist of any COD or Battlefield BS, what i mean by this is that when you get shot your dead,there is no perks or speed reloading,or any type of nonsense.This is a game built for team players and people who can work together,don't get me wrong you can run in nomansland and get shot up or work together and cover your flanks,push,and run in the enemy trenches and stab them all.But the main aspect i love about this game is that all the weapons are balanced,every weapon has its pros and cons and provides what it needs where its needed.Also the game has only 2 Devs! which still blows my mind of how they produce updates which make the game magnificently better.So I recommend to purchase this game if your are into working together like CSGO. Personnally i give this game a 8/10 because it does have flaws here and there also the game is still buggy and does glitch out but its still in Beta so you have to give them that.			"

Early Access Review
								With the hour that I've played Verdun, I can attest that it is a game whose developers have actually put quite a lot of effort behind their project and actually have a scope and plan. I can see Verdun becoming an actual game with a fairly large community, despite a bit of a niche of WWI games.First off, my complaints are that the art assets quite aren't there yet, but since this is Early Access it's forgivable, and I'll mostly just base these complaints on the current build as of writing (v173). The game isn't pretty in it's current state, it's not exactly ""ugly"" but some things like the lighting engine need work, and the models and textures a bit more refinment. My biggest problem in this department are the audio assets. Everything seems to lack volume and weight to the sound. Gunfire coming from a squadmate next to me sounds piddly and weak. Explosions are slightly better but still a tad under par.Another is that it feels a bit too... gamey, I suppose, rather than a much more immersive, realistic experience. Bullets don't currently have a drop yet, and currently uses a CoF (cone of fire) model as far as I can see, and a bit of a deadzone a la Red Orchestra as well as some ballistics physics would help immensely. As it stands, trying to fire a Webley at a target less than 50m away even while using ironsights is difficult to pull off. Movement is very floaty, and everything currently lacks weight.Another thing is that the game currently lacks VOIP, which makes it difficult to really communicate with your team although there is a text-chat system in place. What I'd like to see is maybe a ""radio"" chat within your squad (which needs to increase, btw, at most up to 6 or 8 players otherwise it may be difficult for large groups of friends to play together)My final complaint would that the game feels too small. 32 player combat, each with 4 squads of 4 fighting on 5 different maps ranging from smaller maps like Vosages to larger battles of Picardie. While a 32 player battle definitely feels right on Vosages, it feels sparse on much more larger maps. While no doubt more maps will be coming out soon of various sizes, those smaller maps would be better for Deathmatch rather than TDM which should host a larger player size (at least 64 but 96 would be fantastic, if even a bit of a stretch).So, why should you buy the game? Well so far the developers have done a pretty sweet job, despite my gripes above, but that's all they are for now. Most of that is simply based on what's been accomplished so far, and even in its early stage, it's still quite a playable game! The mechanics that are there aren't broken (but could use tweaking here and there), and there's enough players on at a time that it's not difficult to find yourself amongst a charge of screaming soldiers all before you're cutdown by MG and riflefire, and getting trapped in barbed-wire, because you didn't think it'd serve a purpose other than a prop, now did you?Would I recommend this game? Yes I would, but I'd advise watching some gameplay footage first, to see if the game would be right for you. And remember, although I wrote quite a bit on the flaws of this game, it's much easier to do so when the game is still in Alpha, not to mention that some of my own personal gripes might not be that big of a deal to yourself.

												Verdun - A FPS for people who want a difficult and more realistic shooter.  This is not for people who are looking for another Battlefield/CoD clone. Verdun is a gritty game where most people have bolt action rifles, use iron sights, and have to constantly be on the look out for machine gun fire, gas, and artillery bombardment. The developers made Verdun with realism in mind. You adopt a role within a squad and can choose from one of three layouts for that role. The only cons in this game are a severe lack of kicking abusive players.  "

								nice game, but it could be more realistic. What I mean with realistic is: if you're hit that the wound doesn't heals it self, but than you have to use a bandage, or that you bleed to death (like in Red Orchestra 2 Heroes of Stallingrad). Second, there isn't blood, it would be more realistic with blood.			"

								Its early access, and some things are a bit rough still or not there at all.It's a truly fantastic game. Be warned, you will need to play it alot to get good. Alot of people rage quit after a few hours.  You will likely get killed ALOT at first. There are players with hundreds of hours of play time that know every map inside out. Just keep playing and you will get to enjoy this game more than most other shooters.Also be warned it uses the Unity engine. So performance is pretty poor for what it is. And likely will never be great in this department. It is a shame, but just turn the gfx down and enjoy it anyway.It's worth every cent I paid. Would of payed more!			"

								8.5/10For a game that is still in early acess, this is incredibly advanced.Pros:-It has a wide variety of classes, ranging from trench bomber to sniper.-Classes are varied based on what nation your squad is from.-Very realistic and historically accurate gameplay.-High-Quality Graphics-Guns feel realistic and require some skill, and are also the same as those used in the period.Cons: Not many-Warfare on foot only, no tanks, horses, or planes.-I've had a few issues with invisible barbed wire in the past, but I think these have been resolved.

The community is pretty nice as well, as I would expect when it's this small.Fun WWI FPS, would recommend to fans of history and WWX FPSs in general.			"

If you are considering purchasing this, I will admit that it's pretty buggy. I've gotten anything from invincibility to the game literally never ending. Still love it. If you don't want to pay the 17 bucks without having tried it, you can play it for free online. However, the Steam version has better graphics and runs faster. Plus, the money will support the devs and their amazing game. I highly reccomend picking this up.			"

												UPDATE: Im a little concerned. The game that worked fairly well seems to be very problematic all of the sudden, today, 5/4/15. Just tried playing in a few games and something is very wrong. Usually my k/d is about 10 to 1. Today, every spawn is putting me into a position of insta-death. Enemy players literally invicible. I watched enemies spawn behind our ""Defend"" position and way behind me. (as I was running back to get some distance with a scope I see a player spawn in...its an enemy. Not supposed to be happening at all. They are shooting through large (vertical heigh) of ground. And not to mention walking through ground. This isnt on just one server. Ive tried a few and saw all of the above. So waht is going on?? I really hope the devs didnt just ruin a very well made game.ORIGINAL REVIEWWay better than Battlefield Hardline! It actually worksIve only played for a few minutes. But anyone who plays a lot of FPS can immediately tell of the game is any good. It is. Its just great. Period. Now, that doesnt mean that there arent some stupid little unfriendly quirks. But there arent enough to impact any overall score of the game.I will do a more in-depth review - detail the positives along with the negatives - in the next few days. Until then, buy it so I can blow your head off when you peek out of the trench!Added (5/1/15): Another great thing about Verdun is you can jump into a game fast, play a round, and be done. Since the load times are almost non-existent (and Im only using an HDD) its not like other mass multiplayer games that take 5 minutes or more just to get into the match. Try hopping into a Battlefield game quickly. It wont happen. I can brew a pot of coffee in the time it takes to load me into a server. Verdun starts up fast, joinining games is fast. The whole process works			"

Looking forward to expansions.  One frustrating thing is the snipers who pick you off as soon as you step out of the trench, but charging the trench does get the adrenaline going.  Rifle Free For All not the best of the game modes...join a squad and jump in.  Love that the Cdn's are represented here.  Worth the price.			"

												After playing the game through Early Access and the Full Release, I must say that this game is possibly one of the best Squad-based tactical FPS out there if not the best. The WW1 scenario feels fresh for those who are beginning to get tired with Modern FPS, the different maps also look very realistic and even on low the graphics are pretty good in my opinion. The weapons perform like they are supposed to and you can't just go around shooting from the hip with a MG or 360 no scope with your sniper rifle. The squad mechanics are pretty good, as you level up your squad the different classes for that squad will get  a certain boost, Ex. Grenadier can throw grenades quicker. There are different types of squads each with their unique classes, currently you can choose between different German/Austro-Hungarian or French/Commonwealth squads. I think this is a great game that deserves more recognition.			"

								I started playing this about a year ago in June or so and was very impressed with how it played and how intense it was even through the bugs and funny animation. One of my favorite updates was the improved Rag-doll effect and since I usually play as Landsers NCO it is fun to watch the little French men fly up in the air after an Artillery Strike. The game kept improving a lot with the sound effects, animation and general design and feel getting better. I liked how nice and small the community was when I started and I felt a bond with other players who I've met. Now with a much larger and growing community, the game is truly starting to feel like a WWI game with massive numbers coming towards you.This game relies heavily on cooperation and pulling off strategic attacks. It really becomes better as time grows on and I like how the Squad Progression works out as it makes you want to play with friends more often and to be your best.My tip in playing NCO is to get near the enemy trench (if you're offence) and try your best to survive, find a nice hiding place inside the trench if possible, this will allow your teammates to spawn near you and make it easier to clear the trench.I'm probably the only or the few in game named ""Erwin Rommel"" if you want to find me to ask for tips or to just play together. I'm usually the NCO in any German Squad.*Edit: I should also add, I am not sure if it's the game's animation or just my internet that usually shows the enemy aiming at completely different area when he's actually aiming at you.

I'm happy that the developers aren't just saying that they will add in features, and that patches will be regular, they DO IT. Updates are frequent, thorough, and necessary. The game is VERY well balanced and from my own knowledge spot-on hsitorically accurate. If you enjoy strategic mulitplayer FPS's without taking things too seriously or too lightly, I'd suggest Verdun, it's great and it's cheap!			"

												Verdun - the best game about First World War since... ehm... hmm. This game proved that ""boring"" and ""monotonous"" trench warfare can be bloody fun. War is hell. You hear your commander whistle, you jump off the trench, you see your buddies run straight into chlorine cloud. Your squadmate tries to put on gas mask and misses the barbed wire, gets entangled in it. Your other friend turns to him, looks, thinks about helping him, but gets nailed with an enemy bullet. French, British, American, German, Canadian, Belgian... No man's land is just a giant mincer, chopping off your lives short. You see how people in front of you get mowed, running straight into machine gun crossfire. You have a split second to decide: do I crouch and turn back? Maybe I can get through? You are wrong. You will never get through. And even if by some miracle you make it to the enemy trench, you'll get ambushed by a rifleman, hiding behind a barrel. As the time goes, you'll see young soldiers become veterans with waxed moustaches, ready to die for their Fatherland. But is it really worth fighting?If you start thinking about it all, you might miss the command to retreat. The next thing you see is your lifeless body flying away, while the mortars hammer your position. Unless you affix your bayonet and charge your enemy, how dare you claim to know anything about true dirt and pain of virtual warfare? Get immersed into this painful world of war, and remember lads: It's a long long way to Tipperary			"

												The Good: This isn't your normal first person shooter where you can run around on your own and rack up the points. Sure, you can do that in Verdun, but it won't get you anywhere very far. The gameplay is based around solid team work and good communication, something you don't normally expect to see worked into fps games often. It makes for an enjoyable and satisfying gameplay in a time setting that is not explored through games very well, but the sounds, guns, and different maps really put you feel like you're in the Great War, hunkering down trying to avoid bullets and artillery, and then sprinting to the enemy trench to take out the enemy. The Bad: There isn't really anything terrible that I have encountered yet in Verdun. I suppose one improvement I can suggest for the developers, however, is to somehow implement a tank or two on the battlefield, a major part of the war. You are able to use a lot of new ""modern"" weaponry in the game like grenades, machine guns, submachine guns, gas, and even planes, but no tanks. The team balancing sytem is a nice and welcome touch, but sometimes the game is too lopsided and things can turn south every game. Not sure exactly how to better that. In summary, it's a fun and creative WW1 fps. If you're looking for a different type of shooting game, I'd recommend this one.			"

												100 year anniversary of the battle of Verdun might as well do a review. Game is pretty awesome, highly recommend it. Not for run and gun shooter fans, this game takes patience, intelligence and team work. Each match plays like King of the Hill with a series of trenches, where one side defends and the other side attacks. If attackers take the defenders trench within the time limit (I think 5 minutes) then the timer is reset, and defending team has to retake their trench, if they fail to do so then they retreat to the next trench behind them. Eventually one side is either pushed too far back to their last trench, or the overall game timer runs out and the side who captured to most trenches win. The Squad system is pretty interesting, but with some issues. There are multiple squad types each having different rolls, and thus having different soldier types available, but most people play using the German Landers, French Poilues, or British Tommes squad types because they have the most streight forward soldier types in their squad; An officer who uses a pistol by default but can level up to have a rifle and can call in artillery, a Rifleman who can upgrade to be a sniper, A machine gunner who can use a machine gun (go figure), or a Grenadier who carries a lot of grenades.Apparently the squads themselves level up but from my experience once you create a squad there’s no way to find it when you stop playing and come back later. Usually I find myself joining free spots on existing squads anyway, so take this bit with a grain of salt. Overall a pretty cool Objective FPS that you can play with friends or by your self. Pros:-Great First Person Shooter, very tactical heavy requiring teamwork, brains and patience. -Straight forward role system that unlocks as you level up. -Various maps that have different challenges as you try to fight through them. -Non Toxic player community that is actually pleasent to banter with in the chat. Cons:-Player population very, sometimes its hard to get into a server, other times its deserted. -Wonky Animations, but they're still working on it. -Some LOD issues with terrain where you can sometimes see players through objects like sandbags or obstacles that are far away.

												I lay in the trenches of the german first line listening to the mortars drop and the machine gun bullets wizzing by over my head. I take brief pod shots at the enemy line but have a hard time seeing anything through the grime and smoke. Then I hear an all too familair sound.....Für das Vaterland! Attacke! Attacke! Our NCO had just ordered us to charge the enemy lines and seeing that spreading cloud of chlorine gas on the horizon sure dident help puersuade the descision. I briefly considered shooting myself in the foot or hiding behind our line somewhere but what real soldier would do that? ""Screw it"" I thought, and with that I bounded up out of the trenches and proceeded to run for my life hearing noise of war and whistle of bullets all around me. Knowing if I hesitated now, even for a second, I would most likely end up facedown in the mud. Reminding myself of the noise variances akin to bullets, A hiss means its close but a snag means its a near miss. If you hear the latter then you better hit the ground like a fat man chasing a doughnut. Needless to say the next several minutes are a blurr of mud, screams, and smoke. Seeing several of my comrades fall in front of me and not get up again, knowing I might soon be joining them I close the bolt on my Grewher 98 as I get close enough to the enemy line to see heads moving about. Several of my fellows in a foxhole beside me raise up to run into the enemy trench which lay devestated from artillery fire, I notice movement in front of me. Several brits had rose up to take shots at my allies. I expose myself out of my fox hole and pick them off using 3 of my 5 shots earning myself 4 kills, as one of my bullets had went through my enemies neck and into his NCO behind him,  I see my friends scramble into the trench all safe from the horrors of No Mans Land. Then I see more movement on my right and turn to see the barrel of a MG sticking out amonst the sandbags. I close my eyes muttering a curse under my breath and accept my fate as I hear the sound of the machine gun open fire.I reopen my eyes and find myself back in the trench I had just fought my way out of just to do it all over again. Except now the enemy was charging us.9/10 would die for my friends againP.S. Listen to a Sabaton playlist while playing this, its OP as ♥♥♥♥ >:D			"

								Nice game. It will probably be a nice game when ready. But there is problems.-No bullet drop what makes sniping with rifles too easy when trench wars should be close combat.-You get shot in the head even if in your screen looks like you are behind cover.-Sometimes times you get killed immediately when you spawn.-There is no VAC.-''ghost bug'' and ""Failed to add local player"" bugs.I personally don't like the ranking system and that there is only one weapon untill you reach level 50.There should be more weapons and change. I don't like the bullet physics/processing.Bullets don't drop and many times you just hear a shot or see a flash and then you are dead.I like that the game is historically accurate and that the voices are good.Maps are accurate and fun to play. The squad system is nice. Playing with same players give the squad a bigger squad level with gives many kinds of effects for everyone.The game is good but it has still many things to fix/add/improve.7/10			"

Early Access Review
								Absolutely love this game.  I have played many FPS games, but this one is definitely unique.  As far as I know this is the only fully fledged WW1 first person shooter.  I have played the WW1 mod for BF1942 which was great, but nothing like this.    Verdun does remind me of Red Orchestra, but I actually enjoy this game more.  I have recently become more interested in everything WWI thanks to a podcast I listen to called Hardcore History by Dan Carlan.  So a couple months back I looked to see if there was a good WWI game that would represent the war well.  This game certainly does.  The trench warfare mode is fantastic and really replicates the fierce battles that those men had to endure.  The mechanics of the game are great.  There is a slight bullet drop, but nothing too noticeable. It is really more realistic than the bullet drop you would experience in Battlefield Bad Company 2.  The maps are fantastic and replicate the uniqueness of the war.  I hope that someday the battles will be increased to 48 or 64 players.  Problem is the server populations are pretty small right now.  Hopefully with the official release of the game more people will play.  This game is pretty difficult.  You will not be able to run and gun like you can in Call of Duty.  If you play Red Orchestra or Battlefield you may be able to not mind the long wait period to respawn.  Successfully capturing a trench will require patience and teamwork.  Gas and artillery strikes will be essential to pull this off in most battles, but this adds to the fun for me.  Highly recommend this game.			"

												I'm a huge FPS lover, expecially those concerning WWII. This is definitely the best WWI FPS ever made, and one of the most realistic and difficoult FPS available right now. Pros:- It's a good WWI FPS, isn't that enough?-Realism is high. There are many details that amazed me, such as weapons (every army has its own ones used during the war), battlefields and tactics (throw arty/gas and then charge the enemy trench, defend your one with mgs)-Conquering an enemy trench after loosing many men is such an huge satisfaction! So it is defending it from the enemy charge that will try to take it back.-The squad system works very well.-The game succesfully manages to transport you in the WWI atmosphere with many details, such as menus, musics and images.Cons:-Not all maps are balanced. There are a few where the two opposing trenches are really unconquerable by both armies, vanishing in part the excellent balance made between the armies.-The game is really hard. sometimes frustrating. If you're an Insurgency/Red Orchestra player, you will find at home. If you come from more arcade FPS, you probably won't like this game.-There are a few bugs concerning bullet hits and directions. Sometimes, you will aim directly at an enemy, shoot at him and the bullet won't simply hit him.  -The maximum number of players in a map is 32, not very much if compared with other similar games like Red Orchestra 2 or Battlefield 4.Overall, I really appreciated this game, and I bet that every historical FPS lover will do the same. In the future, I hope that developers will fix the few bugs I found and add more maps, factions and theatres of war. Fighting at Gallipoli, Tannenberg and on the Isonzo river would be really amazing! 9/10			"

												So I bought Verdun today for the Steam Summer sale and let me tell you, it is one of the best gaming experiences I have had. The game is unlike any other fps in the way it portrays warfare, and I felt like I was a small part of a bigger machine, instead of the main character. I booted up the game and joined a squad on the allied powers, looked breifly through the controls and got right into it.Verdun is a very easy game to get into, and it's immersiveness is unreal. I have a small story to tell about it too:So I joined a squad in the trench warfare gamemode (the main one), and the central powers were losing. I was in a german squad as a Bote (Bolt action, bayoneted rifle)It was the enemy's turn to attack, and they were pushing our right flank hard. My squad was holding the left flankSeveral people wanted to retreat and regroup, as much of our team was disorganized or deadI typed in chat ""WE'RE HOLDING THE DAMN LINE""My team agreedPeople were typing ""FUR DEUTSCHLAND""I sprinted across open field under intense fire to a shell crater right in front of where the enemy were pushingOur squads MG suppressed the enemy, who were taking cover behind sandbags and small cratersI popped up and started shootingI killed 5 men by myself and pushed the others back, while my teammates prepared for our assault. You know how I said this game made you feel like a small cog?Well that's how it is %99 of the time. But in that %1 percent, you do some amazing thing, like turn back an assault, or charge and breach the line, or mow down the enemy team, and that is what makes this game fun. A balance of teamwork and individual performance affects the outcome of the game, not what loadout you have or the DLC you bought, like many other games. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a team-based shooter. If you don't like those types of games, just try this one out. You can always refund.			"

												The game does a fantastic job of portraying the western front of World War 1. The rules after an intial periode of confusion (especially when it comes to unlocking weapons) do a good job of switching the defencive and offensive roles. There are however a few imbalances in terms of uniforms (the french blue and red uniforme for example) and weapons, but these are entirely attributable to the historical accuracy of the game seening as they are an exact copy of the historical versions.

												Verdun is a fun game, however it takes time to learn how to play it well. Verdun is not a brainless shooter like Call of Duty. Verdun is a FPS strategy game, and also a pretty good simulator. For anyone playing for the first time, I will tell you this, you are going to die a lot. Now don't take all that ""getting your face blown off by some gentlemen with a mustache"" to shame, think of it as an inspiration to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of a kraut with a shovel. This game, in all of its greatness does have its flaws and I'll share with everyone how I fixed a most of them. First off this game is poorly optimized and you will have to make adjustments based on your computer, now this game when I first had it ran between 5-20 FPS on average whether on max. settings or min. settings.My computer runs Windows 10, and I had to disable PreFetch and SuperFetch to make this game and many other games run freaking awesome. I can now play this game on high settings with 55-80 fps on average with AA off. 10/10 would WW1 and optimize settings again.   "

												I never do reviews but I gotta tell you, if you are looking for a realistic WW1 shooter then this beats BF1 by far. Fun and intense combat since you know that the weapons kill you in 1-3 bullets and that leads to some really intense corner peaking, sniper battles, squad cooperation.The community is really close and you will make friends and foes really quickly. The only real problem I can think of is that the Netcode is kind of bad. This affect things like: When I go from standing to crouching it takes longer for the game to register that I am crouching than it takes for my own screen so sometimes it looks like you are crouching on your screen but when you die you see that you actually are still standing up, the delay is only about 1 second though (I think at max?) but I don't see this as a major problem and I would really recommend this game for everyone. Extra fun with friends!			"

												This game is a lot of fun. The weapons are historically styled and much different than those found in other shooters, and this leads to interesting gameplay that focuses more on precision and careful timing. The maps are cool recreations of WW I battlefields with loads of shell holes and trenches to take cover in. The game objectives are constantly changing depending on which team has taken certain objectives and this leads to big swings in momentum and lots of excitement. If you enjoy history, shooters, squad-based gameplay, or all of the above, definitely check this one out.			"

												The way I see this game, you can play one of two ways. A sniper who will end anyone from any distance, or a sniper's victim. With good positions like I have found, a single sniper can hold off several rushing oppenents with ease. I even tend to ignore the rushing players and target enemy snipers. This might not be how others see this game, but I only snipe. I do nothing else. So if you like sniping this game will give you a rush.			"

												I have Asperger's Syndrome, and as such, a very big interest in history and especially the first and scond world war.I personally feel, that there is a big, or rather enormus lack of games about The Great War, and this  game is a huge testimony that the First World War can be ag great place for a lot of game developors to explore.From thhe guns, to the sounds of the explosions and the environment, this game fells like you're rushing to your death in No Man's Land. And I like that feeling. The feeling that you can die every minute, the omnious feeling that if you don't fight, you'll die a horrendous death by the hands of your enemies.So, by all means, if you like the First World War and what I have to say about the game. Then try to look up some videos on Youtube or buuy it when it is on sale.Ps. sorry for my grammar mistakes, I was rather tired when I wrote this reccomendation. Have a good day. :D			"

The game itself is really enjoyable because it does a good job of recreating the ambiance of the time period. On top of that I think it is the best of the very few fps that are based in WW1.

Early Access Review
								For hundreds of years, warfare was seen as a right to manhood. A glorious undertaking. Some would even call it ""great."" As funny as it may sound, the so called Great War would be the very conflict to change our view of, and the history of war, for the rest of time. Sure, some could say that we began to question how glorious war really was with conflicts like the American Civil War, through photographs of the battlefield that made it possible for everyone to see its terror. But it was World War 1, with its global scale and modern technology, that brought the idea of civilized or glorious warfare to a permanent close.   Now, with the release of Verdun, an impressive little game released for harmless recreation, we have another testiment to how horrible the battlefield truly was. While you may have fun charging across No-Man's-Land with your friends, there's no doubt that you will take a look around from time to time, and you can't help but take notice of the blood-soaked fields and mangled corpse-wridden trenches that defined a dark era of our history.   Verdun is a competive team-based game that takes place in the waterlogged trenches of the First World War. The game introduces an interesting squad system that rewards players for working together, improving the gameplay experience and accurately representing the warfare of the time, two effects which give the game tremendous appeal. The game also features engaging and highly-enjoyable gameplay, as players must adapt to the battlefield and the era in order to survive an enemy onslaught, or simply reach the next trench over without joining the ranks of the fallen.    While the game has many attractive features to point out, it's impossible to avoid taking note of the flaws which currently plague an otherwise genius game. Connectivity errors, gameplay glitches, and a few other systematic bugs can greatly damper and even ruin the experience for some players. However, it's also worth mentioning that as an early-beta game, these kinds of things should be EXPECTED to happen, as the development team works to correct key issues and improve the game for everyone.   Overall, I would give the game an 8/10 rating; the best feature of the game being its ability to accurately represent history in a fun and engaging manner, while the worst being the lack of elements that could greatly enhance the game's overall variety and immersion, such as possible units like field medics or engineers. All in all, I would definitely reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys a good multiplayer game, or needs an introduction into the world of pc gaming.    So whether you shout Viva la France or Fur Dass Vaterland, I think it's safe to say that Verdun is a masterful game that anyone can enjoy.			"

												Great World War 1 First Person Shooter, decent graphics, realistic feel and look and quite fun to play, some people take this game very seriously the way they play which is cool, the game is challenging and rewards people who hold down areas and sit around and wait for people to come to them (basically camping if you are a scrub and call it that) and you will die if you rush, at least at the wrong time. It requires you to be patient and each team has about 4 or 5 squads each with 4 players in the squad and each squad uses different sort of classes so you get a rifle and maybe binoculars or a pistol and a grenade or a big light machine gun and revolver and stuff like that so you may need to swap roles with another player because no 2 roles are identical.I'd say its worth buying, probably go for a sale, $25 is a bit much.

								8/10So for this game. First of all... they need an Australian server. But once you get used to the ping its seriously freaking awesome. Squad based work encourages teamwork. The German MG demands a second man to keep him alive. All of the rifles are well modeled, the scopes are well made. All of the weapons are realistic enough so you get a good feel for the style and yet balanced enough so that nobody ragequits too much. Overall it'll be the best game if it gets an Aussie server.

								There aren't a lot of WW1 shooters out there so I was surprised to see this, and even more surprised to see that the servers were fairly well populated. Oh, it's also pretty fun. That being said, its not for everyone, as afterall it is a WW1 shooter. The guns are all single shot rifles or heavy machine guns, and as a result you'll find yourself getting killed pretty often. Its also not the easiest game to get into and does require teamwork inorder to win, one guy with a bolt action rifle isnt going to clear a whole trench by himself. While the game is pretty fun, the battlefield is ruled by snipers which means that you will never see any machine gun nests since they all get sniped out pretty quickly. I think they should add some night levels to make the machine guns more playable and to reduce the amount of snipers, or add rainy levels or something. Overall it's pretty fun, however I think some balancing is needed and sometimes it crashes, although since it's still in beta I'll let that slide. Definitely get this if you're into WW1 history, and even if you're not you might want to consider it.			"

By far the best FPS out there...I feel like when i play games like battlefield and heroes and generals along with red orchestra the realism just is not yet there its more of a run in  gun type of game. this game makes you play the objective where as other games let have the freedom to run around. Which is good if you like call of gayness. I like difficult strategy games that require teamwork..Who likes an easy game where you can just run around and do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want that gets boring..I play to win games and this game can last you a while like this game could but other games just get boring..Adolf Hitler ist ein Chef ich liebe Hitler , er ist ein verdammt Tank will ich seine enge♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥zu blasen und lecken seinen Schwanz Deutsch mein Freund ist mit einer ekelhaft emo♥♥♥♥♥♥ die ein Bild von ihr Zeitraum Blut , jemand in meiner Schule geschickt zogen shes ein verdammt wierdo  卐 卐 卐			"

												Great WW1 feel. Large weapon selection. Varied maps for close up trench warfare or battles across no mans land. Specific moments when weapons have advantages such as grenades and flamethrower class in trenches and snipers in long range picking off. Light machine guns are effective in situations too. Rifles are single shot which makes shooting tacticalThe main game mode with most players have games based on attacking an enemy trench line, holding it, and then preparing for the other teams counter attack. Or defending the attack, if you successfully defend then you change to attacking and attack the enemy's foward trench. Battles can go back and forwards, reach stalemates or one team may advance the furthest and win. Its an objective based game, so if you can find people to get on comms with then it can be greatMost guns apart from some pistols are one shot kill, no matter where you hit themRealistic, atmospheric battles with artilery strikes and gas warfareOverall great game if your looking for a tactical shooter with fun/varied weapons, maps and classes. Great battles. This is not like COD, not an arcade run and gun shooterBe warned: you will die a lot when you start out, and still die when you know the game more. This is a realistic game with one shot killing			"

												Where to start with Verdun...Verdun is an FPS with a lot of potentail in the future, the developers saw an opening in the market for this genre of FPS and have really shown what they are capable of. As of 15/08/16 this game has improved soo much over recent years and for me, is a viable game to spend hours upon playing. Verdun is relatively bug free (some here and there after patches) and very well optimised for all of its users, causing this game to excell in it's market field. However Verdun has not always been this way, me personally i have owned this game from it's initial Alpha launch and don't get me wrong it was still beautiful in it's initial launch. Giving all of it's places that as realistic as possible feeling of WW1, whilst also keeping it fun and relatively interesting. Over time this game has had it's ups and downs especially with major patches in the past, causing fps issues and huge server bugs. But to my suprise the development team have stayed strong through and through with it's development and achieving it's goal as, one of the best WW1 Shooters. This is because the develoopment team have listened to their players, taken their advise and morphed it into their own ideas aswell. After meeting these guys at Eurogamer you can tell they have put their hearts and souls into this game, all for it to have paid off :)Just wan't to say good luck with the console launch and keep improving this game... Thankyou|------------------------------------------------------MUST BUY------------------------------------------------------------|			"

												After experiencing Verdun for quite a few months by now, I can see myself fit to write an, at least half-legible, poorly-translated-from-my native-language, review about this fine work of entertainment.Well, this game has offered me something that I have not experienced in quite some years now – heck too many years to be honest; playing a FPS in which I am not bothered by extreme discrepancies between veteran players and fresh recruits; dare I call them like this; and a game that truthly encompasses what a shooter should feel like. There is no pay to win mentality, unlike most triple A shooters. The community is friendly; I haven't met anyone hostile really, well at least not too hostile to be annoying. It’s realistic – yes! ARMA-like realistic – not quite. But truth be said if we were to make a 100% realistic WWI shooter, that would just mean creating a getting-mowed-down-by-machine-guns simulator 2016. It has balance in it, yet the balance is quite subtle. (Don’t get me wrong machine-guns will mow you down, but maybe not as often)For most players that are out there and are tired of all these damn pieces of publicly appealing crap (ahem; COD), Verdun might sound for a good alternative and believe me, it is.Honestly enough I am really glad that I decided to spend 10 Euros on that late May day, deciding to buy this game; it really feels it was worth it.Another strong point to this game is the setting; I mean, to this date, WWI hasn't got its proper fps (yeah, yeah BF1 is coming soon I know; but honestly do you want a somewhat legit representation of The War to End All Wars, or do you want Hollywood-style special effects?). I know that game developers see this historical period as something rather dull; truth is that this war was indeed a meat grinder. And, as the war was, expect to die in this game, and die a lot. Yet despite all this death and misery, you realise the true value of this game and the awesome work the devs have done. I mean they turned one of the saddest and most brutal chapters from the history of mankind into a quite exciting and – well, I say it now - authentic experience.Thus, if you feel it's worth a shot, try this game out; one may be pleasantly surprised by it.19/18 I would go over the top and die... again "

												While It lacks the the bombastic feeling of big name AAA shooters, Verdun offers much more simple approach to the FPS genre. And that approach is simply Historical accuracy. Verdun isn't just some budget game, its a completely unique game that no other comes close to in pace, feeling and overall realistic brutality. Fans of Red Orhcestra would feel at home here, and anyone who wants an actual WW1 shooter should look at this more than Battlefield 1.			"

												As a person who enjoy realistic tactical shooters like Arma, Insurgency and Squad, Verdun provides realism to the point where the game feels really immersive.Especially how suppressive fire actually suppresses enemies (when bullets flyby near you, your view gets distorted and your aim significantly decreases temporarily) really adds more fun factor to the game.It's also one of the few games which I won't focus on my stats in game but more on achieving objectives. It doesn't matter if someone is playing really bad, nobody will care and continue to focus on their objectives.Also appropriately sized maps don't make you waste so much time getting to the battlefield yet makes flanking possible even with the vast no-man's land to cross.Lastly, you start to notice your teammates more and support them in this game. When I see a squad running towards the enemy trenches, I start to lay down suppressing fire on the enemy so they keep their heads down. Doesn't matter if I hit them, I just fire right over the barracks. If I'm stranded alone in a dug up near the enemy trenches, I'll wait for my squad members to reach me then flank the enemies.Skill matters but a good strategy(or luck) can have a huge impact in the game.Only problems I have with this game are:1. Aiming on some weapons aren't very accurate. I've read some threads on reddit complaining about the same problem.2. In some unbalanced games, enemies were sniping out my team as soon as we respawn.I guess implementing few second invincibility when respawning or finding some new safe respawn zones would fix this problem.3. Some roles are heavily underpowered. Like that one with a mace and three grenades. After you throw those nades, you're basically a human shield?			"

You wait in your pit. You hear those damned frenchies running towards your trench. They are gone. You make a break for THEIR trench. When you get in it you see an enemy sniper and mortor officer. You shoot them. You continue down the trench and kill more. You advance up their right flank. One sees you. After you rush up and bash his face in with your Kar98AZ you continue making your way to your trench. 50 seconds to live. You come up to a large mortor pit with three more in it. Shoot two of them but miss the third. Melee rush. You now have killed 9 people after the retreat whistle sounded. 30 seconds to live. They all know you are there. You see the men in your trench cheering you on, yelling at you to ""get back here you stupid private"". You look behind you, and see no one. Finally, time to get back to trench. As you rush back to your trench you jump into one of the pits in the front. But as you do so you hear a crack of a sniper rifle...			"

												It is both fun and immersive giving it great gameplay quality. It is very realistic and gives you the feeling of actually being in the trenches of world war 1. The maps are well designed and are fairly balanced however the game does not force you to switch team if it is unbalanced so sometimes it is very unbalanced. I would suggest playing with friends on this game as it is much more fun and teamwork will always win the game. Altogether I defiantly recommend this game if you have friends to play the game with and i do not recommend it if you play it by yourself however it is still very fun anyhow and i hope you found this review useful and maybe I will see you in no mans land.

												100% enjoyable. An FPS unlike most others.  In this day of high tech weapons we fail to to remember the nitty-gritty days of ""modern warfare"". The Great War was terribly brutal. Millions perished and suffered under this new type of combat. Verdun captures this horror very well. Jump in the Frontlines game mode and witness chaos at it's finest. Just remember to keep your head down and keep pushing forward. All the while keeping away from snipers, machine gunners, grenades, mortar and artillery barrages, airplane scouts, barbwire, and poison gas. If you manage you to make it to the enemy trench unscathed hop in and engage and hold!			"

								I have wanted a good World War 1 first person shooter for a long time, and for a long time I heard people say ""Oh it would be so boring. You would just charge and get shot down every time.""Well now a World War 1 first person shooter is out and just in time for the 100th anniversary. They were partially right. I do charge and get shot down MOST of the time, but just as it says in ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" the new troops just charge across the open and die. The veterans know how to move along the ground from cover to cover, and getting into the enemy trench and clearing it out with bayonets, knives, clubs, and shovels is so satisfying. Some people say its hard, but if you work with a squad and move as a team its quite easy. The graphics have improved immensely since I first got this game but alas I am currently living over seas for a year and my good gaming computer is back at home so I can't witness this game at full graphics for another 5 or 6 months. The attack and defend with multiple layers of trenches makes for a fun game. You advance. If you are stopped then you fall back and prepare to defend your original trench. If you take their trench then you dig in and prepare to repulse a counter attack. The front is somewhat narrow to give you that World War 1 trench warfare feeling but its not so narrow that its completely impossible to move without dying. Sometimes you can sneak around if the enemy neglects a portion of their line, or you can gas or artillery barrage their lines to force an opening.All in all, if you are looking for a fun, squad based World War 1 first person shooter with a surprising variety of weapons and classes for a war 100 years ago then get this game, and I will see you out in no man's land.

								Seldomly do you find games that are set back in this era. Alot of time and effort has been put into the game and it really shows best in the scenery and level of detail. Playing this game was both exciting for both the online gaming and the historical experience. The graphics and level of detail is amazing. There is a slight learning curve to knowing what type of soldier you are and what your role is in game. Of course some of these questions may be answered by a quick search through the steam boards but it would be more user-friendly if more was explained in game. Overall i look forward to the progress of this game and what future content may still yet to come. I hope to see more of my own friends playing too!			"

												Well, I like this game a lot, this review won't go into very much detail just because I'm not really a good reviewer. But I have ONE HUGE PROBLEM with this. It's only the community, either their unfriendly or cocky, then there's times when one team is highly populated and stacked with high rankers and the other isnt very populated and has new players. Even when you bring attention to this most of the time (in my experience) the other teams members wont switch, maybe a few but not enough for it to balance. It gets really tedious and ridiculous after awhile, I don't get why these people don't switch to make it fair. Maybe they want easy XP but still. I recommend this game but I dislike the community.

								Absolutely love this game.  I have played many FPS games, but this one is definitely unique.  As far as I know this is the only fully fledged WW1 first person shooter.  I have played the WW1 mod for BF1942 which was great, but nothing like this.    Verdun does remind me of Red Orchestra, but I actually enjoy this game more.  I have recently become more interested in everything WWI thanks to a podcast I listen to called Hardcore History by Dan Carlan.  So a couple months back I looked to see if there was a good WWI game that would represent the war well.  This game certainly does.  The trench warfare mode is fantastic and really replicates the fierce battles that those men had to endure.  The mechanics of the game are great.  There is a slight bullet drop, but nothing too noticeable. It is really more realistic than the bullet drop you would experience in Battlefield Bad Company 2.  The maps are fantastic and replicate the uniqueness of the war.  I hope that someday the battles will be increased to 48 or 64 players.  Problem is the server populations are pretty small right now.  Hopefully with the official release of the game more people will play.  This game is pretty difficult.  You will not be able to run and gun like you can in Call of Duty.  If you play Red Orchestra or Battlefield you may be able to not mind the long wait period to respawn.  Successfully capturing a trench will require patience and teamwork.  Gas and artillery strikes will be essential to pull this off in most battles, but this adds to the fun for me.  Highly recommend this game.			"

Graphics look great, environment is beautiful (for a war zone at least).  Very realistic, one shot from almost any weapon kills you, so you need to play strategically instead of rushing into battle, which in some cases does work if you have a machine gun. Bu for the most part teamwork is key. My recommendation is read the guides, they help a lot!!! Amazing game 10/10			"

""Are we downhearted? No!""Where to start with a game like this? Verdun is the first (to my knowledge) multiplayer FPS set in a realistic First World War setting, which is strangly something no one has attempted before. That being said Verdun offer a completely unique original expierence centered around immersion in a WW1 trench warfare environment. Being a bit of a history junkie myself  I found this game hard to resist and it did not disapoint.GAMEPLAY Verdun's gameplay is based (mainly) around team play, providing you and 3 other players with the ability to form one of the different squad types available to each side respectivly.

												Ill start by saying this is not COD, so that should be grounds enough to give this a try. PROS:1) realism mechanics: stuck on barbed wire, being gassed, suppresive fire, cardio endurance, must not rush and key jam      while reloading or you will not seat your bolt properly, if you get shot 9/10 times you will die. no sprinting with MGs.2) leadership: in Verdun leadership plays an important role and pushes team play. The NCOs have special abilitys to call in artillery, gas, recon planes and such in order to assist in the battle; making them priceless if used effectively. NCOs can also mark where to focus an attack making it easier to maneuver on the battlefield.3) this game isnt made by your top tier shooter developers so the focus is more about how they care about the game they made and less about how can i nickle and dime my market then move on to the next turd.4) its the only WW1 shooter I know of making it basically an untouched market and I feel anyone would have a hard time making this better overall without more realism mechanics such as first aid application, wounds that bleed out and such.5) the game is very affordable and there are no in game purchases6) THERE IS NO GORE PPPPLEASE ADD GORE or atleast a setting to choose to have it on if you wish.CONS: 1)There arent alot of maps to choose from, although the ones that we do have are not bad (they are providing a free update/expansion with new maps and some other stuff very soon)2) sometimes you will be so sure there is no conceivable way you missed that shot, maybe due to lag but it usualy ends with you being dead and wondering...how?3) no uniform selectable uniform/appearance changes ( you will get new uniforms as your squad progresses but only during that game, once you leave its gone),4) I want to loot corpses for ammo/grenades, and use the enemy firearms if i find one on the battlefield i like better.5) MGs could use some tweaking, they do have limitations but overall i feel they are much too powerful and i dont think you should be able to hip fire a couple of those beasts.thats all i have for now, over all it is a great game for what it is. it can be frustrating but usually its because you are trying to rush ahead like youre playing black ops II. take your time, play the game like a troll trench camper because thats what WWI was. buy it.

												I held my hands over my head as artillery shells exploded around my trench. Dazed, I staggered forward, one goal in mind. ""Defend the trench!"" my mantra repeated, beating a tattoo into my consciousness. I reached my pillbox. Crouching, I blew my whistle. My men soon came to the pillbox, posting up around me. Shots rang from my gunner as he killed another enemy. ""All clear!"" I slowly raised myself until I could see out of the makeshift window. I saw movement in some of the underbrush. I called in a mortar shot on that position. Crouching again, I waited, each passing second an eternity. ...........A small hiss rose into earshot. I wondered what it meant as my gunner shouted ""Grenade!"" The word was not even out of his mouth as a bright flash errupted just outside of the pillbox entrance. I was knocked senseless. Two things crossed my mind as I faded into darkness; my family, and how I would never see them again, and my joy as I heard my mortar shell strike home. The screams of my enemies became a lullaby as I drifted into oblivion.10/10This fps shooter is unlike any I have ever played. Set in WWI era, the bolt action rifle is king. Trenches are your castles, your lives, your tombs. You leave a trench, you die. You stand up, you die. You run zig-zag patterns towards the enemy trench, you die. Somewhere along the way, you start to put everything together. Killing gets easier. You develop a sense of danger, you learn to spot patterns. You discover how close of an ally patience is. Patience leads you to survival, and ultimately, your victory. Pros:-Realistic ballistics-Good balancing-Great bonuses for team playersCons:-No story mode (not complaining about this, just a head's up for players who are looking for some sort of story/campaign.Give it a go. It's definitely worth it.			"

												A great objective based FPS. If you're obsessed with your KD ratio, it's probably not the game for you,  you'll be screamed at. Focus on the objectives do your job and everything will be fine. When you find a good team to play with, it really shines, each ""class"" has a unique role that it has to fill otherwise everything becomes way harder for the rest of the squad. WW1 weaponry allows for a different gameplay, compared to all the other machine gun focused modern/WW2 FPS there are.There is a progression system, however it's not central to the game experience, it rewards different play styles and doesn't impose itself on the main game.I'm having a lot of fun, the only downsize is when your team sucks or Yells at each other, but that's something all multiplayer games have in common.

												This game is not like other first person shooters. This is Verdun.I bought this game during the summer sales just because i liked the idea of a WW1 first person shooter, and oh boy have i fallen in love with Verdun. Its all about getting killed during the first couple of hours playing, no matter if you stay in the trenches, crawl through the no-man's-land or attack straight away. These first hours may demotivate new players due to the steep learning curve, but i advise to keep trying and dieing, as the payoff will be great. Everyone should just play this game to experience the horrors of WW1, nothing can describe the feeling of jumping in an enemy trench amidst a gas cloud, sight greatly reduced by your gas mask, and not sure whether you will get stabbed, shot, blown up or if you yourself might stumble upon some unawara Frenchies.Pros:- One shot kills. Don't miss or you're dead.- Graphics- Historical accuracy- Teamplay- Community- New content on regular basis- ...Cons:- Difficulty at start- 16 vs 16 maps, would prefer 32vs32 or 64vs64			"

								I decided to look at some WW1 games and found this gem, completely satisfying WW1 expirience.Defend your trench from waves of enemy, then rush the enemy trench, single shot rifles and bayonets, artillery, grenades and ww1 MG's.An authentic WW1 game with a dedicated and appreciative communtiy. The developers have done a great job here.The game has progressed steadily since early beta and is now close to call of duty standards for qaulity, gameplay is at least 10x cod if you like the idea of bolt action rifles and barbed wire trench warfare.

												Pretty fun game. It has some cool moments and the maps feel well designed, the flow of the gameplay (attack and counter-attack etc) is good and I like the squad system. Battling through the trenches feels different to most other games (reminds me a bit of Lyes Krovy in Red Orchestra).I have to compare it to Red Orchestra because though they're different periods they're obviously very similar games. So it does feel a bit less polished than RO, the animations aren't as nice, the 'feel' isn't as nice and the ballistics don't feel as good/using weapons doesn't feel as good. The thing I really don't like is how there is no feeling of momentum like in RO, the movement is a bit arcadey because of this; you instantly stop/start moving and when you go prone you have to stop and slowly lower yourself - it just doesn't feel nice compared to RO, where you have momentum and can 'throw' yourself forward when running if you go prone.Honestly I think RO is just better - but that said it is a different game from that and it's worth playing in it's own right, it's also just come out so maybe they'll improve it over time. Probably get it in a sale if you're on the fence, but if RO is your kind of thing then you'll probably like this too.			"

								I have to say that this is a really good WW1 simulator. You hear the whistle of your NCO, telling you to attack, but deep inside you know that running into No Man's Land will guarantee your quick death. Nonetheless, you go anyways. Even if you crawl, as soon as you pop your head up over that hole, you immediately receive fire. Luckily, they all miss. You reach the enemy trench! Now what? Look, there is your enemy! Quick, shoot him! But the intenseness of the situation makes you miss your shots! You frantically stand up, and charge him with your bayonet. It's your life or his! Even fending off several enemy soldiers, unfortunately your team's attack is repulsed and is driven back. The call to retreat is given.♥♥♥♥♥♥ now youre stuck in the enemy trench!You jump up and attempt to head back to friendly positions. This means that you will have to venture back into the dreaded No Man's Land. Your chances of survival are now at an all time low since your enemy is counterattacking, and is right behind you. And for some odd reason, you survive and jump into your trench, with mortars hitting the ground all around you and gas dropping in poor souls a few yards away. The enemy attack is repulsed, and the time for YOUR counterattack is NOW. This is what makes the game fun and an actual simulator, because WW1 was actually fought like this- a stalemate.			"

								I have watched this game go from total skrub tier graphics (Minecraft) to an extremely polished game.  Its still being updated with new features and the game play is very realistic.   You too can drown in your own fluids because of poison gas, be ripped apart by artillery fire and turned into a bullet catcher when the MGs are talking.   Its a great game and I would definitely recommend it.			"

												IF you want a historically accurate WW1 first person shooter which has surprisingly good graphics (for a single multiplayer), realistic attack and defend tactics and impressive war ambient this game is 100% recommended by a player like me (with 20 hours experience). Edited: if you don't like the two game modes it has which are: Frontlines (ranked squad based 32 v 32) and Rifle Deathmatch (free for all) I would wait a bit, see if they release something better. e.g. a battle involving AI or player-controlled tanks and probably dogfights with planes? I don't know but still recommend.			"

								I see a lot of post regarding the improvement of the game, but it is an early release.  In my opinion, what is needed is better communication between players.  If you join a random squad, its just that, random and everyone is doing their own thing.  When we go 'over the top' it needs to be organzied.  Defending the mass of trenches needs to be organized.  I have yet to play with a group of friends.  I enjoy the game.			"

								There aren't a lot of WW1 shooters out there so I was surprised to see this, and even more surprised to see that the servers were fairly well populated. Oh, it's also pretty fun. That being said, its not for everyone, as afterall it is a WW1 shooter. The guns are all single shot rifles or heavy machine guns, and as a result you'll find yourself getting killed pretty often. Its also not the easiest game to get into and does require teamwork inorder to win, one guy with a bolt action rifle isnt going to clear a whole trench by himself. While the game is pretty fun, the battlefield is ruled by snipers which means that you will never see any machine gun nests since they all get sniped out pretty quickly. I think they should add some night levels to make the machine guns more playable and to reduce the amount of snipers, or add rainy levels or something. Overall it's pretty fun, however I think some balancing is needed and sometimes it crashes, although since it's still in beta I'll let that slide. Definitely get this if you're into WW1 history, and even if you're not you might want to consider it.			"

It's not very historic, it's more like a WW1 looking map where everyone just runs around freely and shoots. Don't expect any disipline or proffesionalism.It's a hard choise to recomend this game or not, but i choose to recomend it because there is no game like it and because it has great potential.			"

								Super fun game. I've been waiting for a long time to play a World War One shooter, probably since Medal of Honor Rising Sun. This game is what I've been waiting for. There's a good squad element, and more strategic than other shooters out there. Verdun is very similar to Red Orchestra 2, with different roles and classes that specialize in certain combat situations. The community is for the most part helpful, there is more material on the way, and overall it is a fun game to play, especially with friends. The game is still in Beta, so not everything is perfect, there are sometimes frame rate drops, glitches(especially with cover system), and hit detection. I think I've only experienced glitches that crashed the game once in the past 70 hours. If you buy this game get used to being shot out of nowhere or shelled inside a trench, there is a bit of a learning curve. Overall it is worth the money. Follow your NCO, keep your head down, and charge for the Kaiser!			"

												Great World War 1 First Person Shooter, decent graphics, realistic feel and look and quite fun to play, some people take this game very seriously the way they play which is cool, the game is challenging and rewards people who hold down areas and sit around and wait for people to come to them (basically camping if you are a scrub and call it that) and you will die if you rush, at least at the wrong time. It requires you to be patient and each team has about 4 or 5 squads each with 4 players in the squad and each squad uses different sort of classes so you get a rifle and maybe binoculars or a pistol and a grenade or a big light machine gun and revolver and stuff like that so you may need to swap roles with another player because no 2 roles are identical.I'd say its worth buying, probably go for a sale, $25 is a bit much.

								For hundreds of years, warfare was seen as a right to manhood. A glorious undertaking. Some would even call it ""great."" As funny as it may sound, the so called Great War would be the very conflict to change our view of, and the history of war, for the rest of time. Sure, some could say that we began to question how glorious war really was with conflicts like the American Civil War, through photographs of the battlefield that made it possible for everyone to see its terror. But it was World War 1, with its global scale and modern technology, that brought the idea of civilized or glorious warfare to a permanent close.   Now, with the release of Verdun, an impressive little game released for harmless recreation, we have another testiment to how horrible the battlefield truly was. While you may have fun charging across No-Man's-Land with your friends, there's no doubt that you will take a look around from time to time, and you can't help but take notice of the blood-soaked fields and mangled corpse-wridden trenches that defined a dark era of our history.   Verdun is a competive team-based game that takes place in the waterlogged trenches of the First World War. The game introduces an interesting squad system that rewards players for working together, improving the gameplay experience and accurately representing the warfare of the time, two effects which give the game tremendous appeal. The game also features engaging and highly-enjoyable gameplay, as players must adapt to the battlefield and the era in order to survive an enemy onslaught, or simply reach the next trench over without joining the ranks of the fallen.    While the game has many attractive features to point out, it's impossible to avoid taking note of the flaws which currently plague an otherwise genius game. Connectivity errors, gameplay glitches, and a few other systematic bugs can greatly damper and even ruin the experience for some players. However, it's also worth mentioning that as an early-beta game, these kinds of things should be EXPECTED to happen, as the development team works to correct key issues and improve the game for everyone.   Overall, I would give the game an 8/10 rating; the best feature of the game being its ability to accurately represent history in a fun and engaging manner, while the worst being the lack of elements that could greatly enhance the game's overall variety and immersion, such as possible units like field medics or engineers. All in all, I would definitely reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys a good multiplayer game, or needs an introduction into the world of pc gaming.    So whether you shout Viva la France or Fur Dass Vaterland, I think it's safe to say that Verdun is a masterful game that anyone can enjoy.			"

												This is such a great game. This game requries team work and effort. You arn't just running around and killing each other one team has to stay in there trench and the other has to assult them. The weapons are very detailed and the developers have put a lot of effort into the guns, battlefeild, gas, and trenches.			"

												So I have this love and hate relationship with this game. 1. Do I enjoy it?why yes, yes I love this game, because this game offers a really fun experience and new ""challenge"" or enviorment to play in. So far this is the best WW1 shooter I have seen and it is a good hardecore game. My only issues with this game which makes me want to smash my moniter is that this game (at least from my experience) is that either the netcode or something at times is bad. When I am hiding behind a wall, I get shot no matter what because on that persons screen I was standing, or when I shot someone they dont get hit. But thats all, if you dont have it just get it, its a cheap game and why not? very fun with friends :P			"

												Great gameplay, great squad mechanics, great atmosphere, this game has it all.The maps are as detailed and as realistic as they can get, I never felt so vulnerable moving around the map in a game before. Getting through no man's land is a matter of luck, you run from cover to cover hoping no one will catch eye on you and be quick to aim and shoot while you're exposed. Trench sweeping is no easier, moving from corner to corner of a trench, hoping to kill the enemy behind it before he catches sight of you. You will die a lot, shot by snipers, crippled by machineguns, maimed by artillery and poisoned by gases. With enough patience and some skill, you can still be able to do the same to the enemy.This game is definitely one of the best multiplayer FPS I've ever played. Props to the dev team for the amount detail, balance, original mechanics and historical accuracy. It could be a bit more polished, but it's already great as it is. "

												This game is an absolute one of a kind gem that you find once in a blue moon on Steam. It's one of those games that is still fun when playing by yourself, but when you have a friend or a group of friends, it really shines. My most memorable experience from this game was when me and my buddy were on attack. We flanked the whole enemy team and got into their trenches. I got hit by artillary which took all my limbs and my head off while my friend ran to seek shelter under ground. All of a sudden my friend says that there is a group of enemies by him, so I tell him to sneak behind some cover and hide until I get there. I immediatly b-lined it towards the trench going through walls of barbed-wire in the No Man's Land dodging bullets and mortars while the rest of my team went through the trenches and distracted the enemy. When I got to the enterance of the underground bunker, I coordinated a surprise attack, and on the count of three my friend and I jumped out and opened fire on five Germans while an epic gunfight took place right above the crumbling bunker we were in. One of the best FPS games out there. 10/10 would open fire again IGN			"

												This here is how WW1 is suposed to be, harsh trench warfare. Although Battlefield 1 may win on content and gameplay value, this game is 100x more accurate and realistic. You die when you are shot, you aren't the normal bullet sponge most games make you, there are a variety of classes and different weaponry ranging from Mgs, rifles, smg(1), shotgun(1), flamewthrower, snipers, revolvers and lugers and bunch other pistols. you can call in artillary, gas, smoke, mortars and there are a variety of grenades for you to choose from on some classes. on top of all that there are a decent number of maps. although this game will be hard to understand for most starting off, give it a couple games and you'll get it.

								An interesting concept, but the creators fail to make the game interesting, At the current state is not worth the 20 euro.But it is only early access, i think this game has potential, we just have to wait and see what the developers make of it.none the less it is good to see a WW1 game amongst the thousands of WW2 games.The mechanics of the game needs to be worked on, you can make a headshot with a WW1 pistol from 500 meters away, there is no bullet drop at all and the bullets seem to fly in a competly straight line.The maps also needs to be worked on. It's not very historic, it's more like a WW1 looking map where everyone just runs around freely and shoots. Don't expect any disipline or proffesionalism.It's a hard choise to recomend this game or not, but i choose to recomend it because there is no game like it and because it has great potential.			"

								Super fun game. I've been waiting for a long time to play a World War One shooter, probably since Medal of Honor Rising Sun. This game is what I've been waiting for. There's a good squad element, and more strategic than other shooters out there. Verdun is very similar to Red Orchestra 2, with different roles and classes that specialize in certain combat situations. The community is for the most part helpful, there is more material on the way, and overall it is a fun game to play, especially with friends. The game is still in Beta, so not everything is perfect, there are sometimes frame rate drops, glitches(especially with cover system), and hit detection. I think I've only experienced glitches that crashed the game once in the past 70 hours. If you buy this game get used to being shot out of nowhere or shelled inside a trench, there is a bit of a learning curve. Overall it is worth the money. Follow your NCO, keep your head down, and charge for the Kaiser!			"

												Verdun - A FPS for people who want a difficult and more realistic shooter.  This is not for people who are looking for another Battlefield/CoD clone. Verdun is a gritty game where most people have bolt action rifles, use iron sights, and have to constantly be on the look out for machine gun fire, gas, and artillery bombardment. The developers made Verdun with realism in mind. You adopt a role within a squad and can choose from one of three layouts for that role. The only cons in this game are a severe lack of kicking abusive players.  "

												I had been shipped off to the Argonne Forest. That fateful day was, oddly quiet, when one day i heard gunshots wizz past my head in the small ditch we passed as a ""trench"". Oh no! I thought, it's the Germans! I quickly got out of the trench and hid behind a rock. Bullets hit the rock, an inch away from my head. Then we heard our NCO yell: ""Germans incoming!"" I quickly got back into the trench just as i saw a horde of Germans barreling towards the ditch. One soldier yelled, ""MUSTARD GAS!"" And the air quickly filled with the green gas as i heard my comrades coughing. I got on my gas mask on, and quickly shot at a German soldier who was infront of me. Suddenly, a bayonet stuck out from infront of me, I realized i had been struck in the back. The bayonet pierced my flesh and it quickly retracted. I got i slight glimpse of my attacker as i was falling, a young man with a gas mask on, a tear trickiling down his eye. Everything went black. Welcome to Verdun.			"

A fresh setting, exciting gameplay, and interesting mechanics will keep you coming back for another day in the trenches. There is a learning curve to this game, and it is a little unforgiving at times, but it is easy enough to catch on in a short time.Most impressingly, it manages to take an experience like WW1, with its trench warfare, and make it not only playable, but quite enjoyable. There are enough maps, guns, and levelling mechanics to keep things fresh. Definitely worth the price of admission.The community is quite active, and the development team frequently updates the game, and give news updates.			"

												Do you like you CoD and your 360 noscoping around? Do you like your killstreaks? Then this isn't the game for you.I adore this game. It is hard and has a steep learning curve. But if you stick to it and learn how to use your class, how to best follow orders and basically that you should shoot whenever anything moves, you can sink hours into it. Coordinate and ask and you will succeed most of the time. The Christmas Truce charity DLC is also a very good way to commemorate what happened in the trenches that christmas. You can play football, throw snowballs at one another and send postcards. You can tell how much work and love went and is going into this game. This isn't glorifying anything, yet it is immens fun.Probably one of my top 3 this year.			"

								After having played 15ish hours of this game, I feel like I can offer my opinion on it and maybe talk about some changes that should be made. First off, Verdun is a unique game in that WW1 is not a widely used setting for an fps. Second, for an early access game it's rather good, although it does have it's issues. One big issue I have is the optimisation, I have a pc that is rather good, and I only get 35~ fps. Another is that I can never get in a lobby that stays full, but I can't really hold that against the developer. Some minor issues that I think could use some work are: with weapons like the Enfield that load using stripper clips, if you've fired five rounds you should just use a stripper clip to load the rifle instead of inserting five individual cartridges. A second issue is the fact that so many classses have pistols, I feel like the game would play better if only the officers, trench raiders, and the machine gunners had sidearms like that. The third and final issue is just with general bugs (scoreboard not scrolling up or down, friends squad system only working when it feels like it, lag, etc..) All in all I think this game is worth the money, and deserves more players than it has playing it. I'll be sure to update this review as time passes.			"

								Fantastic game!  Challenging - You die a lot, but keep on going, wave after wave.  After a while you figure out why you are dieing so often.  Then you see the new recruits, like you were once, doing what you did, and shake your head.  Just like I would imagine being in the trenches.Cooperative gameplay - Each role has a part to play.  Play together with your squad and team for best results.  It is hard to do, but that is the next level I am working on.  When you do, it is even more fun.Realistic - In many ways, such as fatigue, breath holding to steady your shot, bullet drop and aiming in front of a running target, flinching when being shot at, confusion when mortars are falling...  Very exciting.  The developers seem to have realism as a priority, and I am grateful for that.  This is no CoD, that's for sure.Historical settings - Gets me reading about and respecting the soldiers who were there, and what they went through.Nice community of players - I don't know why, but most people who play this game are quite nice and helpful.  Maybe it is the cooperative element, or the historical content.  I don't know, but it is a refreshing community. I hope this doesn't change after release.Fun - This game is fast.  Lots of reaction elements mixed in with thinking about the best move. I can't seem to stop playing... "

								Verdun is a shining example to other developers, showcasing what a successful 'Early Access' title looks like.Countless numbers of games have entered into 'Early Access,' only to see their developers lose interest once they've already made the bulk of their profits and have no real financial incentive to continue. That is absolutely not the case here--the development team on Verdun clearly has a personal commitment to seeing an online WWI FPS actualized. The most notable part of my experience playing was seeing how often updates and improvements were pushed out, as well as the sheer quality AND quantity; tons of new content, updated textures and animations, improved and balanced gameplay tweaks, performance patches, and even a large overhaul of the game's engine. Not at one single point during the development did it appear as though the developers were living off of their unfinished game, or abusing their fan base's loyalty to work extremely short hours. I'm thrilled to see the official release of this game, as well as it serving as an example of how 'Early Access' was able to positively influence a game throughout development.The game itself is quite fun; the mechanics are fleshed out and very unique. The game modes are nicely objective-oriented without feeling forced or arbitrary. Everything ranging from the game's graphics to its audio feel cohesive, giving an immersive feel of the era. If you've ever wished you could check out a WWI shooter, or simply want to support an indie developer that deserves it, this is your game.Other 'Early Access' developers, TAKE NOTES!			"

								The trench warfare is awesome, and I really like the idea that you can make your own squad.  The maps are very impressive and they WW1 style is very well done and very captivating.  Although I have one problem with this game.  They do not support servers for Australia/New Zealand yet.  It is still in beta so this is understandable.  But at the same time about a quarter of the people on the American servers are playing from Australia/New Zealand and it just isn't very playable.  I wish I could of known about this before I brought the game.Edit: they have now added an australian server, thanks Devs! now we just gotta get people to move to the Aussie/NZ one!			"

								Solid game,  the only ww1 shooter out there! Developers update with improvements very often. Fun, satisfying, challenging. Good graphics, good sound, gas. Simulates how you would imagine trench warfare battles to play out.So at first i didn't realise you can unlock different classes and weapons by simply clicking the padlock button in the ""create squad"" menu. I thought you had to progress through the game, but you start off with a decent amount of points to unlock whichever class you preffer from the start. Then while you play u must earn points i think, you use these points to unlock different classes for differnent armies. Depending on which army you like fighting for. Because they all have authentic weapons, some of the weapons you will prefer over others. For example the British machine gun (Lewis gun) is by far my fav machine gun to use. The German one is good also, the french one is pretty horrible to use.			"

												It's certainly not a bad game; there's just some minor gripes that I have with it. One being that there's no heavy machine guns like maxims and vickers (though there is man-portable light machine guns), and the other being that the game feels a little choppy even though it attains 60 FPS just fine. Coming from playing source and unreal engine shooters this one just feels a little loose. Still though, a great WW1 game that I highly recommend.			"

												Excellent game! Likes: - Historical weaponry. Lots of single shot weapons, - Constantly getting killed, quick lesson in the necessity to take cover and calculated risks.- The squad based fighting - got to work in teams. Can be an individual but teamwork gives the enemy other people to shoot at! (Murphy's law of war!).- The backwards and forwards of the battle. Sometimes defending, sometimes attacking, but there is always something going on, and you always have to be active!- Having to ""go over the top"" and the appreciation for fighting your way over no-man's land.- Use of indirect fire support and chemical warfare. GAS GAS GAS! (would be good to have a gas alarm!- Leadership of the NCO is a good feature.Dislikes:- How do you resupply ammo, except for being killed? Why not pick up ammo, or have resupply in the trenches?- Its too clean. Seems all the battles are in summer, in good weather. What about rain, snow, and other adverse conditions?- No mud? The trenches are too tidy. Why not have some flooded?- Why not introduce a medic class? So if a player is wounded, they could be patched up?- There was a learning curve to get to understand some of the games key features. For the first few hours I was just getting killed heaps trying to figure it out. Would be beneficial to make learning the game a bit more intuitive, or to introduce a ""training"" mission so that newbies can learn the game mechanics prior to battle.- After 17hrs, I've reached game level 7 and I still don't know how to level up and change weapon loadouts... how? Could this be better explained in the game?In summary an innovative and enjoyable game. The attention to history is good. WW1 is an often neglected computer game theme. There's an oversupply of WW2 games, and yet this is the only FPS WW1 game that comes to mind.Overall, excellent game. 8/10.			"

								Due to it being an early access game, Verdun is still a bit rough around the edges (mainly with FPS drops on some maps and the animations still need a little bit of work) but I'm still quite impressed at this title. I'm quite pleased how the developers handle WWI with the respect I had hoped. You get a pretty gritty and ugly picture of trench warfare but not to the extent where you can't enjoy the game. The matches are intense as you struggle to defend your position while taking the enemy trenches. Keep in mind, this is not your typical multiplayer shooter such as COD or Battlefield. One shot one kill is standard and you really need to be careful with your positioning on the battlefield.  The community is generally pretty positive and helpful, and the maps are pretty big and nicely laid out. I really hope the developers keep up the great work on this title as with a little more spit and polish, I see great things for this title.			"

Just tried playing in a few games and something is very wrong. Usually my k/d is about 10 to 1. Today, every spawn is putting me into a position of insta-death. Enemy players literally invicible. I watched enemies spawn behind our ""Defend"" position and way behind me. (as I was running back to get some distance with a scope I see a player spawn in...its an enemy. Not supposed to be happening at all. They are shooting through large (vertical heigh) of ground. And not to mention walking through ground. This isnt on just one server. Ive tried a few and saw all of the above. So waht is going on?? I really hope the devs didnt just ruin a very well made game.ORIGINAL REVIEWWay better than Battlefield Hardline! It actually worksIve only played for a few minutes. But anyone who plays a lot of FPS can immediately tell of the game is any good. It is. Its just great. Period. Now, that doesnt mean that there arent some stupid little unfriendly quirks. But there arent enough to impact any overall score of the game.I will do a more in-depth review - detail the positives along with the negatives - in the next few days. Until then, buy it so I can blow your head off when you peek out of the trench!Added (5/1/15): Another great thing about Verdun is you can jump into a game fast, play a round, and be done. Since the load times are almost non-existent (and Im only using an HDD) its not like other mass multiplayer games that take 5 minutes or more just to get into the match. Try hopping into a Battlefield game quickly. It wont happen. I can brew a pot of coffee in the time it takes to load me into a server. Verdun starts up fast, joinining games is fast. The whole process works			"

												Overall, I'm extremely impressed with this game. The developers really did a good job mixing together interesting historical elements and innovative gameplay features. Unlike CoD-type FPSs where you can get by with spraying and praying with automatic weapons, or you can survive a few body shots, Verdun forces players to rely on their skill to win battles, as most weapons used are bolt-action rifles or pistols that only work up close. On top of that, squad-based strategy is huge in this game as the unique abilities of squad members synergize with each other and prove extremely effective in taking/defending trenches when used correctly. Another impressive feature of the game is the fact that the developers' coherence to historical accuracy actually adds to the quality of gameplay. The countless times you get killed out in no man's land, or blasted away in your trench by unpredictable artillery barrages really gives you an idea of how much of a ♥♥♥♥♥how trench warfare was. This forces players to constantly update their strategies and listen to the commands of their NCO, who generally has his eyes on the whole map. Improvements needed: -Use of ""career points"" in the Frontlines game mode to upgrade loadouts/abilities in a similar fashion as the Attrition game mode. I'd like the opportunity to diversify my loadout within a squad so I'm not stuck using the same weapon for the duration of my time in a squad. -Decrease the zoom on binoculars, or allow for variable zoom/focus. The only thing binoculars are currently useful for is seeing all the way across the map, which doesn't provide a view of any sort of strategic position. -Add squad member descriptions to the in-game ""Squad"" tab. If I'm ever in a new or unfamiliar squad, I have to spend 5 minutes accessing the game guide, finding the proper squad in the squad menu, and reading enough of the description to understand what I'm doing. Meanwhile, my team's getting reamed and I'm likely getting kicked for inactivity.-Add a Red Orchestra 2-type tutorial so players don't have to research the game guide to understand how to play the game properly. -Campaign/career mode would be cool if the devs could figure out how to pull it off. Although, in their defense, if it was to be historically accurate, the campaign would consist of your character sitting around in a trench, maybe shooting a few enemies, and then getting blasted by artillery or mowed down in a charge across no man's land, and the character's army would've gotten essentially nowhere by the end of the campaign. An interesting story could probably be told somehow though.			"

								I know it´s still in Early Access but this game is great. How to describe it?Well take Red Orchestra and put it into the WWI Setting. Tactical crouching is necessary to stay alive and keeps the game intense.There are two modes as i could see so far (maybe more later dunno).First is Frontlines where you take part as on of the ether french or german soldiers and have to drive back the enemy team trough moving frontlines.Second is Deathmatch....well as the name says you against everyone on the battlefield.The maps look great and gives you a intense atmosphere feeling.At all i recommend a buy not for full price maybe at the moment but could change if more will be added.Bought it while it was at 6,45€ and it was worth it.

								As far as Early Access games go, I am so far very impressed with this title. It has LOADS of potential as a fairly accurate WWI FPS. There are currently a few issues I have with it, such as no bullet fall-off and some strange graphics, but I would guess these will be improved by the time the game is fully released. As it stands now, it is a fun game that is not very demanding on hardware, and I would recommend it.For fans of: Red OrchestraDay of DefeatMen of WarCamping			"

												An excellent game for any fan of ""realistic"" WW1 Combat. The game functions well,but has some general issues with net coding (e.g. hit registrations) and similar stuff,however,given it's developed by a lesser known studio,it should come to no surprise that such minor things ,that would usually tag a game as unpolished,do occur. The gameplay depitcs WW1 fairy well,with trench warfare and bolt-action rifles being a huge focus. The game is rather slow-paced with matches lasting around 20 minutes.I can recommend this game to any person who is into WW1 and enjoys a realistic take on it in the form of a video game. The game is heavly based around teamwork - there is usually next to no room for solo play,especially when your team is attacking. Besides,rushing an enemy trench with a bunch of people is quite epic to see and most of the time works out well. However,if you are not very fond of dying quite often (especially early on in the game) and like to do things your own way,then you might want to pass on this one.			"

												This game offers an experience you just can't find today in games very often. To give you a example of what this game can offer read the following. Me and my friend were moving up with our squad on a night time trench warfare map when I hear the sound of a byplane above. I then see a danger close warning on my screen. Knowing any game, that word usually means bad things are about to happen. My friend, our squad and I proceed to move up with continuous artillery fire raining on our heads. Fighting to get out of harms way we didn't realise we were at the enemy trench already. We are able to kill 1 or 2 soldiers before other people on our team sucessfully breach the right side. We join up with them when out of nowhere a german hostile charges my friend with a bayonet. I quickly line my sights up on the back of the germans head and pull the trigger, thus saving my fellow comrades life. However just because I saved him once doesn't mean he is safe much longer, just after I was able to kill one german, another hostile coming from behind landed a headshot on my friend. In this game I truly feel that even taking out 2 enemies and making way for your team allows a turning point for the rest of the match. At the same time there is never a point where you feel safe. Any skilled player with a rifle or a well placed atillery (also if they are lagging like an elastic band spreading from Japan to the north pole whilst having 300 ping) can lend aid to the enemy. It isn't often you can say that about an online game, let alone one made by 4 developers. This one experience that I have had with the game isn't the only one, it can happen every battle. It is for the above reasons I recommend you purchase this game if you think it is right for you and experience these things for youself.			"

Many bemoan developers dropping a game and the poeple developing this have clearly stuck with it and made it, well, awesome! A great FPS with a really supportive community. I was fully prepared fro 'newb this' and 'getgud' that but it never happened (maybe everyone was to busy shooting each other but Probably not). This game can give you the tense excitement if you yearn that kind of thing but maybe that will wear off. If you like historical FPS this is AN ABSOLUTE MUST. Great team mechanics and no pay to win. If there were double thumbs up I would give them.			"

								for such a small game Verdun has suprisingly become one of my favorite fps games. Now I have only played the game for six ours(at the time of this review being written) but in this short amount of time Verdun keeps on impressing me. Their are two game modes one is free-for-all and the other is front line mode. In front line mode you either start out attacking or defending a trench. Every time your team is successful you get a point and get the opposite oblective of what you just had . As of now there are only four maps but those four maps have been enough for me. The game continues to deliver fun fast paced action every match. One time when defending a trench I found cover and started to shoot french soldiers charging the trench. One by one they continued to fall down until the trench was secured. Another time two of my teamates were pinned down so I went thru the trench we were attacking and when I got to the spot where the enemies were I Just started to line up the shot and took four guys out. The only negatives I could find about this game are that their can be lag there is a limited amount of weapons and their are no unlockable items (so far). Besides that I definitely recomend this game to anyone who likes fps games.			"

								The Squad based combat is original, with different roles and armies inside the same side, but sometiemes it is easy to miss the point of being in a squad (it only works if all your squad-mates are really on it). The scenarios are huge and fun, with some minor bugs (some really frustrating bugs with textures when you lay on the ground and can't aim at an enemy because you're inside a trench and the game doesn't allow you to roll or move left or right). They still have to work more in the animations of the soldiers (too simple movements) and explosions (they're ugly), and add some more realistic features (when lying in the ground you can still move while aiming, which is absolutly unrealistic). But overall, I bet this will be an amazing game when the time comes (now it's in alpha), fun to play and competitive: a good Great War version of Red Orchestra 2. They amazingly caught the atmosphere of the trenches, the crazy no-man-land battles in which hundreds die in a hundred metres, with attacks, counter-attacks and a very dynamic course of the game (capture the trench style is quite better than the old capture the flag or the ""attack-defend maps""). I recommend it for RO2-RS, RO1, Arma and M&B Warband mods veterans: historically realistic and enjoyable. What's bad about it? It's still an Alpha (with some minor bugs) and the graphics aren't great (just good enough), but you already have a big and active community so you will always, anytime of the day, find squads and full servers.

								Verdun is an FPS game that brings back the more realistic and strategic gun game. Unlike 99% of FPS games made, only 1 or 2 shots will kill an enemy and you can really feel the burden of your equipment. Players must try to run gaps, crouch behind cover, and lay prone in ditches in order to stay hidden. Its atmosphere is well made and really enhance the gameplay. So far there are only 2 modes, deathmatch, and frontline. Deathmatch is like it sounds, you choose a gun, and fight everyone you see and try not to die (much). Frontlines is a very nice system that matches with the war theme. It is a mixture of capture the flag and deathmatch. Much like battlefield, there are 2 teams and in each team a number of squads. But in each squad there are only 4 classes and each one can only be chosen once. This makes it so communication and strategy is a must in order to do well for the team. The goal is to attack the trenches or defend them. Kind of like tug of war, each side must try to overcome the enemy and gain the most territory.Overall, I am having a very good time playing this game and recommend it to those looking for a good fps game that is not a bullet sponge fest. Yes, there are many bugs and it is not optimized very well yet, but it is also early access and those things will be fixed over time. The content that is in the game right now is well done and once it gains more content and a larger following, it will be a long lasting game that will provide many hours of fun.			"

This game is an intense experience of WWI and sometimes it almost feels like you're fighting in the trenches in WWI its so realistic.

												Ain't played a game this WWI. Over the top towards trenches, try to capture the trench, get repulsed--now you got to get back to your own trench to defend or you gon' get shot for cowardice. The sound effects are terrible and the visuals can be a little spotty, but no other game feels the same. There isn't a huge player base, but I can usually find a game. Downside is a lot of alt-right weirdos on the servers :-(			"

												Very hard FPS, but in this case it's a great quality since you have to calculate your every move. Is your head sticking out too much from the bunker? Are you running towards the weakest flank of the enemy bunker? You better ask yourself these questions, because if not, you're dead meat son. All this dying though is balanced by the fact that you will be twice as happy to get kills, because you had to WORK FOR IT SOLDIER!			"

								I can't praise this game enough. For three guys working on something, they really set out to accomplish something and that's fantastic.The community is phenomonal, the only qualm I have with this game is the fact that many of the people (like myself), who bought this game in the first few weeks, have seriously broken squad powers. The average person has a regular mortar strike, whereas the level 100s have 9-10 75mms that rain down and just completely obliterate the field.8.9/10			"

								Verdun is an FPS game that brings back the more realistic and strategic gun game. Unlike 99% of FPS games made, only 1 or 2 shots will kill an enemy and you can really feel the burden of your equipment. Players must try to run gaps, crouch behind cover, and lay prone in ditches in order to stay hidden. Its atmosphere is well made and really enhance the gameplay. So far there are only 2 modes, deathmatch, and frontline. Deathmatch is like it sounds, you choose a gun, and fight everyone you see and try not to die (much). Frontlines is a very nice system that matches with the war theme. It is a mixture of capture the flag and deathmatch. Much like battlefield, there are 2 teams and in each team a number of squads. But in each squad there are only 4 classes and each one can only be chosen once. This makes it so communication and strategy is a must in order to do well for the team. The goal is to attack the trenches or defend them. Kind of like tug of war, each side must try to overcome the enemy and gain the most territory.Overall, I am having a very good time playing this game and recommend it to those looking for a good fps game that is not a bullet sponge fest. Yes, there are many bugs and it is not optimized very well yet, but it is also early access and those things will be fixed over time. The content that is in the game right now is well done and once it gains more content and a larger following, it will be a long lasting game that will provide many hours of fun.			"

												Not only are WWI games rare, but Verdun is a damn good one.The thing about this game that truly makes it stand out in my eyes is the sheer brutality of it. (You'll need to turn the gore setting to ULTRA to experience this.)Imagine you're a British soldier on the front lines. You glance over the top of the trench and see a German hard charging toward you. You squeeze a shot off and Gerry drops about 20 meters in front of your trench. As you chamber a new round in your rifle, you hear the soldier you just shot let out a bloodcurdling scream. You wait for more to arrive, and the screaming has only gotten louder. This isn't a low-pitched scream of a large man, this is the scream of someone very young, probably not even in his 20's yet. Eventually, he succumbs to his wounds and the screaming ceases.Verdun has something that a lot of shooters lack, the dying. Take Call of Doots: You shoot someone, they die, you move on. Then you have Verdun: You gut shoot someone and you can hear the pain you just caused them from half the battlefield away. Bayonet someone in the neck, and they'll lay helpless on the ground gurgling their own blood. You'll see howitzers send legless bodies flying, wounded screaming men that now have only one arm, and I won't even go into flamethrowers.Pros:-Play as one of 4 members of historical squads from different nations in the war. (U.S. Doughboys, Tommies, Canadians, U.S. Marines, Schutz, etc.) Each of which have their own unique weapons and perks.-Very immersive. No other game quite matches the feeling you get when your NCO blows the whistle to go over the top like Verdun.-Multiple game modes. If you don't feel like playing the usual frontlines or don't feel like facing real people in general, you can play squad defense instead. This is a game mode where you join a squad and survive waves of AI attackers. (I'm a big fan of this game mode.)Cons:-The game still has its share of bugs. Nothing that should turn you off from the game though. One time I even saw someone pistol whip a German to death with a Lewis gun. You don't want to miss out on that hilarity.-WWI is difficult. You will die a lot. That's just a result of how the warfare was at this time.1914/1918, would charge across no man's land for the fatherland again			"

Early Access Review
								I'm only 4.5 hours in and I'm really starting to see the originality come out of this game. It truly is a squad based fps and if you don't stay with them you will not survive. Each member of the 4 player squad has a role and only 1 person can play as that role, but you can offer to switch rolls. One thing that really stand out to me is that you feel everyone is fighitng on one giant map. Although you technically spend the entire round in one area, it's all connected. Instead of picking a server you look at a map and select an area which then shows all the battallions situated there as well as which team is currently holding that territory. While your holding down trenches, another batallion is pushing up the line to where you team can take place. It's very difficult at first if you're used to having several items/weapons/explosives on hand. The only items available in Verdun that I've seen so far are binoculars, grenades, or a slightly more effective melee weapon such as a blade on your rifle. These are all class specific items too. Not to mention 80% of shots are 1 shot kills, although certain weapons hold very limited ammo that won't reload until completely empty either, so it's actually balanced pretty well. It really makes you think about when to take the shot. Range is insane for the rifles. It's fairly difficult / takes some time to earn a scope, but it is most certainly possible to snipe enemies from over 100m away without one (actually just got that achievement). Overall, getting a kill in this game is extremely satisfying!The graphics aren't the greatest, but it's definitely not bad. Of course, there is much optimization to be done too. The sound is well done making close by shots really put a scare in you especially because one shot will probably kill you. Animation is prob worst part, but it's easily ignored by the awesome gameplay and VERY satisfying kills. Don't take my word for it, but considering the accuracty/range of rifles I would assume this kind of game would give an advatage to those who can handle higher graphics because it means seeing enemies further away. Regardless, I think this game is absolutely great and deserves more recognition and support. To be honest though, I wouldn't have bought this game if it wasn't on sale, but I can comfortably say it's worth the full price.***Major updates & Improvements since this was orginally posted. Verdun is now preparing for an offical launch on April 28th. They've come a long way and this game is still Rad!			"

												This game is a game that I have been waiting on for years. I have always wanted to play a WW1 game that focused on trench warfare and the western front. The level of detail that is put into these maps are above and beyond what other mainstream developers go to. The trenches are THE most realistic trenches I have seen in any game with the small details like covered up dead bodies laying on the ground and tiny little dug-outs for infantry to sleep. Even in the crater-filled No Man's Land I was taking cover from an enemy MG and just saw a pocket watch laying next to me. Just seeing this, I knew that the devs are really trying to get this as accurate as they can. Things likl pocket watches, spades, helmets and boots are scattered everywhere because they would be the sort of thing that would be dug up today.At times it can be confusing with all of these different soldiers most commonly on the allied side, where some soldiers are French, British or American all in one trench. Because in a game like this, you wopuld be looking out for different uniforms. So there have been a few times when I have been in an enemy trench and have turned a corner and accidently fired at a French soldier becuase their uniform almost looks like the German uniform.I absolutley love this game, if you buy this game (which you should be doing right now), definately plat the tench warfare game-mode (forgot what its called, you'll know it when you see it). This game is kind of what I was hoping BF1 would be, but BF1 didn't quite deliver on the whole trech warfare aspect.			"

												UPDATED REVIEW.For anyone who actually wants to feel WW1 and actually wants to enjoy hardcore trench combat with incredibly versatile roles (about 8 squadtypes with each having 4 different classes that vary from type to type, each with their own historically accurate weapons), incredibly well thought out squad and teamplay mechanics, personal progression as well as squad progression granting you very balanced and yet great perks... this is for you. You will get your moneys worth, the community is mostly mature and the game is really encouraging teamplay without forcing your hand.This game has now become stable, populated and refined. Gore has been Added, the battles are intense and the devs are continously updating it.See you in No Mans Land.			"

After playing just a little bit i am 1/4th of the way to the top rank, which for about 10 hours is pretty good, meanwhile call of duty you can level up as easy as your pubic hairs grow back.I do recommend this game. 8/10			"

												Verdun is a great but difficult FPS with a strong and historicaly acurate WW1 theme.I personally enjoyed the trench warfare, music and setting of Verdun, the gameplay is difficult but good as well. The squad based gameplay offers a fair amount of depth becasue learning the 4 different jobs and eventualy commanding your squad and coordinating artilery strikes with troop movments takes a long while to master.

												I like First Person Shooters with iron sights. Meaning: if you shoot from the hip, you are only able to hit what is directly in front of you; if you want to hit something which is 10m away, you HAVE to aim like with a real gun.You have to use a button to get the weapon up, pointing towards the enemy and use the sights of the weapon to target.This is so much better than some cross hairs which show you where your hits will be. It feels better. Much better.Verdun is such a shooter. There are different weapons from the time of World War 1 and most kill in one hit to the body, pistols need two shots to the body, grenades are brutal and so on.If you want to run around shooting at everything and killing people like a hero, wrong game.If you want to move slowly, then climb out of your hole and run zigzag towards the next hole, the whole time praying no sniper and no MG is targeting your area, then jumping into the hole and laying on the ground and preparing for the next run, then this is your game.If you want to sit somewhere with a rifle and snipe at people who are trying to run zigzag towards your position, then this is your game.If you want to setup a Machine Gun and spray down people who try to run towards you, this is your game.Don't expect real good graphics, don't expect smooth moving, don't expect really good weapons.Even the gameplay is not really good.Everything is good enough so you can have fun and perhaps this is the kind of game you want to play from time to time.Just so you know what I think good shooters are:- Survarium - Heroes & Generals - Borderlands - Call of Duty: World at War http://store.steampowered.com/app/10090/- Call of Duty®: Black Ops II http://store.steampowered.com/app/202990/These are really good shooters. High quality.Nevertheless, this game is not bad. It is fun for a while.I have no idea what engine they are using, but it is not good for this kind of game. Or not used in a good way.If you want a FPS game with iron sights in WW1, you don't have a lot of games to select one from. I don't know of any others. If you want a game where people have to move the front, where you have to cross a killing field, where nobody is the hero, this could be it for your.If you want a really good game, don't get this. Sorry.			"

												First of all I own this game since the very beginnings it was released on steam, not because I anticipated it but because I got it in a good price.After that I played a couple of hours and left it there.Until now. With BF1 releasing next month and all the nostalgia for WWI surfacing again I felt the need to play a game of that era in order to fill the gap until October.But with all videos coming up and Alpha of BF1 I was like: Hell this is not WWI, this is just BF set in WWI.So is Verdun a good game?Yes it is.ProsFew maps:The maps as I said are series of trenches well placed for defence and bad for offence, most of them if captured are difficult to held like it was one hadred years ago.(it is in the pros because the maps are what they had to be and not open battlefields with snipers on buildings or hills and tanks running like hell and soldiers with machine guns on the move shooting everything). Weapons:Weapons have a variety. Single shot rifles are what you find in most classes (yes there are classes thank God) but you can also meet machine guns (Germans are op like in reality), light machine guns, assault guns, and of course melee and grenades. Classes:There are many kind of classes most of them for coordinating in game like officers who can call mortars and smoke barrage and also point attack points and defence points. Also there are kinda many classes with a bit different equipment. You want a bolt action with one grenade you can have it, you want only your rifle with fixed bayonet also you can have it. Also the classes have 3 tiers which unlock with leveling up which is easy in one way in my opinion and you can easily pick what style you like.Graphics:They are not the Alpha and the Omega in this game as many titles these days. If you look for one game with ultra nice graphics and realism like you play in real life this is not your game. I do not say they are not nice (they are fine as all the game has B+ graphics) but for those who do not want anything less than Whitcher 3 or BF1 do not buy this game.Gameplay:Really easy to learn. Shooting is easy simply because you do not have to deal with fast objects and targets but when you learn to shoot correctly you get kills. What I do not know and can not really say is if there is bullet distance meter or instant kill when you shoot (I will look and report my findings). Connectivity:It is oversimple. You pick what you like in any map you like. If there is available position you go right into, if not it is easy either with trade or if the position is empty later on you switch. SO you do not like being an officer with just a hand gun and want a machine gun? trade or wait a couple of minutes. Also i never faced lagg problem, I play in an average 70ping which is good.ConsNo bullet drop. Something inserted in games from battlefield and it stays there. One AAA title, this is simpler game. See, shoot, XP earned.Not AAA graphics (for those who desperately feel a game must have them in order to feel satisfaction)Well for epiloge Verdun is a game of 20$ for giving you an enjoying War experience with good classes, fine maps, good shooting (basic tip, learn to say the differnce between a tree and an enemie). Really I can not see why not buy such a game especially if it goes in Sales.9,5/10PS: if you are camping animals with a sniper rifle I will love to find you on the battlefield... You are as good as dead... someone will figure out your position and will just chat it in the team. You see the next target and you goin for the kill? Nope, you will just gettin hammered with machine guns and mortars... Also you can not snipe properly in this game... "

												Trench warfare, constantly switching between attack and defence (counter attacking), variety of historically accurate battlefields, unique gameplay where every single shot matters, very high skill celling, but also easy to learn, great graphics, tactical and atmosphere, decent community and Devs that care and update their game.Verdun is a breath of fresh air in FPS industry. No more running around with SMGs spraying & praying and all that kind kind of bulls**t. Here you'll experience what it feels to crawl in a muddy trench surrounded by poisonous gas while mortars rain shells on you and pray that none lands anywhere near. You'll charge straigh into enemy fire, trying to reach their trench or any pit to take cover, and a few moments later you'll be shooting at the poor bast**ds trying to do the same. Here you'll need a sharp eye, quick thinking, bit of patience, steady aim and a pair to win.			"

								Seldomly do you find games that are set back in this era. Alot of time and effort has been put into the game and it really shows best in the scenery and level of detail. Playing this game was both exciting for both the online gaming and the historical experience. The graphics and level of detail is amazing. There is a slight learning curve to knowing what type of soldier you are and what your role is in game. Of course some of these questions may be answered by a quick search through the steam boards but it would be more user-friendly if more was explained in game. Overall i look forward to the progress of this game and what future content may still yet to come. I hope to see more of my own friends playing too!			"

												Well, I like this game a lot, this review won't go into very much detail just because I'm not really a good reviewer. But I have ONE HUGE PROBLEM with this. It's only the community, either their unfriendly or cocky, then there's times when one team is highly populated and stacked with high rankers and the other isnt very populated and has new players. Even when you bring attention to this most of the time (in my experience) the other teams members wont switch, maybe a few but not enough for it to balance. It gets really tedious and ridiculous after awhile, I don't get why these people don't switch to make it fair. Maybe they want easy XP but still. I recommend this game but I dislike the community.

												This game is like sniping in the battlefield series, but better and in a realistic ww1 setting. It's something I really enjoy, but it's difficult and I'd say it certainly isn't for everyone. If you're looking for a fast-paced run-n-gun, this is not that. The action is in the intensity of the trench combat and finding a sniper hiding out across the map. It's slow, it's hard, and by god, I love it all. The community is also one of the best I have ever been a part of, and that's a HUGE plus for me, since I like to talk to people while I play.			"

												Very fun and addictive. So much fun once you get the hang of it, and it's unique playstyle punishes your typical COD player, forcing you to slow down, and really think about your next move while at the sametime offering that ""snap shot"" quick draw feel. Would recommend picking this title up for the avid FPS player. Be sure to read the how to play guide and take your time  jumping into a live match as the learning curve is steep but enjoyable.			"

												This game is great for an independent developer. This game may have a few quirks and goofy movements, but overall it is excellent. A fun multiplayer with very accurate weapons and uniforms as well as maps. The game still updating an dadding new squads and hopefully more features soon. As i said, some glitches need to be solved but its nothing too big. The #1 complaint that i, and many other player shave, is sniper scopes. A few updates changed it and made them a bit useless and hard to use. Overall this game is great and i highly recommend it. With great graphics, sounds, maps, historically accurate, and instead of witty loading hints it gives you facts about WWI, which i personally thought was cool.Just to be a historian Nazi, the game says ""Verdun 1914-1918"". NONE of this game can take place in 1914 as gas masks were not used in WWI until 1916. Gas was used in 1914 and the onyl way the troops survived was by breathing in rags which were soaked in urine.

I'd say it takes awhile to train your eyes to see the enemy but once you get the hang of it its great fun. NCOs make sure you hangout just before the enemy trench so everyone can spawn close.			"

												So far really liking this game, Got it from h0mmer (Thnx buddy) and really enojoying the scene and vibe. Wish there would be more players tho, thats whats the game lacking of but still enough for full action combat (Hide and shoot and hide that is  :D)  Don't expect any CoD move style tactics shannanigans in here. If u do want that go play CoD ;)Not the best looking or best shooter out there, but one with a great atmosphere that will suck u right into it. Specially while ur focused to get those popping heads out of the trenches.So what are u waiting for, BUY IT< IT DUTCH QUALITY SO U KNOW ITS GOED .... , when u done that hit me up and lets play :D			"

												I really enjoy the combat mechanics brought into play (offensive and defensive phases when trying to capture/defend a trench). It really gives the game a unique flavor. I also like the fact that team cooperation is a must if you want to take home the victory, as opposed to other FPS that are more focused on individual achievements. I definitely recommend this game.If I could add anything to this game it be a single player campaign. Doing so would add so much more substance to this already great game!			"

I always look forward to the additions that the developers add, and they listen very closely to their fans.  I just hope that they find a way to add tanks!			"

												UPDATE: Im a little concerned. The game that worked fairly well seems to be very problematic all of the sudden, today, 5/4/15. Just tried playing in a few games and something is very wrong. Usually my k/d is about 10 to 1. Today, every spawn is putting me into a position of insta-death. Enemy players literally invicible. I watched enemies spawn behind our ""Defend"" position and way behind me. (as I was running back to get some distance with a scope I see a player spawn in...its an enemy. Not supposed to be happening at all. They are shooting through large (vertical heigh) of ground. And not to mention walking through ground. This isnt on just one server. Ive tried a few and saw all of the above. So waht is going on?? I really hope the devs didnt just ruin a very well made game.ORIGINAL REVIEWWay better than Battlefield Hardline! It actually worksIve only played for a few minutes. But anyone who plays a lot of FPS can immediately tell of the game is any good. It is. Its just great. Period. Now, that doesnt mean that there arent some stupid little unfriendly quirks. But there arent enough to impact any overall score of the game.I will do a more in-depth review - detail the positives along with the negatives - in the next few days. Until then, buy it so I can blow your head off when you peek out of the trench!Added (5/1/15): Another great thing about Verdun is you can jump into a game fast, play a round, and be done. Since the load times are almost non-existent (and Im only using an HDD) its not like other mass multiplayer games that take 5 minutes or more just to get into the match. Try hopping into a Battlefield game quickly. It wont happen. I can brew a pot of coffee in the time it takes to load me into a server. Verdun starts up fast, joinining games is fast. The whole process works			"

								I've played this game for about two days now (at the time of my review)... and the game is pretty fun. The object seems to be to advance and defend. It is based around charging and counter charging just like the real war. It's a beta right now but there doesn't seem to be many problems. The only thing thats wrong with it is that when you get shot, your screen will freeze for about a half a second and then you will be dead. It's frustrating when you are aiming at someone and they are aiming at you and then you try to shoot and it won't shoot because you realize you are dead. Other than that it's pretty damn fun game. Keep in mind that this is not a mainstream game so if you play COD and stuff like that you can ♥♥♥♥ right off. I strongly recommend this game and I'm sure they will fix that one glitch soon.			"

												Verdun is a game that really aims to be a realistic depiction of how war was fought during WW1. I think in that respect it succeeds brilliantly. This is trench warfare as it really must have been: - waiting around for the enemy, and then getting shot in the head from somewhere you never saw coming. - going ""over the top"" of the trench on command of your squad leader, and getting mowed down almost instantly.- Capturing an area, only to be hammered with chemical gasses- putting on your gas mask, obstructing your visibility so you can hardly see where (or who) you are shooting.The gameplay is brutal and unforgiving, but hey, this is war! I love how the game doesn't make it ""arcady"" or easy. This makes it all the more rewarding when you get to kill someone. The graphics and lighting are really nice too, being nice and muddy in the trenches, but has a good selection of more colorfull maps as well. If you are not afraid of a challenge, I recommend it!

Lovely game and great maps, weapons and characters!The maps are very raw and unforgiving when it comes to the combat, the core tactic is to keep your head down and advance through the trenches.There are two gamemodes as of now,- Deathmatch, pick a rifle and spawn somewhere on the map and combat with up to 16 other players. Fast paced and very good to learn the weapons and maps.- ""Squad Combat"", two teams where each team is built up on multiple squads. Each squad has it's own theme and abilities and this needs to be taken into account when playing a map since too many of one squad can be bad for the outcome of the match.SquadsThere are different types of squad in the game, each one has their own playstyle. Some are based on calling in mortar strikes or gas, some are recon based and some are more offensive. The right mix of these really makes the matches more enjoyable!One thing though...Only downside at the moment is that there are too many players picking the ""Squad Combat"" mode and playing it as if it was deathmatch, which sucks for the players who want to play the mode as it was intended to be played. This can result in some salty chat and boring experience but most of the time the matches go on and hopefully the players change their playstyle to fit the mode!			"

												A great game based on a war often neglected by video games. Unfortunately may be forgotten by many after BF1 comes out, but personally I will continue to play it for a long while. The Frontlines mode encourages teamplay, which makes it a great game to play with a group of 3 friends for that full squad experience. The wide array of weapons and classes means you can choose what fits you the best. There are a large amount of maps and even when you play the same map you have already played before, it still feels like a new experience. Definitely worth the price of admission.			"

Many todays fps are just copy pasted ideas rehached together over and over again Thats where Verdun comes and shows its unique and never before done style of gameplay , ww1 trench warfare never before have you tried to cross nomasland and then fail more than 10 times in row (worst case :D) never before have you tried to hold your own trench and while same time gas comes a long and makes visibility lot worse. Its these key things and many more that make this game unique and new , i truelly recommendid if you are tired of todays copy pasted fps games or you are hardcore fps fan and you are looking for new game , or you just want to see horrors of ww1.

								Ok, Verdun is a great game and any WWI fan would be crazy about it. The loadout system is unique like you unlock new classes in different squad types. Frontlines mode is great. But if you want a really intense match play rifle death match mode. There are some bugs because it's still in early acsess. (Mabey not when your reading this review.) On a scale of 10 I rate it an 9/10 I highly reccomend it. It isn't the best optimised but that will hopefully be taken care of by the devs.			"

												At first I was angry; Its not your typical shooter at all. When I started playing I wasen't enjoying it at all and at some point I requested a refund! But I continue to play and give it a second chance. Now am addicted to the game! The Devs are awesoma and though I havent played that much I can tell you this: its not for everyone but everyone can enjoy it! It takes some time but eventually its pretty fun. I would give it 10/10 since its feels like a complete game that grows.			"

												This game is really fun, I love the realistic part of getting hit once or twice and you're dead, there's only a few bugs, that get annoying,1) sometimes you get teleported outside a trench, especially annoying if you just charged into it, get moved back out 5 metres, 2) when lying down on an edge or trench or crater, and you're weapon points into the sky, dunno if it can be fixed, but it's annoyingly unrealistic, 3) sometimes hits don't register, I had to bayonet 12 times to kill one bloke who unloaded a whole mag of (the german mg) into me, other then that, it's an awesome game, brilliant, I'd love to see some new skins, I don't know much about the central powers other then maybe having turks in there as well, and for entente have the anzac's and the americans added, that would be awesome, also maybe highlanders, just some thought, the only thing that needs to be balanced a bit, is either give another entente squad sector artillery or nerf the german one a bit, it seems to home in on the players in the area, as you can be hiding in a corner with it all exploding around you, and one of the last shots will land EXACTLY where you are lying/crouching,  and the mg's need to be less accurate, IF you can get to a good spot, you can't really miss with them,thanks for a great game,			"

												Aug 5, 2014: When I first got this game, I tried playing it with my friend and everything went wrong. It kept kicking me out of the round for no reason, we couldn't add each other as friends (which we still can't do, please fix this), finding each other's squad to join was very hard, and the gameplay was absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ It would run at 5 fps at best and everything was really glitchy and ♥♥♥♥ed up. HOWEVER, I then tried to play the game again several days later by myself, and everything worked perfectly. Obviously I didn't have to worry about making my squad and having my friend try to find it, but I was able to join right in without being randomly kicked, the gameplay was very smooth and ran at about 40 fps, and there weren't really any glitches, other than when you duck down, you can still get shot and killed sometimes, but it's immediately, so it's understandable, but still annoying. When this game is working, it is VERY fun to play and a really cool WW1 simulator, however, there are still several things that need to be worked on in order for it to be even better. As of right now, I give it a 7/10.UPDATE:June 30, 2016: After about two years of playing this game, I have seen it go through many different stages, have seen many bugs patched, and have certainly seen hard work and dedication to the game by the devs. They have added in so many new weapons, squads, abilities, and gameplay mechanics and I could not be happier with my purchase of this game, back when it was in early alpha. The dev team for Verdun has been one of the best dev teams for any game I have played, and the game itself really sucks you into a pretty accurate representation of The Great War. Not only is it historically accurate, for the most part, but the way they make the teams switch on and off from counter attacks, defending, retreating, and advancing gives it a lot of depth and keeps the combat fun and enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes mil-sims, even though this isn't a full on simulator, and anyone who is a big world war enthusiast. It could still use some bug patches and what not, but it is almost entirely perfect at this point in time. I would now give it a solid 9.5/10.			"

												Without any competition, Verdun is the best and only WWI shooter on the market.But it has legs and will probably stand up to whatever may come in the future.Remember that wall of a difficulty curve in Red Orchestra (a comparably realistic shooter experience)?That doesn't happen here.Sure, you have it tough in the beginning, but after you get to grips with a few of the maps and realise that you need to keep your noggin down, you end up pulling your weight pretty fast.It's got a good amount of maps, a varied series of tactics to be employed in conquering trenches, some working better than others depending upon the map, and you have every chance of killing a level 100 vet even as a level 1 grunt.Le good:The attention to detail is amazing.Squadding up with friends is a blast and a half, it really gets you into the moment.There's variety in weapons/roles/squads.The weapons feel satisfying.Graphic representations of every projectile that flies around lets you see mortar shots incoming, muzzle flashes, bullet trajectories.Le bad:Takes a while to get used to targetting, especially in close combat.Mesh issues still pop up once in a while, prompting you to get stuck in texture.A few bugs still arise and cause you to teleport 50 metres across the map with little to no warning.All in all, the bad things about this game are mostly technical issues, which are slowly but surely being taken care of by the devs who are pouring their heart into this.If you want a realistic, historical, atmospheric, tense shooter that tackles The Great War, this one's for you.And if people give you flak about it feeling contrived because you get executed for deserting, they probably know ♥♥♥♥ all about WWI - don't mind 'em, send 'em back to school and get 'em to brush up on their history.This is the best and most realistic depiction of a war in a game, shooter or otherwise.P.S. alright, alright, there's no friendly fire. Sorry. Deal with it, eh?			"

								I'm going to give my review of the game after spending 6 straight hours playing it.This game is a breath of fresh air. Why you may ask? Because of the core mechanic of the game: Trench warfare. The system of attacking and defending the trenches makes this the best paced multiplayer shooters I have ever played. Thats why I played it for 6 straight hours! It gives this game no stale moment. As soon as you might get bored defending your trench, its time to rush and attack the enemy's.The issue I hear the most is with the net code. No its not perfect. Yes every once in a while you will get shot behind a corner or miss someone you should have got. This is very frustrating and something that must be changed, but at least for me, not a common sight. After looking through the forums and asking a few questions myself, it is clear the devs care about the game. I have no doubt that the net code will get better with time.Please don't let this game pass you by. If you enjoy tactical shooters without the slugishness that usually accompanies them, get this game. However if you are looking for a finished product, wait until the game is release and check it out again.Current rating: 7/10			"

												Verdun is a first person shooter (FPS) which places you in the trenches of the first world war (yes, the one 1914 to 1918).This FPS tries to be on the realistic side of things. Meaning that running, getting hit, amount of ammo, type of rifles and additions to them, etc. are rather accurate to setting.It only offers infantry (there are no vehicules of any kind, at least that I know of).You can either fight in some sort of PvE mode which makes you fight off waves of enemies with up to four other players or you can play the first person shooter mode against all human players in rather big battles.With your progress (kill enemies and aquire targets, etc) you earn experience points which add up to rank. With each rank you receive some sort of...well...coins or points. With those you can unlock weapons, weapon sets and weapon additions.It is certainly no Call of Duty or Battlefield (especially considering the announced new one), Verdun is more on the realistic side and not as fast paced. If there is a need to comparison, then Red Orchestra is certainly closer to Verdun while Arma 3 (beside of the setting, of course) might be even a bit more ""realistic"" (in terms of simulation).I'd say that this game is most definitly worth a try when you like first person shooter which either are not evolving around fast paced rounds or lots of blood and not too terribly much on the simulation side.

Maps are gorgeous and really feel like hellish trenches and crater-strewn terrain.Definitely would recommend this game. Ends up feeling kind of like insurgency, but in WWI. There's a distinct lack of WWI games out there, and this one definitely fills that niche well			"

You die when you are shot, you aren't the normal bullet sponge most games make you, there are a variety of classes and different weaponry ranging from Mgs, rifles, smg(1), shotgun(1), flamewthrower, snipers, revolvers and lugers and bunch other pistols. you can call in artillary, gas, smoke, mortars and there are a variety of grenades for you to choose from on some classes. on top of all that there are a decent number of maps. although this game will be hard to understand for most starting off, give it a couple games and you'll get it.

I was super excited when I found out it was going to be released on steam, I think the price at the time was around 20 USD which isn't a bad price at all!  Over the many months of this games release it has been and continues to be tweaked and improved!  The Devs are constantly jumping into matches and spending time with the players I assume they are getting feedback by doing this. New content is being added as time goes on such as weapons, army's, maps and so on! The game play is great, it's one of the only WW1 frontline multiplayer games out there I may add!  Graphics have been nice lately "" I use a EVGA 780ti.  If you love fps and want to experience a WW1 trench warfare experience then give this game a try!			"

												Verdun is a first person shooter placed directly in World War One on the Western Front. I must say that overall it is a very solid game, but it does require a powerful computer. Each game consists of one side that attacks the other side's trench, and if successful, captures it, and now must defend it; however, if they fail, then the defending side counter-attacks, and et cetera. People connect in squads of four; the leader of this squad can call down gas and mortar strikes. The graphics are high-quality, and the game itself follows true to the actual events of World War One. However, I must warn you that if you aren't very good at sniping, this might not be the game for you if you are the one playing defense.			"

												This game does not get the credit it deserves If you have been craving a realistic WW1 shooter since seeing the BF1 trailer then this will tie you over and ma by even win a place in your heart.the battles are awesome with a really real feel you really feel like your knee deep in mud as the bullets fly over your head just waiting for that ominous whistle that means you need to face the bullets head on. No stupid health bar and make sure you count them bullets as No silly bullet counter on screen nothing is handed to you on a plate.you really need to watch your head in this as 1 wrong move will mean certain death so prepare to spend a lot of time crawling through mud while shells and bullets whistle past you. just to hear the pop of mustard gas and your captain screams of ""GAS GAS GAS"".This game is very unforgiving and very gory at times and the sound of your team mates pain while they lose a limb to enemy shelling with ring through your head after pressing the quit button.the only sad thing is that more people don't play this epic title please put the word out to0 your friends and family and get this game played.

								it is similar game to rising storm/ro2 mp game, so most people enjoying those type of games will found this one very amazing. even more charming is the fact that the game is set in WWI which is very rare in my opinion. gameplay is a mixture of tactical fps, squad and strategic attack/defense game and simulation in a way. huge open fields, periodic defense and attack points, so this might demand some squad/team play. this game also have some ""historic"" feel, in educational way. i recommend this game very much to all tactical fps fans.

								A awesome WW1 tatical FPS, you get that horrid feeling of being in a trench as enemy gas forces you to put your gas mask on making it harder to see as the enemy are pushing up some even breaking into your trench forcing hand to hand combat Or when you are on the offensive despretly diving into craters in no mans land to avoid being picked off then enemy mortars rain down on you forcing you to make a mad ""all or nothing"" dash into the enemy trench. However all is not perfect (as you would expect) movent can feel a little clunky at times and your bullets feel a little laggy, but thats just my opionion and your experience may vary. Overall the game is great and is set to be a awesome WW1 tatical FPS 8/10, pick it up now to support the devs and it's on sale!			"

												One of the best, most atmospheric, and scary war shooters ever created.I'm going to do a list of pro's and cons.+ Beautifully done game+ One of, if not THE BEST war atmospheres ever created.+ Very nice graphical fidelity+ Realistic weapon damage output. You don't need to shoot someone 5 or 6 times.+ Updated gun sounds make them sound more ""powerful""+++ Trench warfare+  Multiple types of Chemical gas + The gas mask makes you feel crowded. Aiming becomes difficult, vision becomes obscured, and you can hear yourself breathing heavily through it.+ Buy this game right now.- Bullet registry. Sometimes you dive into cover, but you'll die after you're behind it. This is a LOT better than it was a few months ago.- At long distances, ofen through a sniper scope, textures can become completely smudged, or dissappear completely. This is such a minor thing however, as all of the pros outweigh it by so much.As you can see, there is MANY more PRO'S than cons. I would 120% recommend this game to any of my friends.			"

												Not only are WWI games rare, but Verdun is a damn good one.The thing about this game that truly makes it stand out in my eyes is the sheer brutality of it. (You'll need to turn the gore setting to ULTRA to experience this.)Imagine you're a British soldier on the front lines. You glance over the top of the trench and see a German hard charging toward you. You squeeze a shot off and Gerry drops about 20 meters in front of your trench. As you chamber a new round in your rifle, you hear the soldier you just shot let out a bloodcurdling scream. You wait for more to arrive, and the screaming has only gotten louder. This isn't a low-pitched scream of a large man, this is the scream of someone very young, probably not even in his 20's yet. Eventually, he succumbs to his wounds and the screaming ceases.Verdun has something that a lot of shooters lack, the dying. Take Call of Doots: You shoot someone, they die, you move on. Then you have Verdun: You gut shoot someone and you can hear the pain you just caused them from half the battlefield away. Bayonet someone in the neck, and they'll lay helpless on the ground gurgling their own blood. You'll see howitzers send legless bodies flying, wounded screaming men that now have only one arm, and I won't even go into flamethrowers.Pros:-Play as one of 4 members of historical squads from different nations in the war. (U.S. Doughboys, Tommies, Canadians, U.S. Marines, Schutz, etc.) Each of which have their own unique weapons and perks.-Very immersive. No other game quite matches the feeling you get when your NCO blows the whistle to go over the top like Verdun.-Multiple game modes. If you don't feel like playing the usual frontlines or don't feel like facing real people in general, you can play squad defense instead. This is a game mode where you join a squad and survive waves of AI attackers. (I'm a big fan of this game mode.)Cons:-The game still has its share of bugs. Nothing that should turn you off from the game though. One time I even saw someone pistol whip a German to death with a Lewis gun. You don't want to miss out on that hilarity.-WWI is difficult. You will die a lot. That's just a result of how the warfare was at this time.1914/1918, would charge across no man's land for the fatherland again			"

								I'm only 4.5 hours in and I'm really starting to see the originality come out of this game. It truly is a squad based fps and if you don't stay with them you will not survive. Each member of the 4 player squad has a role and only 1 person can play as that role, but you can offer to switch rolls. One thing that really stand out to me is that you feel everyone is fighitng on one giant map. Although you technically spend the entire round in one area, it's all connected. Instead of picking a server you look at a map and select an area which then shows all the battallions situated there as well as which team is currently holding that territory. While your holding down trenches, another batallion is pushing up the line to where you team can take place. It's very difficult at first if you're used to having several items/weapons/explosives on hand. The only items available in Verdun that I've seen so far are binoculars, grenades, or a slightly more effective melee weapon such as a blade on your rifle. These are all class specific items too. Not to mention 80% of shots are 1 shot kills, although certain weapons hold very limited ammo that won't reload until completely empty either, so it's actually balanced pretty well. It really makes you think about when to take the shot. Range is insane for the rifles. It's fairly difficult / takes some time to earn a scope, but it is most certainly possible to snipe enemies from over 100m away without one (actually just got that achievement). Overall, getting a kill in this game is extremely satisfying!The graphics aren't the greatest, but it's definitely not bad. Of course, there is much optimization to be done too. The sound is well done making close by shots really put a scare in you especially because one shot will probably kill you. Animation is prob worst part, but it's easily ignored by the awesome gameplay and VERY satisfying kills. Don't take my word for it, but considering the accuracty/range of rifles I would assume this kind of game would give an advatage to those who can handle higher graphics because it means seeing enemies further away. Regardless, I think this game is absolutely great and deserves more recognition and support. To be honest though, I wouldn't have bought this game if it wasn't on sale, but I can comfortably say it's worth the full price.***Major updates & Improvements since this was orginally posted. Verdun is now preparing for an offical launch on April 28th. They've come a long way and this game is still Rad!			"

								Rarely Do I bother to write reviews on Steam, but this game was so outstanding I had to. I have long felt that a World War One FPS was needed and this satisfies. For the history buffs, such as myself, this game is extremely realistic. The damage inflicted by the weapons and their fire rates are very accurate. The battlefields are very realistic and feel like they were recreated from actual battlefields. The music, the UI, everthing about this game feels like the world war one era. Of course, its early access and their are some glitches, but overall it works fine. The graphics are nothing special, but they are by no means bad. I would definatly recomend this game to every hisotry buff or fps fan. 10/10			"

								As of july 28 2014 the game is still in a early beta-like state... but i must say its deeply interesting and something the FPS world has needed for a while now (a WW1 game) it totally flips the idea of the ""call of duty"" like game-play upside down. you feel totaly immersed in the game play with bombs going off and bullets whizzing past your head. i reall would like to see more from the game though, more weapon selection(so far theres only a rifle and a pistol, but it seems asthough the weapons upgrade) better render distance, the game is a big field almost and when you think you're hiding in bushes the enemy can see you clear as day. those are really the only two setbacks, keep in mind by the time you read this it may already be fixed. regardless GREAT GAME!

								for such a small game Verdun has suprisingly become one of my favorite fps games. Now I have only played the game for six ours(at the time of this review being written) but in this short amount of time Verdun keeps on impressing me. Their are two game modes one is free-for-all and the other is front line mode. In front line mode you either start out attacking or defending a trench. Every time your team is successful you get a point and get the opposite oblective of what you just had . As of now there are only four maps but those four maps have been enough for me. The game continues to deliver fun fast paced action every match. One time when defending a trench I found cover and started to shoot french soldiers charging the trench. One by one they continued to fall down until the trench was secured. Another time two of my teamates were pinned down so I went thru the trench we were attacking and when I got to the spot where the enemies were I Just started to line up the shot and took four guys out. The only negatives I could find about this game are that their can be lag there is a limited amount of weapons and their are no unlockable items (so far). Besides that I definitely recomend this game to anyone who likes fps games.			"

												Verdun - the best game about First World War since... ehm... hmm. This game proved that ""boring"" and ""monotonous"" trench warfare can be bloody fun. War is hell. You hear your commander whistle, you jump off the trench, you see your buddies run straight into chlorine cloud. Your squadmate tries to put on gas mask and misses the barbed wire, gets entangled in it. Your other friend turns to him, looks, thinks about helping him, but gets nailed with an enemy bullet. French, British, American, German, Canadian, Belgian... No man's land is just a giant mincer, chopping off your lives short. You see how people in front of you get mowed, running straight into machine gun crossfire. You have a split second to decide: do I crouch and turn back? Maybe I can get through? You are wrong. You will never get through. And even if by some miracle you make it to the enemy trench, you'll get ambushed by a rifleman, hiding behind a barrel. As the time goes, you'll see young soldiers become veterans with waxed moustaches, ready to die for their Fatherland. But is it really worth fighting?If you start thinking about it all, you might miss the command to retreat. The next thing you see is your lifeless body flying away, while the mortars hammer your position. Unless you affix your bayonet and charge your enemy, how dare you claim to know anything about true dirt and pain of virtual warfare? Get immersed into this painful world of war, and remember lads: It's a long long way to Tipperary			"

												First off i got this on sale a few days ago instead of fl price just incase it was not enjoyable. I then found out it would he worth the original price. After a complication of the game crashing once i set the video to high i managed to fix this and could play it properly. And i have got to say it is one of the greatest fps games i have played for a long time most fps games these days are modern or futuristic shooters and the odd ww2 shooter here and there its not often you come across first world war. Especially one based off a real event and real locations this is a are occurrence too. The trench fights close to distant combat make it very enjoyable  for people who love close combat and combat from afar i will highly recommend this game to any ww1 fans and fps fans 9.5/10 i would give it 10 if i didn't have that complication of the game crashing  if this did not happen i would have a few more hours packed into this already thanks for reading and i hope i have helped you make the right choice (buy it!)

												First of all before I start giving my Review right. Game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. 9.5/10So here are the things that need to be fixed / updated.Alright. When you die in Verdun while Proun you might get a really weird animation that makes the character hold a air rifle for like 10-20 seconds and then the character drops dead. That needs to be fixed since it looks quite ugly and people might come to the idea that it is an actual enemy. Another thing I found was that when I reloaded the Lee Enfield and then wanted to shoot , the magazine disappeared and it overdid the reload animation. I think that just needs to be a little bit more smooth. And some optimization would be always good. Oh yes. Sometimes when you are pround and you're kinda limited with your movement , there is a really stupid situation where you can't even shoot the gun or even switch to your second weapon or whatever. I hope that my English wasn't so much cancer since I'm from Germany and ye. In Overall it's a great game for it's price.			"

												I know people are hating on Battlefield 1 but people need to understand that Battlefield is its own series.  Verdun is very good, it's funny sometimes and almost always fun to play and looks fairly good for what it's worth, but it is the most realistic setting WW1 game out there.  Yes, it takes team tactics to win and yes, it can be slow at times but that only mirrors the real WW1 because the truth is, WW1 was not the most interesting war to have ever taken place.  That being said, Battlefield is a cinematic movie-looking FPS series that's changed little over time: it's meant to be fast paced, it's meant to be fun, and yes, it's meant to be a little unrealistic if that means the game will be more fun overall.  Don't get me wrong, I love Verdun, but sometimes I get the feeling that it's so realistic that it's never going to be as fun as a game like Battlefield 1 will be, to me at least.  Just because two games focus on WW1 doesn't mean they have to be the same game, and doesn't mean they both have to be hyper-realistic to satisfy all the manchilds out there complaining about Battlefield 1.  So if you want to immerse yourself in the WW1 atmosphere, if you want to get to know the guns/areas and factions and whatnot before Battlefield 1 comes out, by all means get this game.  Don't expect it to be super action-packed cinematic goodness, because it's not.  This is more of a simulator than what I think of as a FPS but like I said it's still very good.  Don't expect this to be Battlefield 1, and don't expect Battlefield 1 to be like Verdun when it comes out later this year.  I love Verdun, but I'm really looking forward to playing a fast-paced fun WW1 game that's willing to sacrifice some realistic-ness in the name of making a fun game.			"

												after playing this game for a few hours i can really say that i enjoy this game for its realism.This is how one of the battles i was in went. I just started a new squad with 2 other people which was a rifleman and an officer while i was a grenadier. we start the battle and we attack the trench and i throw a grenade into the trench killing a defender making that part of the trench clear. As we make our way through the trench i see a teammate get shot in front of me so i make the squad hold up and let me throw a grenade. When i threw the grenade it killed the 3 people camping there and we moved up. Then we had to defend the trench while our teammates got to the trench. The officer and rifleman set up firing positions and began killing the attackers while i was covering them. I then heard a scream and turned around to see the rifleman was shot in the throat and dying. I tld him that he would get out alive and then he died right in front of me. As he died the officer got shot in the arm by an anti tank gun and killed. I went mad and charged the sniper and suicide bombed him. Then I played Verdun! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												This game is a lot of fun because it tackles a seldom explored area of war and history, that being WWI. The weapons and uniforms are faithful to the time period and the game including weapons and maps feels very balanced. It is a ton of fun, especially with friends where you can play together in squads and take up specific roles such as commander and machine gunner. I would recommend this game to someone looking for an FPS experience that is different than most modern ones, with a stronger emphasis on strategy and patience as opposed to standard run and gun tactics.

								it is similar game to rising storm/ro2 mp game, so most people enjoying those type of games will found this one very amazing. even more charming is the fact that the game is set in WWI which is very rare in my opinion. gameplay is a mixture of tactical fps, squad and strategic attack/defense game and simulation in a way. huge open fields, periodic defense and attack points, so this might demand some squad/team play. this game also have some ""historic"" feel, in educational way. i recommend this game very much to all tactical fps fans.

												The Good: This isn't your normal first person shooter where you can run around on your own and rack up the points. Sure, you can do that in Verdun, but it won't get you anywhere very far. The gameplay is based around solid team work and good communication, something you don't normally expect to see worked into fps games often. It makes for an enjoyable and satisfying gameplay in a time setting that is not explored through games very well, but the sounds, guns, and different maps really put you feel like you're in the Great War, hunkering down trying to avoid bullets and artillery, and then sprinting to the enemy trench to take out the enemy. The Bad: There isn't really anything terrible that I have encountered yet in Verdun. I suppose one improvement I can suggest for the developers, however, is to somehow implement a tank or two on the battlefield, a major part of the war. You are able to use a lot of new ""modern"" weaponry in the game like grenades, machine guns, submachine guns, gas, and even planes, but no tanks. The team balancing sytem is a nice and welcome touch, but sometimes the game is too lopsided and things can turn south every game. Not sure exactly how to better that. In summary, it's a fun and creative WW1 fps. If you're looking for a different type of shooting game, I'd recommend this one.			"

												- Do you like classic shooters?- Are you interested in The Great War?- Do you not mind getting killed a whole lot? If so, then you will probably enjoy Verdun.Verdun is a  slow and satisfying shooter, the gun sounds and animations feel nice and realistic, and you fight mostly in trenches. A battle consists of 2 different aspects, attacking enemy territory, and defending your own. You will most likely feel like cannon fodder in your first games, and maybe you'll always feel that way while playing, but that's part of the experience.The community isn't very big but there will always be some good servers running with enough people, and the players are overall very friendly. The developers regularly give updates on what content is coming up next and have improved the game a whole lot since it's launch and are still working on some very nice things.Recommended :) "

												100 year anniversary of the battle of Verdun might as well do a review. Game is pretty awesome, highly recommend it. Not for run and gun shooter fans, this game takes patience, intelligence and team work. Each match plays like King of the Hill with a series of trenches, where one side defends and the other side attacks. If attackers take the defenders trench within the time limit (I think 5 minutes) then the timer is reset, and defending team has to retake their trench, if they fail to do so then they retreat to the next trench behind them. Eventually one side is either pushed too far back to their last trench, or the overall game timer runs out and the side who captured to most trenches win. The Squad system is pretty interesting, but with some issues. There are multiple squad types each having different rolls, and thus having different soldier types available, but most people play using the German Landers, French Poilues, or British Tommes squad types because they have the most streight forward soldier types in their squad; An officer who uses a pistol by default but can level up to have a rifle and can call in artillery, a Rifleman who can upgrade to be a sniper, A machine gunner who can use a machine gun (go figure), or a Grenadier who carries a lot of grenades.Apparently the squads themselves level up but from my experience once you create a squad there’s no way to find it when you stop playing and come back later. Usually I find myself joining free spots on existing squads anyway, so take this bit with a grain of salt. Overall a pretty cool Objective FPS that you can play with friends or by your self. Pros:-Great First Person Shooter, very tactical heavy requiring teamwork, brains and patience. -Straight forward role system that unlocks as you level up. -Various maps that have different challenges as you try to fight through them. -Non Toxic player community that is actually pleasent to banter with in the chat. Cons:-Player population very, sometimes its hard to get into a server, other times its deserted. -Wonky Animations, but they're still working on it. -Some LOD issues with terrain where you can sometimes see players through objects like sandbags or obstacles that are far away.

												Ill start by saying this is not COD, so that should be grounds enough to give this a try. PROS:1) realism mechanics: stuck on barbed wire, being gassed, suppresive fire, cardio endurance, must not rush and key jam      while reloading or you will not seat your bolt properly, if you get shot 9/10 times you will die. no sprinting with MGs.2) leadership: in Verdun leadership plays an important role and pushes team play. The NCOs have special abilitys to call in artillery, gas, recon planes and such in order to assist in the battle; making them priceless if used effectively. NCOs can also mark where to focus an attack making it easier to maneuver on the battlefield.3) this game isnt made by your top tier shooter developers so the focus is more about how they care about the game they made and less about how can i nickle and dime my market then move on to the next turd.4) its the only WW1 shooter I know of making it basically an untouched market and I feel anyone would have a hard time making this better overall without more realism mechanics such as first aid application, wounds that bleed out and such.5) the game is very affordable and there are no in game purchases6) THERE IS NO GORE PPPPLEASE ADD GORE or atleast a setting to choose to have it on if you wish.CONS: 1)There arent alot of maps to choose from, although the ones that we do have are not bad (they are providing a free update/expansion with new maps and some other stuff very soon)2) sometimes you will be so sure there is no conceivable way you missed that shot, maybe due to lag but it usualy ends with you being dead and wondering...how?3) no uniform selectable uniform/appearance changes ( you will get new uniforms as your squad progresses but only during that game, once you leave its gone),4) I want to loot corpses for ammo/grenades, and use the enemy firearms if i find one on the battlefield i like better.5) MGs could use some tweaking, they do have limitations but overall i feel they are much too powerful and i dont think you should be able to hip fire a couple of those beasts.thats all i have for now, over all it is a great game for what it is. it can be frustrating but usually its because you are trying to rush ahead like youre playing black ops II. take your time, play the game like a troll trench camper because thats what WWI was. buy it.

												After about a solid 100 hours in the game and im still rather a new comer to the title I feel like I can write a solid review about verdun. If your looking for a flashback of simpler times where your skill, accuracy, and timing were rewarded this may be the game for you. Growing up I would spend countless hours on cod, cod2 and all the medal of honors. Although this game is set in ww1 the core mechanics of playing verdun seem very familiar and almost nostalgic to me. The weapons are simple, upgrades make sense, squad work is essential, and everyone has their role. Objectives are very simple and are a constant tug and pull style frontlines that are pretty realistic for the time period. Maps are well designed and balanced for the most part and utilization of cover and map placement is the key to sucess in the frontlines. Graphics are impressive and youll only have a few glitchy textures at far distance but that varies from rig to rig. Sounds are pretty good aside from a few stale sounding explosions (artillery and grenades will kill you alot) but im sure theyll add more. The Historical accuracy of this game was a thing the developers took seriously and it shows, Im a huge history buff and I haven't really noticed anything a miss. The thing that is this games selling point is literally its price at only 22.99USD you can't go wrong with this game and its still in beta with a steady supply of new content. The only real downside is the games small player base or community. Late at night you'll often find it difficult to find full matches even when changing servers EU, JP, ASIA, AUS.  But im sure the games community will only grow from here.			"

												The historical accuracy in this game is simply wonderful, a dedicated team of developers have obviously devoted a large amount of time to Verdun and still are devoting it! The Eastern Front has been promised as a future expansion and even the game as it is now is simply great. Charging over the top of your own trench into a hail of machine- gun fire, a downpour of artillery shelling and (of course) barbed wire certainly is very captivating. This feeling is enforced by the wonderful grafics and sound effects. Now, there are still some bugs in the game, but these are rare and small things mainly. I can definately and confidently give Verdun 10/10 and it is probably the best game I have ever played.			"

												When I first bought this game I had problems with framedrops and although I liked the game this problem annoyed me so much that I stopped playing.Now after some time I thought I'd give it a try again and it seems like some update has fixed this issue. The game itself is really enjoyable because it does a good job of recreating the ambiance of the time period. On top of that I think it is the best of the very few fps that are based in WW1. It's definitely not recommendable for CoD kiddos who dislike camping cause this game is kinda about camping. The challenge is in working out the defending/camping team.			"

												I love verdun, you meet all sorts of funny, and nice people, who just want to blow your brains out. I had the most interesting experience ever on Verdun. Now you may ask ""what happened?"", well I'll tell you. It was a small lobby of about 6, we had just finished the last match, when we loaded into a new map (dun dun dunnn). At this point, there where 3 of us left on the lobby, and two of us were constantly dying from suicide (according to the game). The other player ;eft the lobby after his 10th death. but i refused to go out like this!, suddenly the remaining user (who hasnt died from suicide) tells me that he has a away to restore my terrain, and I said ""how?"". The man replied "" I can rstore your terrain, IF you answer me this. I reply shivering with fear ""Okay?"", the man simply said ""Do you like Fish Sticks?"". And as I contemplated whether or not I truly did enjoy the seafood of question, I quickly said yes to get my terrain back. The man says ""So your a gay fish?"" and my terrain was restored. Still to this day I think back to that horrible match the end.			"

												This game is great for an independent developer. This game may have a few quirks and goofy movements, but overall it is excellent. A fun multiplayer with very accurate weapons and uniforms as well as maps. The game still updating an dadding new squads and hopefully more features soon. As i said, some glitches need to be solved but its nothing too big. The #1 complaint that i, and many other player shave, is sniper scopes. A few updates changed it and made them a bit useless and hard to use. Overall this game is great and i highly recommend it. With great graphics, sounds, maps, historically accurate, and instead of witty loading hints it gives you facts about WWI, which i personally thought was cool.Just to be a historian Nazi, the game says ""Verdun 1914-1918"". NONE of this game can take place in 1914 as gas masks were not used in WWI until 1916. Gas was used in 1914 and the onyl way the troops survived was by breathing in rags which were soaked in urine.

												Verdun is a pretty unique shooter and very well made, but the trailers and screenshots are horribly misleading. You won't be running and gunning, players aren't going to charge forward...it's mostly just lying down or crouching in a hole, slowly moving up and then slowly retreating. It's extremely slow paced and yet there's no tension unlike similar ""realistic"" shooters like Insurgency. There are no ""clutch"" moments, or brief surges of action.The maps are pretty dull to look at as they're mostly just holes in the dirt surrounded by barbed wire and wooden fences...realistic, but pretty boring to play. Sound design is good. Gunplay is okay but hit detection seems a bit off at times. The game seems to be optimised well for lower-end systems, as even my aging laptop could run it smoothly with no issues.I can see the appeal and if you're interested World War 1 or slow-paced shooters, I can recommend Verdun. It's unlike anything else on the market and I'm sure there are people out there who love it. I'm just not one of them!			"

A fresh setting, exciting gameplay, and interesting mechanics will keep you coming back for another day in the trenches. There is a learning curve to this game, and it is a little unforgiving at times, but it is easy enough to catch on in a short time.Most impressingly, it manages to take an experience like WW1, with its trench warfare, and make it not only playable, but quite enjoyable. There are enough maps, guns, and levelling mechanics to keep things fresh. Definitely worth the price of admission.The community is quite active, and the development team frequently updates the game, and give news updates.			"

												This game is not like other first person shooters. This is Verdun.I bought this game during the summer sales just because i liked the idea of a WW1 first person shooter, and oh boy have i fallen in love with Verdun. Its all about getting killed during the first couple of hours playing, no matter if you stay in the trenches, crawl through the no-man's-land or attack straight away. These first hours may demotivate new players due to the steep learning curve, but i advise to keep trying and dieing, as the payoff will be great. Everyone should just play this game to experience the horrors of WW1, nothing can describe the feeling of jumping in an enemy trench amidst a gas cloud, sight greatly reduced by your gas mask, and not sure whether you will get stabbed, shot, blown up or if you yourself might stumble upon some unawara Frenchies.Pros:- One shot kills. Don't miss or you're dead.- Graphics- Historical accuracy- Teamplay- Community- New content on regular basis- ...Cons:- Difficulty at start- 16 vs 16 maps, would prefer 32vs32 or 64vs64			"

												Verdun is a fantastic world war 1 FPS. It's incredibly immersive and the trench combat is difficult but very rewarding.  Imagine running through no man's land with artillery shells going off all around you, you make a dash for the enemy trench and jump in. You look around you and get your bearings, while you hear frantic shouting in multiple languages and accents. Are those footsteps around the corner? It's hard to tell with the deafening explosions, you get up and walk slowly towards the corner, arm outstretched with a webley revolver tightly gripped in your hand. You see a shadow and then quickly a man, you fire wildly and a stray shot hits him in the neck and he slumps down. You issue an order for your squad to advance to your position. You stand up and very carefully try to peek over the side of the winding trench to spot the enemies hidden further up. You hear a noise like a fly buzzing past your ear, then one that sounds like a pebble hitting concrete. You slump down, dead. This is the great war. This is Verdun.			"

												I held my hands over my head as artillery shells exploded around my trench. Dazed, I staggered forward, one goal in mind. ""Defend the trench!"" my mantra repeated, beating a tattoo into my consciousness. I reached my pillbox. Crouching, I blew my whistle. My men soon came to the pillbox, posting up around me. Shots rang from my gunner as he killed another enemy. ""All clear!"" I slowly raised myself until I could see out of the makeshift window. I saw movement in some of the underbrush. I called in a mortar shot on that position. Crouching again, I waited, each passing second an eternity. ...........A small hiss rose into earshot. I wondered what it meant as my gunner shouted ""Grenade!"" The word was not even out of his mouth as a bright flash errupted just outside of the pillbox entrance. I was knocked senseless. Two things crossed my mind as I faded into darkness; my family, and how I would never see them again, and my joy as I heard my mortar shell strike home. The screams of my enemies became a lullaby as I drifted into oblivion.10/10This fps shooter is unlike any I have ever played. Set in WWI era, the bolt action rifle is king. Trenches are your castles, your lives, your tombs. You leave a trench, you die. You stand up, you die. You run zig-zag patterns towards the enemy trench, you die. Somewhere along the way, you start to put everything together. Killing gets easier. You develop a sense of danger, you learn to spot patterns. You discover how close of an ally patience is. Patience leads you to survival, and ultimately, your victory. Pros:-Realistic ballistics-Good balancing-Great bonuses for team playersCons:-No story mode (not complaining about this, just a head's up for players who are looking for some sort of story/campaign.Give it a go. It's definitely worth it.			"

												If you have a thing for realism in your shooters, grittiness, squad based tactics, and enjoy a challenge, you'll enjoy Verdun.Once you get the feel for this game, it's intensity will have you hooked! I don't know if it's because you typically die in one shot, or if it's because you really have to play your class correctly for your squad to be successful, or if it's because of the setting and environment of this game within the terrible battle grounds of WWI, but this game has had me on the edge of my chair, not being able to look away for a second.I like playing as the NCO the most. Calling in mortar strikes, arty support, recon plans and gas attacks (depending on which country you're playing as). As well as supporting your men, giving orders moving up through no mans land, and staying alive for them to re-spawn on you.One of my favorite shooters right now[edit]:  The developers recently added American, Belgian and new German squads, a new map, gore, a new Co-op game mode, animations upgrade and over 40 new weapons.

												This game is crazy realistic to the death gurgles and guns. It is a 16 v 16 game on trench warfare maps. The maps have wide viriety to night maps, small and skinny, wide open, or lots of cover. You play in squads of 4 all playing there own roll with many guns and weapons including flamerthrowers, gas clouds, and pistols. It is very graphic like when you get hit by a motar right on you and explode into many body parts of your leg being blown off! You hear the soldiers crying of pain and gurgilng. Its crazy!			"

												First of all, I want to say, that I bought this game during the early access alpha.After I stopped playing it back then because of problems like the horrible performance, my rank getting reset (after reaching level 60) and some the changes to the deathmatch, this week was the first time I tried it out again and I have to say that it has become a fantastic game!The Frontlines mode is by far the most realistic experience I have had in a long time. In some aspects it is just like Red Orchestra 2 during WW1.Nearly all guns are one hit kill and there are dynamic waves of attacks you have to carry out or fight off.If you do not play as a team, you will die and die and die some more times...If you do play as a team, you will have to use gas, mortars etc. to advance and capture the enemy trenches.After all i can say that this game has come a long way and will continue to do so! It is one of the most realistic FPS already, but I can see it becoming even better, since the developers have prooved their abilities in the past development already!If you are looking for a realistic, brutal, historical WW1 FPS, this is your game! 10/10 would by again, even for more money!

								I started playing this about a year ago in June or so and was very impressed with how it played and how intense it was even through the bugs and funny animation. One of my favorite updates was the improved Rag-doll effect and since I usually play as Landsers NCO it is fun to watch the little French men fly up in the air after an Artillery Strike. The game kept improving a lot with the sound effects, animation and general design and feel getting better. I liked how nice and small the community was when I started and I felt a bond with other players who I've met. Now with a much larger and growing community, the game is truly starting to feel like a WWI game with massive numbers coming towards you.This game relies heavily on cooperation and pulling off strategic attacks. It really becomes better as time grows on and I like how the Squad Progression works out as it makes you want to play with friends more often and to be your best.My tip in playing NCO is to get near the enemy trench (if you're offence) and try your best to survive, find a nice hiding place inside the trench if possible, this will allow your teammates to spawn near you and make it easier to clear the trench.I'm probably the only or the few in game named ""Erwin Rommel"" if you want to find me to ask for tips or to just play together. I'm usually the NCO in any German Squad.*Edit: I should also add, I am not sure if it's the game's animation or just my internet that usually shows the enemy aiming at completely different area when he's actually aiming at you.

												This game was prbably one of my most worth purchases on Steam, and I have enjoyed all the 26h I have in this game. Well, most of it. After some recent updates it's been hard to play the game, since i's acquired some kind of problem to recognize my clicks (luckily it doesn't happen when shooting). Lags are becoming a respectable problem in this game also (and not only because of ping), and the amount of people playing it is dropping. Those things I mentioned really make me sad, becasue THIS GAME IS f**KING AWESOME!!!!! Verdun manages to recreate the Trench War style without making it boring, and in a way it's hard to get mad when you die (and you WILL die, and A LOT of times). And trust me, I rage a lot in games. Even though I haven't played much the alternative game modes, they can be really fun (or could, if there were more people playing the game)I'd rate this game an 85 out of 100, because it perfectly brings the player what is promises, and for all I've said above, but the lack of players and those minor problems in the menu and sometimes in the game really bother me.For the developers: Please fix this problem I am having in the menu, it really bothers me to have to click several times in a button for it to work			"

												I am not a FPS guy by any measure. However, Verdun has to be the most engrossing and entertaining FPS game I have ever played. It is quick, fun, brutal and to be honest the community are good too. Verdun. Well you have to work as a team, doing so has huge benefits, each team member fills a specialisation which has both strengths and weaknesses. Even after all the hours I have played I still want to play more. The designer has made significant improvements to the game and expanded it cleverly. The new nations and units types are very good and make the game even more playable. The new maps are great with no map being exactly the same and requiring different loads outs for they type of combat distinct to that map.    It is worth every cent you pay. So if your up for bolt action rifle shoot outs at anything from 300m to 1m and bayonet fights then try this its awesome. Remember its not when you die in Verdun its all about how many times. Keep your head down.			"

Then, a few minutes later, I saw that my team was falling back. I turned around and ran towards them. The guy next to me was killed immediately after I started running, and following that the guy in front of me. I kept running while thinking ""Why is it me that made it? Why did I have to live when all those other guys died?""Then it came to me. A bullet. A bullet hit me. And I was there with everyone else.And then in heaven the Lord gave me a Steam gift card and I played this.			"

												A great objective based FPS. If you're obsessed with your KD ratio, it's probably not the game for you,  you'll be screamed at. Focus on the objectives do your job and everything will be fine. When you find a good team to play with, it really shines, each ""class"" has a unique role that it has to fill otherwise everything becomes way harder for the rest of the squad. WW1 weaponry allows for a different gameplay, compared to all the other machine gun focused modern/WW2 FPS there are.There is a progression system, however it's not central to the game experience, it rewards different play styles and doesn't impose itself on the main game.I'm having a lot of fun, the only downsize is when your team sucks or Yells at each other, but that's something all multiplayer games have in common.

												A fun game made by dedicated devs. I've been playing Verdun on and off since it was a browser game and, while I don't have as many hours as others, I've watched it change over the years as good as anyone else who's been there since the beginning. I put money down for Verdun when I was skeptical that it would even evolve and complained about it at the time, but now I'm glad to say that it was worth it. "

												Verdun pisses me off. I die constantly, rarely kill anyone, and frequently curse the lack of an aiming reticle, regeneration of health, or any of a number of modern shooter conveniences we take for granted.That's also why I love Verdun.Modelled after WWI-era trench fighting, the devs tried to capture the authenticity of the period - tactics, the way weapons handled, etc - as closely as possible, and it's a niche you didn't know needed filling until you play it. This is really an amazing game, especially if you think you're really good at shooters. It will humble anyone quickly, then rebuild them.Seriously, I don't even like shooters that much, and this game hooked me. That's how good it is. Give it a try, you won't regret it.			"

								Verdun is a first-person WW1 trench 'simulator' in a way. The way the game works, is that there is 2 modes, though the other mode is never really played. The first one is Capture, where you can play as the Central and Entrente Power's infantrymen in an abundance of trenches in which players have two phases. Attack, and Defend. The funnest part of the game, is just running with your fellow soldiers into battle, watching them die side-by-side, as a gas mortar strikes the enemy trench, either dispersing or killing them all. I really suggest you play this game only for Capture, as Free For All is never really played by anyone, other than all the gameplay it does showcase some realism with it's physics engine, and a beautiful graphics update. *Thanks Dev's!*			"

												Verdun is amazing, although it has mediocre graphics and sound - the gameplay is amazing. As what I believe to be the only WWI FPS, Verdun does not need a competitor, unless you want a more arcadey feel, like a Call of Duty title. The gameplay is very interesting, it covers a small sector of a front, with a max of 32 players. Different squads have different weapons and abilities and are able to voice chat with each other. Some can call in gas while others call in recon planes. It is skill based and there are no OP unlocks, just weapons good if used right. A shovel or knife is great at clearing out a trench, while a machine gun can kill an entire wave of retreating enemies. One of my only complaints on the actual quality of the gameplay is how lax the balancing system is. It asks ""can you please switch to Axis/Entente powers to make the game balanced"" If nobody wants to switch it will stay that way the entire game. If it were up to me the squad with the fewest people on the overpowered team should be disbanded and sent to the other team. Another problem is the amount of U.S. squads, there needs to be a limit, because everyone spams the U.S. Marines, even though they're terrible and have nothing good, because they're American. Either remove one or both of the U.S. Squads or put in a system to limit the amount of U.S. squads. The British, French and Belgians won the war, not the U.S.Overall, Verdun is a solid game with great gameplay, but with  squad and team balance issues and the graphics and sound are meh. I'd give it a 7.5/10 Definitely buy this if you enjoy WWI or want something a little new to play.			"

												This game is hard as hell. You need to be crouched or prone at all times or else you'll get shot by a sniper. And if you think you can take more than one bullet, oh no. This aint no CoD or Battlefield; one bullet from a rifle and you're dead. And just to make matters worse, half the time you don't even know what killed you.Despite this, it's really fun. Teamwork is pretty damn important, so you'll want to get some friends. Because of how much you'll die, it's even more rewarding to finally get a kill after getting shot and blown up five times in a row. Every weapon also feels great. Each one feels powerful, heavy, and packs a blow. Really, all this game needs is bots, 64 player support, and a crapton of more maps, and it'll be perfecto.			"

												Ok, I will keep this short. The game overall is great. The frontlines mode forces your team to work together.No, Litterally.If you attack while you are defending some god kills you.A new update is coming, With shotguns, new rifles, and even a flamethrower.There is one issue... In the other modes, People like to be annoying.They tend to snipe with a MP18i or run into a trench hipfiring a lewis. If you cannot aim and hit a moving target in one shot don't get this game.It isn't some call of duty casual game, It forces you to be accurate and stand still.Because in this game if you move an inch somebody like me will spot you from across the map.

												A truly great shooter and about as close to a WWI simulator as you can possibly get without five hundred guys on a server. Grab a few friends, form a squad and then go ham- as an FYI, you can make insanely long squad names. If you ever see the Royal Canadian Trench Club Police Squad Club (one of the classes available to the Canadian squad is literally a club and five grenades, and it is fabulous), then you'll know you've found me. Besides that, it really is an awesome shooter, requiring teamplay and rewarding intelligent play. I highly recommend this game, with my only complaint being that the menu is a little awkward to navigate.			"

No running 5 kilometers without a stop. Getting hit one time is enoughf to get you killed and dye slowly on the grownd, crying and calling your mama, It makes me feel bad for killing sometimes. And sometimes, I do get stressed and get to realize how aweful this might be. You sometimes just get to crawl to the other trenche to avoide enemy fire.			"

Early Access Review
								Ladies and Gentlemen of Steam, I rarely, if ever do this when I write a review. But, I am going to whole heartily recommend this game!I do not know what else to say about this game, aside from, THIS is exactly the way a WWI FPS should work. The thing that carries this game forward is the system they have worked out for the ""Tug of War"" aspect of trench warfare. That alone, the innovative game type, is enough reason to pick this up.For those who haven't played this (And I assume there are some, seeing as how you are reading a review) the game mode works as such. One side starts attacking the other side's trench. Now right now, I know you are reading this like ""No♥♥♥♥♥♥Sherlock"", but stick with me here. One of two things happen at this point, either the attacker takes the trench, or they are repulsed (Stop looking at me like that). If the attacker is repulsed, then the defender gets to turn the tables and attack the previously known as attacker's trench. Now if the original defender LOSES their trench, the game doesn't continue on in a linear fashion, the attacker has to stop and hold that trench against a counter attack. I know it sounds basic, but it's REALLY nice.Other subtle things, from the way you can only cap trenches by actually being IN the trench, to the way that the timer that says when attack time is over works (Attack Time, Registered Trademark 2014) are so cool but so un-intrusive, that you seem to not notice them, which is a shame because WOO, that's what makes this game worth it.Game-play is sort of, generic? I put a question mark there because I don't want ""Generic"" to be seen as bad. I mean, Call of Duty is generic in game play terms, but they are still fun games. (Yeah! Call of Duty is fun! I said it! Back off Le' Fedora Army or whatever the hell you snobby people call yourselves, screw it, I'm not a kid, I'm not hip...but I digress)The game-play here does everything it needs to be done to not make the game un-enjoyable, and that's fine. It's a bit hard to review this too in depth, because things are LITERALLY always being tweaked. New Classes, New Features (Just added Gas), adjustments to the little things behind the scenes (And BIG things such as the recent Ballistics tweak which just totally made the game better), all of these things come out pretty frequently, which is great.Downsides? Well, it's in Beta, so you have all of the Beta downside crap, missing sounds, wonky animations sometimes, and a few moments of general clunkiness, but to be honest with you, I have seen finished games with more problems than this game. Finished games, from people with more money, and a bigger studio at that!So! Here we go for you lazy people again, Pros and Cons!Pros:~Innovative ""Tug of War"" (Officially known as Frontlines) game mode that really makes this feel like a WWI game, not just a WWII FPS with WWI weapons and skins~Honestly, it's all sort of nice to look at~Good support from the developers (You even see them in game from time to time) With frequent updates and fixes.~It's just FUN! Sometimes frustrating, but FUN!Cons~Standard Pre-Release clunkiness shows through from time to time, be it a slow down here, or a glitch there, but these things are usually very quickly addressed in a patch.~Sometimes I feel like the Servers are not big enough, SOMETIMES, but since this isn't a FULL release yet, I won't make too harsh of a judgment on that yet.~NOT ENOUGH MAPS! Holy cow, that's really the only big thing that frustrates me with this game, I love it, I want more of it, I just want more PLACES to make love to the game-play. Summary:A fun take on a rarely touched era for FPS games! AND one of the more amazing efforts from a small studio, period. These guys are working round the clock on this game, and you can certainly see it! If you like FPS games, or Military Shooters, or just like history, YOU NEED THIS, NOW! GET IT! GO!.....SERIOUSLY! You will spend more money on McDonald's and Mountain Dew this week! Get the damned game already!			"

												Without a doubt the best FPS I have played in a long, long time. Verdun is an extremely addictive, yet insanely hard shooter, which you love and hate at the same time - it is a very abusive relationship. Forcing you to play as a team, Verdun blows other shooters away in the 'teamwork' department, which Battlefield loves to promote in our faces the entire time. If you don't work as a foursome in your individual squads you will die. Again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. This is because you die in a single shot. This is why Verdun is much better than recent shooters: realism. Although no game will ever make you feel like you're truely in a war, Verdun goes for realism and nails it with a nailer. Weapons are fantastic, maps are challenging, and the combat is addictive, as each side attempets to attack and defend their line of trenches.Progression is simple yet awarding, higher rank players aren't ridculously over powered compared to new ones, and that sweet taste of winning a round of an FPS never tasted so good. In short: Verdun shows how triple A games how to do an FPS right: an original idea, dedication, and NO bloody micro-transactions or pay-to-win tactics. I take my hat off to these developers.NB: I'm still afraid to stand up straight in real life.			"
