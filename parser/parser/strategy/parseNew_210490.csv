												Buyers be aware, this game may not be accessible, as the company backing it appears to be defunct, and the game was server/login based.  Know what you're getting into and do some research before purchasing!			"

												As many people have stated, this game is unplayable. I am not sure why it is still listed on steam. The devs used an always-on DRM, and they dissolved without removing it. This is the sort of dickbag move that drives people to pirate games with such DRM instead of buying them.			"

												It's a rare day where I don't recommend a game to other players (unless it's an EA title, in which case you need to get to know me better...) but this game actually failed to provide what was the most basic requirements for a genre I personally adore.FRAY, reloaded or otherwise, simply wasn't finished and, I suspect if I ever go back to it, I will find a variety of bugs and pits with it I simply can't forgive.1> Unfinished, in my opinion - certainly not to the standard one would expect outside of the Early Access section.2> squad based tactical  / turn based strategy usually gets me going: this one actually bored me to tears.3> Not actually as free-flowing as it'd have you think.  I wanted to think that they'd got over the nags, but it really hasn't.4>  Not as pretty on second inspection - it looked too grainy, the movement was very forced and the environmentals got in the way of actually seeing character design.5> Intro sound / music... bleeerggghh...6> An engine that chuntered and spat like wet wood on a fire.I could go on, but I just don't want to anymore.  Frankly, this was my first real disappointment on Steam and I will be incredibly cautious around this developer from here on in.AVOID!!!			"

												Somehow I missed that this was multiplayer only, without any sort of PBEM option, and it looks like there's not enough of a player population that any games are available.  Looks interesting enough that I'd want to check it out (and, after all, I already bought the thing) -- want to set up a time to play?			"

												The Fray has an outstanding amount  of bugs, glitches and crashes. This game was definitely not ready for release, and I would not even consider it ready for beta testing, yet here it is on steam. I do not advise buying it, thought I do hope it can recover from it's pre-mature release and bounce back with some enjoyable gameplay.			"

												Fray has an outstanding amount of bugs, glitches and crashes. This game was definitely not ready for release, and I would not even consider it ready for beta testing, yet here it is. It lacks simple UI and social features that one would expect within a modern game of this type (friends list, private matches, matchmaking) and its ""co-op"" listing is entirely PvP. They also require you to use a secondary login system in order to play, and registering at their site tells you the game is still in Alpha and that you should receive a second key soon. Unfortunately this is both true and false. The game IS very much in alpha state but they are not providing second copies of the game. I do not advise buying it, though I do hope it can recover from it's pre-mature release and bounce back with some enjoyable gameplay. Someday. But it has been over a week now and there is little word on how they plan to resolve this.Purchase Frozen Synapse instead.			"

												THe game looked fun, I love those turn based games however I can't load it.  I start and click login and the buttons are off center and the game fails to log me in resulting in a game I can't even play!! What a waste of my money.  If I get it working again I will re-do this review.			"
