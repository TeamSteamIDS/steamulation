												Played this game back when I was just a kid. Loved the atmosphere (I've always been a fan of sci-fi), the lore, soundtrack, and the graphics were (they still are, especially Ground Control 2) amazing. This is a very good game for those who have been missing old school games of the RTS/Tactical genre.			"

												Just... an immortal classic that goes to show that, despite the graphics being dated (though workable), solid tactical gameplay mechanics and decent UI design can keep a game going well beyond it's heyday.If you haven't played this before then it is well worth a try, with controls and gameplay mechanics that still ring true today despite it being made in 2000.One thing you may need to do is hop on Mod DB and get the ""Ground Control 1 Resolution Changer"" so that you can set the game to more modern resolutions. Apart from that, have at it and enjoy, I have not had any compatibility problems so far on Windows 7 64.			"

												Talk about revolutionary, this game was released in 2000 and it was way ahead of its time! While the graphics are dated, this game is still fun and enjoyable to play even 17 years later. It beats many of the more modern genre options in the way it implements combat and accounts for relevant combat variables such as lighting, visibility and terrain elevation. The most mind blowing for me at the time when I first played this game were the air battles - because of other RTS games I was used for the air units to remain immovable in combat, while in this game when in combat the aircraft remains in motion and fly around gloriously. Great game!

												This is a classic game, one of the first full 3D RTS games with innovative feautures for that time - no base or unit building, realistic  view and weapon ranges. Pure tactics without economy.It contains many hours of gameplay - 45 missions await you.If you like it, make sure to play its sequel Ground Control 2 (much nicer graphics, but gameplay is changed a bit to stimulate player to move and control more, well, ground instead of steadily bombarding everything wth artillery from a safe distance). Another excellent futuristic 3D RTS (with additional fun of ) is Battlezone Redux 98 that is also available on Steam. Later 3D strategic games worth playing are Supreme Commander 1 and 2.The recent (and excellent) Deserts of Kharak is also inspired by Ground Control and plays like it.			"

But gameplay, gameplay is still very good and I am enjoying this game again a much. Even controlls are still accetable for such a old game. Highly recommended.

												Ground Control is one of those games that i highly remember after all this time. Played it ~10-11 years ago (got it FREE from FilePlanet, who can remember that?), and even now, after countless computer upgrades, it has not lost it's shine (entirely), nor looks bad as other ""old"" games (and it runs fine on W10 without doing anything to boot).I have yet to see more RTS's with this style, where the units you have at the beginning are all you will ever get. The only game i can recall at the top of my head is Soldiers: Heroes of WWII (which is also one of my favorites). This makes the squad configuration critical for success and not just a race of who can mine resources faster to spam units.If you love RTS's, i cannot recommend this strongly enough. After StarCraft, AoE, RoN, CoH and others, i can still get back to this game and not feel disappointed at all.			"

												I played this title as a teenager way back in 2000. It was one of the first RTS games I had played that ditched resource management and focused solely on squad tactics. The game succeeded wildly in hooking me into the story, through its excellent voice acting and deep gameplay mechanics. The visuals still impress me even today, 15 years later!Fun Fact: Jennifer Hale is the voice talent behind the game's protagonist, Sarah Parker. Her work alone makes the game a delight to play.I include Ground Control with the likes of Homeworld as members of a gold standard for unique, top-tier RTS games. If you want a fun sci-fi story coupled with deep strategy, you'll want to pick this one up.			"

												I was ten years old when this game came out. The gaming magazine that I loved was distributing a demo of the Ground Control and I was so impressed with everything I saved my allowances just to buy this game. The Science Fiction theme, memorable Soundtrack, the reactions of your units; it's all just in such a perfect place that they've found the brilliant balance of making an amazing game. - All you get is what you prepare before the mission; these type of games are not popular these days, it's shameful really.Ground Control is probaby one of the best video games ever made and it was so damn ahead of its time that you get a gem like this once a decade or two.Buy this game immediately.

												I grew up playing this a lot. Hands down my favorite RTS of all time. But its 2015 and this could use a remaster to fix a few annoyances. Its needs wide screen, window mode support, and better cursor acceleration options. Homeworld received a remaster, so I hope for the best here. On wide screen if the resolution is streched, you may run into the issue with the cursor whipping across the screen horizontally and it might sometimes move at a crawl vertically. If you have third party mouse drivers that control DPI, you might want to disable them here and tweak the game's mouse sensitivity to your comfort. The awkward acceleration on modern hardware does make it tricky to micro your squards to move them out of focus fire and/or friendly fire in the heat of combat.			"

												I will put my nostalgia aside and say after so many years this game holds up. 2 Long and engaging campaigns, awesome gameplay, kick♥♥♥♥♥music, and an all out fun experience. It does have some bugs though (as you would expect from an old game) but nothing too serious. Buy the whole pack as it is cheap and well worth every penny.  I honestly don't know about multipalyer since I don't care about online play.Update:If you want to use the extra missions cheat codes you must enter them in the Dark Conspiracy game not the vanilla.

												This brings back memories. Finally Ground Control on Steam and working on windows 7! Two tiny issues I'm having. With 2 displays (both same resolution 1 on HDMI and 1 on VGA) it picks the secondary display to show the game instead of the primary. And no possibility to invert the camera control on the scroll button.But these are tiny issues which won't spoil the fun, works like a charm just like the old days.			"

												Alrighty. An RTS classic. Ground Control does not feature any base building.Pros: - Interesting gameplay (at the time)- Friendly Fire system- Several difficulty levels- Long, narrated story (45 missions in total)- Plethora of units- 2/3 factionsCons:- As I said the gameplay is no longer up to snuff.- Atrocious path finding. Units will get stuck frequently or get ""lost"".- Very slow moving units.- Story gets bland with the introduction of the addon.- Factions aren't unique enough. Basically they all got the same units, minus some special skills, stats and a few unique units.- Obviously very dated graphics.- No save system, no check points...Summary:GC and its addon are definitely not geared towards the casual player. You basically get a handful of units for every mission, which are not replenishable, meaning, when a squad gets completely wiped out it's gone for good, which does not only suck for the mission, but for the overall campaign, since your units ""supposedly"" level up (never really noticed that, but apparently they get more accurate, more durable, etc.). The good thing is that you can restart a mission at any point and get your units back, the bad part is, there is NO save system whatsoever. That 90 minute mission you just failed at the last instance? Yea, you gotta repeat it ALL again. The addon also introduces some fairly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ insta fail missions called ""infiltrations"". In these you have to find your way through the map with only 1 or 2 sniper squads...preferably unseen. If you get spotted the mission is not failed, but the enemy WILL kill your units pretty quickly. Also, ♥♥♥♥ing snipers don't deserve the name. While they kill many units in 1 hit, they aren't all that accurate. I've once spent 5 minuts trying to hit 1 infantry guy...The game also moves at a glacial pace. You might be looking at your units crossing a desert for several minutes until they arrive at the next nav point. Even worse is that you can't just order them there, because the path finding will ♥♥♥♥ it up, so you basically creep forward inch by inch...and wait for your slowest units to still catch up...only to have them encounter an ambush, a mine field or spawned event enemies, which you are unprepared for against. Guess what, you might just have to repeat it all over again. The addon introduces some ""interesting"" mission concepts. However, they don't really work that well with the responsiveness of the game. While your units move fairly slowly (at least the more powerful ones), they can die pretty quickly in combat, especially if they are shooting each other.Say hello to the friendly fire system...just don't. Theoretically you should be able to arrange your units to not suffer friendly fire. Practically I found that to be an insane amount of micro management and frustration, changing formations, ordering troops out of the way...having them walk around confused in circles thanks to the path finding...and have fun ordering a heavy tank into another position.This is a game for die hard fans of squad based RTS games...not sure it's for anyone else. At the end I chose to cheat my way through it, because the glacial pace of the gameplay coupled with the lack of a save feature was just too much to handle for me. I just wanted it to be over. Got through the Crayven campaign without cheating at least.Still a good game for its age...if you're looking for this kind of gameplay.			"

			You can pick up the game here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/254820 Massive Thanks to Rebellion for the Review Copy!		

One of my favourite RTS games of all time, now released on Steam complete with all its awesome DLC. Ground Control Anthology offers a thrilling RTS experience beloved by fans and critics alike. With a trendsetting mixture of 3D action and strategic combat, it’s still just as epic as it ever was. The year is 2419 and mankind is on the brink. War has devastated Earth, and mega-corporations take to the stars to fight over colonised planets. Your employer, the Crayven Corporation, chose you to command an army of ground and air forces on the distant world of Krig-7-B. You thought it would be just another brush-fire war in a longstanding dispute. You were wrong. - Highly Recommended!			"

												Worth every penny.The game is not like any normal RTS. This game focus seriously on the tactical side of the RTS. You don't base build, you select and equip your drop ship for the up coming battle, while the game has soft and hard counters in play, it doesn't feel like its a rock paper scissor game as you need to take care in the using the terrain to the advantage. Also be aware that friendly fire is a thing in this game. Would love an remake....			"

												I remeber when I first heard about this game. I played the demo on a PC Gamer demo disc. The 3 missions that were on the disc hooked me into buying the game. Of all the games I have ever bought, Ground Control, Homeworld, and Red Alert 2 were underpriced according to the experience they gave. This game was produced when the RTS genre was in it's prime and Ground Control reflects that era perfectly. Ground Control should have gotten more publicity than it recieved. It plays on the more tactics base that RTS veterans should know rather than spamming hundreds of units to win. This game, hands down, has the most valuable units of any RTS due to the fact every unit plays a role and they can not be replaced once lost. This game will hammer the importance of tactics, unit placement, and formations into you. If you want a challenging RTS, (coping with the stupid AI is a task of it's own) this game will deliver. You better be on your A game with the higher difficulties where it incorporates friendly fire.The soundtrack is outstanding and complements the story and gameplay very well.This is probably the most immursive RTS you will ever play. As much as I hate IGN, they were right on the money with this one. The graphics are dated, but the game retains its more defining features that separated it from the rest. I did an entire playthrough of the core game recorded and uploaded to Youtube.

												Good old Ground Control, thanks to Steam I was able to play one of my most favourite RTS Games again. I played this Game alot when I was way younger and didn't have any acces to the Internet. Got it from a Magazine that bundled multiple Games on one CD. The games pretty old now, outdated graphics, but alas a classic and I'd recommend it to anyone who like's RTS games. Since it's the Anthology Version, I got to play Dark Conspiracy aswell, since that wasn't part of the Game I played way back. I was looking forward to the campaign. The Cutscene's are definetly better made then in the original campaign. After finishing the campaign. It felt like some missions, of Dark Conspiracy, were more like a chore than a challenge, some of them just seemed drawn out and I don't know if it's just me but I think there were way more enemies per mission than in the original campaign. It felt a bit like, Quantity over Quality. In the original campaign some enemies were well placed and could catch you off guard. In Dark Conspiracy it just seemed like they were all piled up on one point in some missions.They were still fun, but I enjoyed the original missions much more. The new faction they introduced didn't really impress me that much, 1 or 2 units were pretty cool like The Swarm Aerodyne, but that's pretty much it. I'd still recommend the base game and if you really enjoyed the Gameplay and want more. Go ahead and try out Dark Conspiracy. Or try playing the Multiplayer, there's not alot of people, but a dedicated group of players who play on GameRanger. I've only ever played the Multiplayer in the 2nd one, but it was alot of fun.tl;dr Definetly give it a try if you like RTS Games "

												""Command APC under fire by friendly units""...All you Ground Control vets could not sleep one night without hearing the same friendly fire warning over and over again, yet, we never lost one unit due to friendly fire! Correct, Ground Control is back you chaps and chapettes, and it works flawlessly on Windows 10 I might add. For you fresh potential volunteer commanders for the Crayven Corporation, rest assure, you will meet battle where advanced battle tactics need to be used! You do not construct bases, but you manage Dropships in terms of what units you will use, and as you progress, the more units become available, but fact of the matter is, you choose what you want. Do you want to use Jaeger Special Forces recon troops to scout the area undetected to then sneak your artillery nearby to blow everything to kingdom come? Or do you prefer to rush into an enemy heavily defended base with scout vehicles to quickly take out the anti-air defenses, so that you can pull out in time and have your aerodynes fly into the base and bomb it all to ashes without any air defenses. Or perhaps, do you want to roll into the bases with a mix of heavy guns and marines? YOU DECIDE ! This is Gound Control !This package contains the main campaign plus the expansion pack (known as DLC today). The main campaign takes you in command of the Crayven Corporation (Crays) and the Order of the dawn (Dawnies). Playing the game on normal difficulty will take you approx. 10 hours for the Crayven Corporation Campaign, and another 8 for the Dawnie campaign. 18-20 hours of missions !! And this without the expansion pack, because with the expansion pack, add another 15 hours, so you are looking at a solid 32-35 hours of Campaign missions on the normal difficulty setting, for this low price! And keep in mind, this is one of the most amazing RTS games ever made, and there is a Ground Control 2 as well !!! (sold separately).With the Crayven campaign you mostly assume traditional missions of base destructions, but once you play for the Dawnies, expect more fast paced guerrilla warfare and hit and run tactics, because you are fighting outnumbered most of the times with inferior equipment because hey, the Crays did kick your♥♥♥♥♥just shortly before so don't expect it to be easy! Despite the somewhat outdated graphics the explosions and gun fire etc effects as still beautiful. There are some guys that still play multiplayer, but google it as you will find all the info there (some dedicated servers are still up with plenty of players). Pros:- Fun and amazing missions!- Great visuals despite aged graphics- Great sound and amazing battle soundtracks- Awesome Units with micromanaging secondary and tertiary abilities during combat- Dropship unit loadout customization- Plenty of hours of gameplay- Low price- Classic RTS game (top 5 next to Old westwood studios C&C games, Homeworld, etc), a must have!- Entertaining briefing/debriefing and lore (story)- 40+ missions!!!- Works flawlessly on Windows 10- Units have weakspots (rear takes more damage on tanks, etc).- Many fun units to choose from and play- Battle formations to choose from- Can use terrain and shadows etc as a tactical advantage!!!- Great tutorialCons:- Cannot save during game. Play it on LIGHT or EASY for the first time since normal is like a game on Hard today.- No skirmish mode (Single player campaign only and for Multiplayer, find info out of game first how to join!)- Micromanaging units during intense combat can be frustrating at times due to game mechanics. Units need a lot of room to pass each other, they easily get stuck with each other showing their rear to the enemy and taking much more damage. Big chance to lose your command APC that way =Mission failure.- Constant friendly fire messages ""Squad 1 taking friendly fire"" etc, etc, however, friendly fire is mitigated significantly, you only take tiny damage but still very annoying to hear those messages all the time. Terrain often does not give enough room to prevent friendly fire, thus those warnings and friendly fire cannot be avoided.If you are an old school or newbro RTS fan, you MUST get this game at all costs, and after you beat this game and its Dark Conspiracy expansion pack (included in bundle), you must play Ground Control 2.DISMISSED !

												Not as good as nostalgia made me remember it.In my memories, Ground Control was essentially sci-fi Myth, but it turns out I was remembering wrong. Myth had its share of issues, but it didn't have the mess of slow unit responses, terrible unit AI(I can't count the number of times that half my troops' fire, or their special attacks, were wasted because the front lines hit the back lines, or blasted away into terrain rather than moving an inch right or left) and incredibly unclear fields of view(you'll only know how far your units can actually see when something suddenly pops into view. A visible field of view or obscuring fog of war would have done wonders).The writing's decent, though for some reason it feels like they switched VA's for established characters between GC1 and Dark Conspiracy. But ultimately the game is 95% gameplay, and 5% story, so even good writing can't really bouy poor gameplay.Also kinda buggy, with missions that sometimes arbitrarily seeming not to finish/progress, forcing you to replay them, and with Dark Conspiracy forgetting my campaign progress when I exit. Not too great.The soundtrack is excellent, though. Very good at setting a mood.			"
