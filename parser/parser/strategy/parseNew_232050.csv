												This is so close to being an amazing game that it causes me physical pain. It's that close, but there are a few crippling flaws that just ruin it. First, there's the combat. There are different ranks of creatures, one through four, one being weakest and four being most powerful. The problem with this is, after a certain point, anything below rank three will die in the first turn of battle because the enemy AI consists entirely of 'KILL WEAKEST CHARACTER'. The combat maps are tiny so forget any sort of strategy, mid and end game opponents can hit you anywhere you stand. Oh, and those opponents are almost always all one to nine monsters, plus nine to twelve wizards. There are three wizard types, and you will see up to a dozen in every single combat.There are dragons in the game, and you can find them as random encounters. That isn't a problem. A single low level dragon can be beaten, but it's fairly tough unless you come loaded for end game critter hunting with high end, high level units. It's cool. You get an achievement. What isn't cool is that the dragons can spawn in groups of up to six, and all of them in the level 15 range. There might be worse groups out there, but this is literally what invaded one of my provinces in my current game. This isn't something you can fight. I also mean that Literally. You can not defeat these multiple dragon encounters. It isn't possible. You can build an arena in your home province and send heroes to battle in it to gain experience. Why am I mentioning this? because as soon as a hero reaches level ten, the enemy heroes you battle in the arena can also spawn with dragons as minions. It goes about as well as you'd expect.On the plus side, your units can level up and improve their abilities, but it really doesn't matter, because a lvl 30 tier one unit will still be instagibbed by a lvl 1 tier four. And the upgrade system is utterly worthless as well. Why yes random number generator, I did want to improve my crossbowmans hand to hand skills for the fourth time in a row. No, he doesn't need better ranged attacks, he needs to be able to swing that butterknife he has like a man!There are hundreds of items you can find, which is nice, but there's almost no storage space for them. You get a tiny little vault that can't be upgraded. It wouldn't be so bad but on the same screen you have access to the merchant window to sell stuff, and hey, if you guessed that had a scroll bar and infinite space in it, go get a cookie or something. You can build an artifact shop so you can buy artifacts, but unfortunately it doesn't cycle through different ones. You get the opportunity to buy three randomly chosen ones and it never changes for the rest of the game. Those three items are pretty much going to be terrible and I really want to chalk it up to being a bug that it doesn't refresh every so often, but it's been like that since release so probably it isn't.There are four types of hero you can recruit, but you shouldn't bother getting anything but a warrior. The warrior is so much better than the other three it defies belief. Scouts can be useful for the rare encounters designed exclusively to kill warriors, but that's about it. Oh, and yeah, there are encounters designed from the ground up to murder warriors. packs of medusa will petrify you and then poison you, giant spiders will web you down and poison you, giant slugs will poison you if you hit them or vomit poison on you from a distance if you don't.Edit: Okay, so I finally managed to grind a mage high enough to use a specific spell named 'white magic', and basically, it lets you break the game over your knee like a rotten twig. Two casts will clear virtually any combat encounter of critters, barring the two (the latest update may have added more) creatures who are magic immune. Once you get one cast per combat, better beleive that mage is going straight to lvl 30 since he can now effectively obliterate entire armies. Unconquerable foes turn instantly into big, meaty sacks of free XP. Just load up every unit slot with lvl 1 swordsmen, the enemy creatures/mages/whatever will go and kill them while your mage, free and unharmed, fires magic nukes that hit EVERYTHING ON THE MAP FOR MASSIVE DAMAGE. This is a well balanced, well implimented ability that reduces multiplayer combat to 'whoever goes first wins'. Casting it does a small amount of damage to the mage, but a couple of healers can fix it easily before any monsters that made it to turn two kill them for being a weaker, easier target than the wizard FIRING MAGICAL NUKES AT THEM.Oh, and I hope you like really, really really loud TING! sounds, because the game plays one over and over at random for no reason I can discern.Edit: I also hope you don't like loading saved games, because doing that while the game is running will cause the entire thing to crash. Not always, but often enough that I had to mention it.Shouted at by a dev and I didn't even get an acheivement for it.			"

												Ok I always look for negative reviews first. My opinion is that someone who hates the game will over exagerate the flaws, but at least will talk about the flaws where someone who loves it is less likely to. That being said, I still love this game even though it has flaws. However, some people won't like it as I do so I will begin with the negatives then move on to the positives since that's how I approach it anyway.Negatives: Crashes too much. I'd say once every few hours of play time you will have the game crash. It's not enough to bother me, but it can be frustrating.AI can be off pretty bad. Battles that will tell you are impossible sometimes can be beaten manually without losing a single hit point. Battles that say they are so weak they are not worth your time will sometimes wipe you on auto. That doesn't happen all of the time, and with some play time you can easilly judge for yourself. Also computer players will keep throwing themselves at your defenses every time they resurect even if they die every single time in some situations.Bugs. There are a few, one that for some reason will pop up the AI's hero screen in front of me which has shown me they get a +10 gold per turn bonus per hero at the level I was playing at.PositivesIt is constantly changing. Every time you start a new character or see a new world, the game will be different, different maps, different quests available. It kind of reminds me of Civ in that aspect.You can chose how you play. Some games require you to be the hero, some games require you to be the villian, this game requires you to be whatever you feel like being.It is a great strategy game IMO. Losing a single soldier at the wrong time can cost you an entire map, granted like most strat games you can always load fail (load the game and redo a fight because you lost), but not all of us play like that.So with all of that I'd say the game play and replayability are worth it. The bugs and glitches and even AI issues can be fixed (or modders can fix them if it ever opens to mod on steam). Overall I'd say the positives outweigh the negatives enough for me.			"

												This is an oddball of a game, on one hand the campaign can be incredibly tedious and repetitive (just got your castle and hero leveled to where you can kick♥♥♥♥♥ Oh well, time to start the next map from scratch!). But on the other hand, it's the difficulty of fighting you're way up from the bottom that really makes this game shine.I'm hesitant to recommend this game on word alone, find some videos first and see if you would enjoy the Civ/Might and Magic/Kings Bounty mashup. The game is pretty fun, but after a while, I'm finding I have to take it in small doses as repeating the same actions to win a slightly different map gets very boring (even with maps/shards that have different properties to them, they don't seem to be enough to warrant varying from a proven tactic).

												It's hard to play a game over 100 hours and then not recommend it.  And yet, I can't.  I wan't to - but I can't.You've heard the saying that 'the sum is greater than the parts'; in this game, the parts are greater than the sum.  There is such a good game here waiting to 'happen'.  Unfortunately, the overall game design is flawed.Specifically, the size of the 'shards' and the mechanics of the shards hurt the overall game.  Because of this, you won't even use most of the best units/buildings/etc.  In essence, you've got all this outstanding content that never comes into play bacause of the mechanics of the 'meta-game'.

												-Bought this when feeling nostalgic about Master of Magic / HoMM.  I also like CiV and slower, turn-based games sometimes.-More complex building options than HoMM and in some aspects MoM..  More specifically the City Build menu can be overwhelming to look at for the first time.  I particularly enjoyed this aspect of the game - its complexity left me wanting more and more so I would restart a game after losing to tweak the build and see what works best.-The heroes can be viewed as simple/straightforward - 4 classes.  Each time you level you put one point into one skill (out of three offerred).-Spells are just similar to Heroes of Might & Magic. Build the 4th tower to get the best spells.. except there is a different building for each magic type - there are 6 magic types (I think?) at least as far as buildings / main spells go.-More complex gameplay & darker theme than Heroes of Might & Magic-Can't wait to play multiplayer!

												It took me 248 hours to end the campaign - and I chose the quickest way to finish.If you like to finish your games - beware of the necessary time investment!The game runs very unstable (release 1.4.5) - during my playthrough I had over 100 crashes to the desktop (seems evenly distributed between ""Invalid Pointer Operation"" and ""Access violation...""). The game might run smoothly for 5 hours or crash 5 times in 30 minutes.			"

												This game is really hard to rate. I recommend it because the core game is absolutely great and I love such games in general. I also don't want to harm the devs because they really tried hard and have created a real rough diamond but some mayor design issues will spoil the fun for probably most of the common players!So I only recommend it to die hard 4x fans with masochistic tendencies and/or you might want to grab it on sale :)My review became a mini guide so here is the overview and I will post more details in the comments.Good:- Very deep 4X game mechanics (with a focus on battles)- Great turn based battle system (focus on tactics and not luck)- Good RPG elements regarding the hero/unit development- Many different units to hire and fight (most or all of the enemy units can also be hired if you are lucky to get an offer)- Polished graphics and menus- Nice humor (you can either play a good or evil “god” and the evil options are really funny to read)Mixed:- Not many armies to control or cities to build up so micro management doesn’t get out of hand- Hard to learn even harder to master- Endless playtime (if you can stand it - might be good for players who rather want to play in doses instead of one huge map/battle)Bad:- Tedious game mechanics- Monotonous game play (most of the time you spend doing the same over and over again until you finally see/find/unlock something new)- Easy to get stuck in “dead ends” (as long as you haven’t learned how to avoid them or have the patience to wait (for lucky random events or gaining gold/experience over time) or reload/restart)- Still some bugs (Happened once that an enemy unit was not removed from battlefield and I had to reload the fight)So what to expect from the game?I expected another Fallen Enchantress/Warlock - MotA clone but this game plays quite different. There are the same features in place but they are used in a different manner. Think of starting one of the mentioned games. Build/take over your first cities on an isolated island and form your armies, then, when you are ready to conquer the next island: you have to start over.This is basically happening in Eador. You conquer a ""shard"" where you face 1-2 enemies (at the first shards) and as soon as you conquered it you lose (mostly) everything you had earned the last hours. The shards do work on a greater scale though. They unlock new buildings/units and give some mild benefits to the starting condition of the next shard. I also can only speak for the first shards because even though I played 16 hours I'm still on my second shard! (+ the good tutorial that took me 3 hours alone) According to the forums there are 80!! shards to conquer - go figure the playtime you need to beat the game. Though I have to say I always fought my battles and didn’t auto resolve them because I’m a control freak and don’t trust the AI so you can decrease playtime a lot by automated battles.I also don't want to complain about a long playtime but the simple problem here is: motivation. I think it would have been much better to only have like 20 shards but instead increase the rewards you get for conquering each shard and thus give a better feeling of actual progress.Which leads to the real problem here, because having an extrapolated playtime of 400 hours and making only small steps on your way from shard to shard don't has to be bad in general, but the real issue is: The start of each shard is tedious and often frustrating.You start with you major city, the only one you can really build up (and if you lose it to an enemy it's game over). Even conquered enemy cities are just better ""provinces"".So now you can start constructing buildings from different categories that either increase income, mood, get you access to certain military units, spells or items. You also have to hire a hero because there are no armies without heroes! So the heroes are the real stars of the game and they are significantly better than every other units you get (at least in early game). You can choose from 4 different classes: Warrior, Scout, Commander and Wizard.The problem is: The hero alone is not able to win most of the fights even right at the start of the game. You need either supporting units, spells or items to make him capable of conquering the provinces around your city. More units sounds like a good idea but they cost money and upkeep and the AI tends to attack the weak units first so they most likely get killed fast. Also when you buy units you don't have much gold left to build up your city. So what happened to me in the first level was that I started with a warrior (because he was great in the tutorial), build up the city and tried to conquer the provinces around me.When you attack you get a nice text that estimates the outcome of the battle. It also tells you how many units you spotted and which kind of units they are. It is still a little vague because when you spot 8 units of militia and bowmen it makes a great difference if there are 1 or 6 bowmen and you won't know that. So despite the text I at least started every fight and would have lost all of them (tried - failed - reloaded). So my only chance to finally progress in the game would have been to use another (great but overused) feature: Exploring.Every province (or tile) has a level of exploration. You can send your heroes to explore the tile which will give them experience (very important, but very slow), lets them find locations (most of the time fights that are often too hard to win but bring very important loot and gold/ you can also find shops with special items or units to hire) and expands the province for the population (lowers effects of overpopulation).So back to my problem: It would have taken ages until I got strong enough to finally start conquering the provinces so I restarted the shard and chose the scout hero. The reason is that ranged combat is a little overpower and the scout alone can win some battles as long as the enemy doesn’t have too many ranged units himself or too strong and fast melee units. I guess you can also use the wizard for that matter (not tried yet) but if you go for a melee character I suggest to invest in spell granting buildings (especially magic missile) so that he can deal some harm from a distance.So with the scout I was finally able to gain some ground and get the game going. Eventually I was able to hire a second hero (which makes sense because just 1 army to cover ~30 tiles is difficult, especially when the enemy starts attacking).Which leads to 2 more problems:First, when you hire a new hero midgame he is starting at level 1. You might have some items and spells available to give him or perhaps even can give him the supporting units from your experienced hero (but then this hero is significantly weaker) but all the easy fights are already done by your experienced hero so there is no (comfortable) way to level him up and make him actually useful. You can only explore and trial and error random fights.Second: The enemy is really annoying. He often has several heroes (more than you have) and can take every province by just moving on that tile as long as you didn't buy any guards there. The point is that those guards cost money and all they bring is defend the province against a possible hero attack (later on you get access to better units that have more benefits like auto exploring the province or even increasing the income of that province (still less than their upkeep though)). So when you start taking provinces you don’t want to spend your money on hiring guards but rather want to wait until you have an actual frontline. But when you finally have one it usually consists of 4-5 tiles per enemy.I will continue my description in the comments as the text got cut off here in the middle of my explanation! :(			"

												Hello,This is, in my opinion, a triple A title. That having been said, I would also like to point out that many triple A titles are more often then not unpolished and lacking on release, but patched at some point. As others have said, the game plays somewhat like Civilization/Heroes of Might and Magic. The developers don't seem to be in full swing patch-mode anymore either, which is really sad because it needs it.One of the things I enjoyed the most was the exploration aspect of the game. Your heroes explore each province to provide more land for the province's population to settle comfortably. In the process you come across bandits, monsters, and unique shops. Sadly, for each positive aspect of the game, it tends to turn around on itself and bite it's own rear end. In this example , the game all but forces to you play with a ""rush/zerg"" mentality. Getting your hero(es) to the enemies stronghold as fast as possible, because nothing transfers over to the next map, and building up your empire on the shard is more or less wasted time. Couple that with the fact that the longer you play, the more the AI seems to advance in suspect manner (I've more then one grumbled the word ""Cheater"" at the computer screen). The game is very good, I played it for a long time and still visit it when the mood hits. Despite it's shortcomings, I would recommend it if you like HoMM/Civ/Fallen Enchantress/ect.Cheers,Michael			"

												The idea is interesting but the implementation is lacking. Highly random starting positions can vary the difficulty from ""cakewalk"" to ""impossible,"" and strategy games should be decided more by your decisions than by randomness. Hero units drive the game, so if your starting area is  good, you steamroll the map; if not, you may be able to grind through, provided the enemy hero did not get a steamroll start that lets it one-shot your troops and two-shot your hero. ""First OP hero wins"" is not an interesting strategy dynamic.Before each fight, the game evaluates your forces versus your enemies and gives you a difficulty estimate from ""no casualties"" to ""no chance."" Whatever math is being done does not compare the units' strengths and weaknesses. You will regularly find impossible ""easy"" fights and ""run away!"" fights you can win without taking damage. Between this and the highly random elements, you can see why so many places on the forums advocate save scumming.I encountered fewer crash bugs than other reviewers did.			"

												Good idea of combining province approach of Total War and Dominions with turn-based battles a-la Heroes of Might and Magic. All wrapped up in meta-gaming - each new map adds new features. Not totally for me, as it have too much content on each map, taunting my completionism. Still recommend it for 4x-lovers.Remake of Eador: Genesis.Game was heavy broken on launch, but right now it's quite working. Some issues remained, but nothing that could prevent proper gaming.			"

												One of my favorite 4X games. If you like fantasy and 4X this is a must buy.There are a lot of negative reviews talking about bugs and other issues. I just don't seem to notice them. The developer has continued to work on the game and the lastest version seems very very good.You have lots of choices with buildings and your units level up. There is a lot of decision making involved. Play the game using custom settings to enjoy the full experience.This is a hard game that is tough to beat. I sometimes wonder if that is what people are complaining about. I personally rank this ahead of games such as AoW 3 because the battles are so tactical and demanding.This is a great game for those who want a deep demanding immersive fantasy 4X.			"

												Purchased this because I loved Eador: Genesis. I love this game much more than Eador: Genesis. It expands upon that game in so many ways. Graphics, units, situations, encounters, gameplay, AND MUCH MUCH MORE! My playtime invested speaks for itself. 9/10**update 3-16-16**I now have almost 1000 hours in the game. I am very disappointed in all the negative reviews for this game. There has not been a single bug that is 100% gamebreaking for me. All bugs are minor and easily fixed. The game is well worth playing even despite its minor flaws. Don't pass up this hidden gem!

												There is so much here that make this game amazing. I loved the different units and the difficulty of starting off. I loved being able to 100% territories to get more benefits. I loved how there was an overworld with even more shards to take over. As much as I loved this, there was more that I just didn't love. After spending so many hours on one shard, you start with nothing on the next shard. It feels like a slap in the face. It is supposed to feel like starting another scenario, but there is virtually nothing different from this shard than the last one. Why can't I keep some of my♥♥♥♥♥♥? What's the point? If I reread my favorite book over and over, or watch the same episode of my favorite show over and over I will still enjoy it, but how often will I want to do this? It will make you go kookoo for coco puffs. That is exactly what this feels like. There may be more enemies and a slightly different layout, but no real variety. I wanted more from this experience, but I was just left dissapointed. This is fun, but leaves you wanting so much more. This could have been a 10/10 if things were done just a bit differently. 4/10 I wanted to love this, but it just left me wanting a better experience that incorporates all these elements.			"

												Eador -It is a mixture of various games such as Civilizations, King's Bounty, Disciples, Heroes. The hero, as in Disciples is power, pump it, he can compete with the most powerful units. Branched ""pumping"" of heroes and fighters get the experience and the heroes and units, on obtaining a new level they get ability.The game features a variety of system events that enrich the gameplay, help to build a monument, burn the witch, and so on. The game has a good share of humor. By the way, right about the buildings are hundreds of them and all want to build. A huge variety of units, artifacts, everything. And by the way, yes, finally the hero can not just put the two rings, as much as much as 4!PSOne of the downsides of the game in my opinion is the complexity, but with the same and this is a plus. But first it will be very difficult. Raiting 9 from 10!Sorry for my English!____________________________________________________________Это смесь различных игр, таких как Civilizations, King’s Bounty, Disciples, Heroes. Герой, как и в Disciples это сила, прокачав его он может посоревноваться с самыми сильными юнитами. Разветвленная «прокачка» героев и бойцов, опыт получают и герои и юниты, по получению нового уровня новые способности.В игре присутствует система различных событий, которая обогащает игровой процесс, помогите построить памятник, сожгите ведьму и т.д.. В игре присутствует хорошая доля юмора. Кстати, да насчет построек их сотни и все хочется построить. Огромное разнообразие юнитов, артефактов, всего. И кстати да, наконец то герой может одеть не всего два кольца, а аж целых 4!!!П.СОдним из минусов игры на мой взгляд является сложность, но с тем же это и плюс. Но поначалу будет очень трудно.Оценка 9 из 10!			"

												tldr:Fun?  3/5Work?  6/5  The enjoyability of this game is crippled.Deep?  5/5Compelling?  4/5Pace?  Dog slow out of what it could be.  2/5Good intro to TBS?  1/5This game's learning curve is poorly designed and might turn off many beginners to the genre permanently.  A lot of the game is figuring out ""this map is unplayable - I have to re-roll"" or ""this _campaign_ is unplayable - I have to re-roll.""  Occasionally a really fun map does show up.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------My main complaint with this game is the random map generator.  Some maps seem to be fine, but others are practically unplayable.  Or they are barely playable in the openning game only to find out later that you were destined to be steamrolled by the opponent.The game makes no effort to generate ""fair"" maps from what I can tell.My second complaint is that the campaign suffers from the same problem, since it also uses random maps.  That's right - a campaign with randomly generated maps.  Which means a normal distribution of players will see some players able to beat the campaign on the hardest setting, while others won't be able to beat it on even very easy settings.Sound stupid?  Well, whatever you want to call it, it still needs work.  Maybe it's similar to how Civ II would sometimes just be a bad map roll - but it is tedious to spend time learning the player skill ""oh this map is crappy - now I have to start over"".Of course - it's REALLY TRICKY.  The game can offer a feeling of tension, of not knowing ""how far behind am I?"" and ""am I wasting my time on this game?""  So maybe that's the largest enjoyment it has to offer - that feeling ""do I have any hope of winning whatsoever?"" before being plunged mercilessly to your death.  Ha!The weakness seems to be a complete lack of balance between map economy and unit maintenance costs.  Don't believe me?  Try finding screenshots that show armies with high level units.  They are rare.  Which tells me the player base just never finds gameplay involving high levels.  By the time you could afford the big guns, the map has already been used up.  That's my guess anyways.Lastly, progress is excruciatingly slow, both in the campaigns, but also on a single map.  It will take forever to see characters level up, and I think this design is probably intentional, but really misses the boat on making hitting the sweet spot on playability and fun.  After a while it really feels like a grind.  At least the Civ games had a pace slider, and that would help this game a lot.------As long as you clearly understand these shortcomings, I still recommend the game for its unique tactical layout and game mechanics. My first impression of the game has not been overwhelmed by the short-comings I only figured out after playing many many hours. Don't like tactics?  THIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOU THEN.  The core mechanic of the game is the tactical map - sort of these mini-chess games that pop up over and over again.  I get tired of them after a while, and they can become rather complex.  It's not as deep as chess -- nowhere close -- but it's a similar mental workout.I guess the only thing to remember if you decide to buy this game: ""play it looking for the fun that it has to offer.""  It's in there.~~~~~~ Here is my response to someone asking how Eador compares to Warlock ~~~~~~      Warlock is a good beginner 4x. It's relatively lightweight, it has a sense of humor, the       graphics are good. But the content is not huge. I played many many Warlock games       even when it first came out and I'd skip 20 turns because the AI back then was crappy.       But they've improved the AI. In Warlock you'll expand your kingdom until you've moved       far enough in your religious rating that one of the gods gets angry and incarnates to       battle you. Then it's that boss battle and the game is over IIRC. Battles are ALL on the       main map - there is no tactical battle map like in Eador. An average game in Warlock       is maybe 300 turns or less, and they go by fast. Probably less than 2 days for a game.       I'll probably play Warlock again in a couple years or so - but it's not as good as say       Civ5. Warlock does ""just one more turn"" very very well.      In comparison, Eador stands out in that the RPG element is the heaviest I've seen in       any 4x. I have finished a few low difficulty games, which wasn't very satisfying. But       moving into ""competent"" difficulty and it gets frustratingly difficult. Lots of luck is       involved and restarting games is common (and again, frustrating). But there's a sense       that (or I have this sense anyways) that the tactical options are mind-blowing what       can be available at higher levels. If you can figure out how to play...      The economy in Eador is extremely volatile. Nothing comfortable like other 4x where       you build your buildings and everybody is happy. Even Civ5 which is a great play       experience doesn't offer this sort of challenge. So in Eador it's like the house is       continually burning down and you're always just one or 2 steps in front of the fire.       That's the feeling I get playing it.      Whether a beginner should try Eador.... my advice -- don't take the campaign at       all seriously because it uses randomly generated maps meaning you may get       screwed. Learn the basics and (what I should have done, but I doubt it would help       too much) read whatever guides you can find, and watch the youtube videos.      Also, the tactical battles in Eador are very similar to the experience of playing chess.       Some other 4x TRY to do that (hello Fallen Enchantress) but they don't have stamina       or morale and simplistic in comparison.      Eador also stands out from all other 4x in that it has no tech tree. Instead, the tech       tree is implicit in the buildings you build. I can't remember, maybe Heroes of Might       and Magic does this too, but no where near the complexity of Eador.      I think ""should I buy this?"" is really a question of do you want one of the most complex       4x TBS available, with a brutal learning curve, or do you want something easier that       you might not play for as long? If you find it's too difficult and just give up - that's no       good. So if you do buy it, don't hesitate to ask in the forums for help and get the       most fun you can get out of it.""			"

												Linux logo is just for show. All they did is ship Wine with this, apparently without bothering to test it. The wrapper does allow the launching of the game but the graphics are garbled and the game is unplayable. This problem seems to appear mostly on nVidia binary drivers. There are a number of discussion threads about the problem here on Steam and on their own forums but as of yet the developers haven't issued any statements about this. Apparently they suck.Wine wrapper IS NOT a Linux port. There should be a warning about this on the store page.As for the game itself. I don't have a clue. I can't play it. If a miracle happens and it becomes playable at some point I might have to review the game again.			"

												Imagine a typical hex-based strategy game such as Dawn of Fantasy, make it 10x bigger, twice as good, and inject an original and well-written storyline - this is what you get. There are some very minor issues in that the manual is written for acrobat reader but clicking ""manual"" from the splash screen does not initiate acrobat reader so you have to find the file and do it ""manually"" - ironic. Also, for some reason, the graphics auto-detect at highest levels produces in game errors where I had to change settings to get screens to display correctly. These issues aside, this is a must-buy game for any who like the genre and all but hardened haters. 90%			"

												It takes a good 2-10 hours to get into this game, but once you do, it is a great deal of fun and the main campaign is good for at least 150 hours.  The play feels like a better-balanced Master of Magic where the strategic (map) play is much smoother (one main city to upgrade, better resourcing) while the tatical (battle) play reminds me of Kings Bounty, but you don't cycle through troops as fast and they end up meaning more to you.  Over all, if you like 4X or strategy games with turn-based combat, this is the best game of 2012 and 2013 in my opinion.			"

												Eador:MotBW is a really good game that i feel does not get the limelight other similar games get. It may be buggy, though the devs have worked hard to rectify most of these, and it may lack polish but what it dosen't lack is gameplay. A fantasy TBS with elements of the HoMM games. the Civ series and Master of Magic, Eador has that  'one more turn' factor that keeps me coming back.     A remake / upgrade of Eador:Genesis, if you enjoy turn based games with a story campign, customisable  random 'shards' (the games' playable lands)  to play, great music and plenty of original game mechanics, i recommend giving this a chance.   Two things i should add : The campaign is long; if you don't auto resolve battles it will probably take over 100 hours to complete.    Also this game can be hard, even on easier levels, so be prepared for a challenge but it is often rewarding when you win because of this. All in all a great game.			"

												First the bad things: The game suffers from some balancing issues, sometimes everything seems to be against you and can be really unforgiving as Hell.There are some small bugs when I'm writing this review.The good things:The campaign seems to be going on forever! As a dinosaur remembering Civilisation 1 on Amiga, where I've spent months on one session bringing my country to greatest power ever I strongly appreciate very long games.Map generator - you can specify how you want your skirmish map to look like and go!Diverse strategies (not as many creatures as in say HoMM3, but there are so many different tactics!Unuque game structure, where (in campaign) in order to gain new tech you need to conquer particular shards - this means if you loose one important region, you may not get certain tech and be forced to reevaluate your stratedy.Summary:Really like this game - spent quite a bit of time and am already considering the allied forces expansion.

												Eador: Masters of the Broken World combines features from several fantasy games into one very nice package. A true follower of the classic Heroes of Might & Magic recipe: heroes, turn-based battles, XP and RPG-style leveling up, fantasy settlements and their management, parties and armies of strange creatures and all that you would expect from a decent fantasy story. Eador: Masters of the Broken World manages to venture into grand strategy, tactical battles and role-playing and come out on the other side as a deep and satisfying experience. After most initial bugs have been corrected, the game stands as an impressive addition to the turn-based strategy genre. An engaging and addictive game that presents you with lots of challenging dilemmas and strategic choices. The presentation might not be spectacular, but you’ll get loads of upgradable units, buildings and an extensive dynamic campaign. Eador might not be as intuitive as Might & Magic Heroes, but it is just as difficult to get away from it. Eador: Masters of the Broken World is a must for anyone who likes fantasy turn-based strategy games.			"

												Soon to be 200h into the game. Can't say that the campaign is getting to the end basicaly because there are several endings. Each shard is different, and it's not only lands, but the world itself is different too (world of fear, rust, magic and many more), and I unlocked only half of the buildings available, so probably that is why every new shard i start, brings new challenges and tactics to try out. There are 4 hero classes to choose from, that can be mixed together and yet, eventually, you will have to use all of them. There is also karma system in game, so sometimes you will have to be good and sometimes, evil is the way to win. You can amass an army or you can just go with a hero and a few units - it's all up to you. You will struggle to maintain economy but it's good that battles will be the main source of your income, so you will have to pick the right fights, because loosing is crippling, but not necessary deadly. I really don't understand the mixed score - the game is dynamic, interesting and there is ""one more turn"" feeling in it. Furthermore, the developer is still updating the game and replying on forums, bringing some new features and reacting to the probelms (can be faster though, but can't complain). There are minor bugs, but have encountered them two or three times and they are not gamebreaking (skip a turn or finish the fight and the bug is gone). Has crashed once after a big fight, but fighting it again wasn't a big problem and i believe my PC is the one to blame here.If you're into a classic turn-based strategy - it's definitely worth a shot.

Posted: August 31, 2015
												I decided to write this review because I've just seen a new update in my Steam download list and I thought:""wow they keep patching the game! Let's give it a thumb up!"". After years the devs still take care of Eador, and this a great thing.The game concept is quite original: long ago, after a great cataclysm, the world literally broke into pieces... but life did not encounter its extinction and now each shard of Eador is floating on the Astral Plane as a little world on its own. In the farthest dephts of the Astral Plane boils the burning chaos (a sort of hell), populated by demons whose only purpose is to swallow every single shard until nothing will be left on the Material Plane. This reminded me so much ""the nothing"" of the movie ""The Neverending Story"", and when someting brings me back to my early youth it's always a good thing.Some elder entities or some fortunate, cunning or sinister mortals have found the way to ""ascend"" to become a Master: a demigod with peculiar powers able to reunite the shards and to shape them into their ideal world. Every Master wants to get all the shards for him in order to restore Eador (the official rightful goal), and because if he loses all his shards, often due to the attack of another Master, the chaos will swallow him (the unofficial but very compelling goal). You play the role of a Master (and a very powerful one, with the power of time travel... that is how the game justifies the ""load game"" button!). But enough lore...The artistic style of the game is quite unique and in my opinion it's just enough to recommend the game to those who like the genre. I find it very ""dreamlike"": the colors are vivid and the illumination reminds me of a late afternoon in an autumn day. Very oniric. The loading screens are the best I've seen: they're handpainted and show different kinds of shards. I always find myself staring at them, searching for a little particular in a distant town or thinking about the loneliness of the people who live in the only creepy village in the swamp shard...The music is soft and it seems like you're listening to it from afar... like in a dream. Just one thing... why isn't there a combat music??? fighting with a lullaby (even if it's a very, very good one) as soundtrack does brake the atmosphere!The sound effects are not as good as the music, but it's not an issue.The gameplay is structured into turns, this game is not meant to be played in a hurry, yet the AI is very fast (maybe because, as other people has said, it does not shine for its ""intelligence""). Every Master who struggles for the shard can count on mortal heroes born in the shard (or, as recently added in an update, transported from the previous conquered shard through the astral plane to the new shard) devoted to him. In a given turn your ""hero"" can perform a single action picked from the common 4X choices:- eXpand your reign by conquering neaby regions;- eXplore your domains for places of interest (and give a boost to the economy with the treasures he finds);- eXterminate your rival Masters and kick them out of the contended shard (or into the Chaos if you're attacking their world);- eXploit the resources of your regions by building specific structures and by taking decisions and reacting to random events.The ""exploit"" part of the game is nice (even though after lots of games it becomes a bit repetitive), because it is based on completely random events which can affect the morale of the commoners and/or the income of every single region under your control. For example plagues, fires, festivals, magic or scientific discoveries can happen and you have always to take a decision: you can be a tyrant that enslaves the workers in order to boost the production or a benevolent god loved by the people: there is a ""karma"" mechanic that sums all your decisions for the curent shard, and in the end the people will give you a title like ""The Pure"". The interesting thing about this is that the choices encourage you to think as a demigod, not as a human: your goal is the domain of the shard and mortals are just creatures (and if you try to please them always, you'll discover they are a quite expensive kind of creature) that you can cuddle or slaughter if needed. After all a game turn could last a day, a year or a generation... why should you concern about creatures whose whole life is a blink of an eye compared to the eternity of your being?Combat is challenging but I find that only the Archer hero is useful (at least according to my playstyle). Other hero types are way too weak IMHO (although I guess that a high level mage would be able to win every battle very easily, especially with high level summons). Planning the logistics is very important as the main hero gets farther from your capital, because independent troops get stronger and heroes (apart from archers) can move only one/two regions per turn. So it's important to dedicate to production the regions which are near the capital and to build forts and marketplaces into the border regions. But these are general rules, since the absolute randomness of the shards (even the campaign ones) can really influence the outcome of the game, and this can be a pro or a con (you decide): the last shard I played, for example, a poor enemy Master started on a peninsula linked to the main land by a line of regions of deadland (which is not productive and it's difficult to conquer at the early stages of the game), so when I reached him at the end of the game he was blocked and weak... and I annichilated him. If that happened to me I probably wuold have reloaded the game... I am the timewalker Master after all ;)I could speak a lot more about the management (hiring defenders, maintenance costs, combat and people morale, quests, alliances with NPC races) but this is a review, not a guide! I just want to spend a few words about the tech-tree because... there's no tech-tree! Your ""technology"" for the shard is decided by the buildings you build. In the campaign every shard you conquer adds some new building for your capital city to your building list (you start with an ""empty"" city in every new shard). Every building allows you to do something: recruit a new type of troop, give a bonus to morale, learn new spells, build special buildings in other regions ecc... In addition, like in a tech-tree, some buildings block others, so you have to plan which ones will you construct according to your desired gameplay style for the shard.So let's talk about the bugs now. The game crashes once every few hours, so I sugest to enable autosave, which can overcome almost completely the bug allowing you to load the last turn.What else to say?I recommend this game! It has the ""just one more turn"" effect on me...			"

												Not what I expected.  This game makes you conquer a small map, which ranges from hard to impossible depending on the difficulty level you pick, and then start over again dozens of times without much to show for each conquest.  Now the game is pretty well made and polished, so it is fun if you're not playing on the higher difficulty levels while you are conquering, but the fact that you have to start over every time kills it for me.I like playing on the higher difficulties, so now I just figured out a strategy which lets me win and this takes out some of the joy out of it as well - I am forced to use the same strategy over and over, otherwise I will lose.

Basically you play through 'shards' each turn, building up an army and eventually conquering each shard, which then unlocks bonuses for the next shard.

												This game is one of the most enjoyable games for people who enjoy sid Meyers civilization, Heroes of Might and Magic, or Warlock masters of the arcane. Using the might and magic combat system and hero system with more active heroes i combat allowing them to both give and recieve high amounts of damage. The only problem with this game is that some bots in hard story mode tend to cheat to win making the game unfairly difficult. Do not be decieved by their clever disguises as even the morally good bots with do what it takes to edge you out of every conquest. The story mode aside custom and online games are enjoyable, but long. Having to conquer a province and then explore it can become tedious on large maps with little opponents, though they allow you to get to end game scenarios before fighting your rivals. All in all it is a well made game that should be fun for any people who enjoy the games listed at the beginning of this review			"

I typically mute the game sound/music, and play my own relaxing music in the background.  This game is a MUST for people that Enjoy: 1) Turn-based strategy games. Some battles are straight forward easy, others you will really need to plan/think. 2) Playing King Bounty (KB ) Games. It is very similar to KB, except soldier units can also level up and perma die. 3) Playing Fire Emblem.4) Character building by leveling up and choosing new skills (RPG-like)5) Progressive difficulty that can only be overcome with proper tactics. Example: magic beats physical armor, etc.6) Many ways of playing a game (4 heros, and tons of soldiers to choose, they all have different skills and builds) 7) Taking your time to thoroughly complete a level rather than rush through it. No need to rush, enjoy the battles. 8) Loot, Loot, Loot. Decent number of items to find and collect with various tiers. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys turn based battle tactics.  Ed   "

												Highly recommend to all fans of fantasy, strategy, and tactics games. Plenty of unique units and buildings, heroes and units gain levels and you can customize their growth, explore the terrain to find new locations and upgrades, manage resources, and increase your own power by conquering other worlds/shards. The campaign does a good job of introducing you to more intricate tactics and developments as you progress. One downside is that with each new shard/map you start over somewhat, but things still manage to stay interesting through new units and buildings, new opponents, and randomized events.			"

												Easily one of the funnest games I have played, that being said, I would not recommend you buy unless you have a god tier computer. On my normal computer, this game does not work it crashes all the time, I recentlly built a very nice computer and it runs as smooth as a lampshade made of fresh baby skin. Also the issue with the crashes and errors I got on my other two computers (ones a laptop) will not be adressed as none of my emails or error reports ever got a reply. Maybe the company is not the best at pr. This game is amazing nonetheless, I enjoy the strategy and it is not insanely easy as some others, so long as you dont select skilled or anything below you will have very nice combat that requires actuall planning and thinking, story line was pretty awesome too. Only issue I have had is that you need a strong computer to play it, and the lack of help or support from the creators, but I get that from ea and almost every company too. Another cool thing so far as gameplay goes is that you can use one method to win most battles, for example necromancy, however these battles can be slugfests, and you may end up losing, where you essentially trade blows until one of you manages to get the upperhand and you will end up taking days of back and forth battling to take or lose the shard, when if you just adapt you strategy and maybe add a commander with long range  units in the back and strong defense with low attack to shield the path of incoming land units you could maybe have won the shard or faster if you win anyways. There are flying units too, the strategy is quite varied, really an awesome game.			"

												I've put in a lot of time, so trust me when I say this, this game is not very good.  It's extremely repetitive, virtually every shard is the same, with only a few additional gimmicks (which you are informed of before you start).  The units don't change much.  You don't get to keep your heroes, (unless you pay a great deal of energy to transfer them), but that is okay, because they can max level in any shard.  You see the same scenarios happen over and over again.  Eventually, you just know where in the box to click to get the most positive result for your run.  I'm just so bored of it.  Oh, and technically I have no idea how it ends, and I've only played one campaign.  So all that time in I've spent doing the exact same things on every shard hasn't even brought me to a conclusion.  Make of that what you will.			"

												Eador, Masters of the Broken World. The best way to describe this game would be that it is heavily influenced/steals from (well, the older version but okay) Heroes of Might and Magic 3. You upgrade cities by making new buildings allowing for magic, income, creatures, experience for your creatures, or special effects. Battle is done on a grid system in a turn based combat manner and as your heroes level they gain new abilites and skills.However, there is were similarities end. For instance, unlike HoMM3 all cities are equal, which the same creatures being able to be recruited. You explore the map by conquering surrounding provinces - which can be upgraded with buildings but with a much smaller variety than the cities. Thus no free roaming on the map and individual armies of provinces can be daunting to defeat. Furthermore, magic does have some impact, but I would say less in the battlefield that HoMM3, but can be more impacting on a global scale than HoMM3, due to the so called rituals. Another important difference is the 'happiness' factor. If a province gets unhappy it might revolt, that is something you do not see in HoMM making Eador more of a grand strategy game in that sense. It also has more RPG elements than HoMM3 as quests can be given through the conquering of a shard (= one map) and acting differently can have very different consequences. Even more so, if you are friendly some troops will like that and get better morale, where others will think you weak. Likewise, you can not ally e.g. the Elves (some rare neutral provinces on the map) if you play like an evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Personally I miss a bit the variety in units from time to time, but that has been partially lifted by the small DLC (allied forces) of 4 euro. Although that states only 2 new units per individual faction, it actually creatures more new units and with a new special building that can be found in a province (the mercenary guild) you can actually hire these troops. This is great because it sometimes tediously long to get e.g. to level 2 unit buildings and this gives your army the edge you need for higher difficulties in my opinion.All in all, Eador is a good addition for anyone that enjoyed the old HoMM series (not V as it does not have those graphics implemented) and is looking for a different game with a slight twist.

												Hope you've got the next year or so free, 'cause Eador eats up free time at an alarming rate.The basic gameplay will mostly be familiar to fans of the Heroes of Might and Magic series: Hero units, backed by a recruitable army, explore the world and fight with each other. There are towns, equipable items, all that good stuff. However, where HoMM  tends to be fairly simple, Eador has enough depth to drown a whale. What you build, where you build it, and what you stock your army with can have huge consequences, and every turn has dozens of choices about how best to improve your situation. Add in random events, potentially dozens of battles per province, and a solid enemy AI and you've got a recipe for a huge time-sink.Most 4x games become bogged down in the late game: Your strategy is set, you've built everything you need to, and now it's simply a matter of hitting ""next turn"" until you win. Eador's campaign averts this in a wonderful way: The maps are fairly small by 4x standards, but you have to complete dozens of them. The world has been split into shards, and your goal is to control as many of them as you can. That means that by the time you've reached the ""just hit next"" stage you'll have completed one shard and it'll be time to move on to the next, where you have to build up your forces all over again. That's not to say that beating a shard has no benefits: Each one you control grants you boosts to your income, troops, or abilities, so planning which ones to conquer in what order actually matters to an extent.All-in-all an excellent strategy game that I'd highly recommend to HoMM or Disciples fans.

												Diverse and detailed fantasy TBS title with widely branched city building (actually world building) features and ""god-game"" elements extended with a complex economy structure and large number of diverse units. Sheer quantity of content is difficult to describe because after 100+ hours of campaign I did not even get to see half of the story and haven't unlocked good part of the units and buildings. The karma system is ubiquitous and well executed. Sincere recommendation for anyone looking for a slightly different designed TBS.			"

												This game closely resembles Heroes of MaM, in its gameplay but adds several features.  First is is much more complex and takes significantly longer to actually play the game.  One difference is that each map is devided into provences where you move from provence to provence each turn.  Do do not actually attack enemies on the game map, bu through events that are specific to the provence that your hero is working in.  Then there is the world building phase of the game, which acts as a break point between each of the shard games.  You play a campain on the world building section of individual conquests of each individual game map.  Type of recommendation:  If you love the turn based HoMaM games or possibly King's Bounty but want something more complex, you may enjoy this game.  The biggest difference between those games and this one is that you are not moving freely on the map but moving from provence to provence where all the events take place.  Otherwise this game is probably going to be too tedious for most people.  I will continue to play it but only periodically.			"

												A very clever 4X that follows in the footsteps of King's Quest and Heroes of Might and Magic, but adds plenty of its own to the genre. The scale of the game is horrifying, it's taken me several days to beat my first randomly generated scenario out of what promises to be a 50-100 scenario long campaign.There's a huge amount of content and plenty to do every turn, but it's presented in an efficient way and turns go quickly.The game isn't exactly unpolished, but it has some splinters that could be sanded down. Expect a harmless crash every 24 hours or so. There's one bug that can hit fairly often and prevents kills from registering, especially on retaliatory hits and especially on slower combat speeds. It can be resolved without incident by autoresolving at the end of combat and almost always works in the player's favour, blocking its AI reenforcements and almost never occurs on the highest combat speed, which I would recommend using either way, because the second slowest is much too slow. There are other cases in the game where the settings are not as delicate as they perhaps aught to be.The game seems to be a direct remake of Eador: Genesis. I prefer this version, but there's not a lot between them.			"

												Just read some of the negative reviews, bit confusing. 200-300+ hours on game yet ""can't recommend"".  Fairly sure you've already recommended it, pal.Anyway, I have no idea why this game is still being updated, it was released 2 years ago, but it's rather nice for them to STILL be releasing updates for it. Been playing the game for a while and it seems fine to me, few glitches here and there that I recall but given the state of development of even AAA games these days, the glitches were no more pronounced than ""usual"" so seemed balanced. I had no game breaking glitches, anyway.  Game is pretty, combat is fun, levelling heros feels rewarding, taking over shards is the way to make the game ""progress"" and world feel persistent without forcing a heavy handed corny storyline onto you that limits player options per scenario.  Delivering an interesting turn based strategy game that works within a non intrusive narrative is no easy task, but I think handled quite well in this case.Oh, love the dialogue too. Nicely written, surprisingly so, actually. The majority of game dialogue is trash, and that's fine, most don't read game dialogue for the dazzling display of talent - but in this case I thought it was pretty decent.			"

												***** EDIT *****Someone pointed out that the ""pointer error"" bug was fixed w/ the last patch. The announcement for the patch claimed it was.  However...the bug STILL exists and it is in fact, an actual GAME BREAKING bug. See this report from another player: http://steamcommunity.com/app/232050/discussions/0/540740500665480910/In addition, the patch introduced yet another game breaking bug (the ""0 hp bug""). See this thread:http://steamcommunity.com/app/232050/discussions/0/540740500975024315/So my review stands. The game is NOT in a playable state for a great number of players...so new buyers will be taking a risk that the game will not work for them. The game hasn't worked for me in over a year due to that one error (described in the original review below)./end edit===== BUYER BEWARE =====The game's premise is cool. The graphics are fine. The play mechanics are interesting and fun. The problem? The dev simply REFUSES to fix year old bugs that prevent a signifiant portion of players from playing the game.For a large percentage of players...this game is simply unplayable. There numerous threads about this bug (the ""pointer error"") and many more posts about it.Either the devs are inexperienced at debugging and proper coding or they simply do not care that many players cannot play the game they paid for.  Either way, it is highly problematic for the customer as the result is a non-functioning game. BUYER BEWARE. Spending money on this game runs the risk of resulting in the game becoming a  virtual coaster, nothing more.Here's a link to the reported error: http://steamcommunity.com/app/232050/discussions/1/810923021679670190/  There are several other threads doing the same, and even more posts (in different threads) reporting the same error (which has existed for over a year now). Simply search for ""pointer"" and you'll find numerous players who simply cannot play the game as a result of it.			"

												Good concept, poor execution. It plays similarly to Fallen Enchantress, and much like it has constant crashes and errors. It also has an exploration feature much alike Sengoku Rance, a feature I actually enjoyed very much. With some much needed bug-fixing, the game could be quite enjoyable, but without it it is sadly not that fun.

Another things that bothers me is this is not a true linux port.  It's running on wine-which wouldn't bother me, if I could actually play the game.  Please correct these issues.  I do not like giving negative reviews.  The game looks like a great game with a lot of potential and I would really want to give it a positive review.

												Woo Woo this game is intense.  If you play HOMM, you may enjoy this game.  Looks great, flows nice, a bit of a hardware hog, and sometimes timing is off.  Devs are still taking care of it and loving it nicely.  Updates often.  I have already banked a few hours and only dented the surface of the gameplay.  The story is fun and events are unpredictable.  It is immediately challenging.  The tutorial is brief and sets you on your way in the most loving way a game can HA.  Anyway, give it a go if you have much time to spare.  This game is not fast, nor is it repetitive.  Each providence is different and even your own subjects may revolt.  I would recommend printing out the manual and keeping it handy.  There is immense detail in this game.  Plan well!			"

												I really enjoy it as a strategy game. Many choices, like which shards you go after, greatly affect how things go for you. I played the other Eador game and loved it, this one seems better but the different controls took me a bit to get used to. The AI can be very predictable, this is good at times but also can be very bad when things are going against you because there is little chance to fool it or evade it, it pretty much hits you as hard as it can at all times so most should start on the easiest setting. Even if not the greatest it's a steal for the price.			"

												Highly Recommended by me if you like Fantasy style Civ games, It plays similar to my favorite mod of all time; RiFe for Civ 4 - mixed with turn based Might and Magic type stuff. The elements of being able to Explore every province is pretty darn fun, and allows for alot of time to sink into a map. But by far the biggest pull for me in the game is the campaign; Imagine starting a game of Civ with a tech cap on most buildings/units. Choosing which ""shards"" to attack allows you to get new bonuses and slowly unlock everything. It's pretty awesome to have that sort of Metagame aspect to it. seeing as i can easily run through a million and and a half games of Civ that extra layer of progression was really fun to me. If you've got time and enjoy that type of game i'd recommend it to anyone. it's a grade A droning game. It's more a game of unlocking and and collecting items to upgrade your hero/buff your armies that civilization upgrading, but it works well i feel. and the different spells and unit types definitly give you the ability to mix it up a bit and find whatever is fun for you. That's the best part about this game is it tends to just let you go whatever path you want (beacuse most all paths will eventually let you win lol)But, Pick it up if it's on sale, and Take care all!

												Not sure why the user reviews are ""mixed"" when this game is by far one of the most enjoyable of its genre. Having played Eador Genesis before this I was happy to see the content was the same just with a shiny new look. The game has a faster pace to it than its predecessor with more unlocked with each shard conquered and the shards themselves feeling smaller. This is probably a good thing for many, though I didn't appriciate this myself. You will always start with humans as the race you control with the chance to complete (sometimes over the top difficult) quests to ally yourself with a non-human faction on each shard. One complaint many have is the difficulty, I myself am quite average when it comes to strategy games but even I found a way to secure a victory over every shard (hint: the scout is a great hero to start with). Also not seen any bugs which apparently plagued the game earlier in its life so many thanks to the developers for sorting that all out. Overall this is a game for those seeking a challenging turn based strategy and not put off by the fact that it can get a little repetitive. Personally I would suggest trying Genesis first as it is cheaper to get a taste of what it is all about and if the old school graphics there aren't for you but the gameplay is then consider buying this.

												When thinking of this game I think of the difference between Chess people and Checkers people. While they both use the same board they are not the same game.Eador is much like a Chess match that you have to build the army, before you play a match, while the player you are facing off against is doing the same task.The AI can seem either too easy or too hard but this can be the players fault for rushing or taking too long so part of playing the game is understanding the timing of how things work.  The best/worst features depending on your like/dislikes.-Turn based so you can think before you act-Auto save feature so you can try out differnt options rather than having to play many games. -Many settings to adust for how YOU the player want your game to go.-Many units so you can adjust your army based on how you want to play.edit- New feature the option to take heroes from one shard to the next, while costly with prior planing this can really help before you invade another enemy home shard!There are the bugs that sometimes will crash a game but much less than say Skyrim or any other complex game.  No game breaking bugs that will prevent you from finishing the game and not often enough for me to kill the mood,  Say one crash per 20hrs of game play is about what I have.  Not been able to narrow down if they were the programs or mine since often they are not ones I can reproduce.			"

												TL;DR: Only buy this game if it is on sale and you absolutely love 4X games. If you want to spend a few dozen or hundred hours testing your patience, then this may be the game for you. Otherwise, perhaps gift it to someone you want to see spend hours on end beating their head against the wall.This game is a great time sink, but there are lots of poorly executed concepts. Item durability, especially on arrows, is a joke. Your arrows can (and sometimes will) break before you run out of arrows in a single fight. The best magically enhanced arrows have less durability than the ""heavy arrows"" which themselves have to be repaired literally after every single serious fight or they will break during your next battle.If item durability was the only flaw this game might still be a gem, but even concepts that are well thought out are not well developed. Exploration of owned territory is an interesting idea, but there is often no real reason to bother completely exploring areas. Your rewards for doing so are threefold. You receive a tiny immediate 2 gold increase in total income, you discover a large variety of new enemies to battle, and the settlements in that area can expand into the newly explored areas, eventually generating significantly increased income. This mechanic would function a lot better if there was a small amount of exploration that took place automatically in provinces with guards. The AI doesn't explore much manually, but it does have guards in every province so at the very least the AI would have some small amount of exploration done in their own territories. Instead when you take territory from an AI opponent every single province will be gripped under the stranglehold of ""overpopulation"". And that brings me to my second major frustration with the game.The AI doesn't understand the mechanics, either in battle or on the world map. As an example of the flawed combat AI, ghosts can only be damaged by magic damage. However, if you try to autoresolve a battle with a ghost in it you will almost certainly be completely annihilated by the ghost because the AI will use all the physical damage it can against the ghost, while units capable of magic damage busy themselves with other tasks until your entire army is dead. This means that armies that are labelled as something you can fight without taking casualties are often impossible to defeat, where enemies that are labelled as ""I will be trampled"" can often be manually defeated without taking a single point of damage. On the overland map the AI spams a granary in effectively every province. The granary itself generates no income, and takes up one of the limited building slots. The granary can be explanded to a stable which would give the AI some tiny additional income as well as allow it to move more quickly through its territory, but I have yet to see a province in which the AI had actually upgraded one. A storehouse on the other hand can add 10 gold per turn income to a province when it is fully upgraded, otherwise it will offer 5 at tier 2 or just a single gold per turn at tier one. Still, these are the most readily constructed source of income, while it takes awhile to be able to upgrade them to tier 2 you can quite readily increase your total income by a third or more by having one in every province. It's a crying shame the AI doesn't understand how to build a thriving economy, if it did perhaps there could be a provincial governer (or some such) that would automatically build the upgrades you wanted akin to automating workers in Civilization. Building a mall in every province you have is a chore when you have twenty provinces, but it's ludicrous to even consider bothering once you've gotten to the point where you have 100 or so provinces. If the AI could build wealth it might be able to field larger armies more often. I have thus far only rarely seen the AI taking advantage of units higher than tier 2, and there are 5 tiers of units that can be recruited. As an example of something that is ridiculously easily fixed, and yet remains flawed for no good reason, just look to the autosave system. The autosave system autosaves at the end of every several turns, rather than the begining of every several turns. If they had taken the approach of labelling these saves Turn ___ or something along these lines this wouldn't really be an issue. However, they've gone the route of having 5 autosaves that roll over each other. Not necessarily a problem, but there isn't anything behind the scenes that tells the game that it has autosaved this turn in say the slot Autosave 4. So when you load Autosave 4, and end the turn, you will create Autosave 5. Does the war seem inevitable at that point? Load Autosave 3, but when you end your turn you will create Autosave 1. Get to the turn that originally was Autosave 5? Now it's created Autosave 2, and if Autosave 3 isn't early enough to head off your issue your older autosaves are gone. This is easily avoided using a rotation of manual save games, but it's just one tiny example of a problem that could likely be fixed by changing a few lines of code and remains in the game just to annoy players.I wish I could introduce Snowbird to the concept of numbers that end in 0, it would be a lot less frustrating to see that I've done 2 damage or 5 damage to something with 50 health than that I did 0 damage four times in a row firing Ballistae at one skeleton (each with damage potential labelled as 0-5 on a 5 health skeleton). And that's just another in a litany of odd design decisions. If a flying creature flies onto a hill, it gains +1 range for its attacks. But it already flies, it's flitting about in the air, why on earth should the topography below it matter? If anything flying units should constantly receive a +1 range buff, perhaps losing it when they run out of stamina. There's a reason why it's a fairly common practice that ground based effects, positive and negative alike, are typically ignored by flying units in games. Siege engines are considered mechanical units for the purposes of healing spells, but they're not immune to being petrified by a medusa. There is literally only one unit, at least according to the wiki, who can gain the Repair ability so that they can repair siege engines, and it is the militiaman which is one of the weakest units in the game. Both the Ballista and (clearly described as self propelled, yet also capable of being petrified) Catapult are described as having been created initially by the Dwarves, but the Dwarf cannot gain repair. Interestingly the Dwarf can gain petrification immunity, and now I have nearly come to the end of this tirade. I am baffled anew by this game every time I play it, I understand many of its quirks, and yet I am consistantly scratching my head and asking ""Why?"". Why did they make every quiver of arrows in the game have the potential to break if you fight two back to back battles when you can very easily be required to fight at least three armies during a fortress siege (the guards, a defending hero, and the garrison. You will honestly likely fight five as two more armies rush home to commit suicide as an act of solidarity with their comrades). Early game a quiver of 10 arrows will break before you've even run out of arrows, apparently you break arrows like a drunk having a nicotine fit might break cigarettes.This game has had a lot of thought put into it, but it seems to me that very little logic has gone into the development. I almost wish it had come out alongside Master of Magic and the first Civilization. At least then I could have more readily forgiven its faults and the games it inspired would be able to refine the good ideas and burn away the dross. As it stands at the end of the day there are better 4X games out there for your purchasing dollar.			"

												I have been loving this game, it is unique and different then other 4x games... Only downside is I think it has a level cap of 30 and it takes many hours to conquer a shard. I am enjoying the story as I conquer the shards this is a worthy game to pickup to add to your collection.			"

												I purchased this game because it is advertised as supporting Linux.     After installing in several machines and configurations,  I always get the error ""missing executable"".     Then I installed it via  WINE / PlayOnLinux, tried different video settings,  but the video is always broken.    I have not tried it on Windows, but my vote is negative because developers should not advertise supporting a platform when clearly they don't .   You can check in the forums,  all Linux users are getting the error ""missing executable"", and it has not been fixed for several months now.			"

												You want to play turn-based combat and simultaneously building up your empire while leveling every single unit in your army up? You, dear Sir, have quite an interesting taste. And found a jewel.The story itself is engaging while you conquer the whole universe and face from humans to gods everything you might think of. The shards (worlds) itself are then conquered by your hero and his armies, who fight your battles in turn-based combats. All the shards then allow for more units, equipments, buildings and boosts for the next shard to fall under your rule.The graphical presentation might not appeal to anyone, but it is atmospherical and suits the game and gameplay well enough. A lot of peopel are reporting technical issues with the game, however I have never encountered such problems. If this bothers you, I recommend checking other reviews in more detail.7/10 for breaking under it's own size from time to time and the technical issues a lot of peopel might have (This is hard to factor in, though, because if you do have such issues, one would very likely give it a 0, as in did not deliver).

												   OMG worst developers ever. They just parasite on the original one-man developed Eador Genesis. Crappy 3d, ton of bugs that weren't fixed for years, almost no new content compared to the original. I got this but i still play the old one. There is already great user content for the original game. So they implement it first time with the Alied Forced DLC. 3 $ for nothing never even played this crap enaugh to see it. Now they steal another piece of Eador New Horizons and tag it as a new game. What a bunch of thieves. Made a DLC and want to sell it for 12 $ like standalone.    We had your game early access and got no improvements from bugged alpha style game at all except for one  small unimportant DLC. And now you dare to make another for a full game price. Never saw such a terrible indie developers. Look at the Dominions 4 game developers. There are two of people working on it. They make patches for Dominions 4 all the time for years balancing it and adding new nations for free. Yes you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s free content. Something you will never make. Because you tag every crappy little piece of your lazy work for a decent price. And you didn't even took care for game stopping bugs for years. You didn't work for the price we payed. Early access vampires thats just who you are.			"

												A very good 4X fantasy turn based game. It's complexity is well balanced by the game system. I find this game as good or better than some newer and more-hyped games in this genre. One of the best unexpected discoveries I've made on Steam. A rare, beautiful and challenging gem that is a pleasure to own.			"

												Eador: Masters of the Broken Game.  This game could be wonderful.  It is the best Turn-Based Strategy I've ever played, and it is broken beyond belief.  I'm currently nearing 70 hours into the campaign, and I've had to relaunch the game from crash over 150 times.  That in mind, the game is surprising in its depth of world, story, and dialogue.  It incorporates the karma alignment options of games like Fable and Mass Effect, with actions made affecting the general disposition of everyone when they talk to you.  Based on their appraisal of you, the dialogue changes entirely.  If they like you, they may be willing to divulge information, or even give you a boost forward in the campaign.  If they dislike you, they'll be curt, aggressive, and might in fact attack your home world.  The karma system is much deeper and more involved than this, and is one of the flavors swirling in the mix that made me fight through the headaches of constant bugs.Fighting is tough.  The entire game is incredibly difficult.  There are a large number of ways to beat the game (ten?), and each feels different than the others.  Each ending makes you fight for it, and while fighting for it, the possibility for another way out crops up.Managing the empire on each shard of the broken world is tough, and requires capitalization of what you have available.  Once I felt comfortable and confident in my skills, I raised the difficulty to the maximum, which was a nice ego check: while I did still finish the shard, it was tooth and nail.Bottom line for this game: if you're a fan of TBS, get this game.  The developers have stayed on it consistently, improving the game since its ill-advised release.  Even given how long it has been since the game was released, it feels like it's still in Beta release.  It's a fantastic game that absorbed a large amount of time, and likely will continue to do so, but I doubt most people would be willing to fight through all the effort it has taken to get to this point in the story.

												So frustrating...the gameplay is great, nice graphics, vast World to explore. Seems like a great game...but it does crash a LOT. It takes away the joy out of playing as this game crashes for me almost every 10-15 minutes. Frustration is a mild term to use here. I would recommend it to anyone who likes strategy turn based games with RPG elements, but it is still full of bugs almost a year after the release - the patches don't seem to fix the problem a lot of the players are facing.

A brutaly difficult strategy game with 3 levels of playIt's a rewarding experience when you win because of the difficulty. Don't expect to approach this game for self-expression or roleplay despite the Fantasy tag and story arch. It's a pure strategy and every move counts. Reading the guides can help a lot.Not for players with limited playtime. Play session can take over an hour Hard to get back into after not playing for a week Poorly conveyed mechanicsIt's Risk, Ogre Battle, and Might & Magic in one.On the highest level it plays like Risk where you choose which ""Shard"" to take over for resources. Then you go into the Shard and it plays more like Civ V where you move through an overworld discovering resource tiles and enemies. When you land on an enemy you control the details of the battle like an older Might & Magic where you move individual units on the battleground and have to take out all enemies.			"

												This game is broken.Let me say that idea of the game is awesome, the concept of it, its very good.The game itself, pretty much broken in my experience.The game forces you to zerg, for me this seems the only way to win a match, even on easy.When i drag out a campain on a shard, which you really want to do, because the game lets you do so much when you are on a shard, it becomes almost impossible to beat the enemy.Let me give a example.I was fighting against the local lord.I killed of his entire army and only his lvl 6 warrior hero remained.That was versus my fully eqxuiped lvl 9 warrior  hero, with 2 healers that both had ammo, 2 archers and a swordman. all around lvl 4-5.I decided to use auto battle for the match since it was just 1 more unit, and I lost it, the local lord his lvl 6 hero wiped out my entire army on his own, I honestly do not understand how that is possible, when I re did the match, I saw why it happend, since his hero was able to one hit / kill my units, and pretty much kill off my hero in 2 moves.To me this makes very little sense, but perhaps I am doing something wrong.A other broken thing is when you start a battle it will give you a green / organge / red text saying it will be easy / normal / hard to win a fight. ( this being the case as well saying it would be easy to win against his local lord, but turned out to be rather hard )Most of the times this is rarely the case , some of the fights that are being  told you would win wihtout losing anything, are hard as hell and you lose half your army, and some fights it says you dont have a chance to win, you win completely without a problem.Also something that bugs me, but this is my own opinion, is early in the game, where you're gold is being used to troop building / castle building, you get random encounters on the lands you hold saying the people need / want this or that for X amount of gold, which you dont have at that time since you just started the game, leading into angry people.Now I really like the idea of this game, and how it works, I just wished it was working better then it is right now, the fact that its 4 months without any updates or anything has me a little worried though.Although I believed I read something about them working on something new, but dont know if its true.I would not recommned this game right now as it can be very frustrating, but perhaps I am just doing something completely wrong.If that would be the case I would definilty edit this towards alot more postive review, because the game does deserve it, if it works properly!

												Lots of game-breaking bugs. For example, for no explained reason shipyards not allowing passage over water. (Yes, it's been reported all over forums and so on by several people, I'm not alone.) The system presents a lot of good ideas for a strategy game, but half of those ideas go out the window as useless novelties pretending to be contributions to strategic performance. You can spin out a hundred turns doing all this interesting stuff to accrue military might, but the best strategy 9 times out of 10 is to throw karma and strategy out the window and necromancer-rush the other Masters. In addition to the numerous major bugs, there's quite a lot of UI problems. Some simple quality-of-life fixes would save so many headaches. For example, if your hero is on your capitol and you select the Treasury button, you only see your treasury and not also the items your hero is carrying. You select your hero, click the same button, same problem. You have to click the treasury button that is by your hero's portrait to see both windows. I think every single time I need to visit my inventory I have done this lap around the UI in anger.With the slowness of progress in the game, you can literally spend fifty hours on a map and then lose dramatically, then realize there's a greater campaign with many linked games. If the UI were sped up a bit and things like Exploration made to no longer take 50 turns to find a quest location in a single province, I would probably have a whole campaign under my belt by this many hours instead of TWO INCOMPLETE MAPS.The difficulty is also all over the place. My game difficulty is the lowest (what I started with when I was figuring things out) but the vast majority of random encounters are things like armies of demons. NPC goblin hordes keep overrunning my provinces and I literally cannot fight back their grenadiers with my entire military. And I can't build up my military because I am surrounded on all sides with no opportunities for income or tech tree progress. I could hire a handful of horse archers but it would require selling literally everything just to maintain their upkeep - and those tier 2 horse archers can't really handle a handful of grenadiers. The random province attacks by NPCs are a bit jarring because they literally come from nowhere, no origin point - I get it, keep the interior on its toes so you don't keep your whole army on your border, but these attacks are constant and randomly-sized on a huge scale. I love this game and the ideas it presents. As I begin to understand how the math works, I am tremendously disappointed. If you're tired of the traditional 4X games, this is a good thing to mess around with, but be aware that 90% of this game is an obstacle to strategic thinking.			"

												This one is pretty OK. Sometimes it gets tedious, but then, after some time off, you can play it again. Unfortunately it's a bit buggy - at least I wouldn't recommend it for a slower machine like mine. I haven't had a new game that crashes the whole system in ages... some fundamental problem there.I left this game for some months, bought some other games and played them. Then I got back to this and it's pretty OK at least in comparison. It's easily my second favourite game (if you count the Total War series as one game only).			"

In fact, it is surprisingly rich in every aspect. Developers were clearly aimed to make a game that they would like to play themselves.Masters of the Broken World is basically the same game, with modern graphics and effects.I, personally, liked ""Eador: Masters of the Broken World"" a lot, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys games like HoMM, Civilization or Age of Wonders.""+"":-Neat hero mechanics-Lots of units-Tactical variability""-"":-Mediocre visuals-Few bugs (major ones were fixed rather quickly after release; rare game crashes are still there though) "

												If you enjoy strategy games and like a challenge, you will really love Eador.The game involves you taking over ""shards"" in  grid-based expansion-style gameplay similar to the Civilization series. Each conquered shard offers bonuses to you in your quest to take over the broken world. During unit battles, however, you will move to an actual level where your armies must fight - slightly similar to games like the Disciples series and Age of Wonders. The battles, however, are a bit more basic compared to those games (you are put into a top-down style map grid and can place your units prior to the start of battle).The aesthetics of the game are nice, there is good detail in the area tiles and the unit models are decent considering the large availability of characters to recruit. The sound, music, and effects of things like activated skills and magic spells are also decent.There is a lot to do in Eador, and the learning curve is pretty high if you are not familiar with strategy games. During your turn, you can hire ""heroes"" who act as your generals for your armies. The game incorporates a karma system where ""evil"" units like skeletons and ""good"" units like dwarves will stack and provide bonuses if your army has only one type of karma (so mixing the two will result in negative attributes). You can ""explore"" each tile if you own it (up to 100%) and doing so may yield things like an adventurers guild that provides higher-tier characters for recruitment, various ruins or areas for you to fight monsters and receive treasure (there are A LOT of these), etc. Be warned, however, that is is not always advisable to explore your tiles to 100%, especially if you only have one hero because your enemy will surpass you in both troops and tile ownership very quickly. I think this contributes the most to the difficulty - when I play strategy games I am usually very good because I have a good balance of turtling while harassing, howver, in Eador the cost for subsequent hero recruitment increases substantially, and you can only move an army if a hero is leading it.There are a lot of different buildings available to be built, however, there is a limit to how many of each kind/tier can be built. For example, the ""military"" buildings each provide a single unit (archers, spearmen, etc) and will also provide either ""good"" or ""evil"" units, , but you may only build 4 out of 9 buildings (if I recall correctly). At the next tier, you can only build according to what you have previously built (and this leaks over to other ""types,"" like market/armory buildings). You may only build one building on a tile per turn. At the initial stages/shards, the AI is not too difficult, however, quite early on you will quickly find your enemy to be very unforgiven. If you slack in your expansion and troop building, you will soon find the AI's troops right outside your borders. Once you take over a tile, you can build a fort in order to garrison troops - if you don't you can hire a single ""guard"" unit to patrol around the tile and defend it from invaders. This makes it a bit easier to reclaim (or lose) tiles. There is variety in how to take over tiles as well, depending on what kind it is. For example, some village tiles will join you peacefully if you pay enough gold, and they will provide a free ""guard"" unit as a result. Others may offer missions and join you upon completion.The battling system is decent, but if you are used to the more complex battle system in Age of Wonders or the Disciples series, you might not like this as much. You get flanking bonuses against your opponent if you can maneuver behind or to the side of them. Your hero is critical to victory here, as each type (ranger/scout, mage, general, warrior) will affect your party in different ways. The wizard, for example, is very versatile (depending on what magic buildings you invest in) because he can heal, buff, debuff, and use offensive spells. He can also summon units, and investing in specific skills can allow you to keep those units after battle (if they survive and you have space in your party). You unlock more party slots as your hero levels up.The leveling system is pretty interesting, you get 2 options for your units (for example: +health or +morale), and sometimes your units will also be considered for awards/medals. These will provide extra bonuses (like extra damage), however, they will also increase the upkeep (and this can be significant in the beginning when you do not have much income). Overall, the game is very fun once you know what you are doing, and persisting over the learning curve will allow you to enjoy the unique challenges Eador offers.Highly recommend.			"

												Strategy game that uses the Heroes of Might & Magic battle system and a tile-based overworld. You only have one city (your base/capital) as your major base of operations but you can upgrade captured tiles with minor improvements/defenses. There are four tiers of buildings/units (and buildings in higher tiers require you to construct buildings of lower tiers). In the campaign you unlock buildings slowly so it's nice for learning the system: you start with limited options, figure out what's necessary to build, then add in more options and change your build as necessary.I've been playing in the easiest modes and it feels like playing Civ V on easier modes. I can be pretty flexible in my build order (since it takes a while for enemies to attack and upgrade tiers) and just safely build up my hero and steamroll into their capital. As a warning, games can take a long time (like in civ) so when I build up enough of an advantage, I quick-resolve battles (after taking out any key units from range) and head straight to the enemies' capitals (without capturing every single enemy tile).On harder difficulties, I think it'd be more like immortal/deity civ where you need a victory plan: you should know build order (what buildings you need and can skip), what tiles you take (not every tile is worth wasting time on), and trying to balance upgrading unit tiers and spending money on economy-boosting buildings.There are some changes I would've liked:* Before battle, I would have liked to be able to click on the name of the enemy unit to bring up a civilopedia-style entry about the unit (Sometimes I forget what units are in each tier and the strength gap between tiers is pretty high). * When you're offered item rewards, I would've liked to be able to check hero inventory (to see if I already have that item). * In battle, you can use the hotkey 1 to use a selected unit's ability. However, that pretty much only works if your mouse is hovered over it (so it doesn't work if you had selected it previously and moved your mouse away over another unit).* In battle, sometimes units that are brought to 0 hp don't die and are untargettable. If this happens to your own units, you can heal them up to 'revive' them so they aren't lost at the end of the battle. If it happens to an enemy unit, when you're ready you'll have to use 'quick combat' to end the battle (it'll count it as dead).* I play on windowed borderless and sometimes there are game crashes (access exceptions, pointer errors) and the game doesn't really like alt-tabbing.If you liked the HoMM series and turn-based strategy games, you should try your hand at Eador. If you're a fan of strategy games, you should take a look.			"

												Highly recommended!I play a lot of 4x games. But I find myself replaying Eador more than just about any other game I played. Finishing the campaign takes really a huge effort (estimate 600 hours). And after, I immediately started playing a new one.When making comparisons, Heroes of might & magic comes to mind. But me, I like this game better.+ The game has personality: a lot of random events - tied to the personality (karma) of the master you play - and really adding flavour and also the opportunity to develop that personality further. Also pretty funny.+ Challenging: rather difficult. Different scenario's take a different approach. Also, the technologies you develop add to that. On normal difficulty an experienced player might need several tries to conquer a world.+ Strategic: resources are scarce. Investments in your lands take a long time to pay off (10-30 turns) and are nicely balanced to investing in units.+ When comparing to Heroes of M&M: the units, spells and choices to make are just more interesting.+ Lots of replay value: because of the above.- Mixed feelings about the Allied forces DLC. I think it distorts the balance in the game. Because of that it is even more difficult.+- The game did have a lot of bugs. But most are fixed and it is stable now. Nothing gamebreaking.			"

												If you enjoy strategy games and like a challenge, you will really love Eador.The game involves you taking over ""shards"" in  grid-based expansion-style gameplay similar to the Civilization series. Each conquered shard offers bonuses to you in your quest to take over the broken world. During unit battles, however, you will move to an actual level where your armies must fight - slightly similar to games like the Disciples series and Age of Wonders. The battles, however, are a bit more basic compared to those games (you are put into a top-down style map grid and can place your units prior to the start of battle).The aesthetics of the game are nice, there is good detail in the area tiles and the unit models are decent considering the large availability of characters to recruit. The sound, music, and effects of things like activated skills and magic spells are also decent.There is a lot to do in Eador, and the learning curve is pretty high if you are not familiar with strategy games. During your turn, you can hire ""heroes"" who act as your generals for your armies. The game incorporates a karma system where ""evil"" units like skeletons and ""good"" units like dwarves will stack and provide bonuses if your army has only one type of karma (so mixing the two will result in negative attributes). You can ""explore"" each tile if you own it (up to 100%) and doing so may yield things like an adventurers guild that provides higher-tier characters for recruitment, various ruins or areas for you to fight monsters and receive treasure (there are A LOT of these), etc. Be warned, however, that is is not always advisable to explore your tiles to 100%, especially if you only have one hero because your enemy will surpass you in both troops and tile ownership very quickly. I think this contributes the most to the difficulty - when I play strategy games I am usually very good because I have a good balance of turtling while harassing, howver, in Eador the cost for subsequent hero recruitment increases substantially, and you can only move an army if a hero is leading it.There are a lot of different buildings available to be built, however, there is a limit to how many of each kind/tier can be built. For example, the ""military"" buildings each provide a single unit (archers, spearmen, etc) and will also provide either ""good"" or ""evil"" units, , but you may only build 4 out of 9 buildings (if I recall correctly). At the next tier, you can only build according to what you have previously built (and this leaks over to other ""types,"" like market/armory buildings). You may only build one building on a tile per turn. At the initial stages/shards, the AI is not too difficult, however, quite early on you will quickly find your enemy to be very unforgiven. If you slack in your expansion and troop building, you will soon find the AI's troops right outside your borders. Once you take over a tile, you can build a fort in order to garrison troops - if you don't you can hire a single ""guard"" unit to patrol around the tile and defend it from invaders. This makes it a bit easier to reclaim (or lose) tiles. There is variety in how to take over tiles as well, depending on what kind it is. For example, some village tiles will join you peacefully if you pay enough gold, and they will provide a free ""guard"" unit as a result. Others may offer missions and join you upon completion.The battling system is decent, but if you are used to the more complex battle system in Age of Wonders or the Disciples series, you might not like this as much. You get flanking bonuses against your opponent if you can maneuver behind or to the side of them. Your hero is critical to victory here, as each type (ranger/scout, mage, general, warrior) will affect your party in different ways. The wizard, for example, is very versatile (depending on what magic buildings you invest in) because he can heal, buff, debuff, and use offensive spells. He can also summon units, and investing in specific skills can allow you to keep those units after battle (if they survive and you have space in your party). You unlock more party slots as your hero levels up.The leveling system is pretty interesting, you get 2 options for your units (for example: +health or +morale), and sometimes your units will also be considered for awards/medals. These will provide extra bonuses (like extra damage), however, they will also increase the upkeep (and this can be significant in the beginning when you do not have much income). Overall, the game is very fun once you know what you are doing, and persisting over the learning curve will allow you to enjoy the unique challenges Eador offers.Highly recommend.			"

												Eador is a good alternative strategy game to people who are weary of Civilization and its clones, once all the bugs are gone (most of them should be in 2016).It is similar to the old Heroes of Might and Magic and Disciples series, moving units of fantasy setting on a grid battle.Previously, after 300 hours spent in the game, I encountered a game-breaking bug that prevented me from finishing the game. Understandably I was upset and didn't want to write a review. Now after a second attempt at just a meager 50+ hours, the bug didn't occur and I completed the game the way I wanted it.The campaign has multiple endings, and it is a clever way to keep you playing over and over, although it can be long-winded and tedious.The dialogue is often humorous and the various Masters you meet are just as colourful.Eador is a good strategy game to get at a discount.

												Eador: Master of the broken world is an indie strategy game developed by Snowbird Games. Eador is one of those games that makes you think deeply before buying and keeps you indecisive when it comes to decisions. It is a great game yet in the same time it isn’t. The game starts with an amazing cinematic which shows you as a god capable of taking decisions for humanity while ignoring morality. Initially, the first impression I had of Eador was extremely negative when it came to gameplay. The game has been up since 2013 and yet it is still plagued with bugs and issues. During my first hour of gameplay, I had dealt with two game breaking bugs and three crashes. On the top of that, the game was lagging insanely even though the recommended settings are Intel Core 2 duo 1.6 and a GeForce 8800 for the graphic card. As a proud owner of an I7 4720M with a Geforce GTX 960M 4 GB I figured the game would work perfectly. Luckyly, after surfing the forums I was able to minimize the crashes and the bugs amount by turning off shadow maps option and enabling simplified combat. It also completely removed the ‘’lag’’ effect which made the game ten times more enjoyable.At its core Eador looks similar to heroes and might and magic series, but plays very differently. At the very beginning you can start with one of the four heroes, each completely customizable with its own abilities which are either beneficial in battles or on the grid map. The choices are warrior, scout, commander and wizard. Those heroes can be recruited multiple times if you have the resources and act as your commanders. Those heroes can be further customized with gear bought in the stores built in your main castle, stores found by exploring or from adventures. Furthermore, the heroes can be also equipped with different spells to use which can either be bought in the magic guilds built in the capital or found on adventures. The commanders also have divergent paths at level 10, which gives them four choices and unique abilities for each choice. A scout becoming a ranger for instance will shot two arrows in the same turn. A warrior becoming a dark knight will be able to heal when it kills enemies. Each of those choices further diversify the pool of customization in EadorThe construction menu in Eador is also unique. Unlike most games, you only have one city and the rest are classified as settlements populated by humans, orcs, halflings, centaurs, dwarves, barbarians, goblins and other races. Some of those settlements even grant unique buildings when you engage in an alliance. The building system itself is complex since there are 10 types of categories in terms of buildings which go from tier 1 up to tier 4. Some of those buildings also feature a karma system and either give positive points or negative ones which affect the events happening in the game The game also has a nice dynamic system where events can happen in provinces and can be influenced depending on the decision you take. In one of those instances a group of adventurers claimed loot from one of my provinces and I decided to ask them for half of it. The group refused so I set the militia on them which resulted in their demise and my gain of two artifacts. Those events give even more flavor to the game and make it a lot more enjoyable.In terms of combat, Eador is an unforgiving turn-based game. In fact, it’s characterized by unique features such as the tiles having different elements (plains/forests/swamps/hills) which give different bonuses or negative effects but also by the stamina and morale of the units. The stamina stat determines how many actions the unit has including movement, attacks and spellcasting while morale usually determines the damage, but also makes the unit flee if it reaches 0 which can make battles quite interesting. Many players have complained of Eador’s difficulty since it is definitely not for the ones weak at heart.Overall, Eador is a game that can be enjoyed if you can get past its quirks, bugs and crashes. The game comes with an autosave every turn up to 4 turns so you can always reload pretty fast. The game deserves a 7/10 and I recommend to those who enjoy hard strategy turn-based games.For our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to http://www.steamified.com/To begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group			"

												A very fun turn based 4x fantasy based strategy game.Dangerously addictive game. Hours just melt away playing this game.It's not an easy game, definately not for casual players. Build order for buildings is very important. You have to balance available money between buying new units and building new buildings/province improvements. Units require monetary or gem upkeep, some require both. Build too many units and you cannot improve provinces or build castle improvments. If you spend too much time improving your castle and provinces the AI will steamroll you with thier army. So a carefull balance between economy and military buildup is necessary.Negative: AI does not calculate battles well. Battles that will destroy your entire army on auto will be listed as being very easy. Battles listed as too difficult are easy to win in manual mode. So most battles will have to be fought in manual, since even in very easy battles you will lose units (possibly even powerfull units) if these easy battles are fought on auto.Pros: Good replayability. Map generator is similar to the civilization games. Large or small shards can be generated depending on desired length of time you want to play in a skirmish.The Campaign is a good way to learn the game, but is very long. I played the campaign just long enought to get the game basics down.Many different unit types available, good, evil, or neutral. As well as magical or mundane units.Overall a very fun game. I would suggest setting an alarm clock before playing since hours can go by very rapidly. I started playing this game in the mornig, next thing I know it's 2pm. I missed breakfast and lunch. Recommended to 4x Strategy game fans.			"

I can't even change the difficulty without replaying about 10 hours worth of battle as it goes straight into an unskippable dialogue after completing the previous shard.So, recommended with caveats,			"

												Eador: Masters of the Broken World is the very definition of a ""flawed gem"". It's a brilliant turn-based strategy with classical ""heroesque"" tactical battles, solid stronghold and province management component and profound RPG systems on top of that all. Add to that a uniquely structured campaign (albeit a one that's a bit too long to my liking) in an interesting charming setting with a good deal of both humour and seriousness. Imagine if Heroes of Might and Magic and Master of Magic had an illegitimate child. That's pretty much what Eador is. Sounds utterly fantastic, right? If only that was the whole deal.Unfortunately not everything is sunshine and roses. Masters of the Broken World is actually a sort of a remake and a sequel, all-in-one. It took the great gameplay mix described above straight from its predecessor - Eador: Genesis. The idea was to greatly enhance the graphical appearance of the game with tons of *shinies* and stuff. Too bad it didn't really work out as planned. The new graphics aren't ugly, even somewhat nice but mostly awkwardish. The interface was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mess at launch and although it got better with patches, it's still pretty clunky. Add to that the fact that despite all the updates the army of bugs is still undefeated to this day. To summarize: the game is fantastic at its core, it has one of the best gameplay in the genre, but the technical side of things leaves much to be desired. Be prepared to battle the interface and fend off nasty glitches and bugs. Having said that, I must stress once more that despite the shortcomings, the game itself is brilliant. Don't let yourself be frightened off by superficial things, embrace the addiction.			"

												Easily the best ""HOMM"" type game I've played. HOMM is pretty much dead to me these days and I have no interest in the new version where you stack troops and faceroll boring maps for more story bits. I'm a bigger fan of the King's Bounty series but those are still largely about progression through troop stacks and a bit lacking in the grand scheme development. Eador however, is ALL about the development of your capital and all of the land around it. I was initially put off by the more story/objective driven campaign and didn't fully realize that this game did in fact have a sandbox mode, so I'm glad I gave it a second chance.The thing that really sets it off is that you'll take over bigger plots of land, but will have to fully explore it, clear all of the dungeons within it and completely run the enemy forces out of it before you actually gain the land making fights a lot more thoughtful than just single tile-grabbing. This process may not even be possible until you level up a bit higher and come back As in just because you walked on a tile doesn't mean you fully own and control it.  You are also fighting not only all of the monsters around the map, but also the AI building their capitals as well. Not to mention there's actually things on the maps like rocks and hills that you can USE. I took out a bigger army due to great placement with ranged units and chokepoints. That would NEVER happen in HOMM.Of course there's tons of tech tree type buildings and troops with upgrades and multiple classes of heros. It's your typical foray across a map, and the game itself does nothing brand new. It's just how it's glued together and operates that sets it apart. I picked this up for a fiver in a bundle at one point and I've seen it that low on a sale. If you like turn based strategy games you could do so much worse here for that price. It's another game that has 100's of hours potential going for it.			"

												A decent turn-based strategy game with RPG elements. If you like games like Heroes of might and Magic, and Kings Bounty, this would definitely be a game to consider.PROSDoes what you would expect of the core elements very well.A lot of variety; units, weapons, tactics, etc.A lot of tactical debth.CONSNot for everyone, the lack of pace can be frustrating for some.There is a bit of a learning curve, especially for managing your city.AI balancing, it does cheat.If you like this type of games, and are a completionist to boot, you will be in for a long experience. The nature of progression makes your heroes start over each map/realm. And extensive possibilities of exploring provinces under your control makes it hard for you to decide weather to explore the land you have, or conquer more. And the AI tends to act in a Zerglike manner on the map if you dilly-dally too long. That being said, if you like games mentioned above there is a lot of hours of fun to get here.			"

												Deciding whether to recommend this game was difficult. Eador has some rather nice ideas, and the difficulty scales relatively well into the game. I enjoy some of the mechanics, especially the way that hero classes are structured, skills can be chosen, and ""prestige classes"" are selected at later levels. I also like some of the more interesting units and the many choices in building up your stronghold. Having gems used as a global mana supply is also quite nice, and helps to balance mages.In the end though, there is still enough missing from the game that I can't outright recommend it. The graphics aren't great and the game has crashed on a number of occasions. When running it has a noticable effect on my computer's performance (I like to have a turn-based game open and play a turn or two between other tasks) both in terms of processor and memory.More seriously though, there are some issues with the gameplay. There doesn't appear to be a way to retreat from battles, and the battle level estimate algorithm is badly broken at times. I've had an army wiped when told that I should be able to win without casualties, and won some battles easily when they were meant to be difficult. Estimating the difficulty of the battle yourself is next to impossible - you know the unit types and total number, but not the exact composition or level. That last is especially important, since mis-judging the level of opposing units can make a huge difference. And since unit levels help so much, losing one or more units to a badly estimated battle is a big set-back.Another issue is that the battle maps don't particularly correspond to the supposed terrain. While there is some correspondence (for example if the area is deadlands then there's a bigger chance to get an appropriate battle map) you could end up being told that you're attacking a dungeon or hill and be fighting in a swamp-based map. This adds to the problem of judging battle difficulty.The graphics are OK but not brilliant. The music is quite nice, if repetitive. Luck can play a major part in a campaign. On my current campagin my first encounter was with a shop that sold (amongst other things) gargoyles, which really helped early on. I also had many free towns nearby, meaning I could gain provinces through bargaining even though those areas were really far too high level for me (and correspondingly increasing my early income).Quests and events are also a nice idea, but don't really work. When a centaur tells me that ogres have been raiding them from nearby hills and set me a task to kill some, I expect to actually find ogres in those hills. If spiders are repeatedly breeding in one of my provinces I'd expect to be able to send one of my heroes in to deal with them rather than having to pay some random adventuring party.In conclusion, those interested in turn-based fantasy games will probably find enough to make the purchase worthwhile, but will also find plenty of frustration. I'd love to see the game developed more, becaue it appears to be a great platform to build on.			"

												Eador: Masters of the Broken World is the very definition of a ""flawed gem"". It's a brilliant turn-based strategy with classical ""heroesque"" tactical battles, solid stronghold and province management component and profound RPG systems on top of that all. Add to that a uniquely structured campaign (albeit a one that's a bit too long to my liking) in an interesting charming setting with a good deal of both humour and seriousness. Imagine if Heroes of Might and Magic and Master of Magic had an illegitimate child. That's pretty much what Eador is. Sounds utterly fantastic, right? If only that was the whole deal.Unfortunately not everything is sunshine and roses. Masters of the Broken World is actually a sort of a remake and a sequel, all-in-one. It took the great gameplay mix described above straight from its predecessor - Eador: Genesis. The idea was to greatly enhance the graphical appearance of the game with tons of *shinies* and stuff. Too bad it didn't really work out as planned. The new graphics aren't ugly, even somewhat nice but mostly awkwardish. The interface was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mess at launch and although it got better with patches, it's still pretty clunky. Add to that the fact that despite all the updates the army of bugs is still undefeated to this day. To summarize: the game is fantastic at its core, it has one of the best gameplay in the genre, but the technical side of things leaves much to be desired. Be prepared to battle the interface and fend off nasty glitches and bugs. Having said that, I must stress once more that despite the shortcomings, the game itself is brilliant. Don't let yourself be frightened off by superficial things, embrace the addiction.			"

This game is fun, but as other reviews have stated it is definitely missing something to push it to the next level.  It's sort of a combination of HOMM and Civ.  It is so close to a masterpiece, it might be worth the developer gathering ideas for a sequel from the community and maybe consult with a few outside game designers for some perspectives.  But, well, anyways, if you want to give it a try, at the sale price I can definitely recommend it.			"

It's one of the best little Hex TBS games that exists, Being a veteran of the HOMM, CIv, Disciples and every other TBS I could get my havnds on over 20 years....lol This one fills the bill, the difficulty is pretty frustrating but any good gamer can adjust that to your needs. It is a very worthy addition to your library if you are into these kind of games.			"

												First off: this game is fun. If you like HOMM/AoW style combat and empire development, this will be right up your alley. It's a bit simpler (units don't have many spells/skills and mainly boil down to melee/archer/mage/healer), but not simple. As is typical for these types of games, the combat gets repetitive.Now, there's another Eador game, named Eador: Genesis. It's 99% the same game, but this one has (much) better graphics and some minor tweaks. However, MotBW also introduced some serious bugs, one of which is pretty game breaking. It's also a bit slower than ideal, especially on older systems. A lot of the gameplay revolves around reloading the game as a ""go back in time"" mechanic, mainly because of the inability to properly scout enemies and the impossibility to predict the actual strength of an army [unless you play the first or second difficulty, out of 7 or so]. Eador: Genesis is bug free and due to its age suffers no lag or delays. The ""reload last turn"" mechanic makes more sense there, but is also less forgiving than the full save/load in MotBW; to be hones it's much more interesting that way.So my advice would be to pick up Eador: Genesis ($6 on GOG.com I believe) unless you REALLY like flashy graphics in a tactics game.

												Played about 7 hours. The problem is the game repeats the same fight over and over on the shards, and you find yourself just ignoring the stupid random messages that become an annoyance rather than fun. Add in the fact that there's almost no strategy to any of the game.Here's the strategy on how to win: Move as fast as you can to conquer sections. That's it. If you can do that, you win. It's another game that's more about rushing around than actual strategy, or building up defenses, or dealing with an economy that makes any sense. Add in the fact that the mood metrics of the game are very convoluted, and you end up with gameplay that you'll be trying to skip rather than playing.Eventually I just got so frustrated I gave up. It's trying to be HOMM with a bigger veneer on it, but it's nowhere near as fun. Shame, because if they fleshed out the overland map part, it could be fun. But it's completely unbalanced and as such it makes no sense.			"

Posted: April 29, 2013
												So, I've had a chance to play this game for a couple hours now... or 300, I guess. I do like it a lot, so I feel like I owe the game and the developers my feedback, which might help some people decide that they should get this! (or not, I suppose).Firstly, it's a turn based strategy game in a fantasy setting. Anyone who's a fan of that genre knows that it can be really difficult to tell a good one from a bad one by looking at screenshots on Steam. As a result, I own the complete collection of bad ones.I classify this game as good. For me personally, it's probably one of my favorite games, and would be in the shortlist of titles that I might choose from if I were forced to play only one game forever. Other titles in this ""shortlist"" might be Dominions 3, and Heroes of Might and Magic III. Now that 75% of you have stopped reading this, I can speak specifically to the people who should be reading this.Eador has a lot in common with those other two games I mentioned. Hiring heroes, outfitting them with gear and troops to roam the map conquering territory, building improvements in your castle, casting ""adventure spells"" and ""combat spells"" that you obtained from your buildings or looted scrolls. So many similarities, it captures all of the great things from the other games of this genre, so the decision whether to get this game hinges on what it does differently.First of all, the scale of the game is enormous. The campaign is the primary game mode. You choose a ""shard"", which is a piece of a broken world, they are all just floating around in space, and each one has a unique set of properties that will alter the rules of the game on that shard. One shard might have magically infused crystals, making wizardry especially effective, or a desert shard makes it difficult for troops to move across a battlefield, etc. The shards also have a ""size"" (map size), and a reward for conquering the shard. The rewards are mostly centered around unlocking castle improvements, which will then be available to you in subsequent shards. With the exception of previous shard rewards, nothing carries over between shards, as your ""character"" is just the immortal calling the shots from above, and he can only pass on what he has learned. The shards all have their own inhabitants and a unique ecosystem. In addition, there will be other immortals, like yourself, on the shard trying to capture it. You capture the shard by conquering the castles of these other immortals. The winning immortal has the shard merge into his master shard, (a collection of all his previously captured shards). You can choose to attack these master shards, where it will be a 1v1 battle between you and the immortal who owns it. If an immortal loses a game on his master shard, he is eliminated from the campaign altogether, and all of his rewards go to the person who defeated him. This is true for you as well, some immortals will attack your master shard, and losing means game over. Also keep in mind that while you are attacking shards, the other immortals are going after them as well. Some shards might get snapped up while you are battling on a different one, so prioritize them if they contain technology that is part of your fundamental strategy.All the while this is going on, there will be plenty of bantering, wheeling and dealing, smack talking, and good old fashioned back stabbing happening between the immortals. All of them want something from you, want you to hate the people they hate, or try to convert you to whatever their psychopathic vision might be for how the universe should operate. You can take them up on these things, and it can have a dramatic effect on the ""storyline"" of the game. You can kill them off if you choose, and they will do it to each other from time to time when the universe gets crowded. There are many of them, and more of them will keep springing up along the way, each with their own personality, back story, misguided morals, and gameplay strategies. The choices you make in game will affect their attitude toward you.It's important to understand the whole shard and immortal concept of the game because this is a big turn off for some people. Conquering a single shard is like playing an entire game from start to finish in any other strategy title, something that can take 1 to 12 hours, depending on the map size. Then you move on to the next shard where all your heroes are level 1 again, and all your phat loot is gone, and your castle has no upgrades again. While 95% of your time will be spent battling on shards, the overall story arc and meaningful strategic decisions will happen outside of them. This is what makes the game feel like it has nearly infinite possibilities and replay value for me, but I've heard others comment that moving from shard to shard feels punishing as you have to keep ""starting over"". You definitely need to decide which camp you fall in.The pace of the game is much slower and more nuanced than similar titles. You will be faced with MANY decisions in the game, and their impact is rarely immediate. These will come in the form of random events and encounters, where you will be making moral or monetary choices, which buildings you build will open other building possibilities while closing a bunch of others, and the troops you hire will have their own alignments and synergies. In a game like Heroes of Might and Magic, the outcome of the game might be decided on turn 9, by the guy who built his capital first, or captured the ultimate artifact, and the rest is just cleanup. In Eador, you build momentum. You pay 50 gold for +2 gold a turn, because in 30 turns, you're going to be glad you did. Your strategy is the culmination of all your decisions and how effectively you can align them with a particular end goal. Not to say that nothing significant happens, because it does, but for the most part you're playing from a macroeconomic perspective. This also frustrates some players because it can be hard to tell whether you are doing well, and there are so many choices to make without any clear indicator of what your priorities should be. It also doesn't help that the AI can be pretty brutal at times, so right when you are feeling way out of your element, someone is going to come along and crush you very unceremoniously, leaving you feeling pretty sour. I assure you that after a few shards, you will know what you are doing, and why you got crushed, and all that confusion and frustration will turn into excitement and possibilities.Heroes and troops are the core of shard conquering, and the best ones require a robust economy to support. Heroes engage in combat just like troops. They also can become very formidable relatively quickly, making lower level troops more like obstacles in a battle between heroes. There are 5 ranks of troops, and it takes a lot of time and resources to obtain higher ranks. Consequently, the combat effectiveness between the ranks is very significant. A dragon, hydra, or phoenix would be a rank 5 unit. These are very powerful, and could easily clean up an entire army low rank troops like swordsmen or clerics. This huge disparity of power is another frequent complaint. Just know that while each troop will have his moment of glory, and play a pivotal role in your advancement, most of them are unlikely to be useful beyond that point in the shard.The game has a ton of content. After 300 hours, I don't even have half of the achievements, and I'm constantly finding things I've never seen before. In combination with the stunning amount of replay value, this makes for a game that manages to stay fresh.My only complaints are AI turn times in large maps with many opponents during the late game can be long. Patches have made it better, but it's still irritating sometimes.It's had a history of bugs. The last patch introduced a pointer error that made it unplayable for me, but a reinstall seems to have alleviated it completely.			"

												I would recommend this game if you play solo.The game depth is amazing and it's really addictive.There is just a major flaw... don't play multiplayer or between humans only. AI confrontation always leads to crashes and since you can't save otherwise than at end of the turn in multi, you have to reload before the crash and crash happens again and the save is lost...Good game ideas but really really badly coded. Their is still so much bugs 2 years after the release it's indecent.Eador is the exact definition of genial ideas smashed by incompetent developpers.			"

												Eador is a fantasy strategy game with a lot of depth and enormous amount of playtime value.  The gameplay takes place on three levels: The campaign level, where you interact with the NPC overlords and decide which shard to attack and annex; the strategic level, where you explore and develop your provinces, and maneuver your armies; and the tactical, where your army faces off against another force in battle.  All three offer interesting choices and potential paths.  For instance, most of the decisions you make in the campaign level revolve around prioritising which shard to attack and conquer next.  Each one will unlock new tech and potentially offer other benefits; some are going to be harder than others terrain-wise; and of course as you encounter NPC overlords on the campaign level, they will also be attacking shards, potentially denying you tech when you want it. The strategic level-game reminded me of old-school AD&D at high levels, where players are ruling and developing territory, also of the old Heroes of Might & Magic games from 3DO.  Comparisons to HOMM3's gameplay are obvious, so I'll say that I think this is an excellent spiritual successor; for comparison, better than the later non-3DO HOMM games.The province exploration and dungeon-clearing are great fun; I especially like the sense of vastness each shard gets from the fact that every province can be explored, revealing dungeons, shops, or other locations.  On the tactical level, I also like the system where every individual unit has an XP track and gains levels, allowing for a lot of variation in strength and capability within a single unit type.  The downside to this is that a lot of tactical gameplay necessarily revolves around preserving your units so they can attain high levels; sacrificial gambits generally only make sense in a final push for shard victory.  That being said, the tactical combat is a lot of fun and definitely a worthwhile part of gameplay.My only larger criticism is that the campaign tends to get a bit repetitive, espeially in the early turns when you haven't conquered many shards and so have little tech to work with: invade a shard, defeat the local lords, annex, repeat from scratch.  But if those turns are formulaic, it's a GOOD formula, and more variation is added as you unlock more unit types to work with, to the repetition reduces over time.Highly recommended for any fan of fantasy strategy, particularly for fans of Heroes of Might & Magic or Avalon Hill's Titan.

												A very fun fantasy strategy game where you control various commanders to take different shards, which act as randomly generated maps. Each shard gives you more power, abilities, units, and buildings. You have to balance gathering shards with dealing with enemy masters who are trying to do the same thing. The game would be quite a lot more fun if it was not so buggy, which is its most biting issue.			"

You get to build different buildings in your Stronghold and the game is entirely Turn based Strategy even Combat like Civilization except you go to a separate map for combat.  You can build up your heroes so they can command more troops and cast new and different spells.  And build different buildings in your Stronghold that dictate what kind of troops you can build or what benefits you receive.			"

												I really wanted to love this game, and for the first 100 hours or so, I did. The problem I started to find was that the game was just a little too grindy. After the shine of a new concept, the novelty of the gameplay, and the fascination of the storyline wore off, I realized that I was really just playing the same battle over and over and over again. I tried to create a guide to help people with what to expect from the quest, and locations that you encounter, but it became such an undertaking that I had to tap out. If I had been enjoying the game, I would have kept going. It was during the creation of the guide that I realized that the combat map was the problem. You just use the same strategy over and over, as your play style preference doesn't give you a lot of options. All that said, I did get a ton of enjoyment out of the game. It was well worth the money I spent. I just wish that the game had more to offer, and didn't feel so much like doing the same thing over and over. I do recommend the game, and I hope you get at least a hundred hours out of it, at least. I can see myself playing this one again, because there is a lot of fun in it.			"

												Super addictive (and comfy) turn-based stategy/RPG with nice graphics (if you don't mind lack of anti-aliasing), deep gameplay, interesting lore and plenty of content (and, unfortunately, as for version 1.6.3 still full of minor technical issues, though tech support is very responsive). I recommend this game only to enduring people.			"

												Bought this game ages ago (I believe the price tag was a bit higher).  It probably wasn't worth it then, but it is now for sure.  They've really worked the kinks out and added a couple things that were desperately needed.  Hopefully they'll take what they've learned from their past two games and create a third game that really knocks it out of the park.Say what you will, but at least there's an assload of content.  You can play for a hundred hours and not finish the main campaign.  The story is good, your choices matter, all in all I think it's a good game.8/10			"

												I keep going back to this game hoping to get into it more, but it's just so slow. By the time I can finally build tier 3 buildings that I won from previous shards, I've done it so much that it's like pulling teeth (each stage resets your heroes and buildings unless you pay energy to keep them, which is slow gathering).The gameplay and concept and everything is good, it's just that each stage is enough of a hassle to win (more and more so) that I don't want to do it 100 more times.And I really hate it when the AI invades my world! No rewards. I usually kill them for doing so, but one of the enemies that attacks has some force field that prevents you from killing him. I'm sure there is a way to remove it, but I hate being attacked - it adds to my 100s of shard battle grinds.If you want to go grind, I'd recommend a F2P MMO or such.			"

												The game has too many issues to play. I have a high end system, but I constantly get errors during gameplay that ruin the experience. Currently it is almost unplayable. Even when the game does work, it tends to get tedious. Combat is the same over and over, worlds are relatively the same, and the fun wears off quickly. They have added a lot of ""cool"" features in updates, but still haven't fixed the basic problems. I do not recommend buying it in its current state.			"

Grind, grind, grind and oh more grind why not.  It has some neat aspects but they lose their shine quickly when you spend hours upon hours winning just to have to do it all again and again. In the games defense I think they updated it and that helped a little. Still do yourself a favor and grab something else to play that wont just eat your life away with little to no rewards.			"

												This game has become a solid entry into the ""4x"" genre at this point. You conquer the Eador world shard by shard. Each shard you conquer allows you to build a little bit better buildings.  The combat is turn based and is done very well. The variety of monsters, creatures you will face is also very nice. I am a little over 16 hours into the game and I am on my 4th shard and to be honest it is getting a bit repetetive at this point. There is no hero carry over from shard to shard so after you conquer a shard you then recruit a new hero for the next. I think this is where the game falls a bit. You spend hours working through a shard, building your main provicence and adding a couple of smaller buildings to the conquered provinces all the while leveling up your hero. This is honestly quite a bit of work and takes grinding to beat the shard. However once you beat the shard , you lose all your progress and your hero. You essentially start the next shard at ground zero. Albeit you have access to a little bit better buildings but you do the same thing again. Start your hero at 0 and work on beating that shard. This is a fun game and at this point of its life plays solid- however I do not see myself logging 60 hours due to the repeat process on each shard. Things I think would make this game more enjoyable for longer play:Carry over your hero and make the next shard a level harder. This way you feel you are building towards something as you play through. Right now on shard 4 I stopped because I have a level 0 Warrior and he just croaked on 3 imps with 4 barbarians with him. It is frustrating considering on shard 3 I grinded my Mage to a great level and was enjoying the game. Then .... he is gone once the shard is defeated.Reduce the amount of searching in each province. To get to 100% per province takes quite a bit of time and is very repetetive. I find myself at this point in the game rolling my eyes when I hit nothing encountered 3x in a row and it becomes a click fest to see what you will find.Add more heroes if you plan on keeping the new hero per shard. They are quite generic and there is no real customization you can do to make the new hero on the next shard feel different. Right now you only have 4 to choose. I have already used all 4 and I am on my 4th shard. From what I read this game can reach 20+ shards per playthrough.The good :Pretty game. Graphics are solid.Combat is quite fun. I do like the movement points and I do like the challenge as the fights are not easy.The variety of monsters,creatures encountered is very large. Once you get the hang of city building with the wheel its pretty slick. I found myself realy enjoying the building aspect.All in all .. this a solid 4x entry ....however if you are like me and enjoy customization of your characters and buidling your characters over the course of the game you will find this quite repetetive and almost a chore when you hit the next shard. (notice my frequest use of the word repetetive)I would give it 7/10 based on solid gameplay, graphics,combat but it falls a bit due to lack of hero diversity, growth, and customization. "

												Somehow this game got me. It has an easy learning curve which (after some reloading of saved games) is pretty easy to get the hang of. The game also doesn't rely too much on single unit tactics. I've only played the single player portion of the game but at 53 hours in there is still no end in sight. Simply put... I love it. It is challenging enough to keep playing over and over yet not frustrating. Can't wait to play the free DLC.			"

												Ok, an small analysis on Eador:I think this is a great game, played hundreds of hours and still had things surprising me (tried to be the bad guy, and if you let a lot of daemon portals open you will lose the game, as your world will be cast in chaos...)The strategic deep is quite big, and can be a hell to win it on higer difficult levels.Good thing on the game:- Deep strategy- Good history- Keep surprising you- Different ways to win, different scenarios which force you to try newer strategiesBad things on the game:- Sometimes you will have to use a lot of time to win over a shard (longer it takes to me was 16 hours), this mekes you thing you are advancing very slowly- Thtas all, i like very much ^^			"

												An amazing Hex Based strategy game. It feels like an interesting mix of an RPG with hero units and tactical units, and this idea that there is this much larger struggle that you cannot intitally see. The game world looks great for what it is, and the enemies and units are all varied and well thought out. The game runs smoothly, the flow and pace of the game keeps you moving forwards without to much pause. The difficulty settings can keep even the most hardcore gamers entertained, providing a true challenge for those who think they can simply stomp through the game at their leisure. This game gives you so many ways to play it, and every way you can play it feels satisfying as hell.It's one of those games you literally have to pick up to experience it, as it can't truly be full explained. One of those mixxed bags of  a psuedo 4x strategy, but not quite that deep, with elements of other games like Heroes of Might and Magic, among older games from the early PC floppy days and Amiga era.If you like a more straight forwards approach to a psuedo 4x strategy game this would be it. They line it up and simplify it nicely, but keep all the complicated bits in if you want to play around with them and dig deeper. It's a must have for anyone that likes hero style tactics roleplaying gameplay.			"

												I liked this game, though the campaign is RIDICULOUSLY long if you were going to complete it.  If you like strategy games this can certiainly fit the bill and though the learning curve is rather steep, once you get the hang of it, the gameplay is pretty cool.  I reccomend playing a few levels of the campaign and then trying your hand at the instant games where everything is unlocked, that way you have a grasp of the basics and are not overwhelmed with the number of choices in terms of buildings.

												a good game for those who wanted turn based strategy,management builder,alignment scenario depending on your game play , the units you use levels up individually so even a tier1 unit can beat a tier2 w/ sufficient levels. how you rule your world will be up to you. if you wanted to be a tyrant lord who will not hesitate to transform your own subjects to resources. or a paladin who will bring devine punishment , eternal crusade and unreasonable hatered to anyone who sides with the darkness. or a little goodie two shoes who will rule them all is up to you. how you protect your low tier units to be too highly leveled and awarded w/ multiple medals to match high tier units is up to you. strategy is very important. a good game that is easy to learn yet hard to masterDownsides:the daw back for this game is that it takes neary a lot of time and i mean Hundreds of hours to finish and in my case im still probably in the half or close to half of the gamethe bugs are crawling and some updates can fix some of the bugs but not all. cleary to a point making the game unplayable and rendering a savefile useless. currently i can say im still waiting for major fixes for the game so that i can probably play this w/ smooth sailing.if you can overcome and have a LOT of patience for these downsides i can say grab this game if on sale. its a good game w/ good concepts its just that bugs crawl and used to be A LOT.

												I originally bought the first Eador game - Genesis. This is basically a remake with improved graphics. And with this I am perfectly okay because the graphics were the only thing that needed some correction - the rest is perfectly awesome as it is. An Age of Wonders / HoMM sort-of-clone, Eador uses the very cool concept of you being a God conquering the 'shards' that make up the world to send you in multiple mission on relatively small maps as you try to make your way towards total domination. The game is a mix of strategy with some resource management (very basic stuff, really), RPG with growing heroes, items, and spells, and tactical turn-based battles on hexagonal grids, in the best Warhammer tradition. If you like this genre, it's good fun - and in this version, it now is good fun with very awesome looks.			"

												This is a hidden gem. After the patch few weeks ago I'm back to this game and it sucked all my free time, even the one I don't have it (meaning nights without sleep). Don't get discouraged with minor bugs, this game is very deep fantasy turn-based strategy. I've bought this on sale in local ""Ladybug"" supermarket, and this was my first game on Steam, and thanks to it I discovered the whole Steam world. My journey with the game was a bit rocky, as at the beginning I ware really astonished by this game (that was like 3 years ago). I'm a turn-based strategy fun and I've played all earlier HoM&M games so I fell like in home. This game is  much different to the HoM&M series, but that is an advantage in this game and the climate is here. The most strong parts of this game is randomness and slow developing, and no this doesn't turn to frustration or boredom, it makes you want to discover. At first glace small shards seems simple, but once you'll be in game and you are an explorer like me, the single shard may take you weeks to conquer. The troops and hero choices seems rather small at first, but again after a while you'll see complex of development of them. And with other lords starting a war at random times and events that could eat your resources in one turn (of course it can double them as well) this keeps you busy. The game protects itself as some events have the good choice ""moving"", it means that for example that poisoning monsters may be a good idea at some time, but sometimes you'll accidentally poison your city, and there are far more things like that. Also the game ""locks"" a couple of turns so saving/load usually will not auto-solve problems. There is an ""astral plane"" where you decide which shard you'll take and also this is the place where story progress, I really like that point. I said that was a rocky road, as after few months of excitement (btw. since people are pointing this out,I'm playing in offline mode, currently I'm trying to keep my achievements up-to-date as proof) I got to the larger shard. When I ware slowly closing to the end the game started crushing. I tried to load earlier saves, do different things but the game ware still crushing. I've send save games, contact forums and producer but with no avail. With every patch I started the game to end in disappointment, till few weeks ago, now everything works fine, there are some errors in translations and so on, but since the producer is having now a hard time (see news section) I doubt those small things will be ever fixed.Highly recommended with warning this game will probably heavily ""eat"" your free time.

												I honestly couldnt decide if I should recommend this or not. Eador is a game with a very interesting playstyle, that has some serious problems preventing it from being great. I decided to recommend it because, despite its flaws, I am pushing a three digit playtime and still enjoying it.Eador looks like a 4X game, but I would argue that it is not. Your real focus here is on advancing your heroes. EVERYTHING COMES DOWN TO YOUR HEROES. You advance your heroes by clearing dungeons located in your provinces, which you locate with a ""province exploration"" mechanic, that is essential to advancing your economy. You will make far more money clearing these dungeons than you will with your economy, and the latter is really only there to support a few garrisons and pay for your leaders upkeep, which rises steadily.You explore your provinces to find dungeons for your heroes. You expand your empire to get more provinces, so that you can find more dungeons for your heroes. You expand your economy to support bigger armies for your heroes. You upgrade your castle so that you can get bigger bonuses for your heroes. All of your tech advances are aimed at getting better spells, and better units, and better equipment... for your heroes. The goal of this game is to be the first the get a hero to level 30 and max out its arsenal, at which point it becomes more powerful than everything else in the game except for another maxed out hero. Once you do this, you march to the enemies castles, and start taking them out.I have enjoyed this game a lot, because there are very few others quite like it, and the constant leveling is emotionally satisfying in an odd way. But, there are some real flaws. You cannot see far outside of your borders, and you cannot explore any areas you do not own, so the world feels vey small and lonely. You only ever meet your rivals when your borders physically touch, and even then you have no clear way to guage their strength. The world map will remain mostly hidden by the fog of war until you have conquered it, and even then there is no point in seeing everything. Just get to 30, find the keeps, and take them down.The first few turns are nearly impossible to get right until you have really gotten the hang of things. This game snowballs INTENSLY... messing up on turn 5 basically means that you have lost the game, but it will take you 300 turns to find that out. Eador forces you to save scum. There is no scaling of starting zones to lvl 1 armies, and the RMG can place you in a beginning position where none of your surrounding zones are capturable. Depending on your difficulty settings, the first 40 turns or so could be the hardest of the entire game, as you struggle for even the least of progress.Matches take so long (even the smallest of maps take 15 hours sometimes), that you cannot afford to simply play it by ear, you have to commit to a match for awhile. The largest sized maps can take a week to complete, if you really want to clear everything. The campaign is a joke. I spent the first 80 hours of my playtime on it, and I only barely got to the point where I could start to unlock t2 buildings. Basically, each campaign match unlocks (or permanantly locks) a single building and maybe a unit too, and gives you some small boost to your starting set-up. Given how long matches take, I could only assume an estimated 500 hour playtime for the whole thing, as there are hundreds of buildings in total. Either that or it ends way before you get everything.Pick it up if you like heavy RPG elements, that seems like what this game is focused on. But, dont expect a true 4X experience.			"

												Very good game :)Its really good combination of genres.It matteres if your economy is good, if you take care of morale both of provinces, and army. But it is not build billions of units and rush, each unit is more important, as it is cost of having it in your army. So you try to preserv each of your high lvl units so you can battle more efficiently, and easier...If you liked homm3 its this combined with civ :) and without stacking of dragons/skeletons/... get it and try it!

												I have been into Strategy games for about a year and a half now, have it RTS or Hex-Based. I love Strategy games, I love the strategy, I love that you need to care and protect your army in som RTS's or Hex-Based Strategy games. But this one falls a bit short of both of those. I love this game, do not get me wrong. I only have three hours in this game but it is still a fantastic Hex-Based for what it is. After you get your armor and weapon set down, you need no strategy to win battles. When your troops die, you don't need to worry since you can get 6,000 gold in the first hour and a half so you can constantly buy more and more troops, and you constantly get Gems which is currency for mage troops or buildings. You can have buildings in your kingdom to hire new troops or entertain your city population, etc. This is fun nonetheless, but one major bug (which is common, but not at all an annoyance) is the zero HP bug. Sometimes when an enemy reaches zero HP, they are still alive and you need to auto-attack in order to complete the battle. Other than that bug and the simplicity then comes into play with no strategy, if I had to rate this game, I'd give it a 7.5/10.

												Eador is the first strategy game I've really been able to sink my teeth into. And that's saying something, because I seem like the kind of person to enjoy strategy games...The reason for this is because the game remains paletable throughout. I think the thing that typically drives me away from strategy games a few hours in is that, once you start to amass resources and turn those resources into troops, etc., there's so much to take care of at any one time that it's too easy to lose track of anything or everything.Eador isn't like that. While you can eventually get a gigantic army, colossal empire, and a mountain of resources, the buildup to that is very slow and easy to take in. Your armies are led by heroes, which cost exponentially more for each successive one, and each hero only starts with the capacity to have three units in its army (except for one, which starts with four slots). Over time, they'll level up and be able to lead more troops.Essentially, this leads to a strategy game where the most important resource is time. Hard limits are set on just how much you can do in a single turn, so, rather than a game where the first guy to get a billion troops wins, you get a game where the guy to best optimize his time wins.

												As long as the game goes, it's ok. I like turn based games, and Eador didn't disappoint me. But on behalf of all Linux gamers, I have a problem. Steam should not call this a Linux game, yes it runs, but it is not playable. It has some really nasty graphical glitches in Wine. There was some really good moves made to port few attractive games like CivV to linux, which plays natively and not in emulator (I know Wine is not an emulator...). My point is, if you do use linux icon, at least put some notion of it being played in Wine in system requirements portion.			"

												This game, along with Eador: Genesis are a pair of turn based fantasy strategy games made by a handful of russian Devs, and it's cleary a labor of love. If you've played any classic fantasy strategy games like Heroes of Might and Magic, Disciples, or Age of Wonders, you'll feel right at home here. There's a large number of buildings to construct, units to field, all set over a massive, randomly generated campaign that gets more complex as you get further in. If you love any of the games I mentioned, this ones worth a look. One warning though: They're hard, especially Eador: Genesis, which forces you to play in ironman mode: no loading older saves when things go wrong.			"

												Imagine a HoMM game that is more deep than its predecessor, but made by a small dev that cares. A game in which you really need to watch over your provinces. Many different things (presented as stories with few choices) may happen. Those can either boost or hamper your chances of winning. There are also many possibilities when it comes to building types. Every province is like a small city and choosing the right buildings to build there may affect your income, population, events and happiness. Other than the gameplay I also find the story better than typical heroic fantasy boredom.On the negative side (to some gamers) there is a lot of learning to be done and I recommend reading a basic guide. The one in the game does not cover some of the more complex features.			"

												This game can be a bit slow, but very fun. Build however you want and create your army and your generals. You have multiple options, but can't access everything because they conflict. So you really need to decide if your going to build light or dark and that will effect which army units you can use, because they don't work together. It makes for a choice, but you can also pick up other units through mercenaries, so it's not like you're completely cut off from it either. Very fun.			"

												Similiar to Warlocks, Fallen Enchantress and good old Master of Magic, Eador is all about battling in a fantasy worlds with heroes and armies. While you spread your influence for gathering resources you shouldn't think you're the only one doing the same.As it is quite typical 4X game, there are few things that makes it work quite well - if you are about to invest some time to learn the game mechanics. That's the only drawback: construction (i.e. building up land) is more complicated, because you have capital region and ""provinces"" - and they don't develop the same way. Once you have built up buildings in your capital region you unlock more buildings for regions. And you can have only 3 buildings up on any given province, which doesn't make sense, but it forces you to prioritise. Luckily, you can tear buildings down on provinces. I wish there was a way to do the same on capital region, because you can have only 4 types of unit recruitment buildings.That restriction is horrible. At the beginning you need some first tier ""barracks"" in order to muster up your initial army to get you going anywhere. The beginning is quite rough even on lower difficulties. However, on later stages you wish you could have more variety of higher-end troops, but the cap limit won't allow you to do just that. What's even more painful, some ""garrison"" troops, which are different from standard troops, require also certain ""barracks""-types, so you need to do some research. Later on, you get hold on that, though.Tactical battles are like from Fallen Enchantress. They can be very hard at first, but when taking full advantage of the terrain and vegetation it is possible. I am finding the very beginning quite hard on 2nd lowest difficulty level, though I haven't played but a couple of campaign maps. Like in Fallen Enchantress, you equip your hero, while troops get automatically geared up. Both heroes and troops gain levels and when they do, you can choose an upgrade for the victorious one. And when the leader gets level-ups, you can occasionally have more unlocked slots for more troops.Balance on economics work quite well. Gold is scarce, but if you do spare provinces' guards you are asking for trouble. On frontiers they won't save you much against enemy troops, but fortification gives you more time to get in aid with your armies. But these fortresses cost dearly. But you still need guards and pay for their upkeep, because there are plenty of events you get randomly attacked on one of your provinces. These events vary though, and some are helpful. However, the events can occur a lot. It isn't unprecendented to have got four events on your regions at the beginning of your turn.Graphics and sounds are okayish - nothing too brilliant, but they do their job.Definitely worth picking-up on your game library if you're into Master of Magic and/or Fallen Enchantress - especially on this summer sale. 75 per cent off is not too shabby.

												Deep strategy, chess like gameplay, takes ages to get to grips with but very rewarding once you do.If your looking for a flashy game with great animations and personal custamization then... go find another 4x game because this isn't it.it's all about strategy, it's all about perfecting your early game and reaping the steam rolling rewards in the late game. It's on the deeper end of the complexity scale but unlike something like crusader kings 2, it's not initially mind boggling... for the most part. Though the building tree is extremely expansive and not very well laid out...It doesn't run very smoothly either... I've got a 780 now and it works fine, but my previous 570m on my l;aptop had some stuttering, though anything over a 760 should be very smooth. And most people have that at least, so this is just a wasted sentence i guess lol.anyway.the game has it's flaws; the campaign is excessivley long and boring. Though the writing is great I'd reccomend just free play or whatever it's called.also steam rolling... not very fun late game, it's a problem with most 4x games, it's steam rolling. Once you've bumped off the enemy commander a couple times YOU WIN.though it can be fun to maintain and manage a huge kingdom, exploring your lands etc. it's worth the price, it's worth putting a good 100-150 hours into, and it's a 4x game I'll be coming back to at some point. The ai is very good and it's heart warming to see how many different strategies can be played out in this game.			"

												Still VERY buggy as of January, 2014.There are a LOT of things that are good about this game.  That only makes it more painful however when you get to the point that it is unplayable because of crashes.  I have a nice gaming rig, but the game has progressively become less and less stable to the point where now I cannot complete even one whole turn.  In other words, it's unplayable.If you are looking to buy this, I would advise you to wait and see what the discussions say about it after the next patch comes out.  The last one was in September, so we've been waiting for a good while for some fixes.  The next patch has been said to release in January or February.  Here's hoping it helps.Until the stability is addressed, I would not recommend people buy it.			"

												A good game with very original ideas. The idea of the shards is really nice and you get new buildings and new troops every shard. Many strategies are possible during each shard and you may wanna try every kind of heroes. The story of the campain is rather original well written and nicely thought, with opponents who all have their own secrets about how they became high spirits. Also, it is rather original and pretty nice to feel like you are a high spirit immortal and fighting for shards that look like little planets in the stars. Another positive point with the idea of the shards is that you can have several strategies on them : you can rush it, you can take your time exploring every region, trying to find btw legendary weapons or extra bonuses for winning the shard. On the other hand, it is true there are bugs in this game. However, in my games, I never had any bug that warned me from playing the game (always had minor bugs that didnt affect the game). Another negative point is that you cant have bonuses for your heroes when you get a shard. You always have to do the same farming for your heroes and it is kinda repetitive.But still I strongly recommend this game .			"

												I am actually glad that I decided to go through with this game despite the bad reviews that users have been giving it. At a glance, it looks a lot like most fantasy setting 4x hexagonal grid strat rpg games, but this one is by far more punishing. As an example, the Age of Wonders series, when you make a mistake in that game it is typically a simple process to work your way back out of it, time consuming, but simple. This game is a lot less forgiving, to the point that even with all the right moves, you downright have to be cheating to get anywhere at all. In one game I had a single hero at level 2, was barely managing to stay on top of 4 hexes of land, and then a SINGLE beginner difficulty AI warrior hero comes along and stomps me. in the same amount of time the AI had somehow magically managed to have a level 5 hero, with 2 maxed abilities, and another with three points in it, which as far as I know so far, is not evne possible. So, all in all I definitely would have to give this game a 7/10, just for the sake of the mind-numbingly stupid situations I find myself in because of the balancing.			"

Also, they are updating and adding to the game all the time.However, the tutorial does drag on too much, and by the time you can build a full realm (all tiers unlocked) it kinda feels like you've already played the game for what it's worth. The story here is original, but there isn't much to keep you hooked.

The problem is I spent 40 hours on genesis, and since this is identical, it bores me much quicker than it should...

												The best way to describe Eador: Master of the Broken World is that is very much like heroes of might and magic or other hex based, turn based combat games mixed with a strategic map more alike something from the total war series.But unlike other games set in alike setting, you do not get to chose race, however in its place is a karma system and so you still deal with creatures of different alignments and it also extends to the strategic events and affects such things as random events.There are a few problems, namely the random nature of events and not knowing what causes it. I felt that it took a good while before things became clear to the players as to what might trigger within certain terrain, by certain races and for what reasons. While some might argue that it keeps things fresh and you on your toes at all times, I found it at least as much frustrating to be punished for things I couldn't possibly predict.Because of this, some other random elements and because of limited knowledge of unit composition and generally what a good way is to start, I would say this game has a very steep learning curve. For some this might be a strictly bad thing, while others might enjoy figuring things out.It should also be said that the more you learn, the more restricted you might feel as some choices are real not much of a choice at all, like your starting hero for example.Sometimes the games can drag on, and because the game is repetitive in its nature, due to how the campaign is played by generating a new map with a basic start for every single new world you try to take over, progression can feel slow and unrewarding between maps.But overall, it can be very tactically challenging and worthy the time of those who enjoy some management and above all this style of hex based turn based combat.

												Eador: MotBW if a solid game for sure. Gorgeous art, simple and yet fairly dynamic balanced mechanics, original aesthetic. Nothing not to like from this small time developer. Also, they are updating and adding to the game all the time.However, the tutorial does drag on too much, and by the time you can build a full realm (all tiers unlocked) it kinda feels like you've already played the game for what it's worth. The story here is original, but there isn't much to keep you hooked. Add to that buggy coop/multiplayer and after 40 or so hours, I put this on back on the proverbial shelf.If your really like 4x RPG's, don't miss this one!			"

												Eador shipped out with plenty of bugs and very little new content compared to the other Eador game... In fact it was just graphics and some campaign mechanics that were updated... So... for a turn based strategy/RPG for 20bucks that comes out of the soviet union, this is pretty good. The problem is I spent 40 hours on genesis, and since this is identical, it bores me much quicker than it should... Overall, if you are a fan of these turn based strategy games, this is a steal for the price it has on... Comparable to Fallen Enchantress, but way cheaper...			"

												The best way to describe Eador: Master of the Broken World is that is very much like heroes of might and magic or other hex based, turn based combat games mixed with a strategic map more alike something from the total war series.But unlike other games set in alike setting, you do not get to chose race, however in its place is a karma system and so you still deal with creatures of different alignments and it also extends to the strategic events and affects such things as random events.There are a few problems, namely the random nature of events and not knowing what causes it. I felt that it took a good while before things became clear to the players as to what might trigger within certain terrain, by certain races and for what reasons. While some might argue that it keeps things fresh and you on your toes at all times, I found it at least as much frustrating to be punished for things I couldn't possibly predict.Because of this, some other random elements and because of limited knowledge of unit composition and generally what a good way is to start, I would say this game has a very steep learning curve. For some this might be a strictly bad thing, while others might enjoy figuring things out.It should also be said that the more you learn, the more restricted you might feel as some choices are real not much of a choice at all, like your starting hero for example.Sometimes the games can drag on, and because the game is repetitive in its nature, due to how the campaign is played by generating a new map with a basic start for every single new world you try to take over, progression can feel slow and unrewarding between maps.But overall, it can be very tactically challenging and worthy the time of those who enjoy some management and above all this style of hex based turn based combat.

												Awesome game that so far keeps me coming back for more. Its one of those games where I keep thinking...""Just one more turn, then I'll go to bed"". Choose from 4 classes for your first hero/general and then build up armies to follow him around capturing provinces and hunting for treasure as you go. As your resources grow, recruit more heros to lead other armies. Its got a bit of everything - loot, RPG character progression, a story (which I havent really kept up with as I'm fairly early in),  exploration, base building and army customisation.For people that remember games like Gladius, this is about as close as it gets but with more frills. Highly recommended and was a complete steal in the flash sale. My only gripe is that completing some of the quests for the foreign races that you encounter in order to make them allies are sometimes near impossible to complete. Some more directions in game as to where to go to complete the quest would be good, instead of just ""Find this item"" (which could be anywhere amongst the dozens of map hexes, and in turn anywhere within the hex!).I had originally got Heroes of Might and Magic which was also on sale, but this is so far infinitely better in my opinion.

												Eador: Masters of the Broken World is an enjoyable game inspired by the Heroes of Might and Magic series and the King's Bounty series.  However it does stumble a bit initially.  Players who don't fully understand the game are likely to stumble at the start of games after the tutorial if they play on difficulties other than the easiest.  This is compounded by the tutorial not doing a good job of explaining how to start each match and the game forgetting to tell players some of the ways of earning experience, like exploring.  The best way to learn this game is to approach it like something out of the 90's and go read the manual.  You should also make sure to turn up the battle speed significantly to make sure that it doesn't have horrible pacing in fights.  Eador also has bugs that range from minor nuisances to crashes that force you to restart your computer.  For me, Eador froze twice in my first four hours of gameplay and made my computer lock up twice more by the time I hit twenty hours.  Assuming they are willing to risk the bugs in this game, people who enjoyed the Heroes of Might and Magic series, the King's Bounty series, or other similar games will enjoy Eador also although it generally implements each element of its gameplay in a more average manner than another similar game although it balances this out by having more elements to its gameplay than other similar games.

												Pros:- Lengthy campaign- Well designed and flexible turn-based combat system- Random event/world generation- Overflowing with elements from other genres to add depth- Multiple playstyles can be effective- Well implemented auto-save systemCons:- Campaign is a bit too lengthy due to repetition- Still riddled with bugs that can be game breakers- No voice audio, entirely text-driven plot- Erratic AI behaviour and levellingUltimately if you are a fan of the turn-based strategy genre then you probably won’t want to miss out. But until Snowbird either adds in a whole new raft of features (multiplayer options, alternate ways to conquer shards) then for the sake of pretty graphics it’s hard to imagine why you would pay upwards of £20 for an identical remake of a game that is still available for £2 - especially in a genre where graphics are less than a secondary concern.  The amount of bugs and crashes I experienced as well as the constant repetitiveness makes this a hard game to recommend but at the same time I have enjoyed the game and how exceptionally well this game is put together beneath the surface.  Juggling multiple management systems and tieing them to karma, story and making the whole experience fluid is not something to dismiss on a whim, however that already appeared to be present in the original game, so the question remains: what value has Snowbird Games really brought to Eador?  That is a question I struggle to answer, even after 98 hours.A (now) solid turn based strategy game that stands shoulder to shoulder with many others but perhaps not quite matching the immersion that the Heroes of Might and Magic series provided.  What it lacks in story and frills it more than makes up for with in depth mechanics and gameplay however it is difficult to see anyone who is pressed for time or ambivalent about this genre sticking with Eador beyond the first few hours - especially when the tutorial alone took me 6 hours because I hadn’t realised there was no need to explore everywhere to 100%!  It’s a shame as the game really comes alive after the first few hours of invading a shard when you get the tier 3 and 4 creatures involved to take on the larger encounters in the game.7/10 "

												A most excellent game. Eador starts out slowly, and has a tutorial that may frusterate a long time TBS game player, but once it hits its stride you start to feel like the God of a New World (death note quote 0.0) The game plays in a similar manner to Age of Wonders, with heroes and units doing turn based battles, but sets itself apart with its Province and shard systems. A shard is one of the pieces of the titular broken world, which when conquered joins itself to your fledgling domain and give you advantages to use in further conquest. Each shard is made up of a number of provinces, each with its own denizens, dungeons, and enemies. The meat of the game lies in the empire building aspect. Your heroes will spend a lot of time exploring the frontiers of you empire, pushing back the wilderness and revealing lost ruins, dens of evil, and the occasional friendly group. Quests and events will come every now and then, leaving you to decide how you want to rule your empire. The focus can lead to a forgetable shard endgame, as in my experience by the time the AI lords began to move against me I had heroes who could singlehandadly slaughter their armies, but I have only done one Shard so far. There does appear to be a diplomacy function, both on the shard and greater level, as well as a greater threat against the universe in a nebulous chaos, but I haven't gotten there yet. TL:DR Great fantasy TBS Game, lots of depth, some balance issues. 8/10			"

												I give it a 6.  I got about 15 hours out of it before I got bored.  It's a great concept and very ambitious.  The game gets bogged down in tedious combat, unbalanced units, and dumb AI.  Normal units require too much baby sitting to really level, but that's okay because high level heros dominate the field single-handed.  The strategic game lacks too: You're too busy conquering new areas (or re-conquering) to really explore or do quests except as side effect.  The meta-strategic is also neat, but you're so rarely there that it's more an aside than core gameplay.Really, I enjoyed what they were trying to do here, but I'd rather go play something a little more complex, such as Elven Legacy.

												The game play itself is addicting and even beyond the ""take over the world"" goal, you can set up a huge number of secondary goals. Certain locations will give you tasks to complete for rewards, you can aim to complete item sets for your character, aim to fully explore all of your territory (that takes awhile, by the way) and much more.The campaign is structured in a way that each map you win gives you access to a few additional structures when playing the next map.  However, you do start over from scratch on each map.  I enjoy the restart from scratch part of the game, but if that's not your thing, you might find that aspect of the game frustrating.I have not encountered any of the game breaking bugs that are out there, and hopefully the most recent patch has resolved them.

												**WARNING** - This is NOT for those of you that want to mindlessly click and play and have instant gratification for little or no work. Go play Great Big War Game for that. This game simply put is the best Turn Based Strategy title to come down the pike since Civ 5. It is hard, yes. Even on easy it is difficult to manage and balance all the things you need to manage and balance in these type games (Economy, happiness, army upkeep etc). There IS a way to accomplish it but it takes smarts and determination. The rewards are well worth he work. The Pros and Cons are as follows :PROS :1.) Easy to learn interface. If you cant master this interface in the first 10 minutes then you need to exit the game and delete it because you will be lost like a fart in a whirlwind. Go play solitare as it is more your speed.2.) Tutorial brings you up to speed. Easy to learn, hard to master 3.) Very challenging. This is not a simple fast gratification game. Hard core TBS gamers only.4.) The Risk vs Reward system is well balanced unlike other games. 5.) A Deep, rich game that has untold hours of replayability in it.Cons :1.) Poorly designed building tech tree. It has some good elements to it BUT the design of it makes it very difficult to know what to build to get the unit, spells, items you want. Could have been much better.2.) The AI tends to take too long in making its moves on the overall map and in combat .... but at least in combat you can move your combat speed to max and that fixes the problem.3.) The game sometimes will hang in combat and get stuck in the hourglass mode ... but you can hit ESC and then click ""Quick Combat"" and it will simulate the results for you ending the battle. They should patch that problem soon I hope. Well that about sums it up. If you are a hardcore TBS gamer ... this is for you .... if you are a casual TBS gamer ... move along .... back to RISK for you :)			"

												Fun for a while but unless you're willing to put in a serious amount of time (and I'm talking 100 hours plus here) and LOVE strategy games where you get dropped back to the start and have to build from scratch every level: don't bother. If you can stand a fair bit of repetition and are looking for a huge time sink then this is the game for you.Oh and they seem to reset your achievements every so often as well.			"

												While not a giant like AoW or the early Homm Series this game holds its own as a grand strategic game with some development and roleplaying aspects. It has a fairly steep learning curve so be prepared for some level of frustration unless you procede carefully. The economics determine your success or failure so be sure to think before buying armies willynilly. Scout/Warrior are best for starting out.Fair warning: this game will eat up your time if you attempt the campaign mode. And there is a significant chance that there will be game killing errors. I still recommend it but with the caveat that you are buying a deeply flawed and yet beautifully implemented long time scale game.			"

It's a bit more difficult to learn than your average game and  you can expect to get beaten down a bit in the beginning, but once you pickup on the strategy - it is very fun.It's a cheap little indie game with a unique take on a strategy rpg.

												I remember this as Eador : Genesis but this version updates the game with more content and HD graphics. Anyone who loves their TB Strategy games should own this - It's deep, tough and has tons of content and is difficult to describe beyond comparisons with HoMM series, however this indie game definately adds something new to the genre, not least its high level of challenge and superb tactical battle system, random events, a wealth of world locations to explore and fortress management options to get your head around. You can easily lose 200+ hrs to this game, so be warned!			"

												If you're a fan of turn based hexagones tactical battles this is a must have.I came in hoping a game like Heroes of Might and Magic, but I really got surprised with the tools, storyline and options you're able to explore.This game will bring you to a medieval world full of disputes for power and glory; different races trying to survive and expand their lands, wealth and people.Besides that, you're not a mere mortal king or lord, but you're above them all, trying to reach a higher purpose - which you will be able to chose through your fate and will.Conquering world pieces to build your own or eliminating all lives around, you can do whatever you want in your path.So I basically recommend this game because:- Really awesome tactical turn based battles with unique features and options, which you need to explore all resources and be a strategist (depending on game difficulty);- Interesting concepts evolving into a storyline which you can mold a world depeding on your alingment and convenience, which makes a nice roleplaying;- Interesting 3D character models (action) and pictures (events) mix;- Very explicative tutorial that accompanies you throughout the game, appearing when given situation occurs;- Freedom.Things I consider negative, but I hope they'll fix in future patches, mostly bugs:- Crashes when specific situations occur (casting a particular spell or something like that);- Game forum with restrictions and difficulties in accessing.

												If you enjoy the old school Heroes of Might and Magic you'll like this game. It takes out some of the more frustrating resource management by reducing the types of resources from 6 to 2. Heroes feel a little underpowered in this game, but the four classes are pretty well balanced. The campaign mode adds a nice level of strategy. While each shard you conquer feels like its own world, and is a brief heroes of Might and Magic style game unto itself, the strategic brilliance is in how they link each conquest. As you conquer shards you obtain benefits and unlock technology that you can use in later conquests...for a price. The writing could use some polish, and it's difficult to pin down exactly, but it feels at times as though maybe a less than thorough job was done translating the game from another language. The real gold of this game is in its expanse. It is basically impossible to completely explore every shard, or at least would take a very long time, and the game does a nice job of providing you with new and different encounters. Do I want to try and forge an alliance with the elves on this shard or the halflings? Is it worth the time or should I just slaughter them all and take their lands? Should my hero spend his time hunting down that dragon that's plagueing my kingdom or should he pillage my enemy's domain? It's also nice to be confronted with actually insurmountable obstacles from time to time. No I can't explore this laborynth and kill it's minotaur at level one, but just because I can't face it, doesn't mean I can't see it. So many games have the ""you'll get there when you're ready"" mentality and it negatively affects suspension of disbelief. The story is fairly generic fantasy, but Astral politics can be fun, and it's nice that the way you treat your subjects and those around you has a concrete effect on the way they interact with you. That being said, being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ isn't all bad like it is in some games. Some races respect bloodthirst and power. As a do-gooder, I constantly had my orc provinces in rebellion because they view me as oppressive and weak. Certain Astral entities will ally with you out of fear or respect for power rather than just sycophantic loyalty to kindness.All in all I very much enjoy this game. Is it Shakespeare? No, but it certainly passes the time.			"

												This is clearly one of the most addicting games I've ever played. A mix between Battle for Wesnoth, Heroes of Might and Magic and Total War (referring only to the Province system which is more Total Wari-ish than Europa Universalis) which will sink you deep. Challenging and truly fun to learn while playing, even though sometimes one might think it's a little bit complicated. Turn strategy games fans should be delighted.			"

												Really love this game. Not too difficult and not too easy, just right. This is a TBS type of game. The world consists of shards, which you have to conquer. Every shard consist of a number of provinces. Your hero (as usual you can have a number of them) has to conquer the provinces. Once a province is conquered you can explore it (find treasure, etc. usually leading to a fight or negotiation) pleasing the local population make money from them build mining facilities, mills etc. There are many kind of buildings to build and paths to choose. In between, events take place that you must resolve in some way. For instance there is some wizard that resurrects some death people and you have to decide whether to fight the wizard, pay it off or ignore it (just making this one up as an example).Fights bring you to a hexagonal field which is pretty much standard across TBS type of games and you have to fight the enemy with the army you have (pretty much like you have it in other TBS games like king's bounty).Loads of fun and highly recommended.

												I played this a lot, there are many good ideas, the game is very interesting and addictive.However I will not recomend this. There are quite a lot of game breaking bugs. For example if the oposing units have the ""atack and move""traints, they will simply  exterminate your army. This is an easy bug to find and fix, I found this in my game 6 months ago, and is still there . And there are other bugs:Your hero will randomly get stuck while moving from province to province, or it will automaticly fight an invisible army and die. This kills your hero, you need to load a previos save and after 10-20  times you simply have enoght. This game has many good ideeas, I like the mecanichs but with all this bugs ( and no fixing in sight), I can not recomend it.Edit. After a long time, finally the developer release a patch for many bugs, including the ones I mention above. Plus as a apology for the extremly long time, they release a free DLC. After playing for 7 hours I did not found any major bugs.The game is not perfect, it has some balancing issues, but it is addictive and quite interesting.			"

												I've played Eador for some hours and nearly two days non-stop. It is a promising game, really a masterpiece of a crossover between Civilization and Heroes of Might and Magic, the battles are really difficult but still fair, with the exception of 1-2 enemy units. It is a lot of fun for ppl who like to manage a lot, but still enjoy a nice battle every now and then.The main flaw why I wouldnt recommend this game is, because on the technical side it's a mess. Errors prompting up every 5-30 minutes, most of them just stop the game from running, the minimum specs are a lie and the loading times are unbelievably long. You could say that in a playtime of 8hours you effectively have played 3-4.Still I would recommend Eador for being one of those games that really fascinate you, if you give it the chance and maybe have a good PC, the game is still a work in progress so maybe it will get better in time.

												(This review is from my opinion and has doesn't cover any issues the game others claim it may have.)Well worth the money and time invested. It's a game that keeps you coming back so long as you're not a casual player. Has the hardest campaign I've ever played by far and I'm still playing on beginner without finishing or starting a new campaign for the whole time I've actually spent playing the game (over 190hrs). But it's been time well spent. The style of the artwork, the units, the models, the abilities and depth just work sooo well together.  I ACTUALLY feel like I'm in control of a kingdom while I'm playing. My choices have meaning and consequence/benefits. Although thats obvious when you play some games. I feel if I had to choose between games like ROME total war, Age of wonders series, Civ 5 etc, all those turn-based conquest stratagy games, I'd rather uninstall the rest than stop playing this one. But thats just my opinion.The game in full could be taken furthur if the developers spent the same amount of time they spent making the game to make it go ever furthur. More intereactions, more interesting situations your kingdom might face, THINGS like shards clashing in the middle of conquering one shard then 2 more enemy kingdoms rock up that were originally clashing on that shard to begin with now I have to conquer both with more mayhem to add to the mix. The forging of alliances out of shards with other demi-gods, THE LIST is endless.For what it is though it's amazing and a true inspiration towards what fantasy games should be/feel/look like. Not to mention the idea of shards and it's turn based stratagy while conquering territories. Well done! ^_^p.s to myself: This review after reading does not serve the game justice, I feel its more than what I described by far but I couldn't find the words :(			"

												I had a hard time deciding wether to recommend this game or not given the current flaws it has.Watch a few youtube videos to understand the mechanics and know that this is game about trial and error. The battle prediction is broken, dont trust it ... there are some predicted ""very easy"" encounters which in my oppinion cant be won. A battle against 4 medusas without a ranged hero is a loss regardless of predictions.The above brings me to the next obvious point; inbalance. The devs simply did not take their time to implement this propperly, some creatures are simply too powerfull for early game and you have to know this prior to engaging ... unless you dont mind reloading a lot.Early positioning and ressources can also be an issue, but in my oppinion not as vital as the two flaws mentioned above.PS: None of the issues were ever fixed, combat prediction is herrendous and AI cheats. Changed from positive to negative due to that reason.			"

												Incredibly deep 4x game. Steep learning curve and a bit buggy but still well worth the price of admission. Gameplay does get a bit repetitive but the sheer number of units, buildings and various strategies you can employ, in addition to the unique challenges presented by each shard ensures every shard skirmish feels unique from each other.It's so fun leveling up your heroes, buidling armies, developing provinces, learning magic, buying items, exploring, casting rituals, hiring guards, conquering provinces, adventuring...this game really scratches an itch. Not for the faint of heart or someone seeking a casual game but definitely a gamer's game. Only negative is it's a slow game and takes many, many hours to play....so enter if you dare!			"

												It's got a bit of a stiff learning curve and the tutorial is actually kind of weird / buggy. I'm a fan of Civ / Master of magic type games and that's what this is. Dozens of ""shards"" each being a unique world ruled by one or more local lords and possibly a higher being (similar to you). You can use diplomatic relations with the higher beings or just fight everything, be a kind rule and loved or a tyrant and feared. Take things be force and pillage or grow and build. Every shard you claim unlocks new spells, troops and items so it's motivation to go for the hard ones. All in all a really fun game with a good auto save, buggy at times but auto save bails you out and you really open it up / start to enjoy a couple shards in so stick with it / power past the tutorial and the 1st demo shard if you can and you'll be rewarded with a lovely game.

												I will update the review as I play more through the game.First thing: Eador: MoBW is hard, and immensely time consuming, if you are not a big fan of 4x and Turn-Based Strategy you'll hate this game, if you're not a fan of this genre already Eador will not transform you onto one. I have more than one hundred and twenty hours of gameplay and was only able to conquer ten shards, nevertheless know that to finish the game you need twenty five. This means approximately twelve hours per shard, therefore I am talking about three hundred hours of campaign. And I am only playing on the third hardest difficulty. I am sure that in the hardest one I would not be able to finish the game. This characteristic force you to use the best strategy you can think in order to do absolutely anything. Eador is a low-number-status game, so each single positive thing you can figure out will make a enormous difference, the same applies to negative ones. The terrain on the battle map is extremely important, the single ""1+ defence"" a hill give can make the difference between everything. Personally to me this is a positive point if I liked easy and casual things I would study art or some other meaningless area, not physics.There is one thing that almost kill this game, the sense of progression. But the Eador's developers are one the the best on Steam, and even after two years they are trying to fix this problem through patches. It worked on certain aspect but the problem persists. After each shard you conquer (after ten hours) you goes back to the astral plane and have to start every thing all over again, this creates the feel that all your effort was in vain. Now with the new patch you can transfer your hero and equipment to your next shard, so you can progressively construct your hero etc, creating the feeling that your efforts are really meaning something, that your efforts are constructing something. Nevertheless this costs astral energy, and every thing is so expensive that you will only be able to continue with your weakest and meaningless hero, probably the level 6 Commander that in the end of the shard's battle you create just for province exploration.

A lot of things to learn and much more random events to effect of the game playing session. All this range of variety units, events, building options there is no chance to play the same game twice.

												The last time I extensively played Eador was back in summer of 2013, outside of Steam. The game was quite new. It had tons of bugs but it was mostly playable. However it was no secret it was unfinished and many important mechanics did not work. But the small team of developers really deserve a load of respect because now a year and dozends of patches later - after many fans may have given up their hope on Eador and even taunted the creators ""Masters of the Broken Game"" on their official support forums - the game is great. My comeback to the game today was worth and to honor the good work on the game the devs put into it I decided to buy it on Steam. I never thought they could recover this game and even more important giving the UI a needed refresh. By today the game is like it should have been at release - it is fun and can be challenging. There are still some drawbacks: it can be confusing to learn how to conquer the shards and how the whole works.The AI may be still better. The monsters, items and events you face on the shards are very repetitive. Not to start talking about the music.  Apart from that I would give Eador a good 6 of 10 rating. If you have some time kill and you love to combine strategy with roleplay elements  it is definitely worth the few bucks it costs! In strategic aspects how creatures are fighting each other it reminds me a bit of Magic the Gathering. Bad luck for Windows 8 users this game needs .NET Framework 3.5 to be installed to work properly.I rate the game with a 7/10.1 point less for the repetitive music and missions1 point less for the remaining bugs (mostly AI) and crashes1 point less for the fact you have to delete a preexisting profile and start a new campaign to unlock steam achievements, also to get access to the DLC. if you played Eador before you got it on Steam and like to play on like me, it will be troublesome.

												A fun turn based strategy with a fantastical aesthetic.  I've never played the Might and Magic games so I don't know how it compares to those.  I enjoy the art style and the story is pretty neat.  The universe is shards of land floating around a sea of space, similar to D&D's lore of the Astral Sea.  Combat is mostly good, with a few annoyances(can only move before you attack, but not after).  All in all I enjoy the game for what it is, but I think I'd still prefer a different TBS.			"

												Was kinda leary about this title as the game story seemed a bit odd (shards of a world floating aimlessly in space?  Really?)  I recieved it in a 5 dollar bundle deal.  Playing through the tutorial seamed a bit clunky and glitchy, but that was just the tutorial.  After the first few days of playing (countless hours of playing) , wow, I really like this game.I will use an analogy from the game story to describe the game.  Its like a gem broken into pieces floating aimlessly, spend some time collecting and putting them together, well, its a gem to behold (thus far).Its not your typical pick a race, class, here are your abilities, now get to it game.  The shards you attempt to conquer, will add to your abilities and somewhat define and refiine your strategy.  The game has been a pleasant journey of discovery as it doesnt come with a manual (although you can find the manual through google translate if you need game info).  Shards of different gametypes, pieced together (ex: HoMM, Masters of Magic, Warlords, etc) and its friggen extensive.  I am over 40 hours in and not even halfway through.   Altogether, it works for me and if you like these kind of games, you should find this a unique experience as well.Did I mention the game is huge?  Some shard battles I take time to do some quest, others I have been forced to finish fast as the enemy gives me difficulties (I started playing on skilled mode).  I have heard complaint that the game gets redundant or repetative.  What game do you enjoy playing that doesnt get repetative?  The game solves this with some auto functionality.  You can just quickview the battle, or set it to auto and watch the battle play out.  Sometimes I am forced to do the manual battle as the AI doesnt do the strategy required to win.  It will say this should be easy then you lose your entire army.  The game does save every minute or so and I suggest you do some manual saves (just in case, as there is no restart scenario option).  In all its a minor annoyance in all the richness this game offers.I have seen many gripes on the forums concerning this game, I have none here.  I guess you will either love it or hate it, but dont be swayed buy the naysayer if the above mentioned gametypes gave you some joy back in the day.  Eador:  Master of the Broken World is a worthy game.Now if you will excuse me, I have some shards to conquer.			"

												A true indie gem that I highly recommend to all turn-based strategy fans, particurly those fond of Heroes of Might & Magic.This game really surprised me, with taking the essentials from Heroes of Might & Magic but then going their own way.  Eador features combat akin to HoMM, but with much better battle maps that feature actual terrain and interesting, if not simple, innate abilities of the different races.  Beyond the battles the game has an intriging take on territory control and expansion as you capture tile-based provinces with their own terrain features and special resources as well as associated choice-based random events with decent writing and fun outcomes.  Finally, the story and lore is actually quite interesting and kept me playing for a long time into the campaign.Ultimately the game suffers from a lack of unit variety (two subfactions - basically good and evil - plus a neutral third filled with different monsters) and thus battles and maps do eventually get monotonous.  But for an indie game, I was thoroughly pleased and could recommend this game to anyone expecting as much.			"

I wish i was able to choose all my heroes skills from a skill tree like in Fallen Enchantress, instead of relying on luck whenever there is a level up and i think the level capacity would be much better and well balanced if it was at 40 instead of 30. finally i really need a dificulty customizor.

Think Heroes of Might and Magic style battles but with more RPG elements.  But I can tell this is going to be a long game, with lots of story/text.  Right out of the gate there's a lot of talking and it pretty much put me to sleep.  I mean, yes it was the campaign with tutorial settings, but I found everything just moved too slowly for my liking compared to some other games.It's pretty basic, nothing really new to see at all, it's not horrible so I can't NOT recommend it, but don't expect it to blow your socks off.5.5/10			"

												The game has a large amount of rather interesting mechanics; for instance units gain new abilities as they level up and some of them change them dramatically (fairies get a dodge ability that makes it so being attacked by a higher level enemy makes them retreat unless they are cornered or out of stamina for instance). It is a pity that units are so relatively fragile you won't be seeing any of that most of the time. Heroes are relatively overpowered to everything so the game turns into leveling them up and dungeon crawling for money sidling the rest of the military and economic development that exists in game.Given the amount of bugs this game has, I doubt they'll be fixing that fundamental issue which turns the game into a boring slog to level up your hero and then smash your opponent.

												This is the turn based strategy game I have been trying to find for years.  The ""mixed"" reviews on Steam almost turned me away but I am glad it didnt.  I have had the game for less than two months, and am at 341 hours played as of this writing.  I still haven't beaten it.  If I had to quickly describe this game, I would say it is a perfect marriage of playstyles from Brigandine (a PS1 turn based SRPG) and Civilization.ProsInsanely addicting gameplay, with that ""one more turn"" craving.The balance of units and their usage is very appropriate.The story and writing are actually surprisingly good, and thats usually a non factor for me in a game focused on pure gameplay.  It's not an epic tale you'll be telling your friends about, but the individual characters are distinguishable and it's a rather neat premise.  Additionally, humor is intermingled in rather well.The gameplay has a ""roguelike"" feel to it, in that after every shard you conquer you move on to another shard and start off almost from scratch.  Over time you gain more and more benefits you can start the next shard with, but it is very much a fresh new start every time.  Personally for me, this is what keeps racking up the hours.  I would also like to give praise to the great attention to detail on units, and also the vast catalog of equippable items and buildings to employ.ConsOther reviews really only harp on two things, difficulty and bugs.  The bugs do exist, and the game does crash.  There is an autosave feature that saves the game every turn, which addresses this pretty well, but it is still annoying.  It is NOT a reason to give up on, or dismiss this game entirely.  The difficulty may be hard for people new to SRPGs.  For me, I updated the difficulty level to ""Expert"" not too far into the game, and I am not struggling on any one stage.  This concern is also well addressed because they have I think 8 options for difficulty and can be adjusted.  There is a learning curve with troop usage and all of the classes involved, but a huge variety of successful strategies to develop which truly makes this game interesting.DLCI recommend playing the game a bit first and making sure you dig it before buying.  You'll probably know pretty quickly.  If you do enjoy the game, the DLC is a welcome addition to it.SummationIf you are looking for a turn based SRPG that you can play for 10 minutes at a time or easily lose an entire weekend to it all the same, this is a solid choice.  This is the best SRPG I have been able to find since the PS1 era.			"

												Gawd, I've never ""turned"" on a game this quickly. I played and enjoyed Eador Genesis. So when this came out I was excited. It's essentially the same game with much prettier graphics. It look great, the interface is better and I enjoyed it for a while. I really give them props on some of the art - it's some of the best out there. The quests can be fun and there's a great balance between enhancing your own territories and going after new ones. Then two problems hit me:1. It's repetitive. Very repetitive. You start on a shard, build up, conquer the enemy and start all over again from scratch on a different shard. Rinse and repeat. That's not very compelling gameplay. They would have done much better with a faster paced, more open gameplay style.  I could forgive that. After all, it's okay for a while. What I can't forgive is flaw #2.2. This ""strategy"" game is nothing of the sort for one reason - the AI cheats and will give it's side resources that are comparable to yours even if you should vastly outproduce them. So the whole game becomes an illusion because you aren't really ""playing"" the other side, you're playing against a bunch of foes that are generated directly in response to your own force. If you found a way to find a million gold in the game, rest assured the AI would have similar resources the next turn even if they were down to one or two territories left. As a result, the game is fundamentally broken in a way that will never be fixed. It's not a strategy game at that point because the AI doesn't need to play with any strategy. I figured this out when I saw the AI pushing units it could not possibly create with only one city left. After some exploration and some help unravling the back end, we found that's the way it works. So there is no real ""AI"". It's like playing Civilization if the AI could just give itself cities and armies out of thin air every turn. That ruined the game for me. Oh, it still has bugs and the gameplay is also still repetitive. But it's knowing how badly the AI can cheat that was the deal killer. It's lazy and insulting to the players. As such, Eador sadly gets two thumbs down from me.			"

												Is the game worth it? Simply put yes - in a pure cost per hour it represents great value. But if you're looking for a flawless gem then this is not the game you're looking for, its greatest strengths are also its greatest weaknesses.By all means buy the game, enjoy it for what it is and appreciate the depth of control you have and perfecting your chosen methods/tactics. However this is rather like a marathon - you do it once, maybe you talk about doing it again but when you get back in training you realise the memory is better than the actual experience and there are better things to do with your time.When this game was first released the bugs made it torturous to play, despite its underlying appeal. The bug fixes and subsequent DLC addressed the vast majority of these and added some additional diversity into the game and the alliances you could build.The unit progression is superb, allowing you to tailor to your playstyle while still retaining a small element of randomness. It's gratifying to see your minions grow and develop, reaching landmark skills/abilities and being able to deploy them accordingly. It's less gratifying to see them die on turn one of a battle before you can act. The realism of this is appreciated however anything resembling an offensive spellcaster is going to spend its life cowering at the back being chain healed awaiting the arrow that will finally kill it. After carefully nurturing them to a level where they get decent spells this is not entertaining. To avoid this you are left with only a small selection of units to use (or you go with a hero that does all the work while the creatures in the army are more like cheerleaders). The other failing is the high level units you can build are ultimately not needed meaning every level is the same army; the game fails to challenge you to change your playstyle, the 'differences' between the worlds are not level defining and every shard is the same. While I don't always like the myriad of missions that are often forced on players in games such as these the totally directionless play isn't rewarding. And just when you think it is you win the level and start from scratch.My first playthrough was long, I inadvertently picked the longest win condition and proceeded to conquer every shard in turn. It was clear from the achievements there were a number of ways to win but none presented themselves. For me the replay value of a game is key, I love to go back and play games again in a different way, or using different tactics and this one is no different. Once I finished it I wanted to go back and play again; different heroes, different endings, different bonuses. The problem is after a shard or two I realised that I was going to be doing this for another 200 hours (and that there was no joy in trying to do it differently). While the longer I spend away from the game the more fondly I think of it a few hours playing it again drives me away.I don't regret buying it, or the time spent. Perfecting the tactics, overcoming the AI's tendency to cheat spectacularly, finally closing down a shard and managing the grumpy inhabitants of the cities was something I enjoyed at the time. But not something I want to do again and it's something many people won't want to do at once.			"

												I really liked this game.  But I recommend not buying it.  The developer provides frequent updates (that's good).  Those updates, as often as not, introduce new bugs that range from annoying to completely gamebreaking.  Until the developers find a way to quality control their updates before releasing them to production, I can't recommend this otherwise enjoyable game.			"

												I have so many complaints about this game, I'm not even sure where to start.  I love games like Kings Bounty, Age of Wonders, Civilization etc.  But Eador just sucks, just keep clicking in explore province over and over again get's so boring and repetitive I'll start playing games on my cell phone as well = / I've also found most of the time in the begining when your hero is underpowered, the notifications of how powerful the enemies you'll face is frustatingly inaccurate. This really took the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Just seeing, ""this enemy is easy"" and then going into battle and have all your units die in 3 turns, and then you have to wait for your hero to ressurect, and in the mean time your rival hero on the shard takes it over and you lose GG!I also found the combat really dull and boring. I hate strategy game where the units you face aren't concerened with their own life.  As in I hate facing A.I. that's more then willing to kamakaze themselves just so you lose a unti, rahter than strategically move around the board so they don't get flanked or ambushed.  But instead they will charge in the middle of 3 units just to take out that weak archer or shaman and the enemies die next turn because they bum rushed in the middle of your army just for the sake of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. (Also why I hate FIre Emblem and love FF Tactics wayyy more, but anyways)No option to rebind the keys, the options to change the graphics was bare minimum, and the U.I. is underdeveloped, just doesn't provide enough information, like before you move to a square you could maybe scout it to see what level of enemies you could expect to face.  Or maybe in the ""go to a a location"" menu it could state what's in those locations when you hover your cursor over them, instead you just have to waste turn after turn poking around seeing what enemies you can face while the Enemy Heros take over the shard and Game Over. All in all a waste of time.			"

												UPDATE MARCH 15: GAME STILL UNSTABLE EVEN AFTER ""FIX"" OF MARCH 14TH.  Played only 1 full turn on my current game and it crashed in the middle of the next.UPDATE 2, January 13 2014: Game is still crashing despite graphic settings fix.  Don't know why it can't just be consistent.UPDATE: TRY CHANGING THE DYNAMIC LIGHTING OPTION TO ""6"" INSTEAD OF RANDOM.  MUCH MORE STABLE WITH THIS GRAPHICS SETTING.  SWITCHED TO ""RECOMMEND"".OLD REVIEW FOLLOWS.Eador: Masters of the Broken GameI started playing this yesterday and have 13 hours in.  Unfortunately it is still glitchy.  Annoyingly, it likes to error out at the very end of the turn, so if you had a couple battles and an interesting random event... Sorry, gotta do it all over again.  And that cool random event will be something different next time.  So the mysterious magic items you see on the reward screen are never examined.If the game would at least quick-save at the end of every fight, I could give this a ""recommend,"" despite the glitchiness.  If the game is ever fixed, it is definitely recommended.Consider this a public service announcement: Game still glitchy as of December 25th, 2013.  I hope it is fixed sometime.EDIT as of December 30th follows:I've added another 40 hours of playtime, despite glitches and restarts.  Its a testament to the fact that I really do like the game.  I try to limit the number of actions I take per turn, to give the game less opportunity to fail.  But I've hit 3 turns in a row where I've had to restart, and after lengthy battles.Like I said, if the game is fixed it will be great.  But until then it is a tantalizing tease of a game.  I'm not saying you should never buy it, but wait for it to be a working product.  Save yourself some time and frustration.I intend to update this review in the future when the game is playable.People who disagree with this 100% factual review must be out of their mind, or reading reviews to discredit rather than fixing their game.

												I saw videos and previews of this game a long time ago and thought it looked awesome. I really liked the idea of a turn based fantasy based strategy with tactical combat.So when the game came out I waited a bit and then bought it. I'm honestly not sure what to think of this game. There is all the right pieces there for a awesome RPG tactical strategy game, but for some reason it just falls short.The hero characters aren't very balanced and just feel kind of blah. The game gets very repetitive very fast as you keep running into the same thing over and over.While playing I just couldn't help but compare it to Fallen Enchantress which is a similar style game. In pretty much every way it feel short. Maybe not fair as Stardock is a larger company. But still the point is there.You may love this game, you may hate it. If you play Fallen Enchantress I'd stick with that and not bother with this game.			"

												So much potential but it just somehow dosen't feel like it works. A few tweaks to make the user interface make more sense or the shards (mission worlds) less imposible if you don't min max or follow guides and it would be glorious. Far to many actually imposible encounters which you have no idea of the difficulty of unless you look at a manual. Also currently economy is a nightmare unless you find instructions which really takes away from what you want to do, go around looting pilaging and building a glorious army to own the world. It's got loads of character but sadly feels like an uphil strugle to play all the way. I look forward to another iteration very much where things get ironed out.			"

												The best turn-based game focusing on battle planning. At first I'm quite worried about game crash as most review said but when I found a discount price I give it a try. Of all my 15 hours of play I experienced a crash only once which I think because of open too many programs at same time. This game positions itself in a unique way by not give much important on grand campaign but more focus on battle. To run the kingdom is quite straigtforward, nothing interesting. On the other hand, in the battlefield is what most entertaining. It's fully controllable which requires thoroughly planning. One wrong move can make a win or lose.			"

												This is an early impression review.This game seems like a real treat. The visuals are stunning. The music is wonderful. It is something I haven't quite felt since Age of Wonders. The first campaign is very newbie-friendly, going through all you need to know. All in all, this game has everything going for it. It just remains to see whether it stays interesting as you get further. Personally, I tend to tire easily with most turn-based games, and especially rpg games. We'll see, but so far it looks good.

												Good strategic game. The main advantage is that there are a lot of possibilities. There is no unbalanced/unbeatable combination of units, so you can play the game your style. For example Forests is good cover against ranged attacks and hills give you an advantage in melee fights. You don't have to kill all units, you can also reduce their moral to zero or reduce their stamina (that won't grant you the victory, but makes it way easier to kill them ;))The Game is still a little bit buggy and freezes sometimes when you start a new shard and you have to play a different shard instead.The Game develops slowly, you have to conquer a shard and as reward you get plans to build new buildings. You get the first tier II units after 3-4 shards.			"

												While many of the serious bugs have been resolved a year later, a few game-breaking bugs do remain (albeit the ones listed above do not).Gameplay balance remains an issue, and it inherently leads to a very grindy game.So it remains a diamond in the rough.---After almost a year, this game remains a bug-ridden hellhole, with very little tactical or strategic balance at most levels of the gameplay. I'm almost tempted to say the bugs are worse now than they were a year ago.Some bugs include:- if more than one battle of any kind occurs on the map, no other battles can occur. They immediately auto-resolve with both sides being listed as dead despite not being dead.- The AI cannot conquer any terrain where it has to fight player guards. Neither the guards will die nor will the province be conquered.Some gameplay issues include:- In campaign mode, it is entirely possible for the capitol of an AI to be guarded by 9 centaurs. Centaurs are powerful tier 2 units. If this occurs in the first or second mission, you have been given a near-impossible task, as the gameplay elements that allow you to defeat centaurs are not available until later in the game. You can, of course, surrender, and keep playing. This, and similar balance issues, remain a frustrating element of the game.- Starting units are worthless and unless you follow certain strategies or know what you're doing, you're likely to be stuck in your home province for many, many turns.All of this is incredibly sad, as the game's core concept is pretty great. The programming and game design, however, are lackluster and poor. A great game marred by poor design.			"

												Eador: Masters of the Broken World is a great game if you have a lot of time to spend, and do not mind a slow progression curve. Presenting you with a strategy game set in a detailed world broken up into multiple shards, you can spend your time gathering land and power to eventually find one of many endings. It is a big game, full of strategic decisions and plenty of things you can explore, find, and control. It is one of the largest games in scale that I have seen so far, which is both good and bad. Good, because, of course. That's more game for you to play in, and bad because all that scale takes a lot of time to get through. So much time that you may not have enough in your schedule to make good progress in it - I have over 80 hours in it, and I have not yet completed the campaign. As much as I like the scale, the shattered vibrant world, the astral mechanics and the immersive soundtrack, it has issues that it doesn't need to have.The world in Eador is based on shards, with each shard being a whole new map to explore and conquer, and every one you conquer brings you a new building or advantage you can take along to the next. You gain astral energy based on how much of the world is in your possession, and how many people worship you, the astral spirit/master controlling the place. The problem here is that every single shard has you build up your forces from practically nothing. You can spend energy to bring some basics, but it is never really enough to skip through the early game and expensive. Plus, who knows what else you may want your energy for? Eador plays much more like several similar skirmish maps than a long unified campaign. Yet, there is throughout it all a large storyline, from world to world, where you can spend time talking to the other masters or decide to engage them, change things that have long term effects far past the one world you're in, or otherwise find out more about the game's world. While in the game itself, there are a lot of random and semi-random events as well. The world feels as if it is actually a world, rather than just a game through these. The soundtrack is very well done, and it is easy enough to forget about time and spend several hours to take over another shard and advance past it. But it has issues, as mentioned. It is imperfect, with occasional crashes and some balance issues making it very difficult to progress at times, as well as some design decisions, whether intentional or not, leading to some choices being just plain better than others. Out of all this, the worst of it is when your opponent gets a random event that allows them to have a guard dragon, while you are still in the earliest levels. There is no way to defeat a dragon at that point without a lot of grinding experience on your hero and luck.The opposing AI is rather poor, and at times does not seem to even understand the basics of gameplay, which is sad as you will be spending a lot of time beating on said AI. Both the other masters and the neutrals tend to be like that, sadly. The battles being on a tiny, simplistic map that shows that combat is not the game's strong point. But you're likely not buying this for the combat. If you're buying Eador, you're doing it for the strategy, the long term plans, the vibrant world, and all the good things it has. Try to not let its faults get to you, and you will be able to spend litterally days on it without any regret. But if you do not have time, patience, or are not that much into strategy and similar 4X games, you may not enjoy it. For those who do enjoy those things, here's for you.			"

												In the tutorial, I was exploring with my Scout and his army.I got an event in which I can ""rest in the forest""So I choose ""Rest"" to see what will happen...While resting I get attacked by 2 Ghosts. There is no option to retreat, no option to negotiate, no option for protective measures. I was forced into combat.The 2 Ghosts were COMPLETELY IMMUNE to physical damage. I only had 3 Magic Missiles on my hero. I killed only one of them. The other Ghost had half hit points and he killed my entire army of 7 units including the hero because he was completely immune to physical attacks and the tutorial does not allow you to have any magic units in your army.Great game design! How about an event that forces you to fight a Tier 2 unit that is completely immune to the most basic damage type with no way for you to counter it? No strategy, no exploitation of weakness, no need to use your brain at all. Just watch one low tier unit slaughter your army because the developers don't know what STRATEGY and testing means. I swear is was absolutely hilarious watching this one ghost guy kill a whole army by himself! WTF!In every other tactical strategy game, ""Ghost"" type units can RESIST physical damage, maybe have 50% resistance or even 70%... not ♥♥♥♥in 100%! (unless magic attacks are abundant from the start, which they are NOT in this game)The rest of the game can basically be summed up in one phrase: Quantity over qualityLots of options, so much to do, but poorly balanced, poorly tested and deeply flawed on a strategic level.5/10 Game could have been great if more attention was given to unit design and level up progression of heroes and units.EDIT: Of course they released a sequel (standalone expansion). Still in early access, but if it has the same units and gameplay as this game, you can pretty much expect the same thing: More quantity, less quality			"

												Okay, I enjoy this game. I enjoy it alot. I have dumped alot of time into the game. If you like Strategy/RPG mix overall I think this game is something to look at. I won't hide the fact that the game is still buggy even after being out for a year, but the developers have been patching the game non-stop since it came out April 2013.The Ugly:Okay this game still has bugs, for some people game breaking bugs, and for others bugs that are iritating enough that can make it painful to play the game sometimes. The game was released last April almost completely unplayable, and over the past year it has improved for the major part. Yet I won't gloss over the fact that their is still alot wrong with the game.The Bad:The game probably is not all that balanced. Their are 4 tiers of units, and some T4 units could trample an entire army. Not all of the Hero classes are balanced. Their are 4 of them, but they all are playable. It will be nice to see what the game is like in the future.The Good:Did I mention patching? The developers still care about the game. They have been patching it a while, and still patch it. There is alot in this game, alot of units, alot of choice. Alot of lore burried deep within a rough exterior. The game does not look half bad. The game is not fast paced, but is the type of game you can start playing, and come back between turns as you do something else, but will also keep you wanting to play ""one more turn"" when things are getting good or you near to beating another map.

Crashes every once and awhile, very unforgiving if you make a mistake and didn't save recently and for some reason I can't play it anymore since I reformatted my HD. I don't really care though. I had my 250 hours of fun and what more can I ask from an indie?Thanks for the game guys, I loved it.I recommend if you are patient and have alot of time to kill.			"

												I thought this game was a lot of fun for the first couple of hours, then it becomes tedious.The hero exploration seemed like it would be a lot of fun, if it didnt take forever and all the combat wasn't manual. The units are very imbalanced, you can spend a lot of time nurturing your troops just to have them one hit by someone elses tier 1 or 2 units.There's also no real effective way to garrison your territory, so it plays a lot like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game of risk, where you just make one massive army and roll across the map until you sack someones capital city.

												*Nominated for Steam's “Game that never stops kicking your b*tt” Award*This game is relentless. Uncaring. Unforgiving. And it will always find more creative ways to humiliate you. Punish you. At first, you think you're such a tough guy/gal, because you've been playing tactical games for decades, so you turn up the difficulty and start your first game. You are told you are a God, and you feel like you'll own this world. You laugh at the tutorial, thinking ""please... this is not my first barbecue here, enough with the holding-my-hand gameplay, give me a real challenge."" And surely these goblins are just cannon fodder for xp right? Think again. They will tear you apart. On your first battle. It's like getting slapped in the face and get told to get back to your seat. You slowly realize how dangerous this first world is. And then it dawns on you : ""Wait... I... actually may lose before completing my first shard..."" Careful planning, pacing, and never under-estimating choices become a necessity. For survival. After a few hours, just when you think you're starting to get the hang of it... you have this strategy all prepared... you have these old units getting tougher and tougher... Then the game crushes you again. It never takes much : it takes one wrong move on the battlefield ; it takes one daring click during a random event ; it takes one management mistake for your equipment or fortress...Soon you're back to the main menu and a lesson in humility has been learned. You click ""expert"" difficulty (default gameplay stats) wishing you had the guts to click ""beginner"" instead... but there's always a bit of pride left in you, isn't there? And then you're off to another b*tt-kicking. This is not a bad thing. This is actually a great thing. Your choices matter. All of them. Because each time you're wrong, you fail. And each victory, each captured shard, is a real hard-fought battle. It's an endeavour. A real achievement. Overcoming the odds. Until that moment when the game will find another way to mess with everything you thought you had mastered, in a way you never saw coming.This game is a tactical boot-camp. Russian style.

												Recommend if you have loads of time to burn.I want to like this game but it is a bit of grind in the campaign. You'll invest a few hours on a shard to move to the next one just to unlock one more building. The game is fairly challenging which is good. Your lands are easily conquered and require your constant vigilance. Lands also revolt and succeed and so you send your limited units over to smack them down. Meanwhile, other lords are conquering the lands you just left. There's a good amount of random events that benefit or hurt you. There's also a fair amount of bugs that will hurt or annoy you like enemy units that are dropped to 0 hp but don't die. There also seems to always be a non-zero probability to lose a battle when you have an overwhelming force on auto-battle.  "

												Eador is a hard game to recomend. It was actually too tough for me I figured at one point and quit it there and then. I really like how the game fundamentally works but for some reason it is punishingly hard at points. Like, literally impossible missions looming. Maybe I didnt quite get the funding and recruitment properly because some of the fights... well, I feel bad just thinking of them now! That said, I do feel like its a TBS game with a big heart. I'd love to see a sequel that is similar but gives me a chance!			"

												Eador: Masters of the Broken World is a great game if you have a lot of time to spend, and do not mind a slow progression curve. Presenting you with a strategy game set in a detailed world broken up into multiple shards, you can spend your time gathering land and power to eventually find one of many endings. It is a big game, full of strategic decisions and plenty of things you can explore, find, and control. It is one of the largest games in scale that I have seen so far, which is both good and bad. Good, because, of course. That's more game for you to play in, and bad because all that scale takes a lot of time to get through. So much time that you may not have enough in your schedule to make good progress in it - I have over 80 hours in it, and I have not yet completed the campaign. As much as I like the scale, the shattered vibrant world, the astral mechanics and the immersive soundtrack, it has issues that it doesn't need to have.The world in Eador is based on shards, with each shard being a whole new map to explore and conquer, and every one you conquer brings you a new building or advantage you can take along to the next. You gain astral energy based on how much of the world is in your possession, and how many people worship you, the astral spirit/master controlling the place. The problem here is that every single shard has you build up your forces from practically nothing. You can spend energy to bring some basics, but it is never really enough to skip through the early game and expensive. Plus, who knows what else you may want your energy for? Eador plays much more like several similar skirmish maps than a long unified campaign. Yet, there is throughout it all a large storyline, from world to world, where you can spend time talking to the other masters or decide to engage them, change things that have long term effects far past the one world you're in, or otherwise find out more about the game's world. While in the game itself, there are a lot of random and semi-random events as well. The world feels as if it is actually a world, rather than just a game through these. The soundtrack is very well done, and it is easy enough to forget about time and spend several hours to take over another shard and advance past it. But it has issues, as mentioned. It is imperfect, with occasional crashes and some balance issues making it very difficult to progress at times, as well as some design decisions, whether intentional or not, leading to some choices being just plain better than others. Out of all this, the worst of it is when your opponent gets a random event that allows them to have a guard dragon, while you are still in the earliest levels. There is no way to defeat a dragon at that point without a lot of grinding experience on your hero and luck.The opposing AI is rather poor, and at times does not seem to even understand the basics of gameplay, which is sad as you will be spending a lot of time beating on said AI. Both the other masters and the neutrals tend to be like that, sadly. The battles being on a tiny, simplistic map that shows that combat is not the game's strong point. But you're likely not buying this for the combat. If you're buying Eador, you're doing it for the strategy, the long term plans, the vibrant world, and all the good things it has. Try to not let its faults get to you, and you will be able to spend litterally days on it without any regret. But if you do not have time, patience, or are not that much into strategy and similar 4X games, you may not enjoy it. For those who do enjoy those things, here's for you.			"

												i love eador. this or any version. i won't deny that masters of the broken world has it's flaws, but overall i love it. there are plenty of reviews out there that will tell you what can be improved about this game, so i just want to focus on the postive aspects. what i really enjoy is that you build buildings in your main province or territory to recruit troops, upgrade units, boosts production, learn spells-basically everything in the game. if you want to buy your own armor and weapons, you can build the buildings associated with it, but beyond that, as you conquer more territories and hire guards to partol and protect them from potential uprisings or invaders, you can also build more buildings in those territories to do things like hire troops, buy items and learn spells from your capital territory without having to be there. you can also construct buildings in those provinces to boost production of the different currencies and other resources across your empire.i love that the different heroes allow for pretty widely varied playstyles. the scout/archer picks people off from a distance, the warrior is a one many army, the commander boosts his troops to near hero like levels and can have the largest number of troops on the battlefield, and the mage can be a range spellcaster, a healer, a necromancer with an army of the undead or a summoner of hellish hordes. the mage class is definitely my favorite. picking one hero at the start doesn't prevent you from getting the others later on, the cost goes up more and more, but you can keep buying new heroes and making more armies. there's a huge range of enemies to fight and the battlefield itself adds extra depth to the combat. hills slow down movement but provide extra defense for melee combat and extra range for archers, forests provide cover from range attacks and hinder movement. the swamps also slow down units and reduce defense for troops unlucky enough to be in there when attacked. seemingly every enemy you come across in the story can potentially be recruited and used to fight for you. if you don't want to play for hours to unlock the better weapons, armor, monsters, etc., you can play a quick match on a custom shard against custom opponents and you'll start with all the buildings unlocked and the freedom to explore any playstyle you want.

												An empire builder with terrible pacing. The visuals are beautiful, but the gameplay suffers from the fact that you can't field a mobile army unless you have a hero. Unfortunately, recruiting a hero beyond your first is prohibitively expensive, making the early parts of the game very boring or very frustrating depending on how you're progressing. Allowing players to march out troops without a hero or even allowing two free heroes at the start would help tremendously with the opening turns' dullness.Additionally, the game features a separate tactical map for combat. It starts promising, but it doesn't take long before units appear that completely disrespect the terrain and simply fly past your frontline troops to decimate your ranged units.			"

												I put a good number of hours into this game as it seemed as though there is a lot of depth to it. This may well be the case but unfortunately I finally gave up with it due to the fact that it is so incredibly slow, clunky and badly made. The game mechanics are rather confusing and it really does a terrible job of letting you know what you are supposed to be doing. The tactical combat sections are also terrible. Tiny maps with big daft looking units that don't really offer much in the way of tactical options. Either your units are better or the enemies are. It's all pretty dull stuff, which is a shame really as I tend to like this type of game.			"

												Really awesome game that captures fantasy and the idea of being a demigod perfectly. The combat is amazing and really fun, the graphics look great, the replayablity is insane, the random events are fun and well written. The game is really deep and extensive as well, with so many things to manage, upgrade and decide it's just a pure joy to play. Oh, and if you ever played Eador before, this game is literally a 3rd remake of it in it's custom games. With even more content with the DLC. The mixed status and the negative reviews are due to the I guess boring campaing, which is why people complain about not keeping their units and upgrades from shard to shard. The thing is, the campaign is supposed to just be a side thing, The best way to play this game is to go into a custom game, set up your settings, and then enjoy hours of fun as you attempt to conquer your shard.

												Honestly, this game looks like it would be fun, but within 5 minutes of starting the game i already encountered a serious bug multiple times.  Now, I did manage to work around the bug, but it seems to happen in almost every single battle.  I find it very disappointing in a supposedly mature product, so i can't recommend the game at all.  I'm honestly surprised, considering the game appears to have been out for quite some time.Don't buy it unless they focus more on software quality and lack of bugs.			"

												Okay, I enjoy this game. I enjoy it alot. I have dumped alot of time into the game. If you like Strategy/RPG mix overall I think this game is something to look at. I won't hide the fact that the game is still buggy even after being out for a year, but the developers have been patching the game non-stop since it came out April 2013.The Ugly:Okay this game still has bugs, for some people game breaking bugs, and for others bugs that are iritating enough that can make it painful to play the game sometimes. The game was released last April almost completely unplayable, and over the past year it has improved for the major part. Yet I won't gloss over the fact that their is still alot wrong with the game.The Bad:The game probably is not all that balanced. Their are 4 tiers of units, and some T4 units could trample an entire army. Not all of the Hero classes are balanced. Their are 4 of them, but they all are playable. It will be nice to see what the game is like in the future.The Good:Did I mention patching? The developers still care about the game. They have been patching it a while, and still patch it. There is alot in this game, alot of units, alot of choice. Alot of lore burried deep within a rough exterior. The game does not look half bad. The game is not fast paced, but is the type of game you can start playing, and come back between turns as you do something else, but will also keep you wanting to play ""one more turn"" when things are getting good or you near to beating another map. The developers have recently added a boat load of new units and spells, and have dropped hints are future expansion to the game.Is the game, worth $19.99? Its a hard sell considering how buggy it can still be. I do thing its a hard sell, but I've enjoy the time I've dumped  into the game and I do appreciate the patches that have gone into it. The game has gotten good, and hopefully it will cotinue getting better.			"

You'll invest a few hours on a shard to move to the next one just to unlock one more building. The game is fairly challenging which is good. Your lands are easily conquered and require your constant vigilance. Lands also revolt and succeed and so you send your limited units over to smack them down. Meanwhile, other lords are conquering the lands you just left. There's a good amount of random events that benefit or hurt you. There's also a fair amount of bugs that will hurt or annoy you like enemy units that are dropped to 0 hp but don't die. There also seems to always be a non-zero probability to lose a battle when you have an overwhelming force on auto-battle.  "

												Eador is a hard game to recomend. It was actually too tough for me I figured at one point and quit it there and then. I really like how the game fundamentally works but for some reason it is punishingly hard at points. Like, literally impossible missions looming. Maybe I didnt quite get the funding and recruitment properly because some of the fights... well, I feel bad just thinking of them now! That said, I do feel like its a TBS game with a big heart. I'd love to see a sequel that is similar but gives me a chance!			"

												An empire builder with terrible pacing. The visuals are beautiful, but the gameplay suffers from the fact that you can't field a mobile army unless you have a hero. Unfortunately, recruiting a hero beyond your first is prohibitively expensive, making the early parts of the game very boring or very frustrating depending on how you're progressing. Allowing players to march out troops without a hero or even allowing two free heroes at the start would help tremendously with the opening turns' dullness.Additionally, the game features a separate tactical map for combat. It starts promising, but it doesn't take long before units appear that completely disrespect the terrain and simply fly past your frontline troops to decimate your ranged units.			"

												I put a good number of hours into this game as it seemed as though there is a lot of depth to it. This may well be the case but unfortunately I finally gave up with it due to the fact that it is so incredibly slow, clunky and badly made. The game mechanics are rather confusing and it really does a terrible job of letting you know what you are supposed to be doing. The tactical combat sections are also terrible. Tiny maps with big daft looking units that don't really offer much in the way of tactical options. Either your units are better or the enemies are. It's all pretty dull stuff, which is a shame really as I tend to like this type of game.			"

												Well first and foremost this game is way too hard. I know I'll come off sounding like a whiney kid, but with 7 different difficulty levels the easeaist shouldn't be that hard. The combat which is kept in a hexagonal turnbased style known from Heros of might and magic (and many others) has to be fought out with extreeme attention to detail each and every time - if not a weaker enemy will kill you. Thats great if you enjoy that kind of thing. If you want things to go a little faster - there is a ""instant battle"" button - or as I like to call it ""Instant loss"" button. So if you are into micromanaging the same stuff over and over and over again - starting over from scratch on each new map - this is the game for you.If not - stay clear of it. "

												Honestly, this game looks like it would be fun, but within 5 minutes of starting the game i already encountered a serious bug multiple times.  Now, I did manage to work around the bug, but it seems to happen in almost every single battle.  I find it very disappointing in a supposedly mature product, so i can't recommend the game at all.  I'm honestly surprised, considering the game appears to have been out for quite some time.Don't buy it unless they focus more on software quality and lack of bugs.			"

												i love eador. this or any version. i won't deny that masters of the broken world has it's flaws, but overall i love it. there are plenty of reviews out there that will tell you what can be improved about this game, so i just want to focus on the postive aspects. what i really enjoy is that you build buildings in your main province or territory to recruit troops, upgrade units, boosts production, learn spells-basically everything in the game. if you want to buy your own armor and weapons, you can build the buildings associated with it, but beyond that, as you conquer more territories and hire guards to partol and protect them from potential uprisings or invaders, you can also build more buildings in those territories to do things like hire troops, buy items and learn spells from your capital territory without having to be there. you can also construct buildings in those provinces to boost production of the different currencies and other resources across your empire.i love that the different heroes allow for pretty widely varied playstyles. the scout/archer picks people off from a distance, the warrior is a one many army, the commander boosts his troops to near hero like levels and can have the largest number of troops on the battlefield, and the mage can be a range spellcaster, a healer, a necromancer with an army of the undead or a summoner of hellish hordes. the mage class is definitely my favorite. picking one hero at the start doesn't prevent you from getting the others later on, the cost goes up more and more, but you can keep buying new heroes and making more armies. there's a huge range of enemies to fight and the battlefield itself adds extra depth to the combat. hills slow down movement but provide extra defense for melee combat and extra range for archers, forests provide cover from range attacks and hinder movement. the swamps also slow down units and reduce defense for troops unlucky enough to be in there when attacked. seemingly every enemy you come across in the story can potentially be recruited and used to fight for you. if you don't want to play for hours to unlock the better weapons, armor, monsters, etc., you can play a quick match on a custom shard against custom opponents and you'll start with all the buildings unlocked and the freedom to explore any playstyle you want.

												Eador Cons1: You have to restart from scratch every level.2: Instead of having more intelligent IA they just throw more resources and units at them really early on.3: Game has a auto resolve button, but it's broken at best. Ex archer heroe with peasant army v dragons=win archer heroe with peasant army v wolf pack= lose.4: recent update introduced invalid pointer error which causes the game to quit working when certain game events happen it can be worked around, but it's annoying. 5: The game overall is really slow to get going.Pros1: Every level you can pick a different route to go (different heroes, units, buildings, spells, good or evil, etc.)2: You have to plan ahead when choosing buildings to create a good army.3: Random events that can be good or bad, and you get to decide how to respond to them instead of just watching them happen.4: Unit trees (good, neutral, evil) are balanced out.5: You can have guards to defend your lands so you don't always have to make your heroes backtrack to deal with random events. (Which is really helpful during war times.) Guards also have effects on the lands they are stationed in.All in all it's a good game if you can stand restarting every level, but I wouldn't recommend it till they fix the (invalid pointer error) problem.

												Too buggy. Only one hour in and I want to quit. Main issue, which other reviewers have expressed is that units that are killed don't die. Their HP reach 0 and they just stop moving. This is quite a problem since you need to kill every single unit on the map to win the battle. Your best hope is to click auto battle and hope after a few turns the unit will finally die. Otherwise you constantly have to reload the game from your previous save. Way too much hassle.			"

												I love turn based strategy games.  This game looks and feels a lot like Heroes of Might & Magic, but it has some flaws that holds it down from it’s true potential.  I’m writing this review for the TBS fans that know what they are looking for, and noting the exact flaws that ruin the game.There are four tiers of strength for your recruitable units.  Each recruitable unit can level up.  However, no matter what high level they attain, they are really no match for the next higher tier unit.  No units can be resurrected, which can be infuriating when your tier 1, level 10 infantry is eliminated by a tier 3, level 0 archer in one strike.  I tried to cycle through my troops by only using my low levels to fight low level battles, but then you realize that your higher tiers would rather benefit from the experience, as they will need all they can get when they have to take on tier 4 enemies.  On top of that, the opponent AI will always bee-line to your weakest and most exploitable units first.  Battles have to be sought out, but are abundant.  The problem is low level encounters are just as rare as high level encounters.  All encounters are preset, and you can choose when to take on the encounter.  You might find yourself scouring the lands trying to find goblins for your tier 1, level 0s to knock out, wasting many turns in the process.  The best way to level up your army is for them to see combat head on, which makes it tough to build up solid armies without losing a few in the process.  I found myself sometimes recruiting low levels as simple cannon fodder or bait.  No units have a ‘taunt’ ability, so no unit can be used for ‘tanking.’ This greatly hurts the whole point of playing as a warrior type CO, and puts heavy armor defense infantry in a tough spot.  Most units can run or fly circles around them.  Terrain does play a role in mobility and stat adjustments, but not so much that it becomes a game changer.  Battles ultimately end up being very lopsided, with little actual strategy.If it wasn’t for the core of the strategy being flawed, it would be a fantastic gem.  The graphics are very pleasing to the eye.  The soundtrack is limited and repetitive like an old console game, but can be turned off.  The interface may look intimidating at first, but it is simply spread out and unconsolidated, which doesn’t affect gameplay.  I only recommend it to those with a tremendous amount of patience and time on their hands.  Expect campaigns to take many hours at a time, and anticipate never being able to take on many battles due to the limits of what army you can develop.  In short, expect disappointment, but do your best with what you have.			"

Posted: December 16, 2015
												I'm struggling to find words insulting enough to convey how terrible this game is. It's simply a disaster on all levels.Getting the game to run initially is a struggle by itself. The game files get flagged by AVG (something I've never seen before with a Steam title. After that, the game won't run because the game process is not killed and Steam will report an error. Even after forcibly terminating the process, steam still thinks you are running it. Ultimately you have to forcibly terminate Steam itself to fix it. Once you finally get into the game, things get even more frustrating. Let me cover some key points to give a general idea of why I think the game is a POS. First you customize your profile as lord- pick a portrait, emblem color, name etc- however this is mostly pointless because the only part of the customization that is retained is the name and emblem. I picked a cool portrait to suit my roleplaying preference, changed colors to black and white, but in the game my portrait reverted to the default one and the character model is fixed to all red armor with a particularly douchey looking haircut. The games inability to let the player roleplay doesn't stop there either. You equip your guy with a nice shiny Axe and a shield, but the model does not change and in battle he uses a spear and sword. I've seen more roleplaying value in games that aren't even roleplaying games.No UI scaling- Yeah this game doesn't have it. If you are like me and many others that want to play at a decent resolution, then prepare to squint your eyes at the tiny UI or keep a magnifying glass in one hand as you play. There's really no excuse as to why a game like this is lacking such a rudimentary feature. The combat- If you would call it that) is incredibly boring and lifeless. It's about as satisfying as peeling a potato. The animations are out of sync with the combat actions. The floating text and repercussions of an action happen before it has even been executed in a rather strange and detached way. Swinging a sword at an enemy looks and sounds like you've just slapped someone with a stick of celery. The combat lacks any meaningful impact and the enemies fall down in the most generic way shortly before they vaporize into a bunch of sticks ?When a battle ends there is no reaction at all from your army, no war-cries, no chants, they just stand there like stunned-mullets like it never even happened. The battle map is so one-dimensional and generic looking. It doesn't make an effort to show any creativity and just slaps a bunch of hexes together on some slightly modulated ugly looking terrain. I'd say the best part about this game is it's music, and even that's pretty average. Other than that, It's just a horrible uninspired, boring and lackluster approach to the genre with no redeeming value. In fact I can't think of a single thing this game does right. Such a waste.			"

												My specs far outweigh the game requirements. Even the intro cinematic lags so much it's unwatchable. 'Nuff said? It would be an 'alright' game if it wasn't incredibly shoddy in terms of how much memory it uses. Many games exist with far higher hardware requirements that run better than this poor example of a 4X game. The battle mechanics are so simple that I'm amazed anyone finds this game challenging. I've had the game for at least a year now and none of the issues I or other players have had have been fixed by any patches or ongoing work. As far as I can tell, this game is a scam. Don't buy it.

												I don't know what people's problem with this game is, it's pretty sweet to be honest. I don't know why there aren't more reviews or why the ones it does have are mixed.It plays like Civ 5, but you choose a hero (mage, ranger, warrior) and you deck him out to take out enemies. You can get more heros later if you can afford them and deck them out and send to war as well. You recruit soldiers to build armies your heros can command, and there are lots of cool fantasy units you can get. There are casters and healers and tanks and archers you can unlock. More fantastical things are in too, like faries and ogres for example, if you conquer neighboring settlements, which you can do through bribes, diplomacy, quests or violence.Technology is a little weird. You unlock new solder types not through a tech tree so much but by building things in your towns. Building upgrades and types offer higher tier soldiers and different soldier types as well as spells your dudes can use in combat. Army composition is important, you will take morale hits if you put in a bunch of paladins with zombies for example, so you want to watch that and recruit accordingly. I got this game on sale but this title is worth the $20; as far as the dlc I bought it with the game so I can't really tell what all that added or not as I haven't looked at it seperately. It's only a few bucks though so may as well pick it up as well imo. I bought this as a cheaper alternative to Age of Wonders and Heros of Might and Magic, so I can't really compare it to them, but judging this game by itself I would say it is a fantastic game by its own merits.

												I must admit all the negative reviews put me off, but most of the top rated reviews were all positive. So I decided to pirate the game to see what it was like. I can honestly say that it was extremely fun and I decided to buy it the next day. For those who are new to the genre or maybe even the game, I recommend using beginner difficulty and playing the tutorial to get a grasp of the game mechanics. It's a fun game that requires you to think tactically on the battlefield and strategically about what 'shard' you want to conquer. It can be difficult at times, especially if you get a bad starting position, however this can be overcome when you get used to the game. However losing a shard isn't game over, as long as you have more than your opponent you're still in with a chance. Look if you're still not sure pirate the game, don't like it don't buy it, if you do like it buy it, simple. :)			"

There are weird graphical glitches where various images (usually heroes or the island images in the astral) don't appear unless you change the graphics options every time you start.

												I love strategy games of the Heroes of Might and Magic and King's Bounty types. But this didn't feel right. It feels slow and starts out too hard for me. You can't level your units properly because they die so easily. You spend your money just buying new ones after each fight.Also, I love combing the maps of these kind of games for every little secret or item or whatnot, but doing this in Eador is no fun. You can sit at the same map square and dig and dig and fight increasingly strong opponents, and it feels like you make no progress. I wound up giving it up and uninstalling it, but maybe you'll have more patience with it. It might be good when you get rolling for real.			"

Where each shard is it's own map and you fly on over to it using a Hero to command troops n'♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's basically like Civs. It's another Civs hexagon RTS game, okay?Anyway, it's buggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥ A.I is dumb, game is unplayable if you've got more than 2 players, the combat is long and can take away from the rest of the game, and the ""auto-fight"" option to skip all that does NOT prioratize your hero (if your hero dies you have to Rez him or create an entire new party of troops to take control/fight for tiles)... so seriously, wtf. There's also no ""free play mode"" so if you want to do what the game advertises you have to play the campaign.I dunno, it's alright, but It becomes more unplayable the longer you play it.

The Kings bounty F2P, is very similar and much better.Example of bug : if a unit dies by retaliation, it is not regarded as dead but continue to stand on the battleground, immune to attack with HP staying at 0.

												I really want to like this game, but it just ends up being shy of good. The game has issues with bugs creaping in, but the developers are generally pretty quick at addressing them. Unfortunately you rarely get a fully working game. As old bugs are squashed, new ones creep in. Also, some bugs just don't go away, the worst is the bug where you can't end your turn. You're required to basically sacrifice your next turn by converting it into 'auto combat'. In many cases this just results in you losing the battle. This means that 5-10% of your battles you are required to reload, purely because they won't/can't fix this bug.There's three aspects to the game. A campaign-wide strategy, a map strategy, and tactical maps/tactics in small combats. Each one is flawed.The Campaign-wide strategy could be very cool, as you earn astral power to augment your next map start, and you selectively choose what building upgrades you can get. Unfortunatly the astral power aspect is far too weak to have any reasonable changes on your map starts. So every map you start (which will be 10's if not 100's of times in a single campaign) is exactly the same thing. It gets repetitive.The map strategy involves taking provinces and as you progress to diposing 1-N enemies on the map, but once you take a province you can instantly plop down a guard for the garrison, which is 1/10th the cost of the troops you would normally have to buy, and regularly a lot better than any troops anyone can produce. This means the game behoves rushing early on and plopping down guards, two of which the AI gains bonuses and cheats to accomplish.Finally, the tactical combat is exeedingly simplistic. The AI does the same thing irrespective of the map or your compliment. There is no concept of ""threatened zones"" around your characters, so AI troops will run through your line and attack things behind you, turning the game into just balling your troops up, and your tactics are limited by the kharma system.The game has a ""kharma"" system that is based on your actions and the results of the campaign, which would seem like a good idea. Unfortunately, the kharma system limits what troops you can acquire or use, and these limits have absolutely zero relation with your actions. The ""good"" kharma units are slow and expensive, while the ""evil"" kharma units are generally glass cannons. Since your world map size/complement would dictate which tactics you would want to do, the strategic aspects of kharma basically have negative correlary to the tactical aspects of kharma. Combined with the fact you're limited in the number of units you can build at any rank/tier, this means that if you start in a small shard with the zerg units (which since every shard is the same, is almost always the best early option) you're now locked out of the other units.The concept of the game is great, but in practice the limits on troops, building ranks, and the failing of the astral campaign options results in a very tedious game where your choices are generally limited not by any sort of story or strategy, but just purely pragmatic necessities.

												Before anything I enjoy this game.I have played strategy games like total war, Crusader kings 2, etc...I have played fantasy games like skyrim, dragon age, witcher, etc...I have not played games like might and magic. I have heard this game is kind like might and magic.This game is kind of a mix of a total war campaign with lots of magic in it. You control genrals/heros and you move them around and level them up in an rpg type of way. The reason I can not recommend this game is because once you take about 30 to 40 turns into the game the AI wait time is painfully slow on like 2 AI oppents. If you have 16 right at the start it takes a while.I like the game but it feels slows very slow and as i said the wait time just sucks. I like how you build your own castle and put different type of buildings for your heros and purchase new equipment.and 1 more thing before im done. When a village or town is mad at you. You really dont know why their so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at you. I mean if a story thing pops up and you pick say kill half the people in the town then ya you know why.

												UPDATE 1/2016:A lot of the bugs seem to be fixed, though a few might remain. I'm switching this to a *very cautious* thumbs up. (By the way, my hours in the game are exaggerated. One of the many bugs is that when the game crashed, it didn't end the process in the task manager. So, I once had the process running for a week straight, adding a couple hundred hours to my play time).ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:So many bugs! I really really want to enjoy this game. And for long stretches, I do enjoy it... and then a gamebreaking bug causes all of my progress to be lost. This happens over and over again. I keep coming back, so at its heart it is a good game. Every time there is a patch to fix a bug, several new bugs pop up in its place. Most recently, they put out a big patch, calling it free DLC, and supposedly fixed bugs. It introduced an obvious, gamebreaking bug right up front that makes the game unplayable (enemy units won't die, they just sit on the battlefield at 0 health).Here is a list of some other bugs I've encountered in previous builds, some of which may still be present (I don't know, since the game is unplayable on the first shard now)1) I attacked another master, and won the final battle to take the shard. This results in a ""game over"" screen (this ruined my longest campaign, and even happened when I went to beat a different shard first, then returned to that master).2) My provinces are invincible. An enemy master will defeat my guards at a province, then retreat the next turn, with the province still under my control and my guards at full health3) I attack a province and end up in a mirror match, where I control both of my identical armies against one another. No matter which side wins, I both win and lose the battle. 4) Game freezing and crashing to desktop immediately after conquering a shard. It goes to the main astral screen, the conquered shard comes towards my shard, and the game crashes as soon as they merge. 5) The enemy AI completely forgetting to play the game. I once took over an entire master's shard with the enemy hero having never been beyond one hex of his capital. This was on a large map.I cannot recommend this game in its current state. It's been a year of heartache for me, since I want to play through a campaign so badly, and I keep trying, but it's just getting worse.			"

												Let me start off by saying that I've been playing all types of strategy games for nearly 25 years.  This game has potential.  I found myself trying to figure out how to reach the higher level content once I managed to level my hero up.  Many of the quests were extremely hard at the beginning stages of the game and added to the frustration of leveling up.  Basic units are no match to even the most beginning level ""monsters"".The economy is unbalanced.   Unit maintenance is very high in relation to the amount of coin that you bring in from provinces.  Building costs are low which allows for quick building.   This will allow you to access units for purchase fairly quickly.  However, it doesn't seem to matter that much because there is a logistical issue with your hero only being able to hold 4 troop types at lower levels.  Even after leveling up to level 4, a hero still can only hold 4 troop types.  It is very difficult to level your units and keep your favorite units around.  Combat is unbalanced.I'm not sure if it's a bug, but my garrison was transferred to another province when an uprising occured in that province.  I would expect the garrison to stand and fight.The loot part of the game was very cool at first.  But there's no originality to the items.  Many of them are common low level items that don't help out too much.  Most of the game is loot based with low drop rates.There are several bugs that cause the game to freeze/crash in the middle of the game.  This is not a huge issue though considering the game saves every 2 seconds.If this game got some balance tweeks, item updates, bug fixes it would be a much more fun game to play.  It feels like the developers wanted to portray the look and feel of a 4x strategy game with all of the bells and whistles , but forgot the underlying basic game mechanics. "

												Eador is billed as a stategy game and tries to combine Empire building 4x themes with turn based 'tactical' battles. Although the ideas are sound the execution is pretty bad. Everything seems a bit off at first and the feeling only grow the more you play it. Call it lack of polish or simply the mark of an 'indie' studio, the result is still the same...Not very fun. The tactical battles as gimped with an impossibly small field of battle (units are constantly getting in each others way if you have more than 5-6 units and archers and mages can wipe you out from across the map) and poor unit balance. Even on the easiest difficulty level the fights go from very easy to frustrating. Before the battle the game gives you an indication of how tough a fight will be but even fights that ""You will win easily"" can be a total wipe unless you use all your units in perfect coordination. i wish I would have had the willpower to play more to see if it improves but the game is simply not fun...

												I've never been able to complete this game due to the game crippling ""pointer errors"" which regularly occur. They are a game ending, campaign crippling, bug that despite being reported numerous times over the years hasn't been fixed.Worse, an expansion for this game just came out... so odds are these pointer errors will never be fixed. Since the expansion is using the same game engine it is highily likely that these unfixed pointer errors will still occur even in the expansion.It is a shame really. Aside from the pointer errors which prevent you from ever finishing the campaign and experiencing all of its extremely well written story its overall a great game with some awesome concepts and I'd recommend it, but when it can't be completed, never gets fixed, and then the company moves on to making another game using the same (likely still broken) game engine... I can't recommend that to anyone.			"

												Eador is a game I have put off reviewing for quite some time and sitting down to play it I can remember why.Difficult to learn, difficult to master, best sum up Eador.If you are familiar with Heroes of Might and Magic then Eador is a familiar beast and just like those games you control a single hero who in turn controls an army. You are not limited to just one hero however and as long as you have the resources your army can be as big as you like. I am going to assume however that you are unfamiliar with HoM&M and even if you are, Eador is a different beast altogether. It's main gimmick is shards, that is each map is its own contained world so when you conquer one shard you move onto the next.The game also features an ambigious moral choice system and certain units do or do not like being teamed up with others. Holy Paladins for example are not pleased by having to work with blood sucking vampires and such combinations will affect morale. Let morale get too low and units will flee the battlefield.Already you can see a lot of systems are in play in this game and it isn't a bad game either. Complex doesn't have to mean 'bad' or 'begineer-unfriendly' but many things are randomized. You might get a start location with nearby provinces you have little chance of taking over and no resources to bribe them with. A province by the way is akin to a second city or to extending your domain so basically you want them if you can get them.I really could go on and on about every little system but a game stands or falls on one thing. Is it fun? For me Eador is middle ground. It is not a bad game at all and if you like games such as Civilization 5 or Endless Legend you will find yourself slowly adapting to Eador but for me I grew up on Heroes of Might & Magic so I want to love Eador and instead I find myself being SUPER ANNOYED at the game lying to me so much!3 Medusas? Yeah it'll be fine, we'll slaughter them. Lied the game shortly before I reloaded my last save.6 Peasants? We stand no chance! Lied the game again and I wiped them out with no issues.Lying is a harsh word but that is certainly what it feels like at times. The game will tell you that wizards can attack at range, but forgets to tell you that they need a wand to do so. A wizard is a hired hero and hiring is expensive so if your wizard doesn't come with a wand, your hosed. You have to spend more money to build a shop that sells wands. The game will tell you that a unit has a certain range like 3 or 4 but you get into a fight and it forgets to mention all the modifiers that effect the range like trees or hills.And this is the begineer difficulty, with tutorials turned on! As you get better at the game you learn to ignore the lies as you have a good idea of what kills what and who to fight or who to avoid but I can't help but feel like Eador sabotaged itself. This game should be as big as the remade Kings Bounty games with over a million copies shifted or something I mean this game is good enough to be a Civ5 contender, but due to the steep learning curve I imagine many people are just turned off and stop playing, I know I did.Music is more of background noise, I honestly mentally tuned it out. Sound effects are funny, spiders sounds like jewels falling down an escalator but as I always say about sound effects, they are not the biggest factor. Graphics? Game looks wonderful! Really, the art is great it really is and their is so much of it you won't take it all in until after a few hours of playing.Overall Eador is a niche game for a niche market and that is a huge shame. I stand by what I said when I said this game should be up there as a contender for Civ5 but as it stands many will have looked Eador over for Endless Legend and I personally think Eador is the better game but its amazing the difference some handholding and a tutorial can do.The game does have a manual but I think that should be within the game itself like Civ5's civilpedia. I can't recommend this game to the majority of people but if you read this far then you will have a good idea if this is the kind of game for you or not, for most people they will struggle to get into this game and when they do the small playerbase will struggle to keep them.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

However, it's a buggy mess and it's become clear the developers have made no real effort to fix them.  It's clear they've been concentrating on releasing their new stand alone expansion that's in early access.

Horrible graphics, broken controls, stuttering animations and constant framerate drops. What could've been a good game was ultimately a horrible mistake. The only redeeming thing about this game was it was cheap when I bought it. But a dollar wasted is still a dollar wasted.

												You play as a God that wishes to beat other Gods, your goal is to seek out shards that the world broke into. Your way of doing this is to use heros! You use these heros,that command armies, to take out your foes. I get that using mortals to do your dirty work is what is normally propagated for strategy games, since Gods are ""far too powerful"" to be harmed. However this leaves a lack luster appeal for anyone expecting to play a game that moves beyond M&M (Might and Magic).			"

												I wanted to love Eador, but after a couple of painful hours that felt like a total slog, I just had to give up trying.  There are a lot of complex systems that the developers have obiovusly spent a lot of time thinking about, and I commend them for that... I can see what their vision was.  Unfortunately the core of the gameplay - the battle system - is pedestrain to the point of being drab and boring, and that drags everything else down.  If a patch came out to make combat more dynamic and strategic then I'd be all in for re-trying Eador, but until that happens I can't give the game a thumbs up.			"

												I've never seen so much needless repetition in a game, which sucks because with a few tweaks Eador would be superb! But you will quickly see (within the first non-tutorial map) that the game is incredibly repetitive and grindy.There is a concept of exploring provinces which is good but the execution is bad: Exploring takes many turns and you have to tell your heroes to ""Continue exploring"" every. single. turn. You may even get more than one hero to do this, so you will be clicking OK a lot. This really should be automatic.You can then ""visit"" the locations you have found while exploring, which you will usually do this with your strongest hero. When visiting locations, any scouting information you accrued is lost and you're given no indication of the fight difficulty (if there is one) until you spend a turn. Both issues could have been covered in a 'are you sure?' prompt when selecting locations.You're supposed to hire heroes and support them with an army. But I found it much easier to just hire a tough warrior hero and equip them with all the stuff you find from visiting locations. After a while they become invincible and can just stomp on everything. Armies are too expensive/upgrading heroes via equipment is too cheap.Managing your kingdom is a horrible experience. You can only reinforce one village guard and build one building in one province per turn. Your kingdom will typically consist of dozens of provinces, making this incredibly tedious and difficult to keep track of. These limits could be removed.Finally, there are too many random events. They can fire off for multiple provinces every. single. turn. Many events have multiple stages, depending on what choice you make. Do you care that there is a minor event in the insignificant province of Backwater Dump that might affect the citizens in some vague, indiscernable manner? The game believes you should. These events could have been more rare and had a larger impact.So, Eador is entertaining and has great concepts but terrible execution. I can't recommend it when there are better games like it out there (Age of Wonders, Heroes of Might and Magic 3/5).			"

												You can blame me for not playing it enough, but after over 10h of playtime, the game did not get me hooked, not at all.And i honestly think it's sad. The art is amazing, the sound atmospheric, the story... might be interesting, i can barely tell though and i think you can see the love and thought which went into this game, there are a lot of nice concepts packed into it. But, for me, the actual gameplay is so horrible that i don't even want to touch it anymore despite all the things that seem so nice about it.Here is why: I like turn based strategy games, i've been playing Heroes of Might and Magic (oh no, so mainstream?!) since decades, tried every installement and Eador reminds me very much of it. But, while Heroes is definetly not the fastest game, it has a pace i can go along with, its mechanics interlock well into one another (usually, not the same for all of them and all the titles), so it is nice to be invested in them, fighting your way through the campaign with what little things might be given to you, or watching your puny town thrive to a huge empire in an open game, or make to many or one big mistake and probably fail. I think, this is not the case in Eador. There is a lot you can do, but to me none of it felt like i was achieving anything. Spending dozens of turns to explore one area, most of which is delivered in text, sometimes fighting encounters, most of which appeared meaningless to me, sometimes dieing to a threat i couldn't even determine beforehand, or when the game even told me ""this should be easy"" and my units get one-hitted one after another, because i coudln't know better - more than once, but then, maybe i could have known better after the first time - careing less and less about the individual parts of the game because it feels so tedious, until i even started skipping most encounters and finaly stopped playing.So, i can't recommend it despite all its nice parts, because, after 10 hours of playtime, the game should have proven to me why i should care to carry on and not feel like a bunch of tasks i ought but not like to do to maybe get anywhere.

												Aptly named title. With a significant overhaul this game could be something but in its current state it is badly ""broken"". This game will frustrate which makes it in many ways worse than a overtly bad game (at least with a bad game you could move on). As it is this one will have you going, ""I wonder if it would be different if I tried this... or this..."". It won't be. As things go this game prescribes too tightly the path you must take to be successful. Buy these units, not those ones, do things in this order and this way. Fight this, don't fight that until this, etc.As a huge fan of TBS and fantasy genre and long time (decades) player of same. I don't recommend this game. What I do recommend is that some developers out there learn from these guys mistakes and make the game that this should have been.EDIT/TLDR: Buy Age of Wonders III instead...			"

												Games are meant to be fun, not a chore to play.  This game is so close to being fun, but with the silly randomness of events and the rediculous amount of freebies the computer is awarded all aspects of enjoyment are gone.  I would rather say this game is recommended, but just cannot without that factor being present.  You need to first slowly, oh so slowly, level you starting hero in order to explore with you weak units in order to gain xp, gold and gems for encountering the computer opponents.  Then just when you can expand out farther the computer jumps in, starting at peace and hopefully remaining there long enough for you to gain units that can tackle the outer rings of territories.  Usually however you cannot get those units in enough time for the computer to declare war, and then steamroll over you with a hero that is 5 levels or more above yours and bringing in tier 3 (sometimes tier 4) units when you have only reached tier 2 units last turn.  Then on each level (shard) taking 2-3 hours to complete and then having no feeling of accomplishment ruins the game in my opinion.There is just something missing.  Games can, and should, be hard, in order to advance mastery of the game for good, hard fun to occur; at some level of hard however a game becomes stupid.  This game is at the border of this at this time.			"

												Fun the first few times. Then the campaign devolves into conquering the next shard and the next shard and the next shard, making you incremenally more efficient at repeating the process. The rate of progression is geological in span, and the idea that there are mildy autistic masochists out there who have completed this game enough time to see multiple endings (the game has an end?) boggles the mind. It also possesses a considerable number of never-explained and grotesquely unfair gameplay mechanics each of which will make you lose a level at least once. Then a little Gremlin taunts you.Avoid.

This game was a mess in April of 2013 and it is still a mess today.  The game is crawling with stability issues. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME OR THE DLC. Snowbird needs to learn the lesson that no one care about new content or features when the game just plain does not work.			"

												I'd really like to recommend this game, but I can't, really.It's just so good in its basic premise, and the execution is not half bad either, but some bad design and balance decisions make it a sad game to play. After a while you understand just how badly the AI cheats, how only one character class is truly good (warrior, solo all enemies, all armies), and the crash bugs finally get to you..In short, I probably wouldn't get this unless the game balance is addressed. If you got a fun and balanced game, even crash bugs don't bother you because you just reboot it and continue. A bad game, even if technically perfect, you just won't want to play at all			"

												I played a long time this game, but I cannot reccomend it.Postitive:- Pretty for a tactical game- they have fixed most/all bugs- lot of differents units with unique abilities - complexe tactical gameNegative:- too oriented around the tactical combat (stratgic layer is interesting but most of your time will be spent doing combat)- hard to learn as you need to know each unit as some unit are totally overporwered and can wipe a whole army if you have nothing to counter them (example ghost are pretty much invulnerable against everything and are killed in one specific spell)- unit tier X are way more powerful than unit of the lower tier. It seems fun but if you combine with the fact you start from scratch each map, it makes the first hour a repetitive grind before your reach unit of tier 2- bad evaluation of automatic combat (making risky to automate even a simple fight)And the most regretaable that could be really improved by mod done by users, but the game cannot support mod...

												+ The overworld is nice looking. + Has a cute town upgrade system that shows the new buildings and technologies.+ Units and monsters are detailed and well animated, though some animations are over-long.+ / - Quite slow and very long. Each province needs capturing, then you can usually fight one or two side battles there straight away, then upgrade it (one building per turn only), then 'exploring' to quell overpopulation (about 5% explored per turn, totally automated, no actual walking around or exploration) which uncovers more battles. With over a dozen provinces per stage there is an awful lot of content, albeit drip-fed.- Unfulfilling, slow combat.- Even with a huge advantage, using the auto-battle will get half your force killed.- The battles really don't have much to do with 'strategy and tactics'. The battlefields are so small, so full of terrain and your army so comparatively huge that you almost run out of room to deploy them (leading to just plonking them down wherever you can), units get in each other's way, leading to fiddly, grindy crawls across a map dominated by choke points. Pretty shallow, more about numbers than anything else.If you like more board-gamey strategy games (like FF Tactics) then you might like this. But otherwise, don't bother.			"

												Really dont get the difficulty settings in this game, I completed the first turtorial shard and it was super easy and then i tried the official first shard of the game and lost in first 6 turns so i lowered the difficulty, this time after 8 turns my units were finally able to attack and capture a province at which point the enemy showed up with 16 units and slaughterd me. So this time i tried on the easiest difficulty setting, i got a good hero leveled him up to 15 lasted for 3 hours just continusly building holding off the enemy but then another enemy player showed up who was apparently working with this player and they both attacked me from both sides and again I lost. I try defend i cant hire units to guard my province, the enemy with 1 province remaing can capture one of mine then instantly spawn an army of 10 highly trained archers to hold it for him while my hero can only hold 5 units. Its just redicolous and enraging. Sure i might not fully understand the game yet but i dont think a game should be this hard to pick up espically on the lowest difficulty setting when there are 8 settings to choose from. Otherwise im still disappointed nothing really carrys over from the shards so theres not much point trying to get the best items or units because you will just lose them. The shards are unoriginal and get repetitive very fast and the manual combat is boring, the maps are to small, after a certain point my archer hero could sit in a corner doing 12+ damage to anyone the moment they spawned, theres not enough tactics to manual combat to make it worth while, meanwhile the automatic combat seems to be just odds, my hero will say something like ""this battle is going to be easy"" yet all my units and hero will die to units they should of been able to kill easily. The whole game seemed very unbalanced which just ruined it for me. Definatly no match for some of the other games i love that are similar to this like Age of wonders. I cant recommend this game even though the tutorial was fun at i thought it was going to be amazing.			"

												This game is intriguing at first, and the tutorial even tricks you into thinking it will be fun. This is far from the reality of the game. In truth, even the beginning difficulty level is more frustrating than it is worth. I have tried multiple strategies from single to multiple heroes of different classes, conservative and liberal spending. None of it matters. By the time you get any momentum in the game you are harried by your opponent and relentlessly picked off. If resources were plentiful this would be an acceptable challenge as you could build your defenses, hire support, and actually dream to achieve something. The problem is that when this happens you are typically stretched. Conservative play is likely key, but to be honest - I don't f*ing play a game to sit around for hours twiddling my thumbs. Yes, it's strategy, but different people like different strategy. I for one do not like this one. I'd rather play Civ, or most any other tactics game. Save your time and money - and buy something better.			"

												This game is addictive, and the game play is fun, but they have some serious file handling errors.  Their file handling errors manifest it two ways.  The first is that if you try to attack the wrong shard the game will crash during the first save event.  The second is that if you try to attack the wrong enemy on a shard and the game will freeze.   I don’t know what’s going on, but this is pretty basic stuff.  It is kind of surprising that they could create the graphics and gameplay that they have and yet still not even manage programing 101 file handling issues.Here’s the use case that ruins the game for me.  I have three shards that I can attack.  Two of them will cause the game to crash during the first save event.  The third freezes every time I try to invade a territory controlled by the last of four enemies.  As such, there is now no way for me to even attempt to continue, let alone win, the game.  I guess that I could just kill off all of my heroes, dismiss all of my guards and troops, and then wait for the last enemy to conquer my castle, but who would want to do that?  Besides, there is no guarantee that surrendering this shard will allow for the creation of a shard that won’t crash.It looks like this game will be really fun someday.  But until they fix there file handling issues it is just frustrating.  As such, I wouldn’t recommend buying it until after they fix these bugs. "

												The game has three tiers. On campaign level you conquer ""shards"" that give you new technologies and buildings, and compete with other NPCs. Each conquest happens on a map where you and your opponent have a castle, raise an army and fight for territories and resources. Finally, each fight happens on a tactical hex map.Campaign level is little more than a sequence of missions. You have some choice on what to attack next, but it does not matter much. It is extremely long, and most will stop playing before end. After playing 200 hrs I am about halfway.Arena level is fun, but NPC is not competitive - its just something to kill when you want the arena to end. The fun comes out of selecting a sequence of fights to level up your hero and your castle. Its somewhat similar to King's Bounty in play style - you pick fights, your hero levels up, you can now win harder fights, but there is no hurry to do something by set time.The tactical fights are reasonably entertaining, units have various spefical abilities and immunities that you have to keep in mind, there are spells, tile bonuces, fatigue influence etc.This would be a very good game, if not for bugs. Bugs! When I bought it a year ago, it was essentially unplayable, so I let it settle down for a while. Now it is somewhat better, but still, hourly crashes, NPC units endlessly going in circles, lockdowns, corrupted saves... when half of the challenge in a fight comes not from defeating an enemy, but from avoiding triggering the known bugs, the game definitely has quality problems... and if they didn't fix it by now I guess they never will.So... I am not recommeding it because of bugs.			"

												This is an interesting game, which sadly suffers from dated mechanics.  While I'm posting this as a negative recommendation, if it's on sale, and you enjoy this genre it's certainly worth picking up, but with the current choice on the market there are just better options out there in the turn based strategy feel.The slow development of technology from shard to shard is a great selling point of the game, as is the picking and choosing of which shards to capture to add to your range, however the starting afresh on every shard gets old very fast, and the interface is not particularly friendly.

												I tried to like this game, I really did, but the game is way too unbalanced and way too RNG dependent in order to be good.The game is pretty simple, kind of like some sort of Total War TBS. The object is to conquer shards by taking each enemy's capital, then move onto the next using advantages you gained in prior shards. Combat is grid based on a board with your soldiers. Each army is led by a hero and they all have their own special powers. Seems just like my kind of game.UNFORTUNATELY... the game is just broken in a number of ways. The shards are randomly generated and sometimes you can just get a trash start where it's very difficult to take neutral territories while the AI proceeds to take everything else. And on the topic of the AI... its cheating is in a league of its own. I've never seen anything like it in a game. The AI will do insane things like get tier 2 guard units before you even have access to them in game, all but insuring capturing their capital is nearly impossible. The same with spells. Tier 4 spells that one shot your entire army, super rare items, endless pools of gold... I've had the exact situation, where the AI was down to maybe 4 provinces and I had the entire map, but they would pop out heroes and full armies like it was nothing, all while their capital was defended by Centaurs, a tier 2 unit, that would utterly destroy even the best army I could muster since I hadn't even unlocked any tier 2 units!! By the way, this was on the 3rd from lowest difficulty, where the game still gives you advantages. Even when you don't get completely screwed with RNG and do pretty well all this cheating makes the game extremely tedious. Especially the guards. More often than not you need to grind up to beat them, sometimes for a long, long time. And you know what? In  the end, the AI cheating really doesn't make it that much harder. It just makes it take much, much longer.Add in some bugs plus a less than stellar UI and you have Eador in a nutshell. If it were less tedious it'd be a pretty fun game. As it is though? I suppose it's better than Warlock, but that's all I can really give it.			"

												Despite the ongoing support, consistent patching, and free mini-DLC, Masters of the Broken World is still Masters of the Broken Game (hahaha, I'm so good). This is essentially the original Eador with some additional bells and whistles, but little expansion on the existing features.There's really no reason to play this installment when the original Eador plays much more smoothly, actually works half the time, and isn't nearly as buggy. Even the interface in this game is more unfriendly, which is saying something when the original Eador's interface was just a mad collection of buttons.Eventually, it might match up to its predecessor, but with the mods and stability offered in the original, there's really no reason to get Masters of the Broken World right now, especially since it costs more.

												I played this game enough to NOT recommend people to buy it, at least not right now. Since the beginning of every game depends on luck, the loading time is way too long, AI turn take forever from mid game to late game. Talking about the AI, he cheat too much.  If you did not have a perfect beginning, some luck with event, he will destroy you. They need to fix the loading time and the AI before I recommend this game.			"

												Apperently the game is entirely or borderline broken on some systems. I played this a bunch when I first bought. Tried reinstalling on a PC a while later and there's no way I can get the game to run now. I have installed on several drives, form several compatibility modes, run all the suggested fixes from PCgamingwiki but to no avail.  This is not an isolated case. Looking for fixes, I found post after post of users with similar issues and no working solutions.  Shame. It's a great game, on level with HOMM3, I'd say, but I cannot recommend a game that has a risk of simply not working no matter what you do.			"

												The tutorial took 3 hours and that was one of the most boring experiences I've ever had playing a video game.  I honestly can't think of a worse way to introduce your game to new players then what I just went through.  The basic game mechanics seemed backwards compared to every other game of this genre I've played.  Why would you make a move then wait for next turn to see how that move worked out, why doesn't it just happen now...  Other overworld mechanics appeared to exist only to increase the amount of ""grinding"" you could achieve as a player.  The combat mechanics were even worse, the basic UI had enough numbers floating around that you would generally have no idea what nay of them specifically meant.  The ""guide"" dialouge to tell you how difficult an encounter would be how wrong about as often as it was right.The music was repetitive beyond all measure, the sound effects and animations were amateurish. This game may have been a competitor with Heroes of Might and Magic 1 but nothing in that genre that's been created sense.  It is possible that if you're willing to give this game more of a chance then I did there is a good game waiting for you on the other end, but I can't imagine it.			"

You click auto combat then your unitd start to hit the already dead creature. Who strikes back and moves and attacks normally in its own turn (while being already dead). Very often the creature manages to kill one of your units or even your hero. The bug was in the game since day one and still in it as of 2016-03-15.			"

												I'm on the fence about this game. On one hand it is a fairly fun. The game structure works for me, but there is a lot of missed potential. The AI is either too easy, or just tedious to play against. The story mode takes too long before you unlock even half the units. I'm 40 hours in and have unlocked about half. This wouldn’t be so bad, but the game starts to get repetitious when you get one new unit, that you probably wont use, every few hours. I ended up putting the game down when this repetition got to me.			"

												The basic game play in Eador is fine and enjoyable.  I like the character classes, items, building options, etc.,  but the game becomes too repetitive.  Each level you have to start over and do basically the same thing again and again.  And those basic functions like clearing land are too slow and become a grind.  With a few tweaks to speed up game play I would have recommended the game, but as is it is just not quite there.			"

												A complex and rich game worth your time if you like grinding and continually losing units to overpowered enemies - while the new units you buy are rank zero cannon fodder. The game continually throws at you events that make you lose land you have dearly fought over. You may build ONE building over your whole empire PER TURN, and your units recover ONE life point PER TURN. You'll spend the first few hours of a game waiting for your units to heal.""Easy"" difficulty means ""♥♥♥♥ you"" as the whole experience has been carefully balanced to make you rage quit as soon as possible.

												Well, some nice ideas, but done really really badly, and overall it quickly get's boring. Instead of something really creative, most of the hero progress/cash gain is thorugh random events generated by ""exploring"".  And realy while you theoretically can have many heroes for a HUGE part of each game you will walk with single army.  Basically because for one thing you will not be able to buy and maintain 2 heroes (even with easiest setting you will burn out starting gold too fast without building up the armies/heroes to conquer anything) And the difficulty of encounters is badly scaled - at the beginning you struggle in each fight, and then very suddenly you trample most enemies. There are still many bugs. For example before each encounter the game describes the opponent and tries to give some sumary on the chances. Not only the ""estimate"" is most often dead wrong (""no losses"" is impossible and from some ""hard"" fights you come unscrathed). And that is particularily annoying because sometimes some bug causes the part of description with enemies  While the city building and expanse seems interesting and complex at first, it quickly becomes obvious it's really primitive. This is because in longer run most of the possible building choices are not really viable (You can build almost useless trash buildings or buy the few needed or save the cash)While your troops can gain experience and level, in most cases it affects them in pretty minimal way. And the game fight system is not setup in a way that would promote the ""leveling"" of units, as they are hard to level and easy to kill.Overall the game suffers from randomness in just about anything.

												Found this game to be very repetitive and the only play style that worked for me was to be aggressive with the hero from the go. Since if you go slow, the enemy hero finds you and walks right through all your defences.  Whoever has the strongest hero wins especially with the weak units you use for most of the game, the hero can crush entire armies when he gets high enough and the mage class is useless for the most part. The campaign is like an endless restarting skirmish mode, where you start off the same each time with maybe a couple different enviromental effects and the possiblity of one more building which you earned last time. This gets old fast and it almost seems like you aren't making any progress with a vague reason to keep you going. So if you are wanting one or two skirmishes its ok, it also look and plays fine. Would however only say to get this game if its on sale to play a little to see what its like but for the most part its too repetitive for me.			"

												Game play is top notch with meaningful descisions presented to the player quite often. However the crashes to desktop are very nearly a game breaker. Many other games would be gathering dust with half the bugs and crashing this game has, a testement to the nature of the gameplay. If ever the developer finally irons out thier customer service and bug fixing issues (after a year and a half my prediction is that they will not), they will have a true classic on thier hands. If you can tolerate a campaign that drops you to desktop every 5-8 turns or so, you will love this game. If however you can not give this title a wide berth.			"

												Grab it on sale, if it sounds interesting to you. Otherwise... skip it.I have played 3 days worth on it and I honestly can't say any one part of it wants me to come back to try it again after letting it go for a while.Don't get me wrong, it has elements and aspects that are just begging to be a great game - but it is just not mixed well enough to make it there. Pieces of the game's RNG engine that determines the perks you gain by shards play havok with how to progress, making the game mixture so unevel you'll go through the game and realize you missed out on over two-thirds of the content for no real reason.It has so much, but so little to make you inclined to use it, its almost... forgettable.To me, that's kinda sad, especially since I can clearly remember the gameplay as to actually be that good, addictive ""one more turn"" element to it.It has promise, a massice selection of options, but the mixture on how its done makes it so uneven you'll forget what you could have done after you finish it.Its a passable game, about averate of what's to expect for the turn-based strategy - but nothing truly noteworthu  outside its concept. Some growth and development aspects that limit and help lean the player towards one style or another are truly good, but it cuts out so much of viable options thanks to the sheer quantity its such a shame on the balance scale of what could have been.

I dont want to have to be a grand master at the inside tricks specific to a given game just to see whats in the game. How hard is it to understand? A retard baby should be able to face roll the keyboard and play the game at beginner level. It is for people who have never seen a video game before in their lives. The game desperately needs a trainer so you can speed up the game play and not spend turn after turn sitting and waiting for your resources to slowly inch up. There is an incredible depth of detail in this game but dont worry you will never see it because its impossible to see it at the levels you encounter it and you wont stick around long enough to reach end game where you cant go back and see the stuff you passed up on the way.

												Ok so let me start of by saying this game is not only called masters of the broken world for nothing. A.K.A. the game world is littered with bugs and I just came to a game breaking bug that will not allow me to continue no matter what save I load. This game is a wonderful game in the sense of atmosphere and gameplay, but the insane amount of glitches, errors, crashes and now completely broken game is just to much even for such a game full of such potential.In case you think it is my specs, I have an I7 with 12gb ram and a GTX 850 with almost a tera left.

												It's just extremely extremely extremely repetitive. For every new shard, play with a brand new hero. Build the exact same buildings and units over. Fight the same battles in the same way over.Part of the problem is that it's not balanced. Certain units are just SO superior to others, and the difficulty can be punishing, which has you using those same units and fighting in the same way over and over.Basically, once you've won one shard, you've won them all.

												Is Eador a good game? Yes. Is Eador: Masters of the Broken World better than its predecessor, Eador: Genesis? Not really.Gameplay-wise, they are practically the same game, and though MotBW has updated the graphics rather nicely, I would consider whether or not a graphical upgrade is worth the extra $14 you'd save buying Genesis.

												Eador: Masters of the Broken World... What has it brought to us? A fine picture, a new DLC (which you will rarely use to your advantage) and a damn lot of bugs! First of all, the game is not optimized at all! Its graphics are not so great, because it's just a turn-based strategy, but is uses more resources than Skyrim until it just refuses to work. Relaunching the game may help, but I want to play, not launch it over and over again. But that's not all. Tons of bugs still occur after so many updates. Devs, are you sure you fix them? I don't see it. Just two days ago, it crashed, when I attempted to conquer a new shard and no matter how many times I reloaded the game and the save file, it was crashing in the same place. Do I have to begin it from the very beginning after so many hours of playing to get the same error again someday?! Oh, come on...New DLC... Yeah, it's fun sometimes, but that's not what I expected. It could have been much better! You just have some new units for the creatures you can make an alliance with, but if you have a troll or a minotaur, then you won't use them at all, because they are too week. And completing some tasks becomes more difficult, because, if you need to kill 10 dwarves, you'll have to kill 100 dwarves and that's not funny at all. Tastes differ, I know, but I liked the Eador: Genesis's interface more. It looked better and worked better. It was more convenient. Another thing that I did not like at all! The game has become easier! A damn lot easier compared to Eador: Genesis. When you attempt to conquer a shard, you've got 3-4 new building to acquire... When you finally conquer a shard, you get 7-8 new buildings! And how am I supposed to call that bonus? Yeah, a piece of s**t! It just ruins all the fun! You don't have to plan ahead, you don't have to choose wisely which shard you should conquer next. And in the end (if you get to it, because it can crash anytime, as I mentioned above) you have to (yes, you HAVE to) conquer EMPTY shards! And you know what? It pisses me off to waste time like that! The result: yes, Eador: Genesis is older, it doesn't have that pretty though useless DLC, it's not 3D, it doesn't have these pretty (also quite useless though) achievements in Steam, but it works well and it's more challenging, and that is why I'll choose that old beauty instead of this new piece of garbage! So, as you have already guessed, I do NOT recommend it!			"

												I really wanted to like this and played it a good amount, but there's really too much in the game. You can explore a single province and tackle it's encountes a ton, which is generally more valuable than the eXpand part of 4x. There's sort of multiple meta games, the adventure and the mega map.In theory, that'd be right up my ally, but in practice it doesn't mesh well. Plus, you MUST have your heroes survive and level and also your units. You can't really ever fail and expect to win, which makes the game a try-reload tactical battle experience rather than a 4x experience.			"

												Good idea, bad game.The game has alot of portential but quickly decent into repetative.The best way to discripe it is:Done one shard done them all.Exploring is fun at first but you quickly learn the right answers for everything and you are just going through the motions.Combat is just as repetive.Sure you heroes are fun and the units leveling up encourge's to keep them alive(save scum).But the fights themself quickly become tiresome.I found myself fighting the same groups over and over.Killing a group of bandits for example stops being fun after the fith time.The game has lot of good idea's(and bugs)But you will spent most of your time feeling ugh again?

												If you were ever fond of the HoMM series but always thought it could use a little Civilization, then this may be the game for you.....Just kidding. Wait until it is at least 75% off or more because, although the ideas are there and it has a decent core like province exploration or the battle system, it lacks with a very tedious middle game on every shard and it constantly crashes on me. The crashes happen mainly when it is loading a large or massive shard but it happens a little too often for me when I'm just ending a turn. Overall, a 6 / 10 game. It needs some love and care from the developers to polish it off. If it never receives that though, maybe don't bother.PS. More than $20 to begin with this game is kind of criminal.			"

												I have spent a long time playing Eador: Masters of the Broken World. I must say that this game is interesting and certainly has the ""Still another turn"" appeal. However, eventually I must admit: it is exceedingòy frustrating. After the few first worlds, that are fairly easy to win, the game becomes very hard. After trying in vain too many times to beat some of the enemy gods for the control of my third or fourth island in sky, I eventually felt disappointed. A game that is too easy to be interesting  becomes quickly annoying, but so does also a game that is just too difficult to be won. When I play I want to have fun. If it is too frustrating, where is the point in continuing?I may be a mediocre strategist, or just right a stupid guy, but I do not enjoy to be systematically punished. So, after too many defeats, the game is no longer on my hard disk, and I felt so well pushing the buttons to disinstall it !			"

												Unfortunately, Eador: Masters of the Broken World, doesn't add anything to the fantasy 4x strategy genre.  The game feels (as in it is) really dated with mechanics, graphics, music and themes that belong at the turn of the century.  Eador would be considered a ""good"" game back then, but it doesn't measure up to what can be done now.  There isn't any story behind any of the game, mechanics are pretty straightforward (meaning uninspired) and don't bring anything we haven't already seen.  You will encounter odd text in tooltips, ranging from some type of humor (which comes out of nowhere) to not helpful at all. You will spend many turns pressing ""next"", which brings the game to another issue: performance.  Turns are pretty long, even from the start.  Considering that this isn't a very complex game to begin with, it  proves that the studio doesn't know how to optimize a game for the current era. There aren't really any options as to who you play as, where you are going or what path to take.  Overall its just a sad, flat, uninspired game that is akin to a sophmore student's project at technical school.  A ""must not"" buy. :/			"

												There are so many negative reviews of this game, and I've enjoyed it so much so far (only 20 hours in but enough to get the jist of it) that I thought I'd write a short review.The are a lot of comments about how difficult this game is.  I rage quit AoW3 quite often, but I've yet to do so here.  If you're completely defeated in battle, you just resurrect after a couple of turns, repair, get more soldiers and carry on.  I'm sure as I get better at battles that will happen less often.  By the time I'd finished the last shard I was on I had a very powerful army.  Play around with different heroes and find one that fits your playstyle.To get started  I watched a couple of videos, played a couple of very short custom games to get the hang of it, and then started the campaign (it's long, and takes you to many different 'shards').I love that this game is different, so much to do, and a huge combination of choices.  It's terrific.  I haven't encountered any bugs either, but most of them were probably soon after release, which is why I bought this version of Eador and not the latest one  just yet.  Read reviews on Rock Paper Shotgun and SpaceSector.com, then add 4 years for bug fixing. "

												Excellent, truly excellent game. I am a player of fantasy based games and this stands out as one of the best. True, it is a game that will challenge you greatly, maybe even frustrate you at the start but the campaign is very well thought out and enjoyable with several threads. The sandbox game allows you to choose levels of difficulty and size of the shard that you wish to conquer. You might want to follow Martin Fencka's Lets Play on Youtube as I have learned so much from following him as he has played through over 300 parts of an LP. Its a complex game but extremely rewarding.As I write this review, you can buy the game at 80% off. A great opportunity to open up hours of challenging gameplay.			"

												I picked up this game because Heroes VII was so terrible when it was first released - I had been pumped to grab Heroes VII, but I was driven to look at alternatives.  Eador MOTBW (along with Sorcerer King) looked like they might fit the bill.My first impression of Eador was ""this is kind of like the HOMM series, but different""; that impression persists to this day.  My first attempt at playing Eador was symied by my lack of understanding of the overall campaign mission; I stopped for a while.  When I returned to it, I had done a bit of reading and the game made much more sense.Pros:  Great combat mechanics, great visuals overall, great soundtrack.Cons:  One last remaining hard-crash bug; it seems to pop up after I've loaded saved games multiple times in a single setting.  Closing out of the game and opening again always fixes it.  Autosave prevents any significant loss of progress.  The only other con is campaign strategy-related (spoiler here):  Following the ""Erdu"" path, it was not obvious to me that I had to go to shard after shard, finding and battling random locations containing ""demons"" or ""demonologists"" until I reached 100% ... but I eventually figured it out..Overall, it's an excellent game, and I'm certain I will go back and replay it (having multiple success paths and endings helps with this)!

												THIS GAME HAS A LOW SCORE BECAUSE IT USED TO BE COMPLETELY BROKENhaving said that, here is my review.++faction customization, as you go+broad scope of units +vastly non linear gameplay+many ways to play-limited provence interaction-no smooth transition between easy and hard-requires special privileges to avoid crashingConclusion: VERY GOODgonna be short on this one, but do you like RPGs? Do you like strategy? Do you like character building? this is the game for you. Built around forming your faction as you go rather then just making you choose from a set of premade ones the game offers many branching paths for development of both your faction in terms of religion, culture, military, and magic, aswell as for your avatar. There's plenty of hidden things and random encounters to mix things up, aswell as mercs and special weapons to buff your armies. The province interaction is very limited though, and the game suffers from the occasional bug, the difficulty curve is also a bit too steep.Also multiplayer would be good, if anyone still played this game... I give Eador a 7/10			"

												Very nice little game, challenging and requires quite a bit of thought and planning. The beginning is always hard as random events can affect you a lot, but once you get past that stage and build a strong economy, the events are no longer an issue. I love the province locations / quests and units and the way they level up. Some of the gear you can get is ridiculously powerful. Give this game a chance but learn how to play or you will be defeated by the AI easily.			"

												If not for a few niggling balance issues and a stupendously steep learning curve that the inescapable (and long) tutorial only goes part way to covering, this could be one of the best strategy games ever. An unpolished gem for those that can withstand a few hours of frustration while they learn the ropes.			"

												It's a wonderful game that simply has too many bugs/crashes and is more or less abandoned by the developers. I'd pay another ten bucks to have someone 'finish' it, but that'll never happen. Sad! Don't buy - once you love it and you realize that it'll never be what you want it to be (a working full game) you'll be frustrated no end.			"

												A very nice Indie strategic game with elements of HOMM and Total War (campaign turns)			"

												I like the graphics and the combat system, but the map in combat is too small. Think of Heroes of might and magic but instead of squares its hexas and a lot smaller. The game crashes a lot...so much its not even enjoyable watching your friend get mad that he lost his progress. The ai is also a bit passive. So its a gamble if you are going to enjoy it 6.5/10			"

												Highly recommended game if you like RPG/strategy turn-based games like Heroes of Might and Magic / Age of Wonders 2. Coming from Steam GreenLight this game was worth every 15 EUR (50% discounted price)!  I would still not buy the game at the current retail price, but once it's on a sale, do grab it. You will not get dispapointed!			"

												FIRSTLY, be warned that as of the time of this review the mouse is broken in various monitor configurations; after spending heaps of time try to fix it with game settings, a helpful chap gave the tip of right clicking on the EXE and going to the compatibility tab and checking the ""Disable display scaling on HDPI displays"".Great game that fills the perfect gap between RPG and 4X. Not 100% sold on the aesthetic of the landscape terrains but you don't really notice that after a while.			"

												I write this review as a positive with recommendation, but also with a caveat.The game is fun overall, even if it is somewhat repetitive. Enter a new world with a weak hero and basic town, spend a few hours leveling up and conquering it, and then start over. New world, new heroes, same challenge.Where I find fault is that in the campaign there is little to no guidance about how to win the campaign. What are the victory conditions? No one seems willing to write about that aspect, either, I guess for fear of spoilers. So you kind of have to figure out what you must do to win, and if you don't...well, your 100+ hours in a campaign can end instantly. At least there's an achievement for failing.			"

												Hundreds of hours played, still yet to complete a campaign. Which may sound like a negative but it's not - there's just that much to do in the game.I set it down for a couple of months and then come back and get addicted again. One of the best strategy / RPG hybrids I've played sing HOM&M was good.			"
