												What I love about scribblenauts is its creative problem solving and peaceful attitude.Problem: Did the children of the neighborhood land their ball on the old geezer's lawn that won't give it back? Solution: Spawn a gun and kill him! It works!Problem: Nurse being chased by an angry heart?Solution: Spawn a gun and kill it!Problem: Want to contact a manager at the other side of a wall?Solution: Spawn a grenade launcher!Problem: Frozen people encased in ice?Solution: Spawn a flamethrower! Bonus: Watch their life points diminish as you melt/burn away!The thing that bugged me the most and made me sad is the cruelty towards animals. For example, as I visited a restaurant I made friends with a brown recluse spider and a cockroach, petting them and watching their happy little faces light up. Then some evil quest-giving person wanted me to kill them for a pest-control inspection, the nerve! And for a starlite fragment I had to kill my newly made bug friends?! What cruel madness is this!Also while going through the object shards achievements I had to prod a cow?! Shame on you scribblenauts. I hope they will fix those issues in future installments. In the meanwhile I will continue riding my black&red huge supersonic fire-breathing dragon that is immune to damage, while going around helping people and making their lives better (sometimes with the use of supreme firepower).

												It may look like a childish game at first glance, and it indeed may be considered as such. However, I'm 23 years old and I found it quite entertaining. Between two violent games, I just wanted to use my imagination and create my own universe and items; which the game does very well!All in all, the game is repetitive if you don't use your imagination. I'd give it a 8 out of 10.A must-try !			"

												A charming game that expresses the innocent sense of curiosity and imagination of a young child in a way I have rarely seen.If you're not familiar with the Scribblenauts series, they are platformer sandbox puzzle games where you can summon just about any object from the dictionary (with some reasonable exceptions such as copyrighted things, alcohol, and proper nouns) and expect them to interact in a believable way. If you can think of any food, animal, household item, weapon, mythological creature, or vehicle, chances are you can make it appear. We're talking tens of thousands of possibilities. A few surprises can also be summoned, such as a variety of internet memes and special objects, if you can think of them.You can summon objects, or add adjectives to existing objects, to solve puzzles and make all the townspeople happy. Or, you could just screw around for hours summoning gods and beasts and riding them across the world as your epic mounts, or watching them run loose and terrorize the villagers. The puzzles are all ridiculously easy, but difficulty is obviously not the point. Personally, my favorite way to play this game is to think of the most obnoxiously ridiculous solutions to every puzzle. Most puzzles will have a bluntly obvious solution, but you can make hilarity ensue if you can think of something creative. For instance, a guy wanted something to help carve his ice sculpture. I gave him a toenail clipper. Hansel and Gretel needed something to make a trail with through the forest. I gave them thumbtacks. A buzzard wanted something to eat. I gave it a dead baby. A tracking dog needed something that smelled like Santa so he could search for Santa. I summoned Santa.It's an excellent game packed with great humor and content, and it's miles ahead of the Nintendo DS games it was based on. My only complaint is that it got a bit boring after the first few hours, but I fixed that just by taking some breaks and not playing it all on one sitting. But I never once stopped appreciating how wonderful the game is. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to rediscover their inner child, complete with borderline politically incorrect humor, in a way that very few games can provide. (Achievement hunters: getting 100% is very tedious, as you will need to solve over a hundred riddles to acquire the remaining bonus pieces. Usually you will solve some of them on accident throughout normal gameplay if you try to use creative solutions. However, if you ever get bored, you can just look at a FAQ to fully complete the game effortlessly.)			"

												""Write anything, solve everything."" This has been the mantra for Scribblenauts since its creation in 2009, and each new installment comes closer and closer to realising this goal. Scribblenauts Unlimited on Steam has taken the ""write anything"" part to heart, but falters a bit of the ""solve everything"" side of the equation.The Steam Workshop support for this game is quite huge. If you can think of an object that the game doesn't recognise (mostly copyrighted content), then it's possible that someone has either created it for you, or some toying around with the game's impressive object editor will make your dreams a reality. Even better, you can upload your creations for all Steam users to enjoy.As awesome as this is, the gameplay is a tad disappointing. At least, we finally have an explanation for Maxwell's endless search for Starites (the game's MacGuffin). The story acts as a prequel to the series, as Maxwell struggles to retrieve the errant Starites to rescue his sister, Lilly (one of literally dozens of his relatives, all of whom are playable characters), from being turned into stone. This story is quickly forgotten once you start summoning vuvuzuela-playing pink jaguars to fight a winged preposterous black knight riding atop a cowardly telekinetic cybernetic T-rex, with only the occasional interlude reminding you of your main objective.To retrieve the Starites, Maxwell must help people around the game's expansive world with various problems, from helping an up-and-coming rock band gain a fanbase, to helping patients in a hospital with their various ailments. While its nice to have a large amount of different areas to explore, many of which feel alive with various characters mulling about, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was just playing nicer-looking versions of the DS games' title screens. Worse yet, many of the main challenges don't encourage your imagination as often as you think they would.Despite these problems, I would still highly recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played the series before. The visuals are crisp, the sheer amount of objects that can be generated is mind boggling (not counting the extensive Workshop creations), and it's still fun to see how each object and adjective interacts with each object in the world.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pros:+ Graphics look amazing, even on low-powered laptops+ Amazing object editor+ ""Write anything"": only limited to your imagination+ Always fun to see object/adjective interactions+ Nice origin story for Maxwell...Cons:- ...but is quickly forgotten while goofing off- Worlds feel like glorified title screens from the DS games- Many challenges limit/stifle creativity			"

												I highly recommend this fun for all ages kinda game. It is like mad libs come to life. You wander around what is basically a 2D open world mad libbing people's issues. Issues like I need something to scare away crows.... well just spawn a zombie or a scarecrow, or an angry hunter, or a gun to do it yourself! There's a lot of unintentional yet intentional fun here. Spawning a zombie to solve one puzzle might chase away other NPCs. Unless you add the adjective, friendly zombie. Its really the interactivity with the world that makes the game such silly fun. Did your zombie make a fire? Well have a firefighter put out that fire. Its a silly fun game that I can imagine would be great for kids. Simple controls that really thrive with a keyboard when you're typing things like 'pretty pink princess.'  There are good area settings too, everywhere from standard city areas like hospitals and a fire station, to more creative areas like Jurassic Park, a haunted house and a castle. Overall, the game is pretty easy. Easy enough that anyone can see it through to the end.			"

												A game with lots of creativity. You control a boy who can turn anything to life by writing it on his notebook. Lots of crazy things to do in this game like shooting down a building with ""Destroyer"", turning a lizard into a Ice Dragon and make him fight a ""Flamethrower Soldier"", building a school underwater, make a health potion and drink it if you are hurt and low on health, add dead as an adjective... Instant death! and more fun and crazy stuff to do. The art design is nice. And lots of variety in characters and customization. Its more like a sandbox game where you can do anything you want. Also has cool story. Its not a game for Everyone though. You might get bored of it quickly if you don't like these kind of games. And...! You can get past most of the game without killing people! Type ""Sleepy"" or ""Sleeping"" as adjective insteed! Had a great time in this game. Will play more.+ Creativity at Its Finest+ Great Art Design+ Lots of Characters and Customization+ Improve Your Spelling Skills! :P+ Good Story+ Makes You Think+ Truely Open World+ Lasts Long- Not for Everyone.

												I am writing this review on behalf of my daughter, who recently completed the game. This is a wonderful game, for children and adults alike. For children, however, there is the added benefit of improving spelling and vocabulary as the child plays through the game. I know this, because my own child's vocabulary and spelling improved during the 140+ hours it took her to complete the game. It is relatively non-violent, that encourages the player to solve problems in creative and imaginative ways. There are often more ways than one to complete a challenge. Message to the developer: please make more follow-ups to this game! I'm aware of Scribblenauts Unmasked, although that game has much more fighting content in it than this one, so less violent solutions are not as viable. If the original dev won't make any more, I encourage anyone with the proper skill set to make more games like this; it's a winning formula that should not be abandoned.			"

Scribblenauts Unlimited is one of my favorite games in the Scribblenauts series. However... this is entirely because of the object creator and character creator.While I AM recommending this game, I feel the need to list a couple major issues I had with it:-The puzzles are much easier and less interesting/creative than the ones in Super Scribblenauts-They got rid of destructable terrain entirely (you can no longer dig/destroy the land like you could in Super Scribblenauts)-The maps are very crowded and there's no sandbox mode like there was in Super ScribblenautsAs you may have noticed, these are all downgrades from the previous Scribblenauts game (Super Scribblenauts), and while these issues do make the game a lot less fun, the new features mostly make up for it.I rate this game a 7.5/10 and recommend getting Super Scribblenauts if you have any of the devices it's available for.

												This game just makes me happy when I play it. It's fun and I laugh a lot while I play it. Do you really need anything else from anything? It's not a difficult game by any stretch as a simple story game of collecting stars to help save somethign from something with a lot of cool/cute art and object making. It lets you use your imagination to create an enormous amount of objects to just drop into the world and play with. Want a monkey? How about a GIANT monkey? You can make one and then ride it. Hilarious notebook? Sure. It will make every NPC that it passes by laugh. Create a Living Garden Gnome riding on a Tiny Goat. You can even create NPCs that will fight with one another, or even jsut play nice. Using adjectives in front of objects makes them even more interesting than they already are.You can save objects you create in your backpack for easy access, you can get objects created by other Steam users in the Workshop with simple in-game menus and a couple clicks. Tons of user created stuff is amazing and hilarious so make sure to spend a good amount of time in the Steam Workshop for this game. This is a Family Friendly game that anyone with a soul should play and enjoy. If you are a ginger, well we know you have no soul, but even YOU would probably be able to find some joy here. It's an easy 100% Achievements game and they just take the time of finishing all the stars mostly and making objects they tell you to. Trading cards as well of course. Fun and hilarious casual game for all ages!NOTE: If you look at the credits and use the Developer's names to create in-game characters they will all appear in the game with some sort of special attribute. One dev NPC has the ability to turn every hat you put on them to spawn wings that you can take and fly with for example. There are a ton of these and it is fun to mess around with. You can view the credits at any time so write down some developer names and experiment in the game. :)			"

Scribblenauts unlimited attempts to build on this formula by addding the feature of editing items already in the game world through adding modifiers. Unlimited also adds the ability to store items in your backpack for later use. All nice features, but altogether clunky as the game loses its charm without the use of a stylus. Having to mouse entirely across the screen to spawn in an item seems like a hassle when the first time around it took hardly any effort to access the notebook. It's still good ol' Scribblenauts, and while I'd take the old level select systems over this ""open world"" approach, Sribblenauts Unlimited is fun play and a creative pastime. 8/10			"

												I think that this game has a great conscept and is fun to play.It's like the original scribblenauts game but you can get unlimited creations. Maxwell and his sister were spoiled kids, their mom and dad were rich. They bought a magic notebook and a globe of the world. The notebook enabled them to create anything they wanted, and the world globe allowed them go to any place they wanted. One day they were out and saw an old man, so went up to him. They gave him a rotten apple, but the old man was a wizard and bespelled Maxwells sister with a curse,  gradually turning her into stone, every day it gets worse. Maxwell  is sent on a quest to save his sister. They learned that Maxwell has to collect various starites, but the only way to obtain a starite is to make people happy.			"

												This is truly a joy and not only because of the game. 5th Cell Media have developed a game that encourages thinking and learning and actually manages to pull something very fun and enjoyable in the process; something I haven't seen since the age of the Spectrum. Undoubtedly a child will find hours of fun trying to come up with wild and crazy adjectives to supplement their boring nouns. Equally they will perhaps try to find a not-so-obvious route to solve a problem, which again is a credit to the developers. Not enough games encourage this kind of learning and thinking while you play a game.			"

												The idea of Scribblenauts Unlimited really appealed to me. Using your own creativity to solve the hundreds and hundreds of puzzles without any limits. Unfortunately once i played a bit i started noticing more and more Scribblenauts isn't as unlimited as it claims to be. Now don't get me wrong Scribblenauts Unlimited is a very fun game and has some nice and creative locations you travel to! It runs really smooth and has almost no loading times at all. But the game is just really limited, often i tried solving puzzles in fun and creative ways and ended up on google asking myself why nothing works, with the dissapointing news you could only choose from a set of solutions the developers already choose. This way the game starts to feel like a chore after a while, just solving the puzzles with the most basic solutions because those are the only ones that work most of the time. Now this wouldn't be that bad if the puzzles would actually be challenging, but since this game is aimed more towards kids the puzzles are often so easy they're just boring. However Scribblenauts has some really nice and fun points aswell, you can costumize your own character and all of the different NPC's. And although the puzzles aren't as free as the game claims them to be, there are still quite a few items in the game to mess around with and you can create literally everything you can think of. The artstyle is unique and fits the game perfectly and the music is really catchy.Yes this game can be fun, especially for kids. And even i enjoyed this game, just not till the end cause it got way to repetitive after a while. Don't buy this and expect to get creative by solving the puzzles, buy this if you like solving basic and easy puzzles, don't mind a bit of repetitivty and enjoy messing around to create fun and original stuff.

												This is a really fun and original game that is easy to lose track of time on. I can't think of many games with gameplay that allows for so much variety, freedom, and creativity. Scribblenauts Unlimited is a good game. On the downside it does not have a whole lot of replay value. you can go back and enjoy it again, but eventually you feel like you have done it all. Ultimately it's a fun game that you will play, beat, and then probably leave alone. It's not a huge downside, not all games can have a whole lot of replay value, sometimes the way the games work does not make it very replayable.			"

												The concept of Scribblenauts is fantastic, and the graphics are awesome, but this game is really let down by how unbelievably easy the ""puzzles"" are. And yes, being creative is half the fun, but if puzzles are as easy as ""oh no a pipe is leaking we need something to catch the water"", or ""my dog is hungry"" then the novelty of something as strange as a pipe leaking into a swimming pool, or dogs eating enormous waffles wears off really quickly. What's more, an alarming number of the problems can literally be solved just by typing the word ""gone"", which takes another level of fun out of it.Everything else about this game is great, and I think it'd be fantastic for teaching kids about spelling and problem solving, but how unbelievably easy it is just ruins it completely for me. A few harder puzzles here and there, even if they were optional, would make this game infinitely more fun.			"

												When I got this game, I thought it was going to be similar to the first game I played on the DS, which I got bored with rather quickly. However, I was surprised at how far this franchise has come and how many hours I lost playing this quaint game. It inspires creativity, gets you thinking outside the box, if you choose, and can be very funny at points. The only downside, in my opinion, is that some of the solutions to some puzzles have a “guess what the dev’s thinking” mentality which, although makes the puzzles more challenging, can get a little annoying. Overall, a great game for people of any age and I recommend it highly.  "

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is not a bad game. It's just not as good as I was hoping it would be. It's put together well, the artstyle is good, the soundtrack is good (I can still hear some of the game's music playing in my head,) and the voice acting (what little of it there is) is good. So where does it fall short, then? A few places actually. Let's start with the big one: the gameplay.The idea is to solve puzzles by conjuring up an object, or by adding an adjective to an existing one. Sounds intriguing, but really you just wind up solving puzzles with the most basic of objects. The whole idea of being able to add adjectives to objects is neat, but it's not really put into play all that much. There are a few instances where you must scare Person X away from Object/Person Y. So you just apply the adjective ""Scary"" to Object/Person Y. Or perhaps something needs wings, so you give it the adjective ""Flying."" Makes sense. But there's only a few puzzles that really make use of adjectives. The large majority of the puzzles can be solved with basic objects, and it just kinda starts to feel as though you're grinding through the game rather than really ""solving"" anything. It just gets rather tedious after a while.Then there's the Steam Workshop. Probably the main reason that the game is called Scribblenauts Unlimited, the way the Workshop works is you can use and in-game Object Editor to create your own objects and submit them to the workshop for the rest of the world to use. Likewise, you can download other people's creations. Now, I personally took one look at the Object Editor and said ""No thanks."" But I'm sure those of you out there who have the blood of Michelangelo or Vincent van Gogh coursing through your veins can imagine and create masterpieces with it. I just didn't feel like taking the time to get used to it.Now as for the Workshop itself. It's kind of...meh. There are some really well made and detailed things in there with their own creative and useful functions...surrounded by Five Nights at Freddy's characters. Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike Five Nights at Freddy's. I just dislike seeing it in every. Single. Workshop. However, you can play and enjoy the game without even looking at the Workshop, so I won't base my judgement of the whole game on it too much.Finally,considering the game's content and how many hours you'll likely get out of the game even if you go to the trouble of 100%ing it, that $20 price tag is WAY too much. To put it in perspective, you can purchase Terraria on Steam right now for $10. That's a game that you can potentially get hundreds of  hours out of. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a similar story: $15 for potentially hundreds of hours. Scribblenauts Unlimited meanwhile is $20 for around 12 hours if you feel so inclined to get all of the achivements. But to be fair, Terraria and The Binding of Isaac are COMPLETELY different than Scribblenauts. Scribblenauts isn't the type of game that you dedicate hundreds of your hours into. It's the kind of game that you finish, and then move on to something else. But even still...$20? In my opinion, if you truly feel so compelled to purchase the title, you're gonna want to wait until the next big sale.I hope this helps.			"

Lots of crazy things to do in this game like shooting down a building with ""Destroyer"", turning a lizard into a Ice Dragon and make him fight a ""Flamethrower Soldier"", building a school underwater, make a health potion and drink it if you are hurt and low on health, add dead as an adjective... Instant death! and more fun and crazy stuff to do. The art design is nice. And lots of variety in characters and customization. Its more like a sandbox game where you can do anything you want. Also has cool story. Its not a game for Everyone though. You might get bored of it quickly if you don't like these kind of games. And...! You can get past most of the game without killing people! Type ""Sleepy"" or ""Sleeping"" as adjective insteed! Had a great time in this game. Will play more.+ Creativity at Its Finest+ Great Art Design+ Lots of Characters and Customization+ Improve Your Spelling Skills! :P+ Good Story+ Makes You Think+ Truely Open World+ Lasts Long- Not for Everyone.

												I have looked at this game for several time before I decide to buy this game on discount. Videogame is fun on itself, and importantly gameplay system is more creative than another games I have played before. Scribblenauts Unlimited expands my sense of curiosity about English language, and of course it helps me learn some words I don't even know before such as, defibrilator. On the other hand, level design of Scribblenauts Ultimate sometimes makes me feel it's harder to find what word I need to take in the gap. However this game has a 2D graphic, I guarantee if you like intellectant videogame, this game can offer you a ton of English language's knowledge and general knowledge that we should know as well.

June 22, 2015Scribblenauts Unlimited is a strange game, functioning best as a sandbox to play with creativity and absurdity. Focusing on completing the game tasks can become boring, and a fair amount of objectives feel like padding. Completionists will be annoyed by the amount of chores needed to 100% the game.This may sound like the game is bad, and that could be argued. Approached as a series of tasks to save Lily, the game can feel a bit slow. However, sometimes you need to forget the quests and just mess around. Arm shotguns with shotguns, then hand them to a musical afro. Build a tower of dirty jesters, riding a hated jester on the bottom. Give a dog-fearing man a dog whistle and watch him panic. Play around, and you can really see the pure fun of this game. I've spent at least an hour catching my breath after hilarious events, most of which I didn't expect or plan. That alone is worth the time and money, in this era of pretentious art games and multiplayer communities that make you hate humanity.Do you want to laugh, preferably without vulgarity? Can you come up with some silly ideas to see what happens? I'd recommend Scribblenauts Unlimited.  I don't have much idea about the Unmasked version, doesn't seem to change much beyond the missions, and I figure the Unlimited Workshop community is stronger. I got the game from a Humble Bundle key  <3 Fred but I would recommend the game easily at 25% off for $15 USD.			"

												The best scribblenauts game out there in my opinon, you should really get this game if you love the scribblenauts series. The game might be a bit short, but it's worth every second. If you complete the game there is always alot of fun things to do such as creating a flying helpful rocket launcher or a big red triple headed dog to ride on.			"

												This game is clever, innocent and fun. My seven-year-old neighbor begs me to let him play some Scribblenauts all of the time, and I definitely love this game as much as him. It takes the already entertaining concept of the original mobile game and takes it way farther, with a sizable campaign which took awhile to beat, and was fun all the way through. Just like the original, the puzzles involve solving problems by creating helpful items, and it doesn't get old!I was skeptical about this game at first, since I got it for $4.99 in the recent Warner Bros. Interactive sale, but I was pleasantly surprized by how much fun it is! Give it a try...and when you do, make sure you try typing in Cthulhu.			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is a game where you create stuff, earn Starites by completing objectives, and play as any character you want. You can create anything. Anything! Like Shoggoth, a squirrel, a T-Rex, Deadpool, a lighthouse, and even a leprechaun. The object of the game is to get 60 Starites. Once you hit 60, you've completed the game and you get to play as Maxwell's sister, Lily. Hooray! You can create stuff using the object editor. Like a cat launcher, a cat gun, an army camouflage rifle, Ellen DeGeneres, etc. You can also create your own avatar if you want, and you can download other people's creations on your Steam Workshop. They can create other stuff and upload them on their Steam Workshop too.I recommended this game. I like it.			"

												Likes:It it freaking hilarious!!! I can sit and play this thing for hours on end!The ability to manipulate anything and everything in the game just makes for a very special gaming experience, and even though this game is targeted at a (much) younger audience than myself, I find it to be plenty stimulating and intriguing.I can imagine this would be a great game for your kid learning colors and words, and grammars and stuff (yes, I see what I did there).Now, with English not being my primary language, I learn a lot of new things through this game, and I like how I am sort of forced to learn words I rarely or never use in daily life.The absolute major +++3000 for me about this game is the manipulation of everything, and the possibility to download mods to make it (less) childproof and more to my liking.Dislikes:... Well... it does get a little monotone after a while. You do the same thing on every map, and after a while that just becomes a little boring.All in all:YES. I LOVE THIS GAME!!! It's brilliant!!!			"

												For me, playing Scribblenauts Unlimited is a very entertaining way to touch and play a little with my inner child! For those who play it, everything seems like a simple logic problem that must be solved with a bunch of creativity. The fact the game has a simple and at the same time full of imaginative possibilities mechanic, which matches with the clean artwork and graphics, drives the player to this very wished psychological place of not worrying or not having to follow any kinds of protocols, by fullfiling complex and hard-to-understand objectives; but yet being driven and carried on by such direct and fundamental moral themes: making other people a little happier with the powers we have and struggling to undo an ""evil"" caused by our own acts. With the nowadays tendence of creating very human like heroes and villains, with a spectrum of mixed moral values and affections, Scribblenauts makes us all remeber a little what is like to have possibilities of believing and making things look and feel better without the need of titanic actions and moves. I have a 10 here, but that's likely because I really like to hang around with the kiddo side of myself!			"

												This is one of my favorite games. However, it has its flaws. If you dont want to read this entire review, scroll all the way to the bottom, There's a tl;dr version.So first off, the title lies.The object creator is limited. The fact that it says ""Unlimited"" in the title makes it feel like the creator just wants money. It really takes alot of the fun away from the game, but don't get me wrong. I know it was made in 2012 and making everything ""Unlimited"" would kill your computer's memory, but this still is pretty dissapointing.Basically, my point is; Don't buy the game unless you know what to expect, or you've played the game before on something like the Wii U.Second, the small space in all of the levels.I haven't played through the entire game yet, but im getting there. What really bothers me more than the limited object creator is that the levels are just so small.If you've only played things like Big RPGs, Shooters, and Garry's Mod, then this game is going to be weird for you.Although each level has enough space for you to create several things, the free space could be bigger.Finally, the price is too high.I don't think this game's worth 20$. Like i mentioned earlier, the game's very limited and not what you'd expect. Please, take a moment to think about it before you buy it. Now, lets go to the positives.First off, the artstyle's unique.Yes, it's a little blocky and chibi-ish, but it just works. That's all i need to say for this.Second, you can create almost anything you want.You can write something bad like ""Invincible Strong Huge Bee"" and it'll appear as an invincible strong huge bee. If its not in the game, you can make it.Third, the gameplay.The missions, the fact that you can create almost anything, and the high resolution is just what you'd expect from a Scribblenauts game.Finally, that feeling you get when playing Scribblenauts.The feeling of wondering ""When will there be another game?""10/10. Tl;dr: The game's limited, the levels are too small, and the price is too high. But the artstyle's unique, you can create almost anything you want, and the feeling of wondering ""When will there be another game?"" While playing this. 10/10			"

												Imagine being able to create whatever you wanted just by writing it in a book. Now, instead of using this book to give yourself a flying rainbow llama, you use it to help people in need. This is Scribblenauts Unlimited, the third game in the Scribblenauts series.You play as Maxwell, a young boy who has been given the gift of a magic notebook from his parents. Maxwell then uses the notebook to give a rotten apple to a hungry man, and angers him. The man puts a curse on Lily, his sister, who now slowly turns to stone. To stop this, Maxwell has to make up for his trickery by collecting Starites from people, to free his sister from the curse.The gameplay in Scribblenauts Unlimited is basic, but it is obtained and used well. I was never confused by the controls or wandered around pressing buttons. The notebook feature is easy to use, and writing something with multiple meanings (say, 'bat') will bring up a menu to select which type of object you would like. There is also a backpack feature that allows you to save your favourite creations for easier access later, but I rarely used this feature as I created new and different things all of the time.While Scribblenauts Unlimited is simple, its charming art style is colourful, playful and different to a lot of other games that I am used to. Playing the first two games on the Nintendo DS, Scribblenauts Unlimited combines the series-defining mechanics of the first game with the creativity and art style of Super Scribblenauts, building a game that is definitely one of the best puzzle games available on PC. While this game is definitely directed towards a younger audience, I couldn't help but pick up the third instalment of this amazing franchise.There are no borders in Scribblenauts Unlimited. Unlike the first two games, Scribblenauts Unlimited is set it over 20 different locations, which when unlocked are accessible all the time, creating an open world to explore and invent wonderful contraptions and experiments. Never in any other game have I seen so much creative freedom.To conclude, Scribblenauts Unlimited is a flawless addition to the series, and definitely a game that will consume a fair amount of play time.9.8/10			"

During my many visits to this sandbox gem, I found that you could solve many of the puzzles with multiple solutions. You were free to use your noggin' when it was needed, giving you an edge over the admittedly simple puzzles this game had to offer. The addition of adjectives really boosted this into my favorite sandbox games, along with Garry's Mod and Minecraft.			"

Scribblenauts Unlimited is an adventure puzzle game. As Maxwell, save your sister Lily from a curse by creating happiness around the world with the use of your magical notepad that can create anything you can write.Pros: The game has an astonishing amount of potential content. Almost any word and adjective you can think of, you can create by typing it. There is a lot of different method to resolve any situation, and the fun comes in finding new and unexpected ways to do so. You will find yourself attempting different solutions again and again even after you already succeeded just to see if you can find an easter egg or game secret. Usable created objects also add game elements to work with, and combining people or objects with one or more adjectives increases the possibilities tenfold.Cons: The game is short, you can breeze through it, getting the Starites you need to win the game within a few hours. Many of the puzzles are easy, half of which can usually be resolved with the same few objects. There are multiple passageways to move around a level, but they are often useless as it won't take time for you to always make sure you have a jet-pack or pair of wings to move around. Unless you want to explore the possibilities, you won't find much replayability as resolving a puzzle in different ways still ends up with the exact same result.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!If you're looking for an exciting story, grand adventure or mind-bending puzzles, turn away. But if you're looking for an entertaining time trying to push the limit of the game, and exploring just how far you can go, it's a great one. The Steam Workshop makes it easier than ever to add dozens, if not hundreds of new objects and options, assuming you don't use the object creator to add your own. Furthermore, the game is great for all ages, maybe even more so for younger gamers. Of course, if you didn't like previous Scribblenauts games, you're unlikely to enjoy this one. But if you did, Scribblenauts Unlimited will go where previous ones never went before!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												The game allows for an impressive amount of objects to be created, however it is designed for kids and is ludicrously easy. In 4 hours of playing, I had gotten through the majority of the puzzles, with only 2-3 of the over 100 I had done taking more than a few seconds to figure out. In saying that, the levels are creative and funny, and allow for your to set up your own situations using different combinations of objects - which can be edited with the use of a large amount of adjectives.

												This game is surprisingly entertaining! I have seen my daughter play it a lot on her DS so assumed it was a kids game but some of the stuff requires much thought to figure out what these characters need you to create for them. Some things can be funny, some mundane and some dangerous. Yes you can put something out that will kill your people and then you must start the level again. Some are inevitable and restarting does not cause you to lose progress.The workshop also has lots of additional content you can download. To do so you must do it from in game. If you go and just subscribe through steam about 95 percent will NOT show up. To do so go to the object editor (the glue and scissors) and then subscribe from there.Its great when you need a break from the FPS, RPG or Dinos! I had so many hours in ARK that when my husband asked me a question while I was groggy I responded I will just bring my T-Rex! Yes I was serious and he thought I lost it LOL So this game has given me a much needed dino break, cartoon dinos don't count!			"

												An experience not far detached from genuine creative writing, except you get your vocabulary hacked off at the knees, turning it (and - subsequently - you) into a linguistically-challenged, clean-mouthed, experimental dwarf. The upside is that instead of crawling under your desk to cry about your lack of progress and insistence on unhealthy quantities of procrastination, your efforts are rewarded with charming caricatures rendered in glorious patches of primary colour.  In all fairness, it's a tempting trade-off.			"

												5th Cell have made a few very good games that I have played, and this is one of them. This game company has made a few games that can really inspire creativity, such as Drawn To Life and Scribblenauts, though of course inspire creativity  in different ways.Scribblenauts is a game that encourages you to come up with ways to solve moderatly easy puzzles, where there is no one solution. Because there is no one solution, it has high replay value, with you figuring out what else works, and different ways to do the same thing. At first you might start out summoning a sponge to clean a wall, later you will be using aardvarks for everything. This game has changed a lot since it's start on the Nintendo DS, and you can even MAKE new things with parts of things from the game, and even script their behaviour! Or if you are no good at making things, you can download some from the Steam Workshop!There are very few flaws in this game, as no game is perfect. One flaw I find is not really a flaw, but can be seen as one, you have way too much freedom in this game. Limits really work well in certain games, and with games with too much freedom you can get bored, or you see no challenge. If you get bored, there are heaps of achievements to get and there are little challenges in-game for you to solve. But if you have done everything, you can always clear the game data and start anew, and maybe even have a challenge of your own, like, for example, only using aardvarks, which is something I find myself doing a lot.This game doesn't just stop at the limitless freedom, it also has a very heartwarming story, that premotes kindness. Which is a very nice touch on top of the rest of the game. These types of games are very hard to come across, they are very different from most games, and because they are different and very special, they are games that you must have, even if you are a gamer who plays zombie games, or plays a lot of indie games (a lot of the time they overlap) you must have this, as it is not just another generic game, it is Scribblenauts Unlimited.

												I reccomend it! I got it when it was $55 and I still don't regret it. I didn't like the DS ones but this one takes the DELICOUS MASSIVE CAKE! But let's talk detail.This game is literally a dictionary stuffed inside cartoon graphics and zapped with story, and I'm okay with that. The story isn't half bad, the level design is fabulous and the graphics is eye candy. There are afew flaws, some times words entered aren't adapted and it won't help you spell your workshop creations (I happen to have made afew) so it can be a little tedious when trying to make somthing specific. Don't make somthing specific! Go nuts! I come back to it even with the story complete just to make some crazy stuff. (P.S That backpack is very useful if you like making special items every time you play!)			"

												This is one of my favorite games of all time.  I often play it whenever I need cheering up.It has lackluster reviews, and I've noticed almost everyone that rates it mediocre or bad plays it differently than I do.  You could consider this both a review and a guide to having fun with the game.  Don't worry, there won't be spoilers.If you're out of elementary school, and play the game in the most straightforward way, it will be too easy.  It amounts to a graphical adventure where you can access almost every item in the game by typing the name, letting you bypass anything resembling a puzzle.  While this might be viewed as a problem by teenagers and adults playing the game, it's actually a good thing for children, who can use it as a fun way to exercise their vocabulary skills.Teenagers and adults playing the game should use their creativity.  The game is usually surprisingly flexible in how you can achieve a goal.  The only restrictions it normally has are: you can't use real people's names, or anything involving drugs, prejudice, or sex, and you often can't kill anybody.Suggestions to get you started: Be indirect.  Creating things people ask for and sticking adjectives on the problem is boring.  Create other beings and complex Rube Goldberg contraptions made of multiple objects to solve problems.  Watch the chaos as unexpected interactions ensue!  When your solutions cause more problems, add more elements to try to fix those, rather than changing or removing anything. Be lazy.  See how little you can create while still solving a problem indirectly.  This usually involves heavy use of side effects.  You may be able to solve multiple problems on the same level with one action. Be impractical.  Pick a role and stubbornly stick to it.  The best roles are those least suited to a hero (e.g. cook, janitor, tailor…).  Dress the part and give yourself appropriate adjectives.  Try to solve all problems using only things that are in theme.  MacGyver would be proud. Do no harm.  When dealing with a problematic creature or object, try to create and use some other creatures or objects that harmlessly neutralize it, rather than fighting or destroying it. Provide unhelpful help.  Be an evil genie.  Do what someone asked you to do, but make sure it has side effects they won't like, or doesn't achieve their goal. Consider what would happen if…  For example, what would happen if a prince, turned into a frog, was given a werewolf princess to kiss?Played this way it should have you laughing your head off.  You may lose the level (usually due to an accidental death), but have so much fun you won't care.The game does have some flaws.It doesn't recognize every correctly spelled word.  That would have been impossible to program and create art for.Some goals are too restrictive to allow creativity.  Sometimes there is only one solution.  There should be at least three significantly different solutions.  Better playtesting could have caught this.There are “fetch quests”.  They involve going to some part of the map, which is usually unobstructed, picking up a item, and carrying it back to the person that asked for it.  You can't use your magical notebook to do this, and it's unhumorous, uncreative, and unchallenging.  Hopefully the authors will stop including these in the future.While I love what the object editor can do, I hate how it does it.  The primary pain-point is how difficult it is to “draw” a new object.  You have to do it by lumping together existing art assets.  The second worst pain-point is how difficult it is to get the behavior you want.  You can only create new behaviors by tuning settings on existing ones.  While you can argue this is “creative problem solving”, it fits poorly with the design of the rest of the game.  Making a item in game is as easy as typing the name.  Making items in the object editor should be similarly painless.  We'd be better off with a design that imports SVG and allows scripting in some common, efficient, sandboxable, programming language, like JavaScript or Lua.There is no way to create new levels at all.  This could have greatly extended interest in the game.Overall, I think this is one of the finest games ever made, and look forward to more in the series.			"

												Great little game, it's got a ridiculous amount of adjectives. You can spawn an evil version of yourself that randomly creates things to see how advanced it is, you'll see things like ""noctophilic haystack"" or ""serendipitous pho."" They use lots of playtesters to see what solutions people would come up with so that combined with lots of items fitting into similar categories means that most puzzles have an incredible amount of solutions. Spawn a pregnant man and a midwife and you'll get a thin man and a baby man, for example. I don't know how that helps solve puzzles, but there's a lot of dynamic events that pop up. It's worth a look and you can buy it, get a feel for it and return it within 2 hours if you don't like it. That's more than enough time to see what the game is like and whether you want to keep playing, after the opening cutscene and tutorial, you're essentially thrown into the game and have all your abilities. The only downside is the Steam Workshop, which is really cool. Lots of... interesting things there but the only way I've found it to work is that you have to subscribe to things from the game itself, that's the only way it would load what you want. I would've also liked to be able to use downloaded models for the character selector but I suppose the detailed character creator is a more configurable tool. Still, it's nigh impossible to pick Jango Fett or Samus as your character unless you know what you're doing.			"

And I assure you, Once you start playing it you won't be able to stop! Also there is great creations on the workshop. People like JerryMouse4ever, AwesomeGuy, DancingIpod, and more! You can also create things yourself, And post them easily. This is a game you should definitely buy and play for yourself. Also, If you like ""Garry's mod"", This is basically a 2D version of it. Again, This is a great game and thank you all of Warner Bros Games and 5th Cell for making this glorius game!			"

												Adorable game about a brother who has to save his sister because they ABUSED THEIR GODLY MAGIC NOTEPAD POWERS. Maxwell (the main character) is a hero who can ruin your day. You are like some kind of genie, running around fullfilling wishes for others so that they may give you a star. However, you can fullfill the wishes in a ""technicaly"" correct way. I once made the sea more safe by giving an orca a revolver, turning him into POLICE ORCA. A giant was in love with a normal sized woman. They want to live a normal life: Make a woman huge. NOW NOONE IS HAPPY BUT YOU CAN BE TOGETHER ANYWAY HAHAHAHA NOW GIMME YOUR STAR.Not but really. Its a cool game with a really cute graphic style and a good message.			"

												This game is two-faced.On the one hand there's the nice Maxwell saving his sister Lily by helping people (and other things) do stuff they otherwise couldn't do.On the other hand, there's hostile Gods shooting with Uzis at evil floating potatoes and radioactive lettuce while these are throwing grenades at them, nuclear keyboard cats chasing firetrucks, swimming radios with scary masks, undead outlets ending up in a lake and extincting all living things inside, and everything else is either sucked in by a huge black hole or touched by Death while you're cloning some massive huge strong wide tall soldiers for the upcoming Martian invasion.(Oh I almost forgot the Steam Workshop and the object editor, which stretch the possibilities for your own personal havoc to infinity. Have your own personal Pokémon Trainer battle, scare Doges away with a scarecrow that has Bonnie's face, or set up a death battle Sanic vs. Weegee on Final Destination.)It's up to you which side you want to choose. But it's pretty clear what your copy of the game will mostly be used for... isn't it? ;)			"

												This is a game that I found myself addicted to during the first few hours of playing.  The creative aspect of the game is really fun and it really encourages you to come up with creative ways to complete each task.  As with a lot of the other reviews, you can come up with the most ridiculous solutions to the tasks and still pass them.  Spawning random objects just to mess around with the NPCs is probably one of the most entertaining things about this game as well.  Despite all of this, the story could get boring after a while, but it is a fun game to play nonetheless.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is interested in creative type games like this.			"

Despite seeming like a childish game as it may to some people, there is a plethora of references to movies, songs, shows, mythology, historical events, Shakespeare, etc. which must be understood in order to complete certain quests.

												It is unlikely you will find a single scenario in this game that will challenge you to think outside the box.  Most of the problems the game presents you with can be solved in painfully obvious ways.  Do you need to put out a fire? Type fireman.  Is someone  hungry?  Give them food.  Because of this most of the fun in the game will be through either self imposed challenges such as not allowing yourself to solve things in a obvious way or by trying to solve everything in a silly or ironic way.  I myself tried to complete as much of the game as possible using the noun ""baby"" with different adverbs attached to it (this worked surprisingly well). Despite its flaws I would still recommend the game if you enjoy sandbox experiences as with the addition of steam workshop it has enormous potential in that area.

												Scribblenauts is great. Its even better if you play by your own rules and have an audience. If you don't know the basic idea is there are people who need the help of your godlike notebook that can create anything you can imagine and write down into it. So this knight needs a weapon to fight off a giant dragon, why not give him a diamond chainsaw? This girl wants to win a race, why not make her a super hero with super speed? Want to ride around on a golden dinosaur or a flying magical cat? Well in Scribblenauts you can. Its a little easy to get tired of the game though. Its fun and all but the overall difficulty can basically be summed up in ""this mouse wants cheese, click notebook write cheese, give cheese to mouse. This football team can't play football without a football.. click on notebook write football, give football to team."" ..its absurd how easy the game is. Every once in a while I got totally stuck on something because its a childrens rhyme or a kids logic thing that I am obviously no longer in the loop for but that can be solved with a good audience.The real fun though comes from messing with the game. So the mouse wants cheese right? Why not give him a cat made out of cheese then watch the hilarity of a mouse eating a live cheese cat. That poor guy needs a doctor, why not give him a zombie doctor? Make it fun and it becomes fun.. let it be boring and it can really tire you out. Overall its a great game and its easy to 100% (though you'll probably want a walkthrough for the random object challenges). I think it would be great to play with others more than alone and children maybe more than adults.. but its a great game for all ages.			"

												For a child     I can see why a child needs this game. It has hard puzzles for a growing mind and allow you to solve them with your creativity. Also something that allows you to make your own objects! That is awesome, but the community got a little carried away with that. I will go in more detail later. Back on subject, this game might not have a sandbox mode where you can't die. Scibblenauts Unlimited replaces that with a massive world to explore. Makes you feel like you are helping real people instead of just doing levels. Fun new graphics, expertly done, endless hours, and most of all real characters that you feel for. This game is better then the old one indeed.     Now to complain.   This game has a awful community. Be warned! See the workshop items section below. All items are just stupid and you know why. Here they are...10% normal fun items25% stupid items like cat hydras, baby guns, or worse.35% Fnaf items, how did scibblenauts get fnaf disease? Also pokemon too.30% Adult jokes, There is balls items and nudity everywhere!     As you see 90% is just bad. That is only complaint.My final score is a 97%, but the community brings it to a 80%.The rating is 10+, but because of that I bring it to a 13+ game.			"

												I've tackled games in this series before on nds and iphone but this one seems to be the one with the most content...which is both good and bad really. I've waited for this to come out for a while and while it's actually really fun that wears off after a while. While every new are you go to is interesting and uniwue in it's own right they all follow the same rules - you have different characters with problems and you have to come up with an item or a person that will solve that. This is really fun at first but it can get repetitive after a while and getting all the starites in the game (you get starites or shards for every problem you solve) is very tedious.Bottom line play it in small doses and it will stay fun...try to complete it all at once and it will get pretty boring. Also it's fun to screw the goals of the game and just do whatever - make a pink cthulhu with a rainbow colored afro fight a robot elephant with gatling guns. If you can think it you can pretty much make it in this game..and then set it on fire and launch it in space.			"

												When the original Scribblenauts came out for the DS, it was one of my favorite games. While it did not have the option to customize objects or use adjectives, most levels were both fun and challenging, forcing you to push your creativity's limits in order to reach the starite. Scribblenauts Unlimited allows much more depth with creating items, but the levels/puzzles do not reach beyond simply creating a category of object when prompted. There are no action levels in Scribblenauts Unlimited and as a result none of the levels are really challenging and there is no satisfaction in completing them. The object editor also allows you to create overpowered objects as well, decreasing what little challenge there is. It is fun to fool around with the object editor, but Scribblenauts Unlimited does not offer much depth beyond customizing your own objects.			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited was a gift to me.  I had heard about the game winning awards, but never considered it ""my kind of game.""  The basic premise is that you are a child with a magical notebook that allows anything you draw to come to life.  n You use the notebook to help people in town in order to save your sister who was randomly cursed.  You can type thousands of things into this notebook, and they will pop up on the screen.  The beauty of the game is in the sense of humor and in all the unexpected interactions that the people in the game have with the items you create. (I may have created a citywide epidemic by modifying a cockroach with the adjective ""diseased,"" but that's not important...)  It took me a little bit to get the hang of what the game expected of me and a couple of hilarious discussions with my roomie (""What would you draw in order to make a lamb come to dinner?""  Him: ""What?"") to fully grasp it all, but I really enjoyed the creativity and imagination that the game offered.			"

												Brilliant game. Seriously brilliant. Ostensibly a puzzle solving game but this is really a playground for your childhood imagination. Figuring out the most creative ways to accomplish something, in a way that shouldn't be possible outside of a pencil and paper, is just so very, very satisfying. Keyboard required, thesaurus suggested, and you'll want to play with someone younger than yourself. This is how your childhood imagination looked in your head.			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is exactly what you expect from a game of its series; repetitive summoning of certain items in which you can freely customise using adjectives that are in the game's database, and a storyline that evolves into a life lesson for kids or teenagers. Despite being extremely repetitive, the satisfaction that encompasses the success in passing certain objectives is not to be ignored as some combinations are just hilarious, or even confusing. For the fans of the series, this game should satisfy the needs of them, whilst for people who are new to the series, may be a tedious and difficult experience to complete. 6/10			"

												Scribblenauts unlimited is a fun little game (mostly a game for kids though) about traveling the world and collecting stars by doing lots of ""chores"" and getting payed with shards and stars which in the end help with freeing your sibling from a petrifying curse. you have a notebook which makes everything you write on it become a real object. you can costumize and create almost anythingCons:- since a ""chore"" has at least 10 ways to clear it, doing them is a bit tooooooo easy, nothing challenging in my opinion;- its graphisc might not appeal to some;- little to no replayability;- if played alot in a short time (a day) can get boring pretty fast;Pros:- fun and short game;- easy to 100%;- while not challenging it still helps improve imagination, writting speed ( did to me:)) );- despite doing stuff at a really fast speed there are quite a large number of ""chores""to do and explore the fun world;- fun to play around with random objects and properties; "

												This is a great puzzler where, to use a cliché, the only limit is your imagination - within the boundaries of PG. I would recommend it to you if you've never played a Scribblenauts game before or if you just want a good puzzle game. There's a few hours of story in it, plus the added bonus of the sandbox mode, which is essentially integrated into the story. It's jam-packed full of recognizable references includingNyan Cat, Lord of the Rings, Super Mario, Indiana Jones and Half Life. It also has something called the Object Editor which allows you to create your own items to use in the game and even upload to the Steam Workshop. You can also download some great content put out by other users too. It's definitely targeted to a younger demographic but that doesn't mean older gamers won't get something out of it too.			"

												A fun, quirky game about a boy with omnipotence, and easily the best game on the series. It's also on the Wii U/3DS but you should actually get it on steam because workshop compatibility. It's not truly unlimited, but it certainly reaches far into it's possibilities. Also has the most powerful character in every game. The only thing I don't really like is all the epick maymay references, but you may do, who am I to judge you. Also keep in mind this is an E rated game so no, you won't be able to spawn a beer or something, unless you create it on the object creator.Now, If you're looking for a real challenging puzzle, Scribblenauts will not deliver. It's puzzles may go from no brainer ""give me an X"" to something like a riddle, but overall not an actual puzzle game. If you want a puzzle scribblenauts, I'd suggest the original one for the DS, this one is more of a creator based scribblenaut, rather than a puzzle based one. If you want to purchase scribblenautss unlimited for the creativity factor and the adventure and other stuff that isn't puzzles, go ahead.			"

												Worth $5 at most. Nice quick and short game(about 10 hours game-play at most.) and basically, you type an object, it appears. Thing that frustrates me about this game most is that some objects don't work that should, and other objects that shouldn't work, do. It's also toned more towards little kids(not surprised on that one.) it's fun to play around with the different random things you can create. Would be interesting to see an adaptation that allows you to do like a multiplayer mayhem with random objects, animals, etc, that you can spawn to fight against others or just random mini-games. As it stands, it's not.. a bad game, but the story-line is kinda weak and it's basically you go around helping people. I want to be the villain more often. This.. doesn't give you that chance, unless you spawn a bunch of random chaotic things. Which.. in turn, can be fun. hahah. But yeah, get it at $5 or below. I wouldn't recommend it at full-price but no worries, it goes on sale quite often.			"

It's also toned more towards little kids(not surprised on that one.) it's fun to play around with the different random things you can create. Would be interesting to see an adaptation that allows you to do like a multiplayer mayhem with random objects, animals, etc, that you can spawn to fight against others or just random mini-games. As it stands, it's not.. a bad game, but the story-line is kinda weak and it's basically you go around helping people. I want to be the villain more often. This.. doesn't give you that chance, unless you spawn a bunch of random chaotic things. Which.. in turn, can be fun. hahah. But yeah, get it at $5 or below. I wouldn't recommend it at full-price but no worries, it goes on sale quite often.			"

												For a kids game it's pretty good. It gives you some good moral lessons and helps expand your vocabulary, sometimes i had to look into a dictionary to find a really good word to solve some puzzles. Anyways let's get down to gameplay, you play a character named Maxwell and you have to help your sister from turning into stone that was casted by a mysterious stranger and in order to turn her back to normal you have to collect these stars called starrites. In order to get starrites you have to solve peoples problems the more problems you solve the more starrites you get. You write in a notebook to solve problems so anything you write in there becomes a reality, what i mean by this is that anything you write in the book rather it be person,place,or thing appears right in front of you. You can pretty much write anything in there except vulgarity,copyright material, or if you can help it not write the same words over and over again.After playing this game for 9 hours i would recommend this to anyone who is creative with words.

												     Scribblenauts Unlimited is a VERY fun installation in the Scribblenauts series.  New to the game is the object editor, a very easy to use and creative way of making your own interactive objects.  You can change sizes, colors, and shapes, but the one thing that made me upset was that you can't DRAW your own objects.  This limits you to using only pre-made things in the game, forcing you to combine them if you want something unique.      Also new to Scribblenauts is its vast world.  From the city, to a desert, and even to space, you can take Maxwell (or one of his many brothers) on missions around the virtual globe.  Each level has challenges awaiting you that can be very simple or complex.  On the other hand, many missions have simple solutions.  For example, if a boy is unhappy, you can make a clown, video game, etc.  The possibilities are endless, but the entertainment level with some obstacles is limited.     All in all, I still like playing the game.  Even after you finish all the side-missions and campaign, you can still make your own objects and re-create your favorite characters and scenes from movies, video games, and books.  I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to share their ideas with others and explore Maxwell's world.			"

												This is a great puzzler where, to use a cliché, the only limit is your imagination - within the boundaries of PG. I would recommend it to you if you've never played a Scribblenauts game before or if you just want a good puzzle game. There's a few hours of story in it, plus the added bonus of the sandbox mode, which is essentially integrated into the story. It's jam-packed full of recognizable references includingNyan Cat, Lord of the Rings, Super Mario, Indiana Jones and Half Life. It also has something called the Object Editor which allows you to create your own items to use in the game and even upload to the Steam Workshop. You can also download some great content put out by other users too. It's definitely targeted to a younger demographic but that doesn't mean older gamers won't get something out of it too.			"

												The basic gameplay of Scribblenauts is solving little puzzles by creating objects that you can then use to manipulate the world. Most of the puzzles are very straightforward, and allow the player to come up with many different solutions, but every now and then I would get stuck on something. Usually it was because the answer the game was looking for was something completely different than I was thinking, so it was unable to interpret how the objects I created were supposed to be a solution. So while the game is pretty smart considering you can input thousands of words, sometimes it just balks and has no idea what you're trying to do.That said, it's still amazingly fun. There is a map where you can select different levels, each of which you can explore. Each zone has a funny theme, named with a funny grammar pun. The characters that you have to help are often silly and almost always endearing.Steam achievements: Half of them are completed by being a completionist and making sure you finish every detail in every level. But then the other half of the achievements... don't seem to be listed anywhere. I had to go online to figure out what ""find all the object shards"" entailed. It was basically a list of special word combinations, and if you spawned them together, or made the items interact with each other, then it counted toward the total score. For instance, one required you to make a marionette with the adjective ""alive"" to get the ""Pinocchio"" object shard. How in the world are you supposed to figure that out on your own? I needed a guide to figure out what I was looking for, but I didn't want to just run down a cheat sheet, so I searched for a guide that was simply a list of the object shards without the solutions. That was extremely helpful to get the achievements without feeling like a complete cheater. I looked and could not find a list like this anywhere within the game itself. If there is one in the game, it was pretty darn hidden, which is frustrating.(Also, the game says you cannot type in proper nouns. However, one of the object shards requires you to create ""William Shakespeare"". The last time I checked, that was a proper noun. What? Okay, whatever.)Object editor: So much fun! I didn't do much editing myself, what with my limited artistic skills. But when I found an avatar with 3D glasses, I dyed all of his clothes brown (except for the shoes, of course) and ran around the game, going, ""Woooo, I'm the Doctor!""You can also search for and download other objects that people have created. I downloaded a bunch of Doctor Who objects. I was amazed at the amount of customization people were able to put into the objects, from a piece of celery inside of the TARDIS, to a banana in 9's hand, to the combatitiveness of a dalek. I had a great amount of fun playing with these items that other people had created with the object editor.			"

												I admire the vast selection of things you can create in this game and the unique level designs that each have their own personalities ranging from a Prehistoric utopia to a space base. Normally a game like Scribblenauts wouldn't be my cup of tea as it's a pretty casual game in all honesty and it did become repetitive at times. However, it was a decent enough playthrough thanks to just the sheer amount of creativity invested into the game.  I could tell Scribblenauts is aimed at a younger audience and the plot is pretty typical but let's face it, people don't play scribblenauts for an intricate plot it's very gameplay heavy. I'd reccomend Scribblenauts to younger gamers in particular and just anybody that wants to kill some time without investing too much into a series.			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is a fun pass time sort of game. Something to just sit back and play a little of every now and then. You got your notebook. It's magic! You write in it to create objects. The possibilities are almost limitless. Whatever, it's a fun game. Give it a try, you doofus.Final Verdict (4.2 out of 5)			"

												Hilarious game, really a massive improvement on the previous Scribblenauts games. You can create your own items, characters and vehichles using the editor, and upload them to the workshop so that others can enjoy your creations. Definately worth the buy.One thing I would improve on is adding a level editor, since that was absent from the game, whereas it made an appearence in previous Scribblenauts games.9.5/10, Very good sandbox.

												The thing I love about this game is that the possibilities are endless. You can make almost anything and what's not programmed into the game you can make yourself or download from other users though Steam. Unlimited is definitely a most fitting title.Another brilliant thing about Scribblenauts is that it can be enjoyed by any age group. Some might think this game is childish but it is so enjoyable.The style is colourful and friendly and you don't have to worry about hoards of monsters coming at you. I think there should be more relaxed, casual games like this.I'd say the main are Scribblenauts Unlimted falls down is language. The only language option in this game is English. That said, I imagine a game based on writing would be rather difficult to translate.All in all, I highly reccommend this game.			"

												This is a very unique puzzle game. The art is bright and colorful and the environments are fun and well drawn up. The puzzles are creative and interactive although they can be quite simple at times, especially once you find out what I like to call (Cheat items) these are items that allow you to do many of the puzzles with ease, one of these such items is Wings. Speaking of items, the amount of things you can type and create is insanely impressive and makes it so you have so you have a variety of objects that can help in each puzzle meaning that you may even solve the puzzle differently or with a different item then someone else did. Its very kid friendly but is also very fun as an adult and could even be something cool to play with you kid if thats what your looking for. Highly recommended as it is just a unique charming puzzle game that is very addictive, has loads to do in it and the art work is just gorgeous.Game Showcase/ Gameplay-

												This game is one of my favourite games to play, i would really recommend this to anyone with an imagination and that needs a good laugh. You have a magic notebook that can create anything you want and the fun part is you can play around in the world with it or also try and get starites from around the world. The storyline itself is about a couple that love to go on adventures together and were happy together they ended up having a lot of children and passed on the thrill for adventure to the children but one day the only girl of the family meets a wizard who tricks her and turns her into stone the only way to save her? starites throughout the world as soon as you complete the world she gets better. It's a very cute game and i really enjoyed playing it! i  think everyone should give it a chance i'm sure you would find something funny or amusing to do in the game! :)			"

												It almost seems like attaching the adjectives 'charming', 'gentle' or 'lovely' to a description of this game might be damning with faint praise. After all, wholesomeness only goes so far, right? Well, luckily that's not really the case. Scribblenauts IS charming, gentle and lovely and it manages to be all of those things without tipping towards the sickly, saccharine and ultimately bland and nauseating end of the spectrum. Part of this comes down the player throwing themselves into the spirit of the game. For someone who has no problem negotiating play time with their inner child, the game is a treat: relaxing, witty, occasionally quite puzzling, and offering up possibilities for creative solutions at every turn. And, y'know, when a game is that completely pleasant it also makes it all a lot more fun. Good game.			"

												Ever wanted to have the power supreme, being able to materialize anything you could think of at a moment's notice? Annoyed with adventure games that reject your awesome solutions to the puzzles simply by not giving you the desired items? If you answered Yes to both, then Scribblenauts is for you. It encourages many ways to go about the challenges, or just wreak havoc on your fellow man, while still promoting creativity, and even if you are not that savvy about correct spelling, you might even learn something with this. Even if you try to be witty at first, it may be a while until you find something that is not in the game's vocabulary, apart from obscenities and copyrighted materials of course. And best of all, the visuals and characters as well as the music score are adorably cute!			"

[*Type* small purple katar] can you do THAT?*weapon similar to Voldo's from soulcalibur appears, the size of my fist and purple*THAT ACTUALLY WORKED?!?!Everytime I typed something the game had something to give me, which blew me away. The possibilities are endless; it would take me weeks to figure out all the graphics the designers shoved into the dicionary. Obscure things like decahexane tetrachloride would actually yield results. If you wanna type Laser Rifle, that would work, or if you type a pew pew pew, you'll still get an alien gun. The level of vocabulary is so diverse. The only things it doesn't have are propernouns/copywrited material, obviously, or they might have to type Lawyer, and there's no profanity/adult content, which actually is pretty funny when you type♥♥♥♥♥and a donkey appears. The flaw to this game is that the main story only has a very limited number of hours to the gameplay, even if you go on to do notebook challenges. Unless you find it enjoyable to simply make your own stuff and play around in a sandbox (A massive one), which I do, you probably won't get more than 10-20 hours out of it, unless you're a child.

Using the adjectives for the first time (the original had no adjectives) was awesome.  The amount of fun is only limited to how big of an imagination you have.  Overall, it's an enjoyable, fun game if you're looking for a casual puzzle game that isn't as intense or hard as the Portal series.			"

												It's casual.  And open world.  And it invokes creativity.  And it is even intelligent in certain aspects.  However, perhaps the main feature that makes this game really neat is because although it gives an ample selection of pre-created objects & NPCs in any given part of the game's world, you can create practically anything imaginable using your Notepad, and then add in-game ""Adjectives"" that describe the object and will alter its behavior.  To top it off, this amazing game comes complete with Steam Workshop support, so you can share your fun creations with others and utilize their content in your own gameplay.  Definately recommend you try it!			"

												When you first look at this game, your thinking ""This is a kids game, why would I play it?"" Well, that is also what I thought first. But my thoughts totally changed later when I dived into this game. The game may be designed for kids but in my opinion its for all ages. I was particularly impressed by the crap loads of words that the game had to offer. You have a notebook where you type in words that turn into objects. Or you can add a adjective to the object. There are missions where you help people or you can just mess around spawning stuff. I also like how they added the object editor which let's you add your custom objects.So if you can I definitely recommend you get the game. It is tons of fun and you will never be disappointed that you bought the game.			"

												Played scribblenauts on the DS and it was amazing.Played the sequel and it got better.Played this, it could've been better.Scribblenauts unlimited is not a bad game, far from it. It's a good game but the only thing that made me sad is that they dumbed it down a bit. I like the free exploring through the world, create an object is fun and the starites do have humor in it.What i really miss is the diffeculty that the DS games had(wings and jetpacks were less OP as well).The starite missions are fun for its objectives and the humor it shows, the starite shards are also nicely done.Both starite and starite shard objectives have references to other things to make it even more complete.Overall Scribblenauts is a nice game to buy, it's well worth the price. If you don't like the price, just wait for a sale to come up.			"

												Scribblenauts is, to put it bluntly, a puzzle sandbox.  If you can think of whatever could be used to solve a puzzle (or not), you can type it's name and summon it.  This game also includes adjectives, so you can write ""explosive rainbow bacon"" and get just that.  If the game cannot summon it, just hop on over to the workshop and see what others have made, or make it yourself with the painlessly easy object creator/editor.  Suddenly you've got yourself a nuclear bacon launcher and catgirl with the face of an elder god in the game.  It's extremely easy and wholly entertaining to ignore the main game and wreak utter havoc with what you summon.  The game makes you the closest thing to a physical god as possible, so go completely nuts.			"

												Played scribblenauts on the DS and it was amazing.Played the sequel and it got better.Played this, it could've been better.Scribblenauts unlimited is not a bad game, far from it. It's a good game but the only thing that made me sad is that they dumbed it down a bit. I like the free exploring through the world, create an object is fun and the starites do have humor in it.What i really miss is the diffeculty that the DS games had(wings and jetpacks were less OP as well).The starite missions are fun for its objectives and the humor it shows, the starite shards are also nicely done.Both starite and starite shard objectives have references to other things to make it even more complete.Overall Scribblenauts is a nice game to buy, it's well worth the price. If you don't like the price, just wait for a sale to come up.			"

Some of the puzzles are way to simple and some of the solutions dont make much sense, but what can you ask for a game that was made for kids. Very good soundtrack and an original artstyle make this a very solid adventure game.			"

												Honestly, i was sceptical about playing Scribblenauts Unlimited.It looks simple enough, but does not look like my 'type' of game. Keeping an open mind I gave it a go!I was impressed!The game has you completing hundred of tasks ranging in difficulty and hilarity.You are equipped with a notepad which enables you to create just about anything, and add adjectives to objects and people!One task asks you to dispose of toxic waste in a better manner than being dumped on the sea floor.So i pulled out my note book, equipped myself with a rifle and shot the barrels up. They disappeared and task was accomplished.It's even just fun to mess with different adjectives and objects. I took a lion, a basic lion, added some wings, added adjectives 'massive, scary' and it immediately changed into a massive scary flying lion.As the game progresses, you find some tasks which are similar, but its fun to just do these in a more ridiculous way than you did it the last time!

												Fed people in the diner. You can literally feed a cannibal ""corpse"" or ""baby"". 12/10.Seriously though. This game gives you a lot of options for how to solve problems, and lets you apply a certain degree of customization to it. My only complaint is that (so far?) you only unlock brothers to play as. Is Lily really the only sister of the family? I think little girls would like female characters to play as too. Still, you can give the guys dresses and wigs to wear, so if you really wish to express your feminine side, get creative!You can also spawn gigantic beasts that attack people. Or ride around everywhere on a pegasus.			"

Well if you wish that is.It is a game in which the player can get creative, in a most verbose way, giving live to your own ideas to solve quests and riddles. And with each starite you get closer to the ultimate goal of the game.The game is captivating, because it has a lot of quite comedic capabilities.

												It's casual.  And open world.  And it invokes creativity.  And it is even intelligent in certain aspects.  However, perhaps the main feature that makes this game really neat is because although it gives an ample selection of pre-created objects & NPCs in any given part of the game's world, you can create practically anything imaginable using your Notepad, and then add in-game ""Adjectives"" that describe the object and will alter its behavior.  To top it off, this amazing game comes complete with Steam Workshop support, so you can share your fun creations with others and utilize their content in your own gameplay.  Definately recommend you try it!			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimted is the game you go to when you want to let your imagination run wild. You want a ridable fire-breathing huge Cthulu? You can have it. You want a diamond coat? You can have it.Anything you want, in this game, there's a 90% chance you can have it. And if the thing you want isn't in the game? Make it yourself or download something like it from the Steam Workshop! :DYou are Maxwell, and your sister, Lily, has been cursed by an evil old man and is turning into stone, and the only way to stop her from fully turning into stone is by going out around the world and doing good deeds for people to collect ""Starites"" to make everything better, and for her to stop turning into stone.With your magical notebook, you can create anything you want, your imagination can run wild in this game.The game also comes with Steam Achievements and Trading Cards, as well as Workshop support for the game, so getting new content is so easy, just by the click of a button!The replay value in the game is pretty large, considering you can do anything you want, and collecting all of the stariets will be quite a challenge, but rewarding in the end.The game can get pretty repetitive at times though, which is unfortunate, considering it shouldn't be repetitive at all, there's a lot of ""I want this"" quests, and it can get quite annoying after a while, doing the same quest for a person with a different name.I give this game an 8.9/10, it's a great game, but a few shortcomings stop it from being a perfect game.I still would recommend you to buy it, it's worth the asking price of £14.99.

In terms of difficulty, the game is as difficult as you make it to basically a situation arises, and you type in a word and whatever you type in appears in front of you... situations can be overcome simply, or by taking a more extravagant approach, for example in one mission you have to defend a base from attack, it says to spawn an army, so i spawned an army of alien robots, wearing jetpacks and firing laser rifles... this is just a little of what the game has to offer.. rewarding you for creating things at random too, and there are many guides out there that can help :)			"

												Scribblenauts is a lot of fun without going very deep. You can enjoy the entire world map and the main story without getting any object shards... little word-play puzzles based on how seperate objects interact. And this is what I did. I finished the whole game, unaware that I hadn't done everything I could.Then, when I noticed all those achievements I hadn't gotten, I opened the menu, looked at the ""shards"" and immediately became twice as entertained. That's right: I became twice as entertained once I'd _finished_ the game.A beauty queen is tired of being pretty. Make her a ""lycanthropic beauty queen"" and spawn a full moon, and you get a shard. That's what an object shard is. And it's amazing.I'm plowing through all those now, but suffice to say, this game is creative and fun and it makes me happy. Avoid the temptation to look any of the answers up; The puzzles are fairly simple and you'll get it on one or two tries, and there's nothing more gratifying than figuring out a solution like lycanthropic beauty queen.Buy.

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is a brilliant concept. You're faced with a myriad of problems throughout the game and have to solve them by conjuring items from a magic notebook. The number of items you can conjure is impressive. Everything from the Kraken, to God, to microbes and dark matter can be summoned to solve challenges. You can spend ages figuring out the most ingenious way to solve a puzzle, and seeing your solution finally work is satisfying. Unfortunately, there's little incentive to solve puzzles this way when more obvious methods are just as effective. Some items cannot be summoned at all, even if they seem obvious (blood comes to mind). Nevertheless, Scribblenauts is a charming puzzler which can be fun for adults as well as the kids.			"

												- If you've played the previous Scribblenauts, would not recommend.- If you've never heard of Scribblenauts in your life and you like coming up with creative answers to things, go for it. My view's quite biased as I played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the original and ESPECIALLY Super Scribblenauts, big fan of the series, but was severely disappointed with Unlimited.A lot easier and boring than the previous Scribblenauts. 3/4s of the way through, still not having any fun, except for the odd randomness here and there.The answers are either really stupidly obvious or really stupidly not-obvious - and that's not in a funny way.I liked the old 'advanced' system, where you'd have to replay the levels with different answers every time. That encouraged more creative thinking.The hints are also a lot more blatant in Unlimited - ""Try using a hat"" or ""He wants a place to sleep"".But, the new object editor feature is pretty damn awesome. Made a cat-spawning afro, spawned hundreds of cats, didn't crash, 10/10. Though I kind of wish the old level maker was still in the game, that would've kept me more interested in the game if we could try other people's levels.			"

With the ability to spawn almost any item into your world the possibilities are endless.Solve puzzles by writing anything in your little notebook. Anything written…comes to life. This game uses attractive, bright and colourful 2D graphics - which is very appealing. The only real negative I can find, is the puzzles are easy – but you will always find new, creative ways to solve them. The game is only restricted by your imagination.A brilliant idea for a game and I suggest you give it a try. My rating 9/10			"

												I feel that this game is for people which are younger than me. I am 20, but heck, I enjoyed every minute of it. :D Don't read the spoiler if you haven't played the game. Imagine if you actually had a magic book and a pen in real life. That would be awesome. I would have used it to help people: like feed the poor, etc.  Definitely recommend this game. One of the best games that I played. :D			"

Lots of fun!I would give this game 7/10			"

												The game is very limited. The game advertises you to be creative, but the more you play, the more you realize that there are very few right choices to progress. Even worse, the puzzles are extremlely easy. Things like, ""im hungry"", gets reused a lot. And some puzzles almost feel broken. For example.Everytime a puzzle comes up with somebody trying to sneak by a security guard, all you have to do is put him to sleep and it happens more than one occasion.			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited may seem like kids-only game but it is fun for kids of all ages ;). Fun is not as much in finding a solution to the puzzle (as most of them will be rather obvious) but rather finding the most wacky solution you can think of and make it work. Of course you can help the pirate by giving him more cannonballs to shoot out of his cannon, but why not try giving him tiny pink chickens and see what happens. The world around changes with your every action and creating one small innocent zombie may result in having a horde of undead-everything few minutes after.So let your imagination go wild!			"

												As my first Scribblenauts game, I was blown away at how open the player is to interact in EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. Your imagination is your only limitation to this game as you incorperate adjectives and nouns to complete challenges or riddles that the NPC's give you. Abeit it might not be an action game, or fast paced, Scribblenauts will bring joy to puzzle enthusists and those who need a break from their usual gaming selection. I had a relaxing time with this game and could reccomend it to anybody.			"

Aside for another great story across many boards that challenge your ability to think of fun, creative or creepy solutions to problems big and small, this installment also includes the Object Editor, where you can take anything and make anything. A giant grandma with cars for arms that shoots out cats at clowns? Done. A hydra that has a dog head, a dragon head and an ant head that is colored like a sweater? Check. A purple angel that explodes when it comes in contact with cheese in a nuclear fireball? Bingo.I've had hours and hours of fun with this game and it never gets old. It's worth every penny			"

												*writes the word awesome review into magic journal*It's a diffrent game then what you, I, we, him, or anyone else in this world is used to. It's almost like a childrens learning tool except it makes you actually use your brain! However, the title is missleading, you don't ""scribble"" or ""naut"" you just type. Also there's limits, nothing is unlimited. EXCEPT FOR MY ABILITY TO REVIEW GAMES!!!! I AM AN UNSTOPPABLE DESTROYER OF ALL EXPECTATIONS AND REALITY. ALL THOSE WHO STAND IN MY PATH OF QUALITY INFORMATIVE CREATIVE SARCASTIC REVIEWS WILL SUFFER THE SMITEFUL MIGHT OF MY VERBOSE VOCABULARY! YOU ARE JUST A MERE MORTAL AND I AM A GOD!

Also the level design can be confusing at times and the vast ammount of objects on the screen can cause confusion.The background textures, when closely examined, are also meerly childrens drawings with no depth or perspective. This game is a hit or miss. For me it was a hit, but for YOU PEICES OF WEEK CRAP IT WILL BE A MISS BECAUSE YOU ARE ALL TOO STUPID TO EVEN ATTEMPT SUCH A GAME! I AM SUPRISED YOU CAN EVEN READ THIS REVIEW YOU IMBECILES! YOU ARE ALL UNWORTHY OF THIS TEXT FOR WHICH I HATH CREATED!

												Personal Rating: 8 of 10Great fun for the young and adult. Scribblenauts is a puzzle adventure games where you travel from one map to another and help the characters residing in the area by creating and manipulating objects! You can create from animals to robots to even becoming Zeus yourself. The game offers unlimited space for your imagination and creativity. Play with your family and kids as this seems to be a great platform for learning as well. However, you can only create objects that are not copyrighted and the objects comes in limited visuals; but this can be overcome by downloading objects designed by other players or create your own in the editor.

I recommend adding weird before the name. Highly recommend this game, even if its just for a few hours of screwing around, its well worth it			"

												I spent a little over 10 hours in this game doing every level and every side quest. I did not do the mini-puzzles in the book but I did every level.I enjoyed the game quite a bit, but almost the entire game was too easy and the puzzles were funny but not hard.The basic idea is that you can use a book to spell out any item or change a description of an item to solve puzzles. You can be very creative and specific or you can be simple and generic.... both will generally solve the puzzles.There was no combat missions, or create a situation level... so after I played every level, I decided to goof around and make ""massive epic mega ultra portal"" and have giant monsters do battle, but quickly found that playing outside of puzzles isn't as fun as i wanted.Cool game, worth it but only for the casual who is creative.

												Scribblenauts is such a great idea for a game. Choose the items you want to create to solve the puzzle. This game can create practically anything. Sure, some words that are similar end up looking the same, but it seems like the game's dictionary is huge. When I find myself find certain words too often, I'll try to stop using it because I want to make different items appear.You can choose to pass every level or cause destruction. This game has replayable because you can try solving the same puzzle with different words. The possibilities are nearly endless it seems. And, you can change your character which is awesome. There are no voice-overs, but who needs that when you have the nouns of the English language at your fingertips.If you love puzzle adventure games like I do, buy this game! "

												Sbcribblenauts is a very unique type of game. You are given the power to create anything, and i mean anything. Even if it isn't programmed into the game, chances aer someone on steam has made it and uploaded it. If not, you can create it yourself. The visuals are cartoony, like a drawing, and the sound is nice and cheerful. The story consists of you helping multiple people to make them happy. It dose get boring after a while, but it's always fun to mess around and see what kind of crazy situation you can get yourself into. 8/10			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is a very impressive game. The whole point of the game is to simply conjure any item you want (within reason) at any time. The Scribblenauts series consists of a range of small puzzles that require you to use whatever items you want to complete your objective, earning a star in the process. Scribblenauts Unlimited differs from the previous game in the series by having a small free-roam element that steps away from simply clicking on the unlocked level you want to do, but rather you find puzzles through exploration. Another new feature is the object creation, where players may create their own items that they can share online. I recommend this game for puzzle fans with imagination, people who think outside 'the box' and idiots who want to see Deadpool fight an army of vampires while riding Alduin.			"

 Positive + Simplistic and cute art style+ Big variety in the amount of objects and creations you can generate, sometimes leading to comedic outcomes+ Good enough length for what the gameplay has to offer (around 4 ½ hours for the main game, add another 2-3 hours if you want to do everything the game offers). Negative - Gameplay is overall too simple (though the game is targeted at a younger audience, so this is intentional). Verdict “A very fun and creative package, Scribblenauts Unlimited gives the user an environment with (almost) complete free reign to design solutions to many various problems. Think word association with added charm.” 7.5/10 TJBs   "

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is your average scribblenauts game. Scribblenauts, as you may already know, started out as a series of Nintendo DS games, Like Scribblenauts and Super Scribblenauts.Now, Don't look away from this game. This game, is, in MY opinion, is the best game in the entire series. Now, lets start with the plot. One time, long ago, there were two young adventurers, Grandma Julie, and Grandpa Edgar. Now, these two often challenged eachother as they explored all over the world. But, it always seemed Julie beat Edgar to the treasure. One day, Julie, Who once again, Beats Edgar to a lost pyramid, Found an engagement ring! Awww... The two retired to start a family. And wanna guess how many kids they had? FORTY FREAKING TWO. Anyways. They had two special  children, named Maxwell and Lily. They gave them Two amazing gifts. One of them was a magic globe, that allowed them to go anywhere they pleased. The second, was the greatest notebook ever found-- It was able to create anything you wrote into it. ""Like a flying rainbow laser-eyed dolphin?"" ... Yes .... Anyways, They're parents, (Yeah, Remeber them?) Thought that giving them these gifts will turn them into spoiled brats. So they sent them off, to face the challenges of the outside world. On they way to the city, they ran into an old man, who said he was famished. So Maxwell, ignoring common sense and not using the notebook for good, Gave the old man something to eat, Which was an apple. No. Not any regular apple, A rotten one! The old man spat out the part of the apple he ate, and somehow places a curse on Lily that is turning her to stone! Maxwell creates a red wagon, and hurrys off to Edwin's Farm. Edwin, who is one of maxwell's brothers, is a farmer. Edwin seemed pretty upset with Maxwell and what he did to the peasant. So, in order to remove the curse, Maxwell needs to collect Starites, by making people happy and using the notebook for good. DANG! That was a pretty dang long plot summary. Anyways, onto the next segment of this review. GRAPHICS! This game. Oh my gosh, THIS GAME. Has some of the best graphics I have ever seen! Not only to we get to learn Maxwell's Backstory, But we learn in in HD Graphics! Next up, MUSIC!My gosh, they went all out with the soundtrack on this one. It sounds aboslutely wonderful! Its just a joy to listen to. GAMEPLAY! Now, heres the thing that is just so cool about scribblenauts. You can CREATE anything you write down! And you use this to your advantage to solve puzzles! DOWNSIDE! Well, the real downside is, that it seems that the puzzles have been... A bit.. Simplifed... And thats what kind of drags about this game. The puzzles are either really easy, which is about 45% of them, Medium, about the same, 45%, and Hard? About 10%. So, The games difficulty is so out of place, like, sometimes, theres an easy level with ONE single hard puzzle in it. That is the downside to this game. But, Sence it IS a scribblenauts game, You know, YOU KNOW It has to be good. My rating? 9.3 out of 10. Scribblenauts Unlimited, Is alot better than the ones on DS, but sometimes the difficulty gets in the way. But I still recommend you give it a go.			"

												Really cool game if you are under 10 years old... No seriously, it looks fantastic and runs very well. Buy it for your kids... your young kids though. You have small puzzles to solve that earn you stars that will save your sister. You solve these puzzles by typing the name of an object which makes it puff into existence. As I said, good for kids!!!			"

It's definitely a great fun learning game for kids, or a casual pastime for those of you who are a little grown up. This game is also pretty well thought out, you can interact with, and draw out anything from the 'magical book' from almost any noun or verb you can think of.Definitely a recommended title for those of you who are interested. No hesitation, just get it.			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is your average scribblenauts game. Scribblenauts, as you may already know, started out as a series of Nintendo DS games, Like Scribblenauts and Super Scribblenauts.Now, Don't look away from this game. This game, is, in MY opinion, is the best game in the entire series. Now, lets start with the plot. One time, long ago, there were two young adventurers, Grandma Julie, and Grandpa Edgar. Now, these two often challenged eachother as they explored all over the world. But, it always seemed Julie beat Edgar to the treasure. One day, Julie, Who once again, Beats Edgar to a lost pyramid, Found an engagement ring! Awww... The two retired to start a family. And wanna guess how many kids they had? FORTY FREAKING TWO. Anyways. They had two special  children, named Maxwell and Lily. They gave them Two amazing gifts. One of them was a magic globe, that allowed them to go anywhere they pleased. The second, was the greatest notebook ever found-- It was able to create anything you wrote into it. ""Like a flying rainbow laser-eyed dolphin?"" ... Yes .... Anyways, They're parents, (Yeah, Remeber them?) Thought that giving them these gifts will turn them into spoiled brats. So they sent them off, to face the challenges of the outside world. On they way to the city, they ran into an old man, who said he was famished. So Maxwell, ignoring common sense and not using the notebook for good, Gave the old man something to eat, Which was an apple. No. Not any regular apple, A rotten one! The old man spat out the part of the apple he ate, and somehow places a curse on Lily that is turning her to stone! Maxwell creates a red wagon, and hurrys off to Edwin's Farm. Edwin, who is one of maxwell's brothers, is a farmer. Edwin seemed pretty upset with Maxwell and what he did to the peasant. So, in order to remove the curse, Maxwell needs to collect Starites, by making people happy and using the notebook for good. DANG! That was a pretty dang long plot summary. Anyways, onto the next segment of this review. GRAPHICS! This game. Oh my gosh, THIS GAME. Has some of the best graphics I have ever seen! Not only to we get to learn Maxwell's Backstory, But we learn in in HD Graphics! Next up, MUSIC!My gosh, they went all out with the soundtrack on this one. It sounds aboslutely wonderful! Its just a joy to listen to. GAMEPLAY! Now, heres the thing that is just so cool about scribblenauts. You can CREATE anything you write down! And you use this to your advantage to solve puzzles! DOWNSIDE! Well, the real downside is, that it seems that the puzzles have been... A bit.. Simplifed... And thats what kind of drags about this game. The puzzles are either really easy, which is about 45% of them, Medium, about the same, 45%, and Hard? About 10%. So, The games difficulty is so out of place, like, sometimes, theres an easy level with ONE single hard puzzle in it. That is the downside to this game. But, Sence it IS a scribblenauts game, You know, YOU KNOW It has to be good. My rating? 9.3 out of 10. Scribblenauts Unlimited, Is alot better than the ones on DS, but sometimes the difficulty gets in the way. But I still recommend you give it a go.			"

												I have completed this game and have gone through all the missions and done all the achievements, and I can tell you it's not as fun as I expected. It's good for the first <10 hours and then it starts to get awfully repetitive and quite boring. It really needed something more to stop it from getting boring. I think that if you have played any Scribblenauts game before,  it's really not worth your money as they are all practically the same. However on the bright side it is rather fun to play around with different props and items and to make traps and experiment with weapons and monsters (try 'cthulu').Overall I'd give it a 6.5/10 because of its repetitive gameplay.

												If you're looking for a game review than you came to the wrong place, now if you wanted a delicious pancake recipe...Ingredients + EquipmentYou’ll need a mixing bowl, a wire whisk, a spatula and a non-stick griddle or skillet. An electric griddle works wonders too, if you make a lot of pancakes at your house. The ingredients you’ll need are:1 ¼ cup milk  2 eggs 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons sugar 3 teaspoons baking powder ¼ teaspoon saltThe BatterPancakes aren’t complicated, so the batter is everything! For best results, mix that bowl of batter up right before it’s going to hit the griddle.The wet ingredients come together first. Beat the milk, eggs and vegetable oil in a mixing bowl with a wire whisk.The dry ingredients—flour, baking powder, sugar and salt—are then stirred into the wet mixture. Baking powder is what makes the pancakes fluffy, while the sugar helps the exterior caramelize just enough. And a dash of our friend salt enhances the flavor.Gently mix everything together until it’s combined, but still lumpy. It’ll only take about 10-15 seconds to get to that liquidy-lumpy state. If you over-mix the batter, you’re going to be chowing down on a very tough, rubbery pancake because the gluten molecules start having a party. If you under-mix, you might end up with a mouthful of flour.The CookingBrush a non-stick griddle or skillet with vegetable oil, clarified butter or cooking spray before heating. You don’t need too much with a nonstick pan. (You may be tempted to use regular butter, but it tends to burn easily. Save the butter for the breakfast table.)Heat the griddle over medium-high heat. To determine when the griddle is ready for pancake action, run your hand under the faucet and carefully flick just a tiny bit of water onto the surface of the pan. The water droplets will bead up and sizzle when it’s ready.Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the hot griddle and cook 1-2 minutes or until the bubbles on the surface have finished popping and the pancake is dry around the edges.Now it’s time to flip. Using a spatula, gently turn the pancake over and cook on the other side until golden brown.Serve warmFluffy PancakesPrint Recipe  (0)    0 View Full RecipeIngredientsStepsHow to Keep Pancakes HotIf you’re cooking for a crowd, turn the oven to 325°F and put your finished pancakes on a baking sheet as they come off the griddle. That way they all stay hot until you are ready to eat.How to Store Leftover Pancakes in the FreezerStack cooled pancakes between a sheet of waxed paper or parchment. Wrap the stack in foil and freeze. To reheat, preheat the oven to 400°F. Unwrap frozen pancakes and remove from waxed paper. Heat pancakes in a single layer on an ungreased cookie sheet for 5 to 7 minutes or until heated through.How to Store Leftover BatterStoring leftover batter is one of those things one could technically do, but should one? Nah, one really shouldn’t.The baking powder loses its oomph very quickly and the gluten molecules have a field day of chewiness when they are allowed to sit around. Rather than storing leftover batter, we recommend making just the right amount of batter for your breakfast or cooking up the whole batch and storing leftover pancakes in the freezer as directed above.Back To TopTwists on PancakesPancakes are meant to be twisted! There are so many ways you can upgrade your pancakes, from batter mix-ins to mid-griddle additions to final toppings.Batter mix-ins might include pureed pumpkin with pumpkin pie spice, lemon zest and ricotta cheese or even mashed bananas. Our Gingerbread Pancakes are perfect for the holidays. Buttermilk is a common substitute for milk in pancakes too, as the acidity provides extra volume, browning and flavor. Adding additional (or different) wet ingredients may mean you need to adjust your dry ingredients accordingly, so unless you’re simply shaking a bit of cinnamon into your batter, you’ll want to follow a recipe to make sure your flavored pancakes turn out perfectly.Mid-griddle additions would include those tasty bits that you’ll want to place on your hot cakes before you flip them—things like whole berries, chocolate chips, crunchy granola or little pieces of bacon. Adding these types of things to the individual pancakes rather than the batter helps them stay evenly distributed and keeps them from burning. You can use the same Fluffy Pancake recipe outlined above and easily personalize it with whatever you like without changing the batter.Topping options are pretty much unlimited when it comes to pancakes, and also don’t require any new recipe. Obviously butter and maple syrup are classic pancake pairings for a reason—there is no substitute for a hefty drizzle of real maple syrup. But it’s also wonderful to think outside the syrup container and try topping your pancakes with jam, caramel, nuts, fruit, whipped cream, sprinkles and more!8 Easy Twists on Pancakes Gingerbread PancakesGingerbread Pancakes Blueberry Sour Cream PancakesBl			"

												I never really did like Scribblenauts on the Nintendo DS, but it was a great concept nevertheless. Imagine that you can write down anything - ANYTHING - in your notepad and it appears as an (animated) object. That's... that's just awesome, don't you agree ? All you need is a bit of imagination and you create the wildest things.Still, I was a bit sceptic when I purchased and played Scribblenauts Unlimited because: 1) I thought it would be a simple port, and 2) it wouldn't be any fun for me now (if it wasn't already back then, right ?). I'm so glad I was wrong - once again.Scribblenauts is an amazing port, with beautiful art that looks extremely detailed in 2560x1440. The overview map is the one thing that looks kinda low res. Other than that; great stuff. And there are so many (parts of) stars to collect that you'll never run out of things to do (ok, maybe not, but still...). This game has character !Another thing that took some time to get used to, though, was the fact that you have to switch between mouse and keyboard frequently. It's nothing major, but it's a bit clumsy.Scribblenauts should be in anyone's collection, especially considering the price.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												A polished and full-featured offering to the Scribblenauts series. Being on PC and having access to things like the keyboard and the Steam Workshop greatly improve the game. It is somewhat annoying to have to figure out what the game wants you to say, as its understanding of words can be limited at time. For instance, one puzzle needs you to evaluate a piece of art and typing ""art expert"" doesn't work, but ""expert"" by itself does. A mechanic can't repair a robot because a mechanic repairs cars, but a scientist can because science. Little things like that. Luckily those issues aren't usually a huge barrier to progress.			"

												When this game first came out it was original and different and I remember enjoying the original Scribblenauts on my Nintendo DS, but playing it now the puzzles feel dull and takes an excruciatingly low amount of effort to solve a problem. Aside from the main quest there are ""Starite shards"" which take up most of the game and often has the f*cking answer in the question itself. I feel like this is how this game should of been all along and they shouldn't of made multiple entries in this series. This game is fun at the start but gets extremely boring and repetitive quite quickly. I can't help but feel this game is very childish and is marketed towards younger audiences with everything being resolved by common sense. ""Hey I need to get smarter do something"" *Adds smart adjective to the character* ""Hey I'm smart now you did it"" HOORAY -_- I really can't help but feel dissapointed by this game.			"

I love sandbox games, and this brought a whole new meaning to that genre to meI may be a little late to discover this game, but all these things still apply today. OverviewVenture into a wide-open world where the most powerful tool is your imagination. Help Maxwell solve robust puzzles in seamless, free-roaming levels by summoning any object you can think of. Create your own original objects, assign unique properties, and share them with friends online using Steam Workshop – to be used in game or further modified as you like! Points of interestThe amount of things you can create and do in this game is staggering, plus it's got steam workshop!If it exists, you can probably type it!Animate your creations with adjectives, provides for even more possibilities.The puzzles are fun and can be completed in many different ways, not just one.Around 13 or 14 hours of gameplay to complete the storyEasy to 100% achievments-Some puzzles may be difficult for kids, but there is always guides to help with that.-Controls can be a little frustrating if you use your mouse to move, and clicking on things can be challenging, but WASD is a welcome alternativeSummaryA charming game full of possibilities. Recommended for all ages: great for the kids or for you to play in your spare time! 9/10			"

												When the astoundingly ambitious Scribblenauts was originally released for the Nintendo DS I completely loved it.  You were tasked with solving a simple puzzle – get a starite (the game’s star-shaped macguffin), and to do so you could conjure up just about any item you could think of, from the commonplace like cars and ladders, to more outside-the-box things like arsonists and marimbas.  I was always surprised such an excellent game was made by 5th Cell, a game company that was, up to that point, a veritable mediocrity factory.  Was 5th Cell secretly a team of amazing game designers?Scribblenauts Unlimited answers this question with a resounding “No.”Unlimited introduces some new features that should make this game a hit – like an item editor that allows you to create your own stuff.  And, as much as I appreciate a game that allows me to make a bazooka that shoots newborn infants, the new mission-style of the game itself is what ruins it.  Doing a simple task like “get a starite” was rewarding because the solution was open to your imagination.  There was any number of solutions you could use and solving a level made you feel smart and accomplished.  When someone gives you a mission in Unlimited by saying “Boy, I’m hungry.” I don’t care if you say pizza, artichokes, or quinoa, thinking of a kind of food will never feel like an accomplishment.  Also, people who give their missions out to you exist in such a cramped space, sometimes you accidentally solve other peoples’ missions without intending to.			"

But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients- To Make the Dough375 grams (3 cups) plain flour1/2 teaspoon salt2 eggs1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) waterExtra flour for dusting - To Make Cheese Filling15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.1/2 cup cheddar cheese2 eggs, lightly beaten1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon pepper- ExtrasYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)Parmesan cheeseBasilFried vegetablesShrimpFish slicesChicken pieces Make the Ravioli filling.- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough.- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!

												The fun of this game comes from thinking up and creating absurd items. The problem is that none of the puzzles require absurd items like flaming helicopters, dancing hippos, or angry claymores to solve, so you end up using the same five items over and over because you know they work, thus turning the game into tedious chore.

More Bells and Whistles with Less Challenging PuzzlesLike Lego, I am more impressed by its predecessors(the originals) than the later editionsWAY back when I remember my friend showed me Scribblenauts, I was determined to achieve all stars/most creative methods on all levels. I borrowed her game and played it religiously.Less is more?This edition has a coreherent world, an editor to create your own customized items among other functions. Yet, I feel that because all the puzzles are scenario-specific to fit into the world, the possibilities become limited. Trust me, I have summoned a Gentlemanly Cthuhlu to scare a pegasus drawing a piece of rope to move a car...or an oil rig to crush a bad guy...so I have tried my best to solve problems impractically. In the end, something is still kind of lacking...Some of my overall positve experienceEasy to learn and navigate, but the menu can be a bit cumbersomeCharacters and art is still bright and quirky as everCreate and use your own character instead of eg.MaxwellCute but confined scenariosStill a unique puzzle gameConsAs i have mentioned, more restrictive than is predecessorThe user base creation becomes mostly flooded with fanart of games and memes Personally I was hoping to see a game that encourages creative problem solving and ridiculous thinking rather than being  limited by a series of very situational scenariosConclusion:Take a wee bit of my money or none at all: I am reluctantly giving this a not recommended rating because I have seen better release from the Scribblenauts series. It is still a fun game but it has definitely fallen short. As a result, it's not a must have. Feel free to purchase this though, as it can still be entertaining.			"

												The workshop is awesome, but I really wanted to be able to make levels like you can in Super Scribblenauts. If your going to buy a Scribblenauts game I would go for unmasked, so many super heroes and their lore. It is a must have for any DC fan and with the workshop Marvel fan or just super heroes in general. This game may be a little bit of a let down but its still Scribblenauts!!!!! 7/10			"

												While the game itself may be fun, the lack of a terrain editor just completley ruined it for me. I would have also wanted a scenerio editor (and yes, I greatley enjoyed using them in the previous titles, in spite of their flaws), but I could live without that. But without a way to edit the terain of a map, I just can't enjoy this game.			"

												This series used to be good, and it still is in a way.  But after the adjective system was added, the challenge, and the value of most of the game, was lost.  What used to be a game that tested your ability in word association has now turned into a game about making up nonsensical items.  The ways you can solve puzzles now are so easy; you could complete a majority of the game using nothing but sticks.  Here are a few examples:""Make an item that will put out this fire."" CRYING STICK""Prepare a steak for this customer"" COOKING STICK""Make something for this art museum"" BEAUTIFUL MODERN STICK""Give Santa something he likes, but doesn't already have"" MERRY STICK""Scare away the Vampire"" HOLY STICK""Make this date more romantic"" ROMANTIC STI- actually, don't use that one.Point is, the game has been simplified by this mechanic, and it doesn't reward you in any way for being logical or creative.  Kinda sad, because if they did, you would have a clear, straight upgrade of a game from the first Scribblenauts.  The workshop is flooded with poor remakes of copyrighted characters; something that was purposely left out in the original games.  Its a shame I can't recommend this, because the amount of work put into the engine and content would definitely be worth the $20 price tag if the single player wasn't so absurdly easy.  The most enjoyable part of this game is derping around like its a sandbox game.  If that sounds like something you would get a kick out of, by all means buy this.  Just know that the single player ain't worth♥♥♥♥♥♥PS: This game has a sequel with DC Comic characters in it.  Same kind of game play, and the addition of DC characters doesn't do much for the game itself.  About the only thing that it does is add visual assets to the workshop mods.  So... you're not really missing much in that one either :v  I guess go for it if you are a fan of derping and comic book hero's?			"

												I recommend this game for children that already know or are learning how to read and write. Do I recommend this game to adults? No.This game is simply not challenging enough for an adult to play. The starite sequences are easy to complete, and the shard hints are easy to figure out. When it comes down to it, the most gameplay you'll be engaging in is pressing ""Enter"" and typing. True, you can do some goofy things like making people blind and making animals fly, turn colors, or force school children to eat cats, but when that is said and done, the game doesn't get much more entertaining.The achievements are rather easy to unlock aswell. All of the shards are available to unlock without any prerequisites, and the starites are achieved through normal gameplay. The most backtrackingI had to do was resetting a level maybe three times. It's nearly impossible to fail at this game unless you accidentally get Maxwell killed. There are no timed levels and the game eventually tells you what to spawn if you take too long to complete a task during a starite mission. My five year old loved this game. He enjoyed the themed levels, the ability to spawn almost anything, and how he could interact with almost all of the objects. We would often play together and the game motivated him to learn how to spell.  He would ask me how to spell certain words and I believe the game made learning a little bit more enjoyable for him. He played this game for a long time before moving on to Scribblenauts: Unmasked.			"

												Scribblenauts is finally available on PC (and now finally available in Europe as well!)  It's a fun little game that has you solve word puzzles by typing in words to create just about anything you could want.  Objects can be modified with a wide variety of adjectives and you can ever create your own objects with custom scripting.  If something isn't in the game already you can easily go find it on the Steam Workshop or create it yourself.To the game itself, it is very fun.  Puzzles can be solved in a wide variety of different ways, giving you room to be creative.  A few of the puzzles are very obtuse which is an annoyance when you run into them, but it's not game breaking.I'm not sure what else there is to say.  Go buy this game!			"

												Scribblenouts Unlimited is one of the most fun casual puzzle games I have ever played. Pretty much all puzzles are very easy (if you know the language well enough) which usually makes for a horrible and boring game, but that's not the case with this one. It's because difficulty is not the mane goal of this theme, it's creativity. In this game puzzles are completed by writing nouns to create new objects or adding adjectives to existing objects. Once you get the gang of the mechanics of the game it becomes ridiculously fun. My personal highlight of the game was the moment when I had to retrieve a ball from an old dudes yard without him noticing aaaaaaaand I just added the adjective ""blind"" to him. I felt so evil once it worked.Get it you dummy!			"

												Have you seen a Flying Rideable Hipster Manical Supersonic Supercharged Sparkling Golden Toaster Oven!? Well I have. You can too if you get this game of PURE FUN.Don't let the cartoony style fool you into thinking this is a game for kids, this is easily one of the most f*cked up games I've ever played to date. In just 20 minutes of play I've helped a chef at his restaurant cook up random things that his customers wanted, one guy wanted pizza so I gave the chef human body parts for his pizza ingredients that made a lovely human pizza afterwards, the dude totally ate the whole thing without a clue, ha ha dummy. The next person wanted a motorcycle... okay, wrong place n' all but whatever I'll just throw some part together and make a bike for you no problem, EXCEPT! once the kickin' rad bike was done the chef decided to take it for himself and drove off with it leaving a crying customer for me to deal. Wasn't my restaurant though so not my problem, I then bailed to some school.First thing I noticed here was this bully forcing some nerd into a locker, I helped this nerd by summoning Mutha Fu**in' NITO, yes NITO from Dark Souls, who then bullied the crap out of this bully, after soaking in all this glorious irony I then moved onto the cafeteria to help with school lunch, this was a no brainer for me, I fed them a ♥♥♥♥♥ (not that kind :/), unfortunately the kids all died from eating it, not sure why when China eats cats n' stuff, but whatever it didn't matter at that point because I already got my star. I then just flew off on a flying pregnant baby going at supersonic speeds with Solaire from Dark Souls where we praised the Sun for the rest of that play session. This all in just 20 minutes.Seriously get this game, you should play this now. Never mind the fact that little Maxwell is an idiot that almost got his sister killed, all that matters is with this Notebook YOU ARE AN ALL POWERFUL GOD AND SHOULD GIVE ZERO F*CKS.			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is pretty damn fun. Whether you're getting this for yourself, your grandma or your young nephew, this game is great. It's really kid friendly and great for all ages. It definitely has it's drawbacks, but I'd say this game is on the positive side.Scribblenauts is a game where you can create objects by simply typing in their name and they will poof into existence. Now this is limited to objects that have already been created in the engine and as hard as much as you may want to summon some naked gurls, you can't make anything lewd which is fine honestly.The purpose of the game is to collect stars, kind of like Mario 64 and other games, to save your sister or whatever. To get stars you summon objects and things to solve problems. This can be done with lots of different items which you will need to be somewhat creative with, but at the same time you can always just summoner a hover tank and make yourself fly to do most things.Overall the game is solid and just simple fun. Worth around 15 to 25 bucks based on how you value your time.			"

												Great game!!! Tons of interesting, unique, and colorful levels. The story is good. You run around helping people for starites(I won't say why because spoilers!!). You really have to be creative with this game. This can get repetitive though. The graphics are great. The HD added with the color is beautiful and since it is 2D it should be easy for all computers. As for content there's lots to do. Even when your done the game you still have tons to do as anything you right will appear. How they put all this in? No clue! When you think you have seen it all there's more. It has something called object editor  . With this you can make anything you want (It is not to complicated either), you can then post your creation on steam workshop. With Steam Workshop you can see and use other peoples creations, this adds a new level to the game. Overall its a fun game for a casual gamer but if you were expecting it to be all sirius and precis, you came to the wrong place. Overall I give the game 8.3/10			"

												Scribblenauts is a puzzle game where you solve puzzles by making things apper out of a word. Using this the possibilites for completion are endless. There is everything from the entertaining ending to the mundane in this otherwise great game.A definite must play for people of all ages.			"

												Great game!!! Tons of interesting, unique, and colorful levels. The story is good. You run around helping people for starites(I won't say why because spoilers!!). You really have to be creative with this game. This can get repetitive though. The graphics are great. The HD added with the color is beautiful and since it is 2D it should be easy for all computers. As for content there's lots to do. Even when your done the game you still have tons to do as anything you right will appear. How they put all this in? No clue! When you think you have seen it all there's more. It has something called object editor  . With this you can make anything you want (It is not to complicated either), you can then post your creation on steam workshop. With Steam Workshop you can see and use other peoples creations, this adds a new level to the game. Overall its a fun game for a casual gamer but if you were expecting it to be all sirius and precis, you came to the wrong place. Overall I give the game 8.3/10			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is pretty damn fun. Whether you're getting this for yourself, your grandma or your young nephew, this game is great. It's really kid friendly and great for all ages. It definitely has it's drawbacks, but I'd say this game is on the positive side.Scribblenauts is a game where you can create objects by simply typing in their name and they will poof into existence. Now this is limited to objects that have already been created in the engine and as hard as much as you may want to summon some naked gurls, you can't make anything lewd which is fine honestly.The purpose of the game is to collect stars, kind of like Mario 64 and other games, to save your sister or whatever. To get stars you summon objects and things to solve problems. This can be done with lots of different items which you will need to be somewhat creative with, but at the same time you can always just summoner a hover tank and make yourself fly to do most things.Overall the game is solid and just simple fun. Worth around 15 to 25 bucks based on how you value your time.			"

												If you have played Scribblenauts on NDS or IOS and are hoping this game is exactally the same you are sadly wrong. This game is fun but when it comes to creating things out of words it cant be compared to the NDS or IOS port. Simply because it doesnt recognize half the words you put together. For example in the first city there is gaffiti drawn on the wall and you have to get rid of it, So you may be thinking lets get creative with the words so you type Paint Eraser, or Paint Thinner and the game asks you did you mean this, and it gives you 5 pages of words you possibly dont know to replace the words you typed. Its like they took the worst part of gooogle search from the year 2005 by saying did you mean this, and made it into a game.The game is really fun once you get past the flaw of being creative with words and you can even make your own creations and replace other creations with your own in a level such as a ant with your own design by clicking on it and recreating it. But with the 1 flaw thats holding it back it feels like its not the same scribblenauts from the NDS or IOS and was simply made poorly as if the game was made by a different company.The game is a defininate buy but if your a fan of the Original games on NDS or IOS then prepare for extreme ammounts of being angry because the game wont let you make paint thinner for paint but somehow an eraser can get rid of the paint which has no creativity at all when you are trying to get crazy creative with word creations.

												Some puzzles are very specific with their solutions, which makes the ability to ""create anything"" a little daunting. These puzzles are far and few between but frustrating when trying to get 100%. Most of the puzzles were a breeze, so the difficulty spikes were never really in a middle ground, either super easy (most of them) or very specific (difficult).Good for kids and adults alike... but more for kids I'm sure.

												An adult version of this would be SOOO much more fun. I cannot even begin to tell you the amount of things you can do if this was an adult version. But it is a PG version and limited words to choose. A lot of puzzles of certain limited answers when clearly there are more than those few. So it becomes a frustrating exp of choosing and typing and trying until you get stuck and go online and look for it. After a few hours, it becomes repetitive. Suitable for young children but I doubt anyone older than 15 is going to find it fun.			"

												Long ago when I didn't work everyday I was a pretty creative person, I wore a beret, had an evil Mcgee mustache and a paintbrush in hand. So it's only natural I grab a 1 part puzzle game 1 Part LittleBigPlanet story , 2 parts Mr. Rogers at the crayon factory.It's a good concept, along the lines of a creative mind game. You get enjoyment out of it as long as you can imagine stuff to do. If your used to looking down the iron sights like most of my people do, they'd spend 2 hours coming up with different Russian armor and weaponary to spawn. *sigh*  What have we become...3.5 out of 5 chiliwgs			"

												The only game where, after sitting a child down in front of it and turning them loose, it took them 3 hours to stump it and/or crash the game (which occurred when they created a cascade effect of magical items breeding more magical items until everything♥♥♥♥♥♥itself).Highly recommended if you like silliness, Steam Workshop, or being able to solve things with deceased entertainers.Fun fact!

A magic notebook that creates anything that you write into it can lead to a lot of trouble and a lot of good.  To save your sister you must travel the world solving problems to make people happy.The majority of the puzzles can be solved with a small set of words but the real fun is thinking up creative ways to solve problems.  While aimed for younger players this game is still enjoyable for all ages.			"

												It's really fun once you play it. You can make anything appear, except for: real life copyrighted items, vulgar items, and other inappropriate items. If you REALLY want to make those objects, you'll have to create them yourself, using the Item Editor. There is a main story to it and if you actually try to complete it, you can unlock more places to go to. You have the notebook to use for every part in the story. Creating items is the key to this game with adjectives and nouns. I would DEFINITELY reccommend this game for anyone with a creative mind. The possibilities are endless. Also, you can edit yourself however you want to, except that you can't change the torso on Maxwell's body in the Avatar Editor. Sorry, but that star on his chest will stay there.			"

												Kind of fun at first. But way too simple for an adult. The thing that makes this game fun is trying to find silly ways to solve problems. Like trying to build a house with a screwdriver or fight zombies with toys. But once you figure out the underlying systems to solve all the puzzles it starts to get to be a chore trying to figure out how to be silly. Kids might like it though.			"

												Maxwell is the true representation of an all encumbering indivdual, reaching out and trying to touch the entity that is god. Each time he traverses the levels, he is jumping through space and time with his almighty totem of infinite possibilities. Anti-death note some may say, but in truth, Maxwell is his own entity. Disguised as a child's play thing, as he is innocent as the birth of the world is young. I enjoyed this game as it was cheap enough to aid in my art degree.			"

												Ever wanted to make your own story, but always knew it has hard? Welcome to Scribblenauts Unlimited. This is the 3rd Scribblenauts game, but the first for Non-DS. Scribblenauts Unlimited is (hence the name) having unlimited possiblilties. You can add in your own characters, make plots, settings, all kinds of things. Of course, it has a story mode. The story mode does indeed have deep things in it. Really, I suggest you get this game. MAYBE when it has a sale, but really, what are you waiting for? Get your flying pink metal cow today.Score: 9.0/10.0~Jstar			"

Still with that said I guess with some of the crazy things you can do in the game an older audience might have fun goofing around with it.  Also you can edit/create your own objects for the game so that is a healthy thing for a person to do at any age.  In terms of graphics it looks wonderful for what it is trying to be.

												I got this game on a sale since it was rather cheap and it had been a while since I played Scribblenauts. The game, while full of content and a great concept, fails to keep my attention for long. For a game that boasts creativity, the challenges are rather easy and linear. The visuals, however, look great, and the backpack feature was an overdue and welcome addition to the series.Is it worth the current price? No.Is it worth it when it's cheaper than a bag of chips?

												Don't expect the same gameplay as the first two games on DS. While Unlimited is just as charming as the originals, the gameplay is relegated to simply helping other characters perform actions. You're basically ""Helper Scribblenaut."" The solution to most puzzles is pretty linear and you wind up not feeling nearly as creative as in the previous titles. But if you don't have a DS, and this is your only way to experience Scribblenauts, check it out!			"

												I cannot recommend this game. The game consists of various locations populated by people (or animals, or other objects) that have a problem to be solved. These ""problems"" or ""puzzles"" are usually incredible simple, like ""This guy is hungry. Give him something to solve his hunger"" or ""this girl wants something to wear to a party"", or ""this ghost wants to see his reflection"", or ""this elephant wants to be a painter. Give him something a painter would have"", or ""this jockey needs something to ride for the race"". You ""solve"" the puzzles by using your notebook to create an item for the person in question: ""dinner"", ""dress"", ""mirror"", ""palette"", ""horse"". You can be creative in your solutions (""pink polka dot flying horse""), but other than self-amusement, there's no incentive not to go with the first obvious answer the pops in your head. Young children may get a kick out of this game, but personally I thought the game was pretty boring.			"

												This is a really charming game, and the idea behind it is fantastic. The amount of words in the dictionary is really impressive, and you can solve puzzles pretty much any ridiculous way you want. But if you're looking for a good brain workout, look elsewhere. This is by no means a brain-teaser. I'm really confused as to what audience this game was intended for. It's so simplistic that a 6 year old could easily figure out all the puzzles, but there are words and references that only an adult would get. If it was meant to be played by parents and children together (which would make sense), it's certainly not marketed that way. The unfortunate truth is that this game gets boring incredibly fast. You can solve puzzles in very creative ways, but there is no incentive to try because the game rewards you exactly the same way no matter what you do. You could create a giant burning zombie made of bacon to melt an iceberg in your way, but using a flamethrower will net you exactly the same result, so eventually the appeal of using your imagination wears off and you'll settle for the easy solution just to push through faster. Even playing with friends or being inebriated (which usually make anything awesome) only extends the fun for so long. If you're still curious and want to try it, at least wait for a sale, because $19.99 is just way too much of an asking price.			"

												The game is cute and the dictionary is a novelty you won't find in any other series, unfortunately the game's selling point is also kind of its downfall since it makes all the puzzles incredibly easy. There's no penalty for using the same words over and over and the game doesn't really reward cleverness, you can solve pretty much everything with adjectives or the same obvious solutions. A game with limitless potential for creativity isn't worth much when it offers no incentive to actually be creative beyond self-amusement. The controls are also pretty bad, you'll find yourself repeatedly accidentally opening menus and pausing the game when you try to attack things, although this game is very light on reflexive action as it is.. It's an alright sandbox if you get it in a sale, though if you've played any of the other Scribblemans games then you've already seen everything it has to offer.			"

												It's ok.  The puzzles are extremely easy to solve - usually you just give a simple item to someone who wants it.  If someone wants a picture, you give them a camera; if someone is hungry, you give them food.  However, you could be creative.  If someone is hungry, you could always give them something amusing that might satisfy them.  The thing is, this gets old very quickly.  If you have a friend to play it with, you could laugh at it, but it loses its appeal if you're playing alone.  It just wasn't enjoyable enough for me to recommend.			"

												Yes, it's cute, and the potential to solve the puzzles in any way -at all- that you want is nice. But it is, for all that, rather a short game. I completed all the achievements the game had, as well as the game itself in far, far less than a day. It also falls over when you consider that many of the puzzles in the game can be solved in the same few ways. Work out one or two of the solutions that just repeatedly work and you can blast through the game extremely quickly. This leaves mopping up the collections to become a rather tedious task. The novelty wears off on Scribblenauts pretty quickly. It's fun at first, but that soon wears off, leaving you with an adorable game that's far too easy. I think this might be challenging for a small child. If you have a small child, give it to them to play, perhaps play it with them. Or just play it while you're too drunk to think clearly. This would be an amazing game to play while drunk.			"

I got a couple of really good walkthroughs and guides to help breeze through the game.  By the end of the game it was just tedious.  Creating  things and combining things, cluttering up the screen.  I was able to create a black hole to suck up all the discarded items I created.  I cant say I would recomment the game unless you like puzzles and word games (or are young).

The appeal of writing in anything you want to solve puzzles loses its appeal relatively quickly. It is way too easy, short and sometimes just plain boring. However, it is also very charming. The visual style, music and quirky characters all help ease the pain of the complaints I had. All in all, if you like using your imagination, I would say pick this game up on a sale. I'm really glad I finished it and for the most part enjoyed my time with it. I just didn;t like it enough to collect all those damn Starites. 5.5/10.			"

												A game that allows you to create your own objects to solve puzzles! Unfortunately the concept of a game with a magic create anything notebook turns all the puzzles into rote data entry. There's an editor, but judging from all the recreations of video game characters on the Steam Workshop, I'm assuming there isn't much of a reason to use it. Unless you want to create a Human Centidog, but then again I like my ideas when they're in my head and safe within their Platonic form and not in the hideous physical world that somehow ruins everything.

												Okay yes, this game is fun for a few hours. But then you realize how shallow it is. Writing 'royal' or 'pretty' adjectives only adds a single item to something. Most things are very basic. This is a game children will most definitely enjoy, because of it's simplicity, but as an adult I cannot recommend it to any person older than 5.

												This game is more of an education simulator compared to the NDS versions of Scribblenauts. I got it because it had workshop support; but that only allows you to import new playermade characters/items to summon, and not new levels. Which is a total sham.			"

												If you're looking for a creative/sandbox-ey type game to get into (think: Garry's Mod, Minecraft), look elsewhere. The puzzles in this game are all pretty much mind-numbingly obvious, and being creative is actually *discouraged* because the game engine won't accept or recognize most really creative solutions - so this often leaves you solving the puzzle with the first, most blatantly obvious thing that came to your mind.With this, I believe Scribblenauts Unlimited is a great game for the kiddies, considering its easy puzzles and the insane amount of objects you can spawn (they really did think of everything). I could see this being a great for the fam-fam if everyone sat down in front of the tele and played the Wii U port together.However, I'll have to give this a negative review because while the game and its description would like you to believe the limit is your imagination, it's really not.

												Initially, Scribblenauts Unlimited leaves a favorable impression and gives the player a cool ability to generate almost anything out of thin air simply by typing the name of the desired object, as well as augment existing objects, by adding adjectives. Furthermore, generated objects believably interact with each other and the rest of the world, which allows for some creative problem solving. However, an initially cool concept soon turns into a tedious grind of giving hundreds of NPCs ordinary commonplace items level after level, and many of the references required to generate the right item would likely stump children young enough to enjoy what is essentially a word game. While the game offers quirky graphics and cool mechanics, I think reading a dictionary would be more fun and useful in the end.			"

												Really underwhelming.  This is really difficult to rate as it'd probably be a great game for kids, but... I picked it up based on good word of mouth online.  Having tried several times to get through more than a level or so, I'm not sure what would keep this game interesting to anyone over the age of 7 or so - the other negative reviews have already covered the issues with the simplicity, so I'll just confirm that I found the same problem.

												In Scribblenauts you have to find solutions for problems by creating or altering objects/persons with your magic notebook. The amount of objects and adjectives available is enormous, but unfortunately the puzzles are lacking. In fact they are not even worth being called puzzles. Someone wants to chop down a tree? Give him an axe. Someone wants to fly? Give him wings. Someone wants a gift for his girlfriend? Give him flowers. And that's it. Of course you can use weird solutions, like giving the guy with the tree problem a 'huge pink funny demonic chainsaw', but the fun in doing things like these wears of pretty quickly. Especially since it doesn't change the outcome, the guy still chops down the tree just like he would with an axe. Often your weird creations aren't even used and standard objects are created instead. If you give a girl who wants to dress up nicely a pink miniskirt for example she'll just put on some default clothes instead of the object you created.The game can be fun for a few hours if you just mess around, but it gets boring pretty quickly. It is certainly a nice game for little children (age 5-10) though. So no recommendation for adults from me, but recommended for children.			"

Also, i feel it's absolutly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to allow the option of creating a gun and shooting a small child, but prevent you from creating alcoholic bavareges. It's like trying to be politically correct by adressing a black guy as ""underpriveliged minority"".

												I've been meaning to play Scribblenauts for a long while, I wanted to see how good it was at realising what I had it mind.I've got to say the object creation and interaction definitely worked.However, in my opinion, Scribblenauts fails to be an actual game, it's just a tool to play with. I thought I would have to figure out puzzles by combining elements and unlocking stuff progressively. Sadly, that's not the case, almost all ""challenges"" simply ask you to create one single object, most of the time obvious. When you're asked to ""write someone to help spy on the bandits"", well the answer is obvious, a spy will do. Yes of course you can try more wild choices, and most of the time they will work. However, since everything has to be solved by inputting one single item, even the sandbox aspect is limited. Your word works or doesn't. It's in the game's list of possible answers or it's not. That's it. And there is only so many times I can get amused by giving overpowered or stupid items (especially since, if you go too wild, you risk destroying an important item and having to redo some stuff again).Dashed hopes... :/			"

												I'm really surprised by how much I've come to hate this game. It is such a load of closed minded, sexist, anti-scientific, moralising rubbish. Many of the restrictions are merely reflections of the rating system in place for games so the devs aren't really to blame but when you put it in this context they become so incredibly infuriating. So for example, it is perfectly fine to spawn a flame-thrower and burning everyone alive. One the other hand woe betide you if you try to spawn anything relating to sex, drugs or alcohol because none of those words are in Scribbenauts' vocabulary. I get that this is a children's game but then why can we spawn flame throwers? Why is violence so often featured in the puzzles, often unavoidably? Why does one level feature torture? Why can we spawn iron-maidens if we feel like it? It is garbage. Moralising garbage that shoves a twisted morality down the player's throat where torture and violence are a-okay and sex and alcohol are the works of the devil.Other things are clearly in place just to reduce controversy so you can spawn old religious figures that not many people take seriously any more like Thor and Zeus but not Jesus, and Mohammed is right out. Mind you so are most of the historical figures I've wanted to spawn so far. Someone was clearly in the grip of internalised capitalist oppression so I tried to spawn Marx to talk some sense into them, I didn't seriously expect this to work but I did expect to be able to spawn Marx but no. I gave up and spawned a Lemon when that was the suggestion when I tried Lenin.On another occasion a scientist wanted someone to talk to so I tried to spawn Aristotle, this worked but it seems the game doesn't consider Aristotle to be a scientist so the scientist refused to talk to him. Einstein of course worked but it felt like such a hollow victory to resort to the bloody obvious. And the game forces you to resort to the bloody obvious so often. Thinking outside the box is so often met with no reaction at all from the game. Sometimes the box you're meant to be thinking inside is bloody stupidly defined as well. One of the hints was to solve the problem of needing to melt a block of ice to thaw out a prehistoric man ""with science"". I tried heating the ice in various ways. The ice melted but level was failed. I tried ordering the ice to melt with adjectives. The ice melted but level was failed. I tried spawning salt and using that on the ice. The ice melted but level was failed. Eventually I resorted to Google. It seems ""with science"" in the Scribblenauts world means ""don't try to solve this yourself, spawn a scientist to do it for you"". Good god, such a stupid anti-scientific attitude to science.Finally there is Lilly, poor, poor Lilly. First off she is a Ms. Male by which I mean she is a female version of Maxwell with no other distinguishing personality or features except for being pink. Then she gets damseled in the opening cut-scene. Then you find that each level you can unlock one more of her siblings as a new playable character if you don't want to play as Maxwell, how many of these are sisters? None. Seemingly the other god knows how many playable characters are brothers. *sigh* Maybe Lilly becomes playable after the end of the story missions and she is released from her predicament but if so it is too little and far too late.No. Enough. There is joy in the heart of this game but after you're over the initial rush of apparent power the limitations and all the rubbish that come with it suck all the joy of it. I dare say some might say that as a grown man I shouldn't be surprised that I can't enjoy this since I'm hardly the target audience but honestly given the amount of twisted crap that is wrapped up with this game there is no way I'd let a child play it.

												The idea of this game has a lot of potential. Making something appear by typing its name is really fun, but in this game it is horribly limited. Part of the problem is you can't summon pop culture icons, and that would be very important since they are so infused in the modern world. There are many other things you can't summon, too many for this game to be titled ""unlimited"". Experimenting with the game will quickly become boring in a few hours, if that. The story mode is simple and charming at first, but there is no challenge introduced as you progress, making it quickly become boring. In short, its a fun, cute game to play for an hour or two, but it will rapidly become boring after that, and its not worth more than a few dollars top.			"

												In the third scribblenauts game the old gameplay having to cross various terrains to reach the starrite is unfortunely lost in favor of new gameplay where you help people by giving them items they ask for. most of these items are fairly obvious meaning less encouragement to come up with a creative solution. Additionally some of the answers are references to pop culture such as LOTR, which if you dont know about your not going to be able to solve. After finishing the game you find out about this list of 200 items you have to summon off a list thats annoying to access requiring multliple clicks threw menus to reach.The game also lacked much of a plot, your sister is frozen and you have to unfreeze her thats pretty much it. I would reccomend getting a different scribblenauts game over this one. The first 2 are much more interesting but they arent on steam, that leaves unmasked. I played very little unmasked but it seemed pretty similair but had a lot more interesting features.			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is a fun, interesting, and innovative game for about 15 minutes. The game concept is engrossing enough; type any word or phrase and it will appear in-game. Y'all already know I was rolling with my posse of George Washington and Napoleon on the reg, sporting a tuxedo and wielding a flamethrower atop my giant flying jaguar. The open nature also makes the options to resolve ""quests"" interesting (we'll get to that later). I was a vengeful God, and if a person needed, say a bag of money, I would make them blind in return. If they wanted a child, it would be a gargantuan, dying, amphibious baby. And for a while the gimmick was entertaining. However, the gimmick gets old fast. Because that's all the game is; an interesting game concept and gimmick that is stretched into a full-length video game.The game quests are extremely shallow and repetitive. An NPC says ""I need something that can do this/is like this/is this, and you oblige them. This process takes an average of 7 seconds to complete, and is the core of game progression. Like I said, this provides plenty of opportunity for humorous moments. But the game counts on you to make those moments happen. And there's really no incentive to do so; because the game is so repetitive, you want to just blow through it and be done with the quests. As the game progresses I became more and more utilitarian with my answers. I just didn't have the heart to try and make humor out of what felt like work. ""I need a friend"" - give them a dog. ""I want to write"" - give them a pencil. THe process became so monotonous and boring it was unbearable.This is a game that brings the player an interesting but temporarily engaging concept and absolutely drab quests and asks the player to bring the fun. Whereas ""make your own fun games"" like Just Cause and GTA create diversity in how you can create that fun, Scribblenauts is dull and taxing throughout. Just knowing that this game exists is about as much fun as playing it. Don't buy it, not even on sale.			"

												(BARELY got a Yes) [Overall (Meh) Rating: 5/10]If you're like me, you probably got stuck into the Scribblenauts series thinking you'd actually draw stuff, save it and call it up later. Earlier on, like me, you'd be dissapointed. Now, though, you can actually make stuff and save it... but you better know what you're doing, you have to ""Hngh"" your way through ""Programming"" to make it of any use to you. So, your better off just going with the defaults.Personally, i wish they'd stop republishing the same game over and over again... -sigh-			"

												Ahh Scribblenauts Unlimited. A childish but still entertaining game.It really is surprising how this game has so much content, it amazed me the first time I started playing it and keeps amazing me every time I play it. I think that the concept is quite interesting and original. But it's still not perfect, the game is clearly made for children so it gets repetitive quite fast and is extremely easy. Well that is really not true, if you are not from a country where people speak English this could be a great way to learn some words, even for older people. This is one of those games they should use as material in schools.As for the story of this game. Well, the story is not the thing in this game that they gave extra attention.Positives: -May be helpful in educating children-Quite entertaining-Funny-Lots of content-OriginalNegatives:-Poor story-Repetitive-Boring after a while-""It is a game for kids so its not suppose to be good, right?""I would rate it 6.5/10			"

												I played a couple of Scribblenauts games on DS and absolutely loved them.  It may have been the novelty of it that really got me hooked, or maybe the fact that I had to learn the ""tricks"" of the game as I went along.  This game was terribly disappointing by comparison.Most of the ""puzzles"" or ""quests"" are insanely simple.  I was stumped maybe 3 times at most.  Otherwise it was a bunch of, ""I'm hungry, make me something to eat,"" or, ""My cat's stuck in the tree, please get him down,"" or, ""I'm bored, find something to entertain me.""  Sandwich, ladder, clown, EASY!!!  Given the name ""Scribblenauts Unlimited"" and the fact the game is Steam Workshop enabled, I was under the impression other people would be making levels and challenges.  Wow!  Was I ever wrong!  The fact that you can create your own objects is a poor consolation, especially considering most of the changes are simply visual and the item editor comes with NO GUIDANCE WHATSOEVER!  I tried to make an object starting with a cannonball as the template and it was never any more useful than an actual cannonball.I don't recall how many areas/quest there are, but there are way too many given the overall difficulty of the game.  The developers definitely went for quantity over quality and I think that's where the game really suffers.  Too many challenges that aren't challenging and too many objects that aren't all that unique.  Even at a dirt cheap price this game feels more like a chore than an actual game.			"

												Scribblenauts unlimited is great if you have an amazing imagination. However, more often than not, the game is treated more of a sandbox as there really isn't much appeal to complete the quests, although they are relatively simple to solve with a mundane solution. The challenge is to find alternative ways to complete such quests, although once again, the game fails to motivate you to push yourself to do so.Storyline is also made to appeal to younger kids-teens and is mediocre at best.6/10, fun for the first 5 hours of playing or so.

												Pretty great for kids that don't require much of a challenge, but for an adult it's a 'make-your-own-fun' kind of game. You play a young boy venturing out into the world with a notebook that makes him an itty-bitty god, letting you create anything your imagination can conjure up, as long as it's not copywritten or mildly controversial (you can create God, but no Hitler). Challenges are usually a slight riddle or a character telling  you what they want, leaving you to generate it with your notebook. Unfortunately, most of these challenges are without real challenge, leaving it up to the player to try and eake out some of the more creative solutions the studio programmed in. Still, the game is attractive, has a pleasant cheeky sense of humor, and has some really nice music, but as a game it usually as demanding as that children's game where you put the round peg in the round hole. Charming, but more ingenuity need to be applied to how to engage the player's imagination.			"

												This is a real fun game, to get you started on the story, you are a boy names Maxwell and you have a notebook and if you write anything in the notebook like ""car"" you get a car. Maxwell and his sister were walking along and pranked a witch of some sort, the witch uttered the words ""SPOILED LITTLE KIDS"". Nothing happened but moments realizing his sisters feet were made of stone. Maxwell was later told he needed starlights or what ever they are called.. to get the curse out of his sister. He told Maxwell starlights are earned from helping people, and making them happy. Anyways, I had alot of fun with this game and I rate it 7/10.			"

I think drawing or adding characters to the screen to complete easy puzzles / quests quickly gets boring and repetitive and it feels like the game has no real goal.. it's more of a ""play around with objects"" game for children than a game you could enjoy or feel achieved in as an adult. On top of that the quest start over even if you mess around a little bit.Good thing I got it from the WB humble.			"

In reality it gets far to limited where many liable alternatives are ignored and you are left hoping for a hint. It has a really nice design but it cannot not compensate. Maybe it is because i dont have English as a first language. But should this stop me for playing this kinds of games? I Hope not.			"

This game as the title says is Unlimited there are alot of things you can summon and have fun with. The puzzles can be challeging some time head scratching but some puzzles do repeat them selfs just with diffrent text but the solution stays the same. The game has a really nice art style which i really enjoy. But there are some glitches to be encountered. This game is youre Imagination you wish to make it you can. With the crazy library of things you can summon in the game plus the steam community workshop really makes this game a lot of fun. There isnt much Re play ability after you finish the game just some bonus objectives. But with the final product im not dissapointed with it actually im quite impressed. This is definetly worth buying I give it  9/10			"

												Compared to the previous titles, this installment of Scribblenauts is crippling and crushes the creative spirit.There are no actual puzzles; you never have to create elaborate setups, get creative with your summon variety, or make use of stacking/nesting/connecting. You don't even have to move, really. There are no challenges. There are only fill-in-the-blank scenarios.That's it.Even Kirby games have challenge and variety.For a game whose central theme is goodwill and charity, I'm wondering why I'm asked to arm and harm others, and break criminals out of prison. With a name like Bruiser, I'm pretty sure his incarceration was not unjust.My initial excitement by a VA appearance from Jennifer Hale was immediately snuffed when I realized she would spend the entire game in the barn while her 41 brothers explored the world and had incredible adventures. By the time I freed her from the barn, I was sick of the game and couldn't continue.As a Scribblenauts fan, this game was incredibly disappointing. The free iPhone version is leagues better, and it doesn't even have adjective mechanics.			"

												I've only played this one and the original Scribblenauts, so it's possible that this is what all the current games are like, but ...The basic idea of Scribblenauts is that you are let loose in a series of levels, each of which contains a ""Starite."" As Max, your goal is to obtain the Starite by any means necessary. Fortunately, you are armed with a magic notebook; when Max writes nouns the game understands in the notebook, whatever he's written is summoned into reality. With Scribblenauts Unlimited he gains the ability to use adjectives, as well, even adding them to existing objects.In the first Scribblenauts game, getting the Starite usually (but not always) required solving a physics puzzle. In Scribblenauts Unlimited, though, you generally just end up walking up to an NPC, being told the NPC wants something, and then writing down examples of whatever is requested.For instance, an NPC might be described as a ""Hungry Vegetarian."" Write down ""apple"" ""pancake"" ""carrot"" get Starite. (That was off the top of my head, but it might actually be in the game. That's the level of sophistication.) It's less a video game and more a vocabulary test. Oh, and since a LOT of puzzles require knowledge of English-language culture, don't even expect to be able to use it to help learn the language.It doesn't help that in the first game Max would often find himself in danger and need to find a way to protect himself. Here, the first thing you do in each level is click on Max and add adjectives like ""Immortal Flying Fireproof"" to yourself and then roam with impunity.Basically ... if the first Scribblenauts was easy, Scribblenauts Ultimate barely qualifies as an activity book. An expensive, overproduced activity book.			"

												I made a rocket launcher that fires fridges and gave it to a terrorist. This was after I'd gotten bored making suicidal kittens and assorted other cute animals, placing bombs, then watching them detonate the bombs and kill themselves. Not to mention the fact that there is an accurate sprite for the RPG compared to a simple rocket launcher.10/10 will kill again.			"

												Buy this. Buy it. Buy it now. If it's on sale, buy two copies. This is great.The art style is simple yet pretty to look at. You can use a magical note book to spawn items in order to innovatively solve problems in new and exciting ways. Problem: Car being parked illegally. Solution: Spawn a rideable block of cheese with wings. Tie rope from the cheese to the car and tow it away! With the workshop support, the only end to the game is your imagination. You can literally have anything you can think of. Good points - Great art style.- Hours of gameplay.- Amusing situations.- Workshop support.- Child friendly.- Main character has the same name as me. Bad points- Character creation is very very fiddly and can be annoying. - Running out of ideas due to lack of imagination.			"

												Frankly, it was an honest effort. I'll give them that. But Scribblenauts just didn't catch my attention. Sure, I got 3 hours into it, but I have at least 10 times that in CS:GO, let alone the 60 TIMES record I have in Garry's Mod.      It's enjoyable for the begginning, and I'm sure younger audiences might play this game for months upon months, but when you suddenly turn 13 and realize there's games like Call of Duty out there for you to play, the replay value drops rediculously. Better than nothing, but I'm just not left satisfied. 4/10 stars.Auther's Note(s)     With all due respect to the hours upon hours it must of taken to make Scribblenauts, it just isn't worth the money I put into it. And I even got it on sale. It's fine if you're younger though, so if you've got a 5/6 year-old brother or sister that wants something to do, it's considerable to buy it for them. "

Please help if possible. So on top of the game not opening, when I did play the game on my old laptop, it was OK. Not all that fun, gets very repetitive and boring. So, if you want another game as well as this one, buy that other one first.			"

												A cute looking problem solving sand box game that involves spawning, labeling, destroying and manipulating objects and entities with an educational angle for kids. The premise is simple with multiple objectives in each map, but the possibilities and combinations are limitless and often hilarious, with many shards and starite objects to collect once all objectives have been met.For achievement hunters, the full starite collection will require trying a huge selection of outfits, weapons, items and situations, but the process is relatively fun if, albeit, slow. Good fun for kids. 3.5/5			"

												I remembered playing this on my Nintendo DS and it was fun but lack much clearer directions than this one. And now i finally got to play this IP again and this time on PC! This version if more refined and polished in terms of controls, content, storytelling & gameplay but to sum them all up has given that charm that i haven't experienced in a long time since Little big planet, Locoroco and their likes. Simple and dose not stress your brain to think too much i would say.Surprisingly, one of the best games i've played this year to the point that it's going to be one of my GOTY of 2013. Yes i'm that serious! I would recommend myself to play this game with my future kids one day :).			"

												Really impressive and beautiful game, way better & bigger than the 3DS version and iOS version. It's also support Steam Workshop.Also, other than the previous Scribblenauts games, instead of beeing only puzzle based, it's adventure based. So it's way better as you have a LOT of puzzle per level so it's not annoying like the previous one as you don't have loading time between each puzzle.			"

												After finishing this game I can certainly say that is is worth playing. It has replay ability but its mostly about the first play through. If you are playing I'd say keep an eye on the shards in the menu, otherwise you'll end up at the end grinding for ages to get the shard pieces. Its fun to write some random stuff to solve odd puzzles that in most cases can be solved simply but why solve it simply when you can summon kathulu or a giant pink fish or a tiny tank. Games like this bring out the weird and sometimes darker parts of my personality. There are some problems where I had to look up on Wiki to find out how to complete a task but for the majority you can find some way to 100% the game.			"

												This game is perfect for all ages, (Mostly 6-10+ of course,) and It contains very fun and addictive gameplay.This is a large game, therefor it will take some fair amount of time to finish, but the time is worth it. The game itself is based on creating anything you want, even making things for the game on the Steam Workshop.It is a curiously adventurous game, in some perspectives. There are multiple selections of the game you can explore, and play in. You can costumize your own character, male or female, and you have completely no limits to your imagination, and what you can create.What I created? A Giant Flying Rocket Sheep.What else I created? A Tiny Red Hulk.You have completely no limits to what you can create, and therefor it makes it the perfect SandBox game for any Indie or Adventurous gamers out there. The cartoony graphics might not be the best, but the gameplay itself makes up for more than enough of this.I say this is worth a buy, and a very, very, enjoyable and creative-building game.Good Job, Scribblenauts.

												Truly a spectacular game. It runs so well on my laptop (my laptop is pretty crappy). Especially the Object Editor and the Steam Workshop. You can find creations of your favorite characters from anywhere (only if someone created it already) such as Naruto, Finn, and Doctor who. But thats not all there is to offer, you can also find better weapons to use against enemies, or people whom you might not be too fond of.For all you little girls out there, fulfill your fangirl dream by getting Justin Bieber from the Workshop. You can do anything with him. ANYTHING.I recommend this game, ammensly.Good job, 5THCELL			"

												Type something in and watch it appear on your screen or if it doesn't exist, create it yourself! Scribblenauts offers vast complexity underneath its primitive visuals--much more than I expected. It seems like it was primarily developed for a younger audience (except for the violence), but anyone can definitely have fun with it. There's plenty of laughs to be found when something unexpected happens and the sheer number of puzzles offers many hours of enjoyment. Try it out and let your imagination run wild.			"

That said, I couldn't get enough of this game until I explored every inch of it and took a crack at all the puzzles. Some of them had me scratching my head wondering if the game was broke or if I'm just too dumb to figure it out. In the end it was worth the head scratching once I figured out the puzzle.Buy it on sale! This game is worth the $10.00 price tag, on sale, but $20.00 is too much for what it is!			"

												Excellent. This game is a fun word puzzler that tests your imagination. The only faults I find are that a few of the puzzles are a bit on the ambiguous side (meaning some trial and error or online research), and most of the puzzles needed for the achievements are even more ambiguous while being completely superfluous to the actual game (meaning you are expected to do those more exact and unclear combinations in the sandbox mode). The story is charming and the mechanics work well. I'm definitely looking forward to the sequel(s) on the way.			"

Making use of Nouns and descriptive words makes the creation of objects in the primary game rather fun, and the ability to create your own objects in the game makes it even more fun. The creation of objects is easy to use and doesn't have many issues, but it would be best to avoid altering the hit-box parts too much, as it could cause unusual problems.			"

												huge improvement over the first 2 games. the open worlds are really great and summoning objects to complete puzzles is still awesome. however, it's a little too easy and the main story can be completed in one sitting. the object maker is kind of confusing and limited, but it's possible to make some really cool stuff.

												I have so much to say about this game. I got this game from a stranger on Christmas. After playing it for a while, I realized that I would be playing this game a lot. If I had not gotten it as a gift, I would never know how good it is. It is worth more than $20 as it is the best Scribblenauts yet. The game has an unlimited amount of content, as you can mix objects together and post them on the Workshop, add adjectives to items, and so much more. The game has almost every word in the english dictionary (Not sure about other languages, also copyright and profainty is not allowed) which makes sure you won't run out even after 20 hours. The puzzles are sometimes hard, and sometimes easy, unlike the other Scribblenaut games which are mostly just hard. I have already spent 23 hours and plan to spend more. 10/10			"

I have gotten plenty of things that don't work but for the most part you can write any noun to make it appear. Pretty neat mechanic! It's fun trying to come up with solutions other than the obvious ones. On the other hand, there have been a few puzzles that I couldn't figure out at all, either because my mind wasn't going in a certain direction intended, or because I missed something. Good game all around.			"

												I bought this for $60 when it came out.[screams internally]If you liked Scribblenauts on the DS, then you will like this game. It does have a lot of content in the way of puzzles, but they are not particularly stressful or challenging; don't expect a Dark Souls experience is all I'm saying. You really can create anything... as long as that something is not a proper noun or copyrighted material. But then there is the Steam Workshop and the Object Editor, which allows your imagination to go wild.If I bought this game for $10-20, then that is a good deal for what is essentially an object creation sandbox. There might be some limitations in the way the objects interact, but all in all it is a good game toy. But $60 was highway robbery. Fun while it lasted.I give it 7 out of 10 transparent zombie purple immortal starites.			"

												There were games that I looked forward to playing but then it turn out to be a dissapointment. This one is actually the other way around, I thought this might be something that I don't like, but it might be a good educational game to play with kids.  But after half an hour into the game, I was really surprised that not only I like this game, I love it.This game is not only fun, but funny as well.  In a nutshell, you help people by creating 'objects' or add an adjective to something, then you get a star.  So you go around and help people, and you clear stages/area around the world.  Like I mentioned, it's actually good to play around kids.  When you think about it, the whole theme of the game is about helping people, so not only it seems educational, it is also a nice game to play with kids.What I really like about the game is the freedom to express your imagination, and there is always more than one way to do things here.  Before I played this game, I have this preconception that this is one of those game that is very linear, you have to use the right word for anything; but, that's totally not the case here, the flexibility of this game truly amazed me.  Also, I like the vast amount of objects you can create, combined with different adjectives.  It almost seems like there is infinite possiblities of objects you can create in this game(hence the name, ""Unlimited""?).I also love the humour in this game, lots of pop culture reference, it's like lots of spoofs from movies and such.  And it gets better if you are the type of person like me who like to create objects that make the situation even funnier.  This game is generally easy, but sometimes it can make you think really hard.  So if you don't know what objects or adjectives to add, you can always move on to do another one.  That brings me to another thing I like about this, you can play this game at your own pace.  You don't have to spend certain amount of time in one sitting.  You can even spend like 1 minute in this game, maybe help one guy, save the game, and come back later to play more.There really isn't any story to this game, I technically finished the game under 10 hours and saw the 'ending'  by collecting 60 stars, but there seem to be a total of 106 stars.  I will probably play till I get all of the stars.  This is my first Scribblenauts game, I will definately play more of other Scribblenauts games.			"

												This game is fun for a casual gamer. It's not particularly challenging, but that's what made it fun for just relaxing. The game can test the limits of your creativity, as you attempt to come up with new ways of doing simple tasks, and the game can be limiting if you don't know exactly what you're trying to do. Overall, I would recommend this game for relaxing down time.			"

												After opening the game and playing 1 mission I thought ""Wow this is a game for 12year olds."" I got mine in the Humble Bundle and had no idea what it was btw.BUT something kept me playing... it was the plain fun and imagination in the game. Do not judge this game by just looking at it, in this game almost everything is possible, and it all depends on you! You can creat ANYTHING with your magical notbook, from a ant to sun! It is very fun a will keep you busy for hours. Only negative part is that it's not really a long game, but i can assure you, you will enjoy every second!Playground for imagination! 9/10			"

												This sequel to Scribblenauts is truly a technically impressive feat, but it is very offensive to someone who is a radical Muslim such as myself. In this game, you play a boy who can create anything by writing it in his magic book, including a huge variety of living creatures - which become even more diverse with the new adjective system. The Koran says that only Allah can create life. Often times the game encourages cannabilistic activities, and this is against the word of Allah as described in the Koran, unless of course the subject in question is an enemy fighter or an adulterer. However in the case of Scribblenauts, you are prompted to feed a cannibal at a restaraunt, and the only way I could continue is by feeding him a fried baby. Truly a disgraceful game to our great creator. 2/10 would jihad again.			"

There are multiple areas (levels) with multiple tasks (missions) to do ranging from rescue the cat from a tree to appeasing a deity.The game is a great pick up and play title, with so many different ways to complete each task. I had myself in stitches playing this.There is a even the ability to make your own custom items, from different colours to different abilites, winged hat anyone?I would recommend this to anyone who wants a simple pick up and play game, where the risk loss is low.

But I can say, ""Create anything except copyrighted characters/objects."" That's why Scribblenauts Unmasked released, tehehe... So, don't expect that you can create anything... :-/ But, the game itself is still interesting and fun to play.GRAPHICSNice graphics, funny characters and colorful world.MUSICThe soundtracks and sound effects is good enough.Story: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Graphics: 7.5/10Music: 7.5/10Overall score: 7.75/10			"

												Scribblenauts is a game about writing words. The words you write will be created. You can use this to solve puzzles if you're lame. If you're not you will create a pile of hats, wear them all, laugh gleefully, then force a ninja hamster to fight against a samurai cactus. There will be people caught in the crossfire. Lots of people. After this, you will call forth the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse to clean up any survivors. Having experienced the greatest thing ever you will then probably die yourself.After that you can do puzzles I guess.Why are you even reading this anyway? You either love Scribblenauts or you think its a poorly executed gimmick. If you like Scribblenauts this is for you. I obviously love Scribblenauts.But even if you don't like Scribblenauts it has all the hats. All of them.And with the new Object Creator, if there's a hat that doesn't exist you can MAKE YOUR OWN HAT. Then you can upload it to the Steam Workshop so everyone can experience the glory that is YOUR HAT.10/10			"

This game is much more addictive than I thought it would be, and I was very surprised to see how much time I've spent playing it (and usually procrastinating doing very important things at the same time). The challenges are usually very easy to complete, which may put some people off of the game, but there are also many creative ways to solve puzzles - finding new ways of solving the same puzzle can be a lot of fun! Overall, it's a fun game that is useful for burning time (so I strongly reccomend it to those who have just finished exams and have a very long holiday ahead of them!).			"

												Fantastic fun for the creative player who either likes puzzle solving or just summoning the foulest beings from hell and beyond to terrorize the poor men, women, pregnant blood banks and all other creations you can think of. Except explicit stuff, of course.This time, unlike the previous games, Scribblenauts Unlimited gives you a nice backstory of Maxwell and his family as well as the reason for wanting to gather Starites -- to save Maxwell's sister, Lily, from a curse that is gradually turning her to stone.

Most of the puzzles are easy, but they provoke the imagination and there are various solutions and it's interesting to see what different people can come up with.The game is also filled with cultural references, which make it both fun and educational.I am a little confused about child friendly attitude, though - you cannot create items like blood, alcohol or drugs, but you get to help criminals, awake Cthulhu and feed human meat to cannibals.

												Grade: 90/100Difficulty: Easy once you get used to object/word/adjective limitations.Pros: Diverse and unique gameplay depending on how you choose to play; user-created content available through Steam Workshop; object editor so you can make your own objects.Cons: You can play through and beat all the levels without so much as making a scratch on the shard lists, meaning you have to go through the lists and complete each objective even if you've already finished the game if you want to collect all the shards.Replayable: Only for achievement addicts or completionists.

												After finishing this game I can certainly say that is is worth playing. It has replay ability but its mostly about the first play through. If you are playing I'd say keep an eye on the shards in the menu, otherwise you'll end up at the end grinding for ages to get the shard pieces. Its fun to write some random stuff to solve odd puzzles that in most cases can be solved simply but why solve it simply when you can summon kathulu or a giant pink fish or a tiny tank. Games like this bring out the weird and sometimes darker parts of my personality. There are some problems where I had to look up on Wiki to find out how to complete a task but for the majority you can find some way to 100% the game.			"

												This game is perfect for all ages, (Mostly 6-10+ of course,) and It contains very fun and addictive gameplay.This is a large game, therefor it will take some fair amount of time to finish, but the time is worth it. The game itself is based on creating anything you want, even making things for the game on the Steam Workshop.It is a curiously adventurous game, in some perspectives. There are multiple selections of the game you can explore, and play in. You can costumize your own character, male or female, and you have completely no limits to your imagination, and what you can create.What I created? A Giant Flying Rocket Sheep.What else I created? A Tiny Red Hulk.You have completely no limits to what you can create, and therefor it makes it the perfect SandBox game for any Indie or Adventurous gamers out there. The cartoony graphics might not be the best, but the gameplay itself makes up for more than enough of this.I say this is worth a buy, and a very, very, enjoyable and creative-building game.Good Job, Scribblenauts.

												I definitely recommend this game to people of all ages! Scribblenauts Unlimited is simple enough for younger folk, but at the same time, it's great for adults as well. There are so many ways to get creative and just have fun with your surroundings. Basically, you play as Maxwell and your goal is to help your fellow man with a magical notebook in order to save your sister. The different worlds and the people/creatures who inhabit them are so fun to interact with. I'm not sure about what's available in the Steam Workshop, as I have yet to try out any of the custom content. I love this game, but I do have only one complaint: the game can get repetitive at times if you decide to use the same solution for multiple puzzles.			"

I started playing just to help and wound up playing the whole game when he wasn't home. It's a surprisingly deep game and while some portions are rediculously easy, some parts actually require some thought on your part. Overall despite the childish animation I would recommend the game as a way to kill a few hours on a rainy day.			"

												Scribblenauts is a fun puzzle game with inventive solutions to problems others are having. You (Maxwell) must save your sister by collecting starite which you collect by helping people. You can help others by using your magical notebook that alows you to create anything* that you can think of. Many of the solutions to these puzzles require some knowledge of many different topics and is a really fun way to test your memory bank and problem solving skills. I recommend this game if you want to be given a problem and must figure out the solution only using nouns and adjectives to modify those nouns. The pencil is mightier than the sword, especially if that pencil, paired with Maxwell's magical notebook, can create Excalibur.			"

												TL;DR: Definitely worth a play if on sale (I paid $4.99) and you are new to the series, but overall not a good enough game to warrant a recommendation.If you've never played a game like Scribblenauts before, this is definitely worth a play. The play mechanics were unique to anything I've ever played before, so it was definitely worth the sale price. If you *have* played a game like this before though, I'm not sure if I would recommend this one.As much as I enjoyed the premise at the beginning, as I progressed, I found the game got stale. I was hoping for a much stronger puzzle-solving element to the game, but unfortunately everything is pretty straight forward, and there are a lot of clues that are force-fed to you. By the end of the game I was still somewhat entertained, but mostly I was just doing my duty in trying to complete it.			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is by far the best Scribblenauts game out there. The puzzles are simple but sometimes challenging and the animation is funny. Their are thousands of objects in the game that I bet not a soul in the world knows them all. Its really fun to see how each object reacts with another object. The object creator is really cool and there are lots of cool things on the Steam Workshop to download. In other words this game really is Unlimited!			"

												At first, I bought this game because I was staying for a week at a place where this 5 year old followed me around and stared at my computer screen. Of course I couldn't play my usual Team Fortress 2 or Skyrim because ""Oh you shouldn't scare the little kids"" I turned it on and the beginning was... meh. As I countinued on, I found myself playing it more and more. There were great references, entertaining missions, and lots of things to do. The point of this game is to help people around the land with strange/silly problems. The soulutions can be something boring like ""Hamburger"" or... ""Hipster Cthulu"". This may sound like a slightly childish and bothering game, but even I was entertained. If your looking for a nice calming game just to take a break from all the crowbarings and zombie-killings, buy this game9/10 Needs More Missions			"

Creativity gets rewarded by being creative - the game is less about ""what is the solution to this problem"" but more about ""let's see how creative I can be with this solution"". In other words, it's very much like The Incredible Machine, only with words.			"

												This game is great. It's just like any other Scribblenauts game. You know, do good things for people using the objects you bring into the world and you get a Starite. Only in this one, you can create your own objects and characters. Not just bringing them into the world, but actually creating them. You can decide what they do under certain circumstances, and what they have the abilities to do in those situations. The system for creating the objects is easy to master, but at first it does take a while to understand. You can also create the different characters that you can play as. This game is spectacular, and I highly suggest that you buy it as soon as possible.			"

												This should definitely be categorized as a children's game, but it is still very charming and fun to play.  The real fun for me is in seeing how creative I can get with my answers, and I've been surprised a couple times as to what works.  It shows a lot of care on the developer's part.  You can always get past a puzzle with an obvious or easy answer, and often times just a handful of words can get you past many puzzles, but I urge anyone that's playing to dig into their vocabulary to try to be as creative as possible.  This is my first Scribblenauts game so it is a very fresh experience for me, however unless the formula is changed up quite a bit on other releases, I can't see myself purchasing another game in the series.  As it stands though, I would still recommend any and everyone at least try one game from the series.			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is the ultimate scribblenauts experience. As the name suggests the amount of things you can type up to create in the world are litterally unlimited due to the item creator and steam workshop support. If you're looking for platforming gameplay or an interesting story you should just go somewhere else, this game is about solving puzzles by thinking up things to create, if you want that and actualy gameplay, then play the original scirbblenauts and super scribblenauts, both for the DS, they include action levels which are much more eventful then sitting back and thinking about a puzzle. Nonetheless, this is is a must-buy just be sure to buy it during a sale as the price of 20$ is a bit steep for this game.			"

												Broad but shallow. You can spawn and use a huge variety of things, but there's just not that much to DO with them. Being primarily a kids game, the puzzles are incredibly easy. The fun parts of the game basically amount to faffing about with silly items or trying to find the most ridiculous or dark was to finish a puzzle.""I need something to make that kid stop bullying me!""*GIANT RIDEABLE FIRE BREATHING ROBOT POLAR BEAR*""GROOOOOOOOOOOOOOWRRRRR""""Challenge Complete!""

												Type something in and watch it appear on your screen or if it doesn't exist, create it yourself! Scribblenauts offers vast complexity underneath its primitive visuals--much more than I expected. It seems like it was primarily developed for a younger audience (except for the violence), but anyone can definitely have fun with it. There's plenty of laughs to be found when something unexpected happens and the sheer number of puzzles offers many hours of enjoyment. Try it out and let your imagination run wild.			"

												I personally do not get the story. I mean, Maxwell has a journal that can spawn anything he writes, but it doesn't explain how he got it. Or why he's on a mission to make everyone happy, like the humanitiarian James Ogelthorpe. But overall, it's pretty radical.			"

												Scribblenauts is very fun. You type in almost any noun you can think of (as long as its not offensive or a proper noun) and the game can most likely create it for you to solve fun puzzle situations. You can also add random adjectives to things, which is very fun itself. I was in a school with a bully and a nerd, I added the adjectives ""weak"" and ""miniscule"" to the bully. Then ""strong"" and ""muscular"" to the nerd and watched them transform. ITs hilarious if not a little easy. ~PR0XIDIAN			"

												This is a really fun little game that makes you look at situations in unexpected ways. You are presented with a problem (Make a car into a fire truck), and have to create items to solve it (red paint, fire alarm, hose). The puzzles are different from the iOS Scribblenauts Remix game.

												""I need something to help me to conduct surgery"" Give her a sword.  ""I think we need a flag on our flag pole"" Put a Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Man on the pole.  ""We need a class pet"" Put Cthulu into the cage.  This is only a tidbit of how you can deal with these real world problems with even more realistic solutions.  My girlfriend told me that I should become a PR director for this game once I told her how great it is because she didn't see how great it was but I think she is more bias than I am.  After only an hour of playing I have been hooked for life, making millions of objects more interesting with adjectives and beautiful by giving them tiaras.  Ever thought of riding a flying shark through all the levels?  You can do that too like Napolean fighting the Chinese in world war 3.  I have submitted a marriage proposal to this game without my girlfriend knowing yet.  I hope she is okay with paligamy since us three should get together really well.  Also the solution to all problems is either putting the adjective ""Gone"" or ""Naked"".  ""I am lonely!"" well now you're naked, therefore not lonely.			"

												Honestly, this is a great game, just not one I'm going to play for hours on end. Yes, the mechanics of being able to literily create whatever you can think up in order to solve the puzles is great and it's fun as hell. But it's also not the kind of game where you can just kick back and let your mind relax after a hard day, as you're going to need to think through what object to summon for every single puzzle, not to mention how to use what you summoned.That aside, this game is still something special, so buy it even if you only end up playing it ever now and then.

												Even if it have a childish facade there is a lot of chaotic fun to be had here for kids and adults alike. The game consists mainly of simple puzzles scattered around the various different levels in the game, where you can write a word to spawn nearly anything to help you solve it. Kids can get a educational experience with learning simple logic things in an engaging way, while adults can have fun times in trying to bend the rules of what the game allows you to do.Cook food for a school cafeteria? Use normal cafeteria food, or just use human flesh! Then once the puzzle is solved you can make everybody catch fire and die from exploding banana pudding if you so wish, because why not!You can also create your own objects which is pretty cool, even if the editor have some limitations. The editor and workshop integritation makes it so if a object is missing from the wordlist in the game you can create it yourself or find out if somebody else made it, which has lots of fun potential too.It's perhaps a game that requires a bit of effort on your own part to make it truly special, but if you are a creative person or have a young child with a lot of imagination this is a pretty solid game for all ages			"

												Based on a popular Nintendo DS game, Scribblenauts is an action puzzler where the player assumes the rooster-headed roll of Max, the protangonist. Lily, Max's sister, must be saved from a curse caused by abuse of a magic notebook. The notebook is the core mechanic of the game - the ability to describe an object and have that object appear in the world to be used by Max or the game itself. It's a simple premise, but one where the huge open ended variety of the dictonary used by the game really makes the puzzles (which get progressively vague or specific, including required actions with items) stand out as both endearing and enjoyable.The game itself has a decent length, with a solid ending that wraps up the PG storyline in a neat package worthy of Aesop. The quality graphics, catchy and unobtrusive sound track, and genuinely creative player-centered gameplay should delight pretty much anyone of any age and ability. Probably the only gripes I have are the removal of particles (no ""bag of salt"", you have to make a bag and salt separately then put the salt in the bag) and that it's very easy to destroy required parts of the level, necessitating lengthy replaying of certain challenges.

												Imagine you're playing Pokémon, but none of the enemy trainers' Pokémon ever increase in power, and your Pokémon can't take damage. You spend the whole game squashing Pidgeys and Caterpies. Sure, you can still try and customize your team or fill out your Pokédex or whatever--that's all still there, but the game never rewards you for it, because there's no encounter where it makes a difference. That's Scribblenauts.""We need a captive to put in the prison!"" Notebook: CAPTIVE. ""We need an experienced sailor to man the helm!"" Notebook: EXPERIENCED SAILOR. ""We need someone who can cook!"" Notebook: COOK. ""I need something to extinguish this fire!"" Go go gadget FIRE EXTINGUISHER. You can try to be creative, but the game doesn't reward you for it in any way. In and of itself, there is no challenge here. It's less of a game than a toy. Of course, there are certainly worse toys you could play with. You can have a good time screwing around in the sandbox for a while before it gets old, and it's a great game to give to your kids. If you like Mad Libs, you'll probably get a kick out of changing firemen into flying rainbow-colored zombie firemen in stylish hats and whatnot.			"

												The endless possibilities are intoxicating at first, but once that wears off you'll see just how, well, boring the tasks you're supposed to complete really are.  After six hours I was using my imagination to come up with the fastest solutions possible to just get things over with.  A lot of the time near the end of the game i didn't even bother creating objects if I could avoid it and just edited adjectives to accomplish everything.There are a few rare instances where the game makes things more challenging by imposing restrictions on you, like a gauntlet you have to run without being able to use adjectives synonymous with invincible.  Unfortunately these aren't very common.Still, it was fun for a few hours and could be worth it if it's on sale.  There's also all the stuff made by the steamworks community that I've yet to check out.			"

												I definitely recommend this game to people of all ages! Scribblenauts Unlimited is simple enough for younger folk, but at the same time, it's great for adults as well. There are so many ways to get creative and just have fun with your surroundings. Basically, you play as Maxwell and your goal is to help your fellow man with a magical notebook in order to save your sister. The different worlds and the people/creatures who inhabit them are so fun to interact with. I'm not sure about what's available in the Steam Workshop, as I have yet to try out any of the custom content. I love this game, but I do have only one complaint: the game can get repetitive at times if you decide to use the same solution for multiple puzzles.			"

When you look at Scribblenauts first time it seems like ordinary colorfull game for kids where you help everybody (and everythink) by creating things by writing them in you're magic notebook. And you know wath ? Maybe its a game for kids about helping humanity with their problems. It may sound odd, however this game brought me much more fun that many ""adult"" games. The whole positive music, the posibilities, the awkwardness (i guess thats a word), and mostly just happiness that brings helping everybody made this game one of my most loved title.(Small hint-before buying this game first try it out somehow. Its a really good game, however its not a thing that everybody would like)			"

Lots of costumes to make and alternate characters (siblings of the main character) to play as. The story is silly and simple, but kept me occupied. Good game for kids and adults.			"

												If you're a fan of the DS titles, then you'll have a blast with this one. My only complaint is that after you beat it, it gets really boring, but for the $20.00 game that it is, it's a great addition to the series. With the new Object editor, you can make solving puzzles more hilarious than the previous installments. Unfortunately, it doesn't have much replay value, either, so if you do plan on buying it, either wait for it to go on sale, or pressure your friends to get it for you.			"

												This game is many things, but above all, it is delightful. The graphics aren't glorious and it doesn't have a rich story accompanied by hours of cutscenes, but it is absolutely delightful. Let me give you an idea of what I'm talking about. This game is like one of those things that I dreamed about playing when I was little. ""Wouldn't it be cool if someone made a game where you could make any object appear?"". I'd like to imagine the look on my 6-year-old face if I saw that, yes, someone actually made that. Granted, you can't spawn absolutely everything, but that would actually be impossible, considering that you would also need to make art for pedophiles, glockenspiels, all the members of Monty Python, rare engrams, and New York City, along with everything in the known universe. But hey! You can add adjectives!To make things even better, this is the definitive edition of the game, in my opinion. Not only can you make your own objects by using other in-game things you can spawn and then adding scripts to them, but you can also share your creations to Steam Workshop. This is an absolute joy. Sure, you can't spawn Dragonball Z characters by default, but you can through the wonders of the Steam Community! This adds a whole new level to the game. It was enough that they let you create your own things to spawn, but the fact that they also allowed you to share and download your and other people's creations adds to the experience. I could spend hours just screwing around with this game. But of course, there is a mission mode. The missions are fun, because they force you to utilize your skill to spawn an uncountable amount of things to solve problems. This adds an element of logic to the game. Also, the music and graphics are charming, although simple.Even though sandbox games have recently become third-person open-world games exclusively, it's still fun to partake in experiences like Scribblenauts Unlimited. Sit back and let your creativity flow.			"

												Yes, this game, the best of creativeness ever. Seeing bunch of gamers play on Youtube, no matter how they suck at creative things, it's still best of all to make me wants to buy this game much enough. Tried it and pretty impressed with it. Getting to the end of game with no regrets a bit stuck, but never mind that. If you're thinking about some of lively games, no need of good graphics, how music can makes you like playing those old lively games. What did I say? I just eman today's games are quite a bit of boring, not feeling happy when played like old day times. Try this, really. You can give 10 out of 10. Every single star shards are great too, do not keep only doing big one.			"

												A very nice game that's sort of like a sandbox but not fully, you can create almost anything and the workshop offers a variety of other content you could use, the ending is heartwarming and I would definitely recommend this game for the younger community. You can also make your own objects using the object editor and then publish those to the workshop for others to enjoy, although, for me at least, it is kind of diffictult to make something you can really be proud of because you don't get that big a variety to work with, but that's no reason not to pick up this game.If you enjoy games that are like a sandbox but theres a storyline to complete, this is the game for you, I would recommend this a thousand times over if you are young, it's even quite fun for the older community sometimes!

												If you've seen the commericals for this then you know what to expect, a fairly simple and fun puzzle game. I've nearly beaten the game after several months (playing only a small ammount each week) and I still consider it fun after about ten hours of non-continuous gameplay. For the $20.00 it costs to buy it at its regular price I feel like I have gotten my moneys worth out of it though I might suggest waiting for a sale if you are not sure if you want it or not. In terms of gameplays though I can see people getting annoyed at the fairly repetitive nature of the game play which ammounts to see some people with a problem, firguring out what they need to solve the problem, typing it in the book then giving them that item. And while I aggree that it does get annoying if you are planning on trying to beat it in a single sitting I think the game is ment to be played in short bursts, which is the way that I have been playing it and have found it quite fun. The only other problem I have found is that sometimes it doesn't know simple items like winter coat, instead you have to kind of simplify the idea down to its more basic components (such as wool jacket for winter coat). Overall I would recomend this game for children or people who just like a simple, fun puzzle game. P.S you can summon cthulhu and have him battle robot pigs, so there's that.			"

												I find this game very enjoyable to play and I think many others do too. The story is a little childish but, seriously, come on. Who plays Scribblenauts for the story? You get a magical notepad at the very start of the game which you can use to create any object. The puzzles are quite enjoyable and humorous if you can finish it in an unlikely manner (like putting out a huge fire with a microscopic raindrop). You can also make weapons and mounts and clothes. You dress up as a samurai with a blue mouldy bazooka riding a flying robotic squid through the sky. Or a knight with a rusty cheese knife riding an orange shoe.The possibilities in this game are endless and I'm sure that you'll enjoy blowing things up with explosive goats and laughing at the humorous results just as much as I do (If you meet the imagination requirements).

												Szuper játék, addiktív és szórakoztató, sokszor van olyan érzésem hogy egy 8 éves angol kisfiúnak tervezték a játékot, de az én szerény angoltudásomnak jól jön, és szórakozok is vele, szóval teljes a játékélmény és tanulok is valamit. Nagyon szerethető játék, a feladatoknál csak néha, nagyon ritkán érződik hogy ismétlődnek. Kicsit ""buta"" az egész pl. amikor a horgásznak adtam egy tortát csalinak és ráment a cápa...az azért fura volt, és ilyesmi nem ritkán történik meg szóval ilyen szinten vannak hibái, de emiatt vicces is. A szótára hihetetlen nagy még kisebb slangeket is tud, azzal meg voltam elégedve! A világok is nagyon kreatívak, az ötlet is nagyon eredeti, én csak szórakoztam vele! Abszolút ajánlom!			"

												Like Scribblenauts? Buy this game. In this game you can either figure out puzzles or see what words, adjectives, and combinations create the coolest things. The puzzles are thought-provoking, making you think outside the box to figure out words that would answer or solve the riddles. This game is very fun, and, with mods, can be very worth the price. Most likely the best Scribblenauts game out there :).			"

												Bought this on 3DS. I played all the Scribblenauts games so far. At least on this one there's an object editor, whereas the 3DS didn't have the power or purpose for it I believe. The better graphics and added details due to the PC's superior power add for a wonderful experience even to those who have played it before (like myself). I think of this as a ""New Game+"" when I first bought and started it up. Write anything. Solve everything. Scribblenauts is for everyone!			"

												This game is many things, but above all, it is delightful. The graphics aren't glorious and it doesn't have a rich story accompanied by hours of cutscenes, but it is absolutely delightful. Let me give you an idea of what I'm talking about. This game is like one of those things that I dreamed about playing when I was little. ""Wouldn't it be cool if someone made a game where you could make any object appear?"". I'd like to imagine the look on my 6-year-old face if I saw that, yes, someone actually made that. Granted, you can't spawn absolutely everything, but that would actually be impossible, considering that you would also need to make art for pedophiles, glockenspiels, all the members of Monty Python, rare engrams, and New York City, along with everything in the known universe. But hey! You can add adjectives!To make things even better, this is the definitive edition of the game, in my opinion. Not only can you make your own objects by using other in-game things you can spawn and then adding scripts to them, but you can also share your creations to Steam Workshop. This is an absolute joy. Sure, you can't spawn Dragonball Z characters by default, but you can through the wonders of the Steam Community! This adds a whole new level to the game. It was enough that they let you create your own things to spawn, but the fact that they also allowed you to share and download your and other people's creations adds to the experience. I could spend hours just screwing around with this game. But of course, there is a mission mode. The missions are fun, because they force you to utilize your skill to spawn an uncountable amount of things to solve problems. This adds an element of logic to the game. Also, the music and graphics are charming, although simple.Even though sandbox games have recently become third-person open-world games exclusively, it's still fun to partake in experiences like Scribblenauts Unlimited. Sit back and let your creativity flow.			"
