Solid TD-fun with a twist!McDroid is an awesome little pearl, obviously overseen.It's an immersive tower-defence game with some really neat, fresh ideas.You're some adorable little droid with the mission to collect as many strawberries, seeds and diamonds as you can while fighting off hordes of different enemies that try to kill you and your base. And your towers. And your strawberries. And everything else.With diamonds you'll research/buy new towers or upgrades in a special ""shop-map"" and said red berries are the per-map-currency with which you can buy weapons which you can either plant into the ground (fixed positions) as stationary defences or plant into yourself for additional firepower or utility.You plant seeds in fixed spots that grow more strawberries regularly. But the more you build, the more you have to maintain/repair which will get very demanding in later waves.You can also plant repair-arms, factories which gather berries themselves, small droids to help you fight, etc.And what you have planted, you can pickup again and plant elsewhere. Or keep it on yourself. Whatever floats your boat here.At some point in a level the strawberry-production will be stopped and you'll have to do with what you gathered so far, so you better hurry up in the first place, which is easier said than done :-)The level selector is a map by itself, which is a neat idea. There are ""only"" 12 maps, but each with additional challenges and more to keep you going. There's even a nice ""zoo"" where you can see all creatures you've encountered so far.You can then compare your results with your friends. The Dev plays the game himself and has awesomely high scores. I bet he cheats :-)The good (what to love): Unique and one-of-a-kind! It's adorable and got a cute art-style Walk around as heavy armed artillery? Or a repair-god? Or as a berry-gathering maniac? Or as a weakling in a heavily defended base? Rely on YOU or your towers? Your choice. Each weapon (if you attach them onto yourself) can be charged for an additional punch. And separately if you wish to do so. E.g. Left arm makes PEW PEW PEW!-lasers while the right arm charges a big missile. Awesome! You don't just place a tower and leave it be. No, they will get destroyed too. Did someone say micromanagement? Hell yeah! Berries, seeds and diamonds vanish over time. So you need to grab them ASAP. Oh and of course you only can carry a limited amount of each, so you need to deliver them to your base all the time. OR you can attach a factory onto yourself and... Cool music It has COOP-features, which i have not tested yet There's a story. But I really don't care about a story in a TD. But it does not hurt either :-) Even with a totally overcrowded with hundreds of enemies and explosions and whatever else it remains playable. Performance is very good.The bad (not good, but not gamebreakingly awful): In some maps, at some points it can get horribly overcrowded up to the point where it's easier to oversee snowflakes in a snowstorm than enemies and towers :-) There apparently WAS an in-game-shop or something like that. That thing's still there in the map-selector with only a ""closed"" sign. That's annoying. Wanna see it all!The ugly (what to hate, may kill the fun): Nothing!Recommended?You like Tower Defence games and maybe action shooters and some RTS too? Definitely worth a try!You hate one of the said genres? You MAY still like it anyway.There's no game I could say that is quite similar, so a comparison is out of question here.I really enjoyed it, although it's no ""classic"" TD. Too sad it didn't had the commercial success it deserved. Maybe the Dev should have named it ""Fingered"" or ""NotGTAV"" :-(			"

												McDroid is simply delightful!Blending old rock music, cell shaded graphics, kwerky humour and fresh take on old tower defence mechanics; it's a gem a game many can enjoy. Rest of review below.

			NEW McDroid is a delightful game as little rover tries to save his planet. Click Here To Subscribe  http://bit.ly/19ksM1a Get the Game  http://store.steampowered.com/app/252970/ Website ...		

In it you're a little rover returning home with your rather silly shuttle, only to find your once beautiful planet has been ruined and its spirit silent. As the two of you set out on a quest to not only find out what's happened, but to restore the planet to its once beautiful self.This is done planting trees, and of course lasers, along with varied other weapons.The planet has been fracked, and its resources drained. Leaving it barren and its fauna and flare horribly mutated. The game might be rather linear in its story, but it lends itself to it very well and never having a boring spot.The shuttle is the voice of reason; to some extent. Telling what to do, how to do it and why. It's you're job to save the world, and protect not only the shuttle but yourself. As a little rover you can mount any item you can make, whether that's a little bonsai tree, a robotic repair arm, or a set of lasers!During the missions, aliens, and mutants are hell bent on stopping you. They've become rather accustomed to the horrible lava filled and corrupted world. This is where the tower defence mechanics come in, although you simply do not drop a turret and leave. Oh no, the creatures will happily destroy them on their path towards the shuttle, and you have a lot of micro managing to do. Running around repairing turrets, upgrading them, planting trees, and harvesting strawberries and diamonds.The two things that you depends on your fuel, and research. During the hectic battles you still need to try and harvest as many strawberries as possible. They are they currency with which you buy much needed items, and weapons. Take to long and they either disappear, get eaten, or the dreaded Strawberry DRM kicks in. Each mission has an undisclosed countdown, to when the DRM kicks in. Effectively turning the strawberry plants into crystals and halting your supplies.This makes the game quite hectic as you have do all this, your objectives, and fend of hordes of mutants.Adding to this is the collection of diamonds, which are used to research newer weapons, and items, along with upgrades for current ones. Not only this but they're also used to buy special items that can only be used during missions. These are vitally important. Especially for the later missions that feel almost impossibly difficult.My biggest complaint is the severe upgrade cost for items. Some need 1000 diamonds, and they're already hard to get and keep. As once you've used them for a mission item you need to earn new ones. This is done through the various arenas and challenge missions, although they can be even more difficult than the last missions.This forces you to have a nasty grind in the quest to get diamonds, especially since the early challenge missions only reward you with around 25-30 if you do very well.Also you can only pick up and carry a set amount of diamonds and strawberries, and they all go into the same pouch. Meaning that in a rather difficult fight you need to try and pick up the correct ones, while managing your defences.Overall the game blends all these things extremely well, and it's a very addictive game. I simply could not stop playing, even despite the bit of a diamond grind. I would easily recommend this game to people that just want a good fun game, with some weird humour, and lots of lasers.			"

												This is a wonderful little game. Played this co-op in beta with my son and nephew, then 10 and 8 years old. It was a joy to play then, and it has only improved since. It combines Tower Defence with strategic action. You can place towers in pre-determined slots on the map, and additionally carry one tower on your back. As you defend your spacecraft from attack, you have to consider repairing towers and your spacecraft, and defending and gathering of ressources. This is where co-op is particularly fun, as you can divide tasks between you, and devise a strategy together to beat a level.The graphics are colorful and cel shaded. As with all cel shaded graphics, this can become tiresome for the eyes. On the other hand it creates a nice display of colours, and makes items and entities easy to identify.The music is simple and excellent, fits the theme of the game well.The story is a little generic, but is suitable and when everything combines, it makes for a great game for adults and kids.Even in beta the game was well put together, something not always the case these days when it comes to Greenlit games on Steam. The price may be a bit too high, but the three years in the making shows, so maybe it's reasonable after all.			"

												This game can be really fun even for people who don’t like tower defense game like me.The game has a cartoony style which I like a lot. To me you can’t even compare this game to other tower defense I was hooked instantly. I know I only have a 100 minutes but I will complete it all  :D. The research place is also interesting because most game tower defense games don’t do that you get better stuff by level. The characters I meet so far are cool I like the jokes the ship makes and your robot has already impressed me too me this game would make me look at other tower defense. If someone asked me what I would give it, I would give it a 9/10. The things that bother me are that you can get stuck easily on the monsters and other stuff and so can your robot dogs and die ;(. The story I have mixed feelings I don’t like it nor do I hate it, the reason why is because it seems a bit bland to me.  But that wouldn’t stop me from playing I would recommend this to people I know even if they don’t like tower defense games, this game has me in its hands. "

												Mcdroid is a great game, its really good. Everything is good, from gameplay, to progression, economy, enemies, ect. Every match you plant seeds in pre-placed seed beds, which produce strawberries, which act as the games currency for buying and upgrading towers. This adds a additional element many tower defense games don't have, as you need to defend your strawberry patches. The other currency is diamonds. Diamonds are gained from certain enemy kills, and are used to buy tower upgrades and special abilities.There is alot of variety with the towers and upgrades, and the game is fun both in single and multi player. There is a limited number of campaign levels, estimated about 5 hours playtime. However there are hardcore and survival versions of almost every level which can ramp up the game time considerably, and are very fun. Playing online is also considerably fun.All in all a great game, worth the money and recommended to tower defense and arcade shooter fans.			"

												I like the cell-shading, the sound design and the look and feel remind me favorably of Rochard.  It's an odd tower defense, because you play in a confied space.  The pace is on the slow sid.  It is fun and can be occasionally challenging.  It can also be slightly confusing.  I am enjoying it, picked it up in a bundle a long time ago, and it just recently hit Steam.  It's a unique tower defense and I give it a cautious thumbs-up for introducing some new ideas (and plenty of nods to other tower defense games, especially the strawberries of Defense Grid.) "

												What if the Lorax was a robot, and his friends a shuttle and a sick planet?That's the premiss of McDROID, where you multitask a lot - install turrets, plant trees, and seeds, farm strawberries, build factories, place a giant talking laser on your back, kite monsters, plant more trees.Its main mission is made up of 12 levels, most can be replayed in challenge and nightmare mode with different waves and usually require vastly different strategies.After level 5 it becomes more of an action game than a tower defense but really you can play it different ways.

 McDROID Im giving this game a very negative review, duly because of the crazy SALE'S tactic's that have been used here OK.


I've been had here :O

By: Zowieanna Zanthia

			This game was on sale for 1 week ending October 4 2016. The multi pack was also -75% off so I purchased the Multi pack YAY :D Bargin RIGHT?		


 This game was on sale for 1 week ending October 4th at 3am CST time. I purchased the 4 pack and that was also 75% off as well. I gave a copy to a friend and a copy to my son, SO TO LATE for a REFUND now. Then I see the store page after the sale was over, & its the same price as what I had origionally bought the game for WHY? If this is an honest mistake, then I will delete this review in an instant, BUT if not and this is just another scamy sales tactic then ...........................

			Here is my proof of Purchase for the 4 Pack to McDROID. YES this was 75%off at the time of Purchase as well :P		


 IM REALLY UPSET over this change in pricing, so soon after a sale like this one !  If it was say 1 year later or even 2 years later it would not be so bad, but 1 week :P :(  To the Developer & Publisher Thank you greatly for the game and the fantastic discount I got ? WELL never really got, because YOU just scamed me for the price and the price NEVER really changed RIGHT? all with in a week from end of sale :PDeveloper: Elefantopia Publisher: Elefantopia OK know on a more positive note here, the game is very a nice Tower defense type Strategy game and does play smoothly I love the art the very cute McDROID Robot and the colours Im presented with, with in this game. BUT when all the shooting and action starts from the enemy waves the game starts to lag and stagger for me, not fun when this starts to happen, Son said its my laptop and GPU possibly cant handle the extra load when the action starts. This I really dont understand because other games even RIVE play fantastic with out any issues and many others a s well. Look all I will say is buy at your own risk now, I never really got a 75%off discount NOW did I ??????			"

												So, speaking of outlandish premises, here's another that has that in spades. Is it a better game than Last Hope? I'd say so, and I would recommend it, but with some caveats.The game stars the titular McDroid, who the game refers to as a dog-bot, and his friend a talking shuttle named...Shuttle. They return back to their friend Planet (who is a sentient) after a trip to find thing are a bit different. She's completely silent, mutated creatures are roaming about, and mysterious messages are around from an entity called the Somanto Corporation. You can probably see where this is going, and while I didn't find it too insufferable since you play as machines, the game does have an environmental message.To heal Planet you'll need to heal special flowers to bring her back to the way she was, and to do that you'll need to protect Shuttle from the mutants Somanto's action have let loose. Like Orcs Must Die or Spacejacked you control McDroid and have an avatar in the fights. Unlike other games though, you don't just get money from killing enemies: instead you have to collect seeds strewn across the level or dropped at scripted moments and plant them. They'll sprout strawberries every so often, which you need to grab and bring back to Shuttle. Then you can spend them. Certainly a unique change but not entirely a welcome one, although you do unlock a unit that will do that for you later on in the game.You can spend the berries on turrets, extra health or equipment for McDroid and Shuttle, and...Bonsai trees? The game has a terrain mechanic to it, where you can put trees in the same spots as your towers; they don't do any damage on their own, but spawn greenery in a certain radius. If a turret is in that distance, it deals much more damage. You can only put things in certain spaces, but McDroid has room for at least one turret or plant to carry around with him, so there's a lot of room to experiment.Where it gets tricky is that the enemy has their own terrain, a lavaish field that deals constant damage to anything inside it - this is another game where your towers can get attacked, although thankfully McDroid can repair them by default, and quickly too. Plants can counteract the field, but they sort of cancel each-other out, so it's a good idea to have your turrets get rid of whatever is causing it, usually the corpse of some bigger monster. To do that though you click on it, which distracts them away from anything else, so you need to pick the right time.It might sound like the levels have a lot to keep track of, and you're right. You're almost always on the move in McDroid, whether it's to collect some berries, shoot some debris, or boost your towers. That becomes a pain in certain things, like if you want to upgrade a tower; you need to have him holding the one in question before you can, which is cumbersome at times. To upgrade your kit you also need to personally collect gems that drop from destroying certain things or opening chests. You do get a grace period when the level's over to collect things you missed, and there are a few levels where you need to do other things in addition to surviving all the waves, which ensures you won't get booted out before you can get them all. You can use gems in levels to buy specialty things, such as some helper units that attack enemies for you or extra spaces for turrets and plants.I finished all the main levels in McDroid except for the last one, which almost seems designed for co-op (which the game has), since you have to keep track of things in all four directions. That took me five hours. That's probably the biggest caveat: besides the story levels, there just seems to be more challenging versions of those levels and some endless arena levels. The game's twenty dollars full price, but even at five dollars, which I bought it at, you'd need to really like the game to get much out of it besides the bare minimum. I can't really say it's a bad game, since there does seem to be a lot of effort to put in, and it looks really nice. I might be less pleased with it if I have gotten it at full price, though. If you want a unique game that's a bit imperfect, McDroid could interest you.			"

												I think Mcdroid created a new genre. It's not only a tower defense it's an action game with turrets. After the first 3 levels, action really picks up and you can feel the power of this game. The hordes of enemies always keep you alert. You can deploy many strategies or just run around with a bunch of guns on your back. Furthermore when you finish a level, the mission becomes available in challenge and nightmare mode which reminded me of the good old Doom.Kudos for the Coop, I was not expecting multiplayer for that kind of game but it's really fun to play nightmare with a bunch of friends :DGreat Game! = GG "

												McDroid is a very silly and bizarre game, with a setting that sounds like a story Pee-Wee Herman would tell. Its light hearted, but certainly has some advanced humor.The gameplay is deceptively challenging, with a number of different activities to balance in each level. Should you leave one un-attened for too long, you will quickly find yourself in a pickle.The tutorials are not entirely intuitive, so make sure you look at all the signs! Fortunately the gameplay is starightforward enough that you might not need it, though there is more depth than there appears to be at first glance.I enjoy it, and look forward to playing more with friends!

												McDroid Is a very fun and addictive game that is in its own category. It is part Tower defense, part 3rd person shooter, part RTS. It has good graphics with good game mechanics as well. You can play for any period of time to either kill some time or just go BALLZ OUT and just destroy everything and everyone to see how far you can get within the levels. The best part of this game is that it is actually very challenging. Each level has its own style and you have to find that sweet spot just to clear it. of course you will never be happy on how you did on the previous level, so you'll want to retry it yet again and do a different build. And the best part is, each level has a challenge level and a nightmare level where you get to play from where you left off at in your previous playthrough instead of starting from scratch. So if you end up getting your butt kicked (and you will) you can go back and redo the easier mode to set yourself up better in the harder difficulties.And just when you thought you had a good strategy and build, you unlock and upgrade more and more towers and weapons, which is awesome, but is also like throwing a wrench in the gears, because you have to rethink everything you have just learned. But its all good, that is a great feeling and adds so much more to the game. I would recommend this game to anyone who has just the slightest interest in Tower Defense, Challenging games, building games, cutesy games, ect. This game may not look like much, but it has more than you can imagine. Try it, buy it, get involved. Lets get this game on the map and hope for a sequel.			"

												McDroid does something refreshing in the TD genre. This game provides a bright artstyle with adorable enemies.  It reminds me of a better version of Pixeljunk Monsters. I can see the company easily publishing worthwhile DLC since levels offer replay value and there are fairly limited tower options so far.  My only complaint is that it isn't a 60 dollar game with more content.  I haven't played much of the co-op but what I played was fun. I'm very surprised this wasn't pushed on consoles since it would make for some fun couch co-op.			"

												I played this back when it was beta invite only on indie royale and desura. I had enjoyed it greatly then and still enjoy it here. Now while i find it slightly disheartening that i have to start back at square one instead of where i was before it was on steam, I quickly got over it since it just means i get to enjoy the ride all over again.The new addittions in this version include: A research lab level that lets you test drive the various weapons and upgrades as you unlock them. The survival levels being moved to their own area instead of needing to be found in other levels. a few extra levels. And few new and/or reworked weapons. There appears to be room for new content as well as the possibility of random cosmetics and the challenge levels add an extra spice to the mix. The devs are also responsive and listen to the community, quick to sqwash bugs or make balance changes as able.I would definitely give this Game a Recommendation, especially since it is upto 4 players co-op.

												This game sucks in a way that it keeps away you from doing anything else ;-) It is very lovely done, the graphics are really nice, kept in a comic-lice style.The story is ... well ... odd. Long story short: You crash-land on a planet and need to refill your strawberry-juice-engine. While planting and harvesting strawberries, you have to keep the ""local population"" away from them and prevent your own destruction, because they bite and shoot.Handling is very easy, Just run, collect and upgrade. Shooting at enemies is done automatically, but you can also choose a primary target by just clicking it. All weapons fire is then focused on that.There are many different weapons and items which will help you doing that. You will find blueprints and diamonds throughout the game to research and upgrade these.Your McDROID has an arm with which it can repair damaged turrets and your shuttle.After you finish a level, the challenge and nightmare mode for that level will become available for more fun.And if a level ist just too tough fou you alone, you can invite friend to help you out. Yes, this game is multi-player.Is it worth the price? Yes. Definitely.			"

												Kind of fun... maybe i need to play more.  Not really understanding the decision to only allow the droid to pick up a finite number strawberries or gems.....really annoying when you are trying to pick up gems for upgrades but you can't because your guy picked up the strawberries instead.  Also,  Need to maybe make a no kidding tutorial.  I had no clue what was going on other than by pressing buttons and seeing what happened.  Good feature is the auto attack while you are running around.  I noticed the hit box is a little unforgiving when human controlled.  Game needs some patching which will surely come as more players check this out.  6/10			"

												More Reviews @ TheVideogameBacklog.comMcDROID is one of the two most imaginative tower defense games I’ve played in a long time. It’s a timeless story about you (a puppy-like robot named McDROID) and your friend SHUTTLE crash-landing on the dying Planet M. You must plant and harvest strawberries as a form of currency to build and upgrade towers to fight off the corrupted creatures that have taken a stronghold on Planet M. This may really sound strange, but it’s also a truck load of fun!Maintaining your calm, like John Spartan, is crazy essential to McDROID. If you don’t keep a clear head you’ll start forgetting to maintain your defenses so you can gather stuff or you’ll forget about gathering strawberries and have nothing to buy towers with. Things can go from good to “Oh sweet mother! Where did all THAT come from!?!” fairly quickly. That’s part of the strategy/challenge though.Since the game comes off as having a tower defense game foundation one can assume a usual set of rules: set defense->kill monsters->gain money repeat. McDROID rarely gives you the currency needed to buy towers or to beef them up from drops (while in the stage). You need to find and plant seeds to grow your strawberries. You’ll usually start with a few seeds and then get more from monsters to plant later. Then, not only do you have to pick them when they ripen, but you also have to take them to SHUTTLE. Then you can spend them on defense. Also, you can only carry a certain amount at one time.All this takes time away from the front lines of battle. You’ll quickly learn that if you ignore the front line for too long in hopes for more profit, the front line will be in your face in no time. Eventually you’ll get blueprints for a gathering tower the helps by harvesting strawberries and gathering diamonds nearby. Don’t scoff at the idea like I did; use this helpful tower!Of all the things that the bad guys do drop, you will receive diamonds from some of them and these are essential. High scores… screw’m. You can come back later for that. Diamonds help a lot more in the long run. They are used in the researching of bigger and badder guns to help repel the waves of no-goodniks. Oh, I guess you could also buff your defenses too, but isn’t the best defense a good offense? That does come with a cost though. If you unlock all four levels of your laser turret, you may only be able to have one fully upgraded turret instead of multiple lower end ones. Is that worth it? It varies on each situation. Sometimes the upgraded turret can function differently than the previous levels and you may not even like it! Spend you diamonds carefully… or not really, you can always get more!Something else that stands out in McDROID is the humor. It’s… strange. Not the “so far out of left field you can’t fathom it” strange, but you will probably tilt your head and question if you just heard what was said. It’s nothing inappropriate, just different. Some of the things said in McDROID also had me rolling. This is a light-hearted title that holds a crowbar behind it’s back. One minute it will have you laughing and the next the sudden change in a battle’s tide will have you crying.One of the best parts of McDROID is the coop. Normally this is something that is just tacked on for me and is nifty, but not all together necessary for me to have a good time. While single the single player campaign is great fun, playing this crazy madness with friends is simply a blast! It can be a bit confusing at first with the strawberry collection being shared and one teammate (read: me) spending all of them on some venture that he thinks is a great idea. Hopefully it pays off, but it won’t 100% of the time. Diamonds collected go to each individual person, but when spent only get taken from the one who purchased said item. It’s a very nice touch.Score: Gewd./Tasty!Other than a small issue with the back button on my controller causing some problems, McDROID is a delight to play with or without friends. The concept is great and executed fantastically. It’s not super deep, but it’s got depth where it needs it. If you are a fan of strategy/tower defense games, you owe it to yourself to pick this up and give it a try. It may not be a walk in the park, but there are some nice views to take in while your rampaging across Planet M.			"

												You may read my initial review below, however after completing the game on the second day with only ""achievements"" left to gain by painfully grinding levels or waiting for people who actually play properly i have had to change my review. If i am missing something please let me know, but according to it i finished the tree of life and thats pretty much the end. So i payed £13.50 for a few hours of gameplay some which were just painful grinding to get diamonds. i have to compare this to say kingdom rush - £6.99 for  70 hours+ gameplay. in its current state this game is well overpriced.Now deleting!I purchased this with very little to go on, only around 3 reviews at the time of purchase. It's a great game i do however think it is more inclined towards multiplayer if you want to advance at a reasonable pace. I seem to have to be ""grinding"" to get diamonds to unlock upgrades etc in single player. Also the tutorial doesnt really explain things very well and as your thrown in at the deep end ( in single player ) it can seem a little overwhelming, As you realize that your wasting the diamonds you need for upgrades on mines etc, evetually it causes you to play a lot more strategically to save resources for upgrades.Graphically its nicely done and it all plays very well. The only problem i really encountered was whilst i was carrying a turret at one point i seem to become lodged in the ""mother ship"" there seemed no way to free myself and it forced me to restart the level. Also i noticed that trying to traverse the pathway from level to level with the keyboard causes your droid to walk diagonally ( i saw a few people fall off the path - having the same problem ) this problem however doesnt occur with a  controller.  All in all a good game with only a couple of minor flaws ( that i have found so far )			"

												This game looks nice but just seems to be designed poorly and therefore isn’t very fun. Levels progress slowly, it takes forever to kill enemies, the diamond upgrade system also seems like a grind. The fact that there is a tower on the player just seems gimmicky, and just makes it so you are constantly hovering over enemy’s with your mouse, a brainless activity. I want to like this game but just don't. It may get better, but I don't want to spend time to get there.			"

												Highly recommend this game - not your typical tower defense game. Requires plenty of multi-tasking and a steady mouse to keep track of all the moving pieces. I pretty much pick up most tower defense games and this one certainly stands out amongst the many flavors. Note - the game is not easy if you expect to breeze through the levels in short time.I've not tried co-op yet but I read it's one of the selling points also.			"

												This is a great take on a tower defense.  It is very easy to pick up and enjoy but ramps up the pressure at a nice pace which keeps you coming back for more.  I only have a few hours on this game so far but have decided it is a keeper for me.  I would love to see this game developed with additional downloadable content.  Or better yet a mod.  I will revisit my review after more time in game and will update accordingly.			"

												I think this is a good one. I like tower defense games so I figured I'd like this but there are quite a few unique things for this one.Pros:Lighthearted (Tries it's best to be ridiculous with it's dialog)Crazy (The turrets talk, your main currency to buy things is strawberries, the main character looks like a toilet with the basket on its back)Small, this game seriously only takes up 800 MB or something at the time of writing this.Multiplayer, always nice to play with friends.Cons:Short (I haven't finished it yet and haven't tried the challenges but for the regular maps I think I'm already half way done.)Character customization seems to be disabled at the moment, you can interact with paint cans to change your color but not much else.On a random note you fight using the turrets by attaching one to your head, this makes you a mobile defense base more than it gives you a weapon though, you can command nearby towers to shoot a given place anyway and the one on your back is no different, it'll also shoot automatically when you're not commanding it. It's a bit different and doesn't make a huge difference but I found it a bit of a strange system at first.Definitely worth a look if you're into coop tower defense type games.			"
