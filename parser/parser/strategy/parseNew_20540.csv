												Back when I was in middle school I had two close online friends who I played games with every night. We played the usual thing middle schoolers played like Call of Duty and some free to play games. One day, one of us had enough money to buy 3 copies of Company of Heroes which was a game none of us heard about but were interested in. For the entirety of 8th grade we played this game religiously. I have so many good memories from this wonderfully made RTS that there is no way I can write a bad review. This game is a perfect 10/10 with a 20/10 for the abundance of mods that exist for it. There are mods for Modern Warfare (Not the COD game, but a conflict between China and U.S.A) with it's own campaign, mods that expand upon existing units and vastly expand the possibilities of the game, mods that feature the Eastern front (USSR vs. Germany), mods that feature the war in Africa, Italy, and Japan, and many, many, many more. This game is a thing of beauty.			"

												Needless to say, Company of Heroes is one of the greatest games of all time and my favourite RTS. If you are interested in this game and haven't bought it yet, let me just sum up all the things which make Company of Heroes so superb: + thrilling campaign with cinematic cutscenes+ insane multiplayer battles where even a certain loss can be turned into a surprising victory+ unique resource system that forces you to play aggressively and fight across the entire map+ completely destroyable environment and sophisticated physics system+ very detailed graphics compared to other RTS gamesWith that being said, one could think CoH is almost a perfect game. It indeed is, but there is also a couple of things that sometimes make the game a bit frustrating:- vehicle pathing. Especially in urban maps with lots of buildings. obstacles, etc.- cheating AI. Yes, computer player cheats which means it can see the exact locations of all your units at all times as well as your building queues. Additionally, it can also use some abilities in ways human players can't.So, what are you waiting for? Go get the game if you haven't yet! It's definetely worth the money and it still has a lot to offer, even today.9/10			"

												The only thing that bugs me about this game, is that there is nothing wrong with it. The second add-on to one of best real-time strategy games of all time. Intense, beautiful, and very amazing. The Game follows the stories of individuals from both sides as they fight in the Battle of Normandy. This add-on, does not have the average long campaign stories. But three short, but very good stories. Two German and One American. Either you are a German Tiger Ace batting British Tanks, and German Luftwaffe Ground Unit trying to defend the evacuation of the Faliase Gap, or a small band of members of the 82nd Airborne Division trying to hold a key road from a German counter-attack on D-Day. New units and better graphics are added making your whole Company of Heroes series (Opposing Fronts, and ToV) a whole lot better and more exciting.			"

NOTE 1:Also see my Company of Heroes Review here:http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/4560And my Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts here:http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/9340NOTE 2:Normally I would give this expansion a 'Not Recommended' rating but since a 'Complete Pack' exists I highly advice that you buy the aforementioned Pack to have the full Company of Heroes 1 experience.TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor is a real-time strategy game developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ (RIP). This game serves as the second official expansion pack to the series which adds new game types that focuses on micro-management of either a single or small unit sizes, new 'Direct Fire' ability, new mini-campaigns which rewards you with alternate unit models for certain factions and fun new multiplayer modes.The expansion pack 'Tales of Valor' gives the players three new mini-campaigns. The first one is 'Tiger Ace' which lets the players control a rampaging Tiger I Tank in a small town. The story follows the exploits of Majorgeneral Voss (character from Opposing Fronts) and Hauptmann Schultz (main antagonist of the first game). The second mini-mission is 'Causeway' where the player takes command of a group of paratroopers of the 86nd Air Division in their efforts to secure and hold the La Fiere Causeway which was being used by Allied forces to pass through the Normandy beaches. The last and final mini-mission is 'Falaise Pocket' where the player controls a renegade SS Panzergrenadiers and Wehrmacht soldiers who were ordered to evacuate but defied High Command in order to hold off advancing allied forces and give time for retreating German troops to escape.PROS:+ New missions are fun to play+ New units looks nice but... (See CON # 2)+ New and fun multiplayer game modes like 'Stonewall'+ Micromanagement gameplay (specially with the 'Tiger Ace' mission) was very fun+ 'Falaise Pocket' mission was extreme+ Artwork cutscenes were nice and complemented with good voice actingCONS:- No new armies or units- Some new units are just skin replacements- Mini-campaigns can be completed in a few hours for all three missions (I didn't expect it to be as long as the original campaign or as long as the Opposing Fronts campaign but I didn't imagine that it was this short)- The 'Directed Fire' feature is very hard to use and is implemented badly- Tried to do Stealth missions which were implemented (just like the above CON) badly- This expansion feels rushedCONCLUSION:Much like a Sherman to a Tiger Tank, this expansion is vastly inferior to the other games. It has its moments with some really intense battles particularly the 'Falaise Pocket' campaign, interesting new game mechanics from 'Tiger Ace' and cool looking replacement units but in the end, it doesn't really add anything innovative to the title. Playing through the campaign missions will leave players feeling that this expansion was rushed and released prematurely.Normally I would give this expansion a 'Not Recommended' rating but since a 'Complete Pack' exists I highly advice that you buy the aforementioned pack to have the full Company of Heroes 1 experience.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Even today ""Company of Heroes"" is still a great RTS game set in WW2, but the campaign in this expansion ""Tales of Valor"" just rubs me the wrong way. In the original game the campaign focuses on the American forces. In the first expansion ""Opposing Fronts"" the campaign focuses on the Allied and German forces. Now you would think that for this second expansion they would focus on the Soviets, but no. This was my only gripe when this expansion first came out. To make it worse, the German campaign focuses AGAIN on the same German officer that was featured in the original and first expansion. This expansion just adds very little to the franchise.

												Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor (CoH: ToV) is another expansion from the ground-breaking real-time strategy (RTS) game, Company of Heroes. CoH: ToV, however, does not offer any new armies and features a very short campaign, but it does allow you to select a few new units in multiplayer that will replace other units such as the American M10 Tank Destroyer for the M18 Hellcat. CoH: ToV is still a worthwhile investment for fans and completionists while still offering interplay ability.			"

												Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor is another great standalone add-on for the main game. It provides 2 new armies, 2 new campagins and few extra units for the main game (if you own it, that is) - AGAIN. You can use this Add-on as a seperate game and just use this content or you own the base game and the content adds up - you suddenly have up to 6 armies, a lot of campaigns and extra units. Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor does the same as the main game and the first expansion - great campaigns, enjoyable sessions against AI players and one of the best and most balanced Multiplayer RTS games on the market. 10/10 the second of 2 great Add-on's to the main game.

												You play as either one or maybe at most a few tanks. It's okay. It gives you a new way to independently traverse the turret for easier (?) aiming. The game is transformed a bit into an action game instead of strategy by focusing on generally one unit. It's not bad, but it's not as enjoyable as the regular game.			"

												The entire Company of Heroes collection is a great RTS, especially for those who traditionally don't like to play this genre of game due to the punishing difficulty on new players (seen in the big name ones, like StarCraft). The fact that this is a World War 2 setting will also draw out some people to try the game out.CoH doesn't have you building your base and gathering resources, rather it has you capturing points on the maps which provide you with increased resources and army capacity. This lets you worry more about managing position on the battlefield, rather than managing how many drones you have collecting resources. As you play more, you will see little nuances of the game that make the game deeper and more complex, like cover behind walls, flanking, and all the sorts of things you may expect from playing an in-depth, turn-based, strategy game.Overall, the CoH collection of games have a great single player campaign experience, and a thriving multiplayer community. If you like real-world settings for war, this RTS is probably for you.Tales of Valor has a much weaker single-player experience than the previous entries. It's really just more of the same, but with a bit taken out. Regardless, it is still worthwhile to have if you are a CoH fan.6/10 ""Okay""			"

												Tales of Valor is the second expansion for Company of Heroes and where Opposing Fronts brought us more of the same Tales of Valor tries to change the pace and brings many new features and additions, some better than others.The campaigns, all 3 of them, are very nicely made but unfortunately very short, only 3 missions each and it's a shame because they are by far the best single-player missions in the Company of Heroes franchise.Multi-player wise Tales of Valor adds a number of the new game modes which is a really great addition. Although I am a bit disappointed that an expansion is needed for this as mods usually does this job with other RTS games I am still happy that the Multi-player finally got a bit more varied.Whereas Opposing Fronts gave the Company of Heroes singleplayer new life Tales of Valor revitalizes the multiplayer and gives the game new life. It is still not a full expansion in the way you expect it and that hurts the experience.			"

												this is the 2nd time i owned tales of valor. first was buying company of heroes gold that includes relics COH vanilla, opposing fronts and Tales of valor. and the 2nd was by buying company of heroes collectors edition.my gameplay dose not match for the time i have with COH:tales of valor since relic made a steam only variant for COH. where i am able to activate my old keys for COH. and it worked. i even have new keys for my COH,opposing fronts and tales of valor for my new steam edition version.back then when i was in college i spent hundreds to thousands of hours for all COH titles including expansion. since i had to spend like an average of 2 - 4 hrs a day for 5 days a week and sometimes 6+ hours during saturdays and sometimes a full 12+ hours on days when i visit my friends and meet in a net cafe. for COH grind fest vs player or vs custom map like the 3vs3 KI War Sumpfgebiet, 4vs4 V2 Festung, for custom maps against AI where the map is riddeled with AI deployed infantry trenches weaponizes zones and full armored companies waiting for ambush in negative cover kill zone. so we have to work together to systematically take every inch in blood and hard earned lives of men, balls of steel, Glory and for the Fatherland or Freedom depending on what sides we took. those were the times where DSL in our country is hard as hell to get and unreliable since it gets to disconnect a lot so we play w/ LAN. immagine a cafe with 4 players - 8 players within earshout. some informant is leaking your info in your sides to the enemies. some using spy satelites to glimpse your troop position by turning their heads to confirm your position. immagine what will it take for you to properly coordinate with an ally that is between enemies positions (his computer was in between enemies computer tables and not close to ours). its all hell , all fun and just make sure you dont get too cocky pull your buffs properly and spread disinformation amongst your foes. our wars are berderline subtelety and duplicity with a dash of blitzkrieg and lots of sheer manliness. those were the days where you fight and die with bros. REAL BROS. not someone whe pretends as one over the net. where decisive planning and faints changes the outcome. where a singe AT gun well emplaced mines and 2 altillery piece claims the day.immagine an average of 2 - 4 hours a day for five days a week for the next two years. spent on this experience and up to 12+ hours of marathon during the weekends with real bros fighting side by side. laughing , dying , trying to check the position of the enemies from a single large piece of cardbord seperating our team to the Enemies. trying to use people who watch the game to help them leak info to us and our enemies are also doing it in every possible options. its not just a game, its a life experience. and its filled with emotion. good bad and ugly just like war. some say war is hell. and this game is one of the closest we can get aside from paintball and BB gun play. some might find it difficult to understand but when you meet your enemies or see them in just a few computer tables away from you ,  some games you ally with your previous enemies , you change sides , you play with people you meet , have lunch or take breaks after 5-8 solid hours of play , grab some snak together and talk afterwars about your game, your past games, your experience, sometimes your real life problems , your crush , your difficulties in life when you are not playing. its no longer a game anymore but a bonding , a brotherhood or something close. my best friend married one of the girls who used to kick his♥♥♥♥♥in halflife 2 deathmatch and counter strike 1.7-1.9 patch since 1999-2000's who also played Company of heroes with us and can kick 2 players vs her. after ten or so years shes a part time housewife , a full time mother and an occational super level boss that we have to fight once in a while. i hate it when she lures people in the killzone and after you got tyranosaurus rekt she quits since the baby sitter needs to go home already and take care of their kids. (no more chance to redeem myself or maybe 5-9 of his opponents there including her husband)would bribe a kid a coke to get the position of the US and british army for my hummel altillery strike. 1942/10			"

												(This is less for TOV more for Company of Heros in general)The main thing I love about this game is not the large battles or the in depth cover and destruction system, but the dialogue from soldier to soldier. Sometimes you just forget about a squad, and they lose their lives for it. If you aren't too preoccupied with pushing your forces on the other side of the map, you'll sometimes hear the screams of your men begging for orders asking what to do. As the CO, you don't have time for that one itty-bitty squad, there are bigger stakes at hand; Like winning. ""Sir we are under enemy fire! What are your orders!?"" ""Oh god, He's dead sir! Man down!"" ""Run or the Americans will kill you!""COH is incredibly immersive for that reason alone. Add in the well done skirmishes and army building, effects and sounds, this game easily gets a 9/10 IMO. I absolutely reccommend this game to anyone who enjoys WW2 settings, and RTS type games.			"

												Even though all 3 games belonging to Company of Heroes (New Steam Version) are a singular package on your account once bought, yet does not have a store page of it's own, I wanted to point out that Tales of Valor in particular really changes up the campaign structure. While it offers 3 very short campaigns that dont even add up to the length of the original COH's campaign, or barely matches the length of either campaigns from the first expansion, this one feels quite a lot more like the flow of Warhammer Dawn of War 2, which they also made. You are given far fewer units, the stories flow much faster, and you are forced use an expanded set of abilities for your few units, instead of relying on massive waves of soldiers and tanks. You also can directly control the targeting of any tank or squad now.Aside from the single player, you of course get more multiplayer content, but at this point I think most people who play online moved onto COH2 and it's expansions. I do still see almost a dozen active games at any given time here though. It's still alive.			"

												Made back when the original company of heroes was in it's golden era. Gameplay is more action and arcade oriented so do not expect a realistic or historically accurate story. Graphics are actually BETTER than in Company of Heroes 2 , if you're new to the Company of Heroes scene, avoid CoH 2 at all costs, instead, get Tales of Valor or any of the first installment's titles, CoH 2 fails on so many levels it is offensive to even call it a game. CoH 1 will give you the entertainment and action packed gameplay you seek if an arcade style RTS is what you are hungry for. CoH 1 - 9/10 . CoH 2 - .3 / 10, it's THAT simple.			"

												Anyone who knows me knows what I think about this game. It's an RTS that does a lot of things differently from the Starcraft/C&C crowd, with brilliant new ideas that make for excellent gameplay. It is, bar none, my favorite RTS of all time.Resource income is based on control of territory sectors distributed all over the map. Your economy hinges on being proactive and willing to fight to push the front line forward. Turtling in your base is effectively forfeiting the match.Combat is more nuanced -- less about reflexes and more about tactics. Reading the terrain and making use of environmental cover is a vital skill. Flanking, formations, suppression, combined-arms assaults... very few of these concepts matter in most RTS games of today, but they're all here and all important components of victory in CoH.I don't know if this game is ever going on sale again, but if you have money to spend, get this game. You'll get a fresh, masterfully-crafted experience, and countless hours of fun in online matches alongside, or against, your friends.			"

												Company of Heroes is one of the best WW2 RTS games I have ever played. Of course, like all games, it is not without faults. However, the vast majority of gameplay concepts and mechanisms have been perfected to such a level that you will not regret your purchase.I am a big fan of WW2 history and I have always wanted a real-time strategy game that would allow me to master combined arms tactics which were developed during WW2. The game has a wide variety of units including but not limited to infantry, tanks, mobile artillery, mortar and light armored vehicles. In order to defeat your enemy, you will have to use a combined arms approach that integrates all of these units. You won't be able to steam roll through the enemy lines with a single Tiger tank as it would get torn to shreds by Bazooka-wielding infantry units.Overall, I must say Relic has created a true gem for all WW2 game fans. I wholeheartedly recommend buying this game!			"

												One if not the best real time strategy game in my game collection. I played this game for hours and hours with my online mates. The game has superb coop mode but that doesn't mean you can play the single player missions of the campaignes. A lot of people made some very amusing maps for this game that extended the replay value of this game by tenfold. The units look realistic even when zoomed in. The vehicles and weapons look historically correct. As far as I can judge. It took a while to download the game with all of it's gigabytes of patches on my computer.  But boy was it worth the wait.

Focusing on company level combat has allowed for lots of attention to detail, adaptable play, and fast action. Completely destructible environments are used to enhance gameplay and create some of the most satisfyingly war torn landscapes seen in video games. A fulfilling campaign, addictive gameplay, detailed visuals, and powerful use of sound make up a complete experience with very few problems.

												Company of Heroes (CoH), a WWII RTS game created by Relic, the developers behind Warhammer® 40.000 - Dawn of War.  CoH puts you in charge of the U.S, British, Wehrmacht, and Panzer Elite forces during the famous war. In the (Single-player only) campaign you will fight through battles such as Omaha Beach and Carentan, while also being able to play as the Germans through their unique story. There is also a Skirmish mode and several Multiplayer-only modes.			"

												Although I did enjoy the campaigns in this game (as well as the other COH games) and I think the multiplayer would be great, I can't reccomend it purely on the basis that the AI is unplayable on team skirmish maps. Every time I have played I'm left with AI teamates that get overwhelmed by the opposing AI, leaving you to pick up the slack. Even on easy difficulty it makes games predictably boring, with you eventually losing to the AI spamming the harder to kill units.			"

												Start playing at 10 p.m, when i look at the clock its 3 a.mI was indecise about getting CoH 2 due to the amount of DLC's it had and people complaining. It came on sale and I gave it a try.  So far enjoying it pretty much and I can safely say that it is one of the best RTS wwii I ever played.Simple, easy to learn, hard to master. Runs great without bugs and graphics are also awesome. Apart from the campaign and graphics, i can say it is pretty identical to the first CoH, with it's own advantages (and disadvantages).PROS:-Active multiplayer , with great community ready to help-Great graphics, superb amount of detail-Simple and easy to learn-I just got it for 9€(cheaper then the first CoH?)CONS:-Ridiculous amounts of DLC's, some may even consider it P2W.I have really no more cons about the game. 8/10			"

												A real classic WW2 RTS simulation. Perhaps just slightly dated now but still highly immersive. When the action kicks off you really feel in the thick of it, Orders being barked, machine guns rattling, morter shells exploding around the map. Real solid single player and multiplayer, a wide selection of troops with are all quite well balance (although mass tanking it against the AI does seem pretty much the way to go), great map design and top notch sound effects and music.

												The game in of itself has both good and bad, but mostly bad.  If you want to get it for a riveting single-player focused on the struggle and chaos of the second half of WW II, you sort of get it.  Most of the ‘characters’ if you even want to call them that blandly spit out their lines as they send another wave of conscripts with the game-equivalent of a BB gun against armored cars and tanks.  Don’t expect a story as in-depth or well-paced as “Saving Private Ryan.”  If that’s not your cup of tea, then fine.  If you want shooty-shooty tanky-tanky then this is the place for it.  Most of the game leans on its multiplayer for any sense of replay-ability, as the ‘medals’ you work to earn in the campaign aren’t even a challenge, and you can generally acquire them without even realizing you did (by the third sweep of the 5-hour campaign, I had it to 100% completion.)The problem with multiplayer is that it’s completely dead.  That’s all I can really say.  I don’t know if there’s a hyper-elite community of the game’s veterans that shun nooby outsiders or if it’s flooded with bad players because the game on sale day is cheaper than dirt.  I never found a lobby, never conversed with anyone, nothing.  The HD re-release of Age of Empires 2 has a larger following than this, for goodness’ sake.  So with no multiplayer and a luke-warm single player, skirmish mode is your best bet, where you place yourself against the AI on a whole slew of different maps that inevitably (and I mean completely without failure) turn into ‘who has more tanks?’  Oftentimes it’s the Wehrmacht (the primary German army) and their best pals the Panzer-Lehr division (given you have the other DLC).  If you play as American (as their campaign is the longest and you’ll have much more experience with them) enjoy getting smacked around considering all your truly good units (Shermans, Rangers, Hellcats/ Wildcats) don’t show up until way late game when the enemy’s already busting up you and your incompetent allies with Jagpanthers, King Tigers, Hetzers, Stugs, StuH42’s, or whatever else they feel like. Speaking of the A.I, if your faction is the Allies you get a choice between Americans or Brits, Axis being Wehrmacht or Panzer-Lehr, which sounds diverse, and in some cases is, but they are completely brain dead.  The securing of territory (marked by capturing certain points on the map) is what allows you to gain more resources and ultimately win.  In the one of two skirmish modes, some of these points are replaced with special ‘victory points’ which you capture and hold in order to drain your enemy’s points to zero.  Oftentimes my allies would capture a territory one of these points was within, build up their forward base, send units, bring in gliders, whatever, and never even touch the victory point.  Didn’t matter if we were behind or ahead; they were that dense.  And lord forbid you set the enemy difficulty above ‘normal’ because they will stomp you and your allies into the dirt with the fun little process I can only refer to as cheating.  You will be stampeding through their base with your vastly superior Shermans, Rangers, and armored divisions only for them to call in special units from their command tree and push you back effortlessly.  If I could describe this game in one word, it’d be frustrating.6/10.  Buy it if it’s on sale for good and cheap so you don’t feel that cheated when you realize how crap it really is after a while.

												Everything from C&C4 except the bad things... just add it over here.This game is the RTS master. It has so much micro-managing that I had to let go of some keys while playing to assign the 0 to a specialized squad. I love the fast paced combat in annihilation but Conquest or ""Victory points"" will forever be my favorite in COH. After playing these games thanks to the Humble THQ Bundle, I can surely say I am addicted and I will be getting COH2, hopefully it will happen unlike my other favorite strategy -- Generals 2 which got cancelled only to make a... F2P strategy game.That asside - COH is a great game with many pros and little cons. The bots can be kind of hard to manage both on the enemy team and yours. For instance, we had our friend leave last night and his bot made the biggest army that I've ever seen in RTS game until now... they did nothing at all and since there are 3 types of beacons, each for ""Attack"", ""Defend"" and ""Capture"", the only way I could signal my Not-NPC player was by beaconing him the attack here and then quickly changing to the bot doing something but he doesn't do it all the time. Bottom point though, the game uses interesting mechanics and I like what I see from it, I am only sad I was stubborn not to download it through out the years when these Standalone expansions and the game were released..

The difference lies in the extreme realism and tremedous effects which leading to awesome gameplay. Excellent graphics, gameplay, strategy and management of your squads. 8/10 will suffice. The current state of the product is bit broken and you must install the ""New Steam Edition"" because Sega taken THQ over. Don't expect the multiplayer feature to work seamlessy, it still works, but sometimes the server timeouts.

												Currently the price is $19.99. The campaign mode is extremely short (Steam tells me that I played for .4 hours, and I beat the whole campaign, so...) Granted, the levels are fairly fun, but almost all of them are: here is one (or a few) unit(s) good luck. There is little base building in many of the missions, and I absolutely HATE these sorts of missions. Instead of micromanaging a army, you are largely micromanaging one or two guys. This is an RTS not an ARPG.I cannot comment on the multiplayer, in general I don't like PvP games or PvP communities. I don't need children telling me their sexual escapades with my mother or for them to question my sexuality.I did like some of the campaign, that which allowed you to base build and not control an extremely liminited nuber of units, but at this price point I cannot recommend the game as a standalone or expansion. $5 might be a good price point for this.

												Compared to the first expansion to Company of Heroes (Opposing Fronts), Tales of Valor adds very little. There are no new factions. There are no new, extensive campaigns. The expansion adds only three short, unfulfilling campaigns, some new multiplayer units (these replace other units normally in the game), and a few new multiplayer modes. The campaigns are not very fun. They entail taking control of a small number of absurdly overpowered units to play a highly unrealistic set of missions. The new units in multiplayer are generally less useful than the units they replace, so it's best to simply not use most of them. The survival multiplayer mode is fun, but it is not worth the purchase price of the game.This expansion sometimes goes on sale for $2.50. If you're going to buy it, buy it at that price. Do not spend more than that on this expansion, as its gameplay value does not merit such.			"

												Please note that I am not recommending this game based on it being £9.99 in the store.  Depending on future sales, it may be worth a look if you are a company of heroes fan.My main beef with this is the length of the campaigns.  You will see that I have played this game for 3 hours, which is the total length of time it has taken for me to complete all three campaigns on a normal difficulty setting.  There is some replay value in attempting to achieve some of the medals for secondary objectives but I would not envisage this taking more than about another hour of gameplay.  So £9.99 for three hours of game play, I don't feel that's value for money.The original Company of Heroes was/is an exceptional game that rightfully is considered to be one the greatest RTS games ever made.  This game seems to run on the same engine and is a stand alone game to the original so you don't need that to play it.  There are three campaigns, though I use that word in the loosest sense as none of them are very long, all centred around the campaign in Normandy.  Each campaign consists of three missions which are all on the same map (to be clear there are three maps, one for each campaign).  There are two German campaigns and one US campaign.  The first campaign has you in control of one (yes one) Tiger tank for two of the missions, gaining a second for the final mission.  This is a relatively quick but somewhat stale campaign as you're normally used to managing a number of units in combined operations.  The designers (in a nod to Men of War) have also included a direct fire command so you can target enemy units directly with the mouse.  This feature didn't really add anything to the game for me and felt tacked on.The second campaign has you controlling two US squads with an expanded force later on.  This is slightly more challenging although I question the results of some of the combat as they seem to be 'super soldiers'.  This is challenging given that you are fighting with infantry against vehicles and infantry in fortifications with artillery support.The third campaign is much better and has you defending a town (Chambois) at the base of the Falaise gap as the German's against relentless Allied ground and air assault.  This is more like the classic Company of Heroes, requiring you to cotrol sectors, build defences, recruit different troop types and muster a defence against a superior enemy.  This for me was the most challenging and enjoyable campaign and one I will play again.I haven't played multiplayer but there a number of different units that change the unit roster for the various countries.  I can't comment directly but I'm not sure that having an amphibious kubelwagen really adds that much beyond novelty!I feel that Opposing Fronts adds much more for the single player and multiplayer and if you haven't got that then I'd go for that one first.I add that I got this game for free in a PC Gamer magazine so for value I'd say that about £0.50 to £1.50 is what I would pay for this.

												Ehhh noThere are three campaigns here, but they are really short and lack the mix of good missions and story to go with it that made the original game and Opposing Fronts as good as they were.I guess if it's all in one collection you will get this too, but it is most certainly the weakest part of Company of Heroes. By itself it is not worth it.			"

												This would be the third game breaking patch in a row.  This patch now attempts to hide the fact they have broken the server browser.  This makes it next to impossible to play with friends versus people you don't know, which is the main draw for me at least.  Additionally this effectively limits the game modes you can play to 'victory point' (KotH) only.The singleplayer isn't very good either, the campaigns other than the US one I are extremely boring and skirmish(vs AI) isn't entertaining after a certain point.  While the game is old and cheap I would still recommend avoiding it, simply to not give sega business (game was fine under thq and I would even posit that sega purposefully sabotaged it to garner more cash for coh2).

So as you can imagine i was like hmm not a lot to play with and i was right. 3 very tiny campaigns 3 missions each. The cut screen were rushed not like the others adding to story. I will give it a negative purely because for 9.99 on an old game now i expect more for my money this add on should of been given as an update because that is pretty much all it is nothing really added content wise. The original game and other addons though 5/5 all the way amazing game so play them not this one unless your a completist			"

												To be perfectly clear: this is a review for the New Steam Version of CoH.Company of Heroes is probably my most beloved franchise of all time. So why am I giving this a negative review?Here's what happened: CoH's original publisher, THQ, went bankrupt and CoH and its development house were sold to Sega. Multiplayer infrastructure is now handled natively through Steam. This sounds great in theory, but in practice, the game suffers from constant, crippling crashes. It really is unplayably bad. It's unconscionable that things could have been allowed to deteriorate so badly, but I suppose it was inevitable that such an old game wouldn't get the love it needed. The gameplay and graphics really do hold up quite well: in fact I'd say it bests CoH 2 in practically all regards.What a sad and ignominious way for a beautiful game to live out its last days. CoH really didn't deserve to go out with a whimper. If you haven't played the single-player campaigns, you really owe it to yourself to play through the original and Opposing Fronts campaigns, which are brilliant. But as for multiplayer, this game is essentially over, barring the unlikely event that the netcode is ironed out to pre-Steam levels.Fare ye well, CoH.			"

												ATTENTION! I could easily consider this game to be one of the best ww2 strategy game ever in the history. Graphics are awesome, in game units are really good and there are plenty, the game has a great balance as well but unfortuenetly Steam ruined this game with updates. There used to be usually 45-50 servers easily, now there are just as many but all of them are filtered and somehow you can't get into them, it is so hard to find a game in the first hand and even if you get in one, there are twice as many bugs in game! I wish Relic wouldn't give up on it's servers, the game was awesome back then. 3/10 as of now, but I would easily rate it 10/10 back then.			"

												CoH made me sad - sad that I somehow missed this gem years ago.  Even years later the graphics are still quite good and the sound effects are top notch.  Essentially this is along the same lines as other top-down squad-based RTS games (Warhammer 40k); however, the game mechanics are very well polished and the control scheme is intuitive.You'll play as the Americans, British, Germans or Elite Panzers (German also) and battle over resources across the map until someone manages to win by points or annihilate the other team.  Warning: you must use strategy with your units.  They will naturally try to seek cover so they aren't shot to pieces, but you'll need to come up with a better plan before rushing out in the open - such as chopping up the enemy defenses with artillery, using snipers to weaken key units, or ambushing the enemy by hiding in city buildings and placing defenses (like sandbags and barbed wire) to funnel the enemy in to a death trap. Excellent game.			"

												Easily the best RTS of all time. Deformable terrain, cover, squads, veterancy, gorgeous and balanced maps, novel 'commander abilities' that unlock over the course of each battle and raise the tempo of combat. The music and voice over is excellent. The single-player campaigns/missions are excellent but the multi-player game is where it's at. Not quite the clickfest that is StarCraft, Company of Heroes is more about battlefield tactics - using cover, diversions, combined arms, and manoeuvre to outfight your opponents. Generally you only ever have to look after 3-8 units and the AI does an outstanding job of prioritizing targets. This was my preferred lunch time game for a year and a half (2006-2007) and shares some blame for 'Mass Effect  1' being a bit delayed.			"

												Easily the best RTS of all time. Deformable terrain, cover, squads, veterancy, gorgeous and balanced maps, novel 'commander abilities' that unlock over the course of each battle and raise the tempo of combat. The music and voice over is excellent. The single-player campaigns/missions are excellent but the multi-player game is where it's at. Not quite the clickfest that is StarCraft, Company of Heroes is more about battlefield tactics - using cover, diversions, combined arms, and manoeuvre to outfight your opponents. Generally you only ever have to look after 3-8 units and the AI does an outstanding job of prioritizing targets. This was my preferred lunch time game for a year and a half (2006-2007) and shares some blame for 'Mass Effect  1' being a bit delayed.			"

Some of these mission features include a rotating map, alerting your units to an incoming attack and commanding an overpowered lone wolf tank against the British!			"

												Reviewing for Company of Heroes is reviewing for my child hood. When my the game first came out, I was 6 years old. I played it on a disk for a while, and then I moved unto console gaming. When I was 13, I bought Opposing Fronts, and played that to my hearts content until I could get Tales of Valor, which would give me American and Wehrmacht units again. I played this even more some. The game is still indate, with the moving to a Steam centered multiplayer system. The game's graphics are better then you would expect from a 10 year old game. Buy it. Just do it.			"

The game does not have too much complication, as some might be accustomed to from games like Men Of War. Now, with that said, the game is not easy either, espessially in multiplayer. Also, if playing the game with the opposing fronts expansion, having the collection of four factions brings some diverse gameplay. Having played Company of Heros 2 for some time as well, I have to say that I perfer the first game to the new game, just saying.			"

												How good is it? Good enough that I - not a fan of strategy games, started playing from the time i had oportunity with such a pleasure, that not many games (and I mean any genre) can give. Everything from gameplay to sounds are great. No wonder its considered probably the best RTS of all time. It also has the Highest score up to date. Thats what RTS really should be like. Competetive multiplayer is a bit harsh now, because there are still many hardcore players playing it. Therefore it can be frustrating automatched with someone who is a pro. Besides that is pleasure to play against PC or friends. If by any chance you are rts fan and havent tried this - punch or kick yourself in the face. Go buy it and try it. If you're not a fan of RTS i dare you try it and say that you dont like it. I wont go into details like watching 1vs1 tank battle when oponent tries to escape leaving his back open and gets a shot that pierces his rear armor, and explodes in beautifull detail (like i said i wont go into details) but i just cant get enough of this game.

												If you enjoy military RTS games, then you will love this game.Well balanced, and even handed - one of my pet annoyances within this genre is how the AI will magically 'know' where your units are, or move out of an incoming artillery barrage for no apparent reason, or tanks that have excellent visibility when buttoned down, etc.Happily, there is little evidence of AI advantage in this game, which gives an indication of the thought put into the game by the designers - they have actively programmed in real world constraints, rather than be lazy and not balance the AI, like so many other games in this genre.Gameplay is easy to pickup, giving newcomers and old hands a smooth introduction into the game. From there, expect to have the hours stolen away from you, as your men valiantly fight off or through Panzers and infantry.Well crafted game, with plenty of replayability, and with it frequently on sale, there is little excuse not to have this fine game in your collection.

												Set in the world of World War II; Company of Heros is one of my favorite RTS games of all time. Another very tactical game that requires quick action to potentially game  ending situations, but with careful strategic planning of defenses they can be prevented. You also have three abilities to choose form, and the one you choose ultimately determines how you play the game for each faction.			"

												What can I say about Company of Heroes? Well, for starters, it's a World War II based RTS game with great graphics and a great physics engine. The singleplayer campaigns are immersive and interesting. They keep you on your toes and are not only fun to look at, but they are historically accurate down to the letter (mostly). The online community is decent enough but you'll always get a few try-hards here and there. It is a strategy game, though, so it does require a little more thinking than just spamming something. That doesn't work in this game, unless you have tanks. Tanks are always nice, unless they are shooting at you. Anyway, Relic did not drop the ball on this series. They went all out. This is their gem, as far as i'm concerned. Try any of the Company of Heroes versions before trying Company of Heroes 2, which is almost a different game.			"

												Company of Heroes has been a hugely successful RTS series that has set a new standard for games of this type.This Real Time Strategy (RTS) focuses upon the key events of WWII and the Allied and Axis forces. Commanding units, ranging from artillery, tanks, infantry and aircraft, is rewarding with cover use and destructible environments.The Good:- Destructible environments. Waging war in a changing environment gives added depth and realism.- Balanced forces. While each force has its' strength and weaknesses, the remain reasonably well balanced for multiplayer matches- Graphics. Not of the highest detail close-in, but quite good, given the game's age.- Cover use. Multiple levels of cover type, destructibility, and protection.- Units. Authentic of the era, great audio to match and very diverse.The Bad:Multiplayer is hosted ""peer-to-peer"", relying on other people's PC's.

												Company of Heroes is a unique game, think of Dawn of War except in World War II fashion. It's an amazing RTS game and it's great for those tactical-minded people out there. And plus its not very complicated, its very easy to learn.  It has a little bit of age on it (2006ish) but the graphics are still great and you can get the original Company of Heroes on Steam for under 10 dollars which is a steal for a game that can eat all your hours up. It has a great campaign which the expansions also add on more campaigns, you can play as the German Luffwafte or the United States or Great Britain. The resourses you collect in this game are obtained by capturing ""points"" so you focus on the warfare and no industrial side of this game, just all out war. The AI is competent and it can be challeging at times. If you call yourself a tactical gamer this game is a MUST HAVE..			"

												Played this game on disc a long time ago before I got the steam version in the humble bundle. Really enjoyed my time playing this game while it lasted. Hopefully, the next installment that is COH 2 will impress. Pro:A good fun game that is addictively fun and even so when you played the game with mods. A must for WW2 strategy gamers looking mixture of some realisim and arcadish feel.Con: The game engine needs to be more friendly to custom mods. Constant crashing seems to be an issue. Also, logging into accounts can really be messy as login seems to always fail when using custom mods.			"

												I've been playing this game for years (long before the weird steam version hours started counting), and I always come back to this game for clean RTS fun. There are few games that hit just about everything you want in an RTS like Company of Heroes, including longevity. This game is far better than CoH2, offering great balance, (still) great graphics and performance, entire standalone games as DLC (instead of crummy map packs), and a modding community with years of material for you to explore (including the amazing Eastern Front mod which does everything and more that CoH2 does). I don't think I'll ever stop playing this game.			"

												I loved how the final campaign feel, a lost cause but you can protect the retreat of the army and finally relieve your troops and evacuate them.What I hatted was the cheating AI, after some tries at hard to accomplish all the medals y began to use mines and tanks obstacles, then the AI started spawning unlimited Shermans with plows apart of their regular army and destroy my defensese. And even if you manage to stop them it will start spawning units behind your defense.I know it is designed to defeate you, hell i played the campaign as the allies I know you have to lose as the Germans, but at least make it by your own rules, trowing thousands of units and not cheap spawning tricks.

												In many ways a very complete game, even with all it's shortcomings. Would you have friends to play with, go for the Tales of Valor. Players who are only interested in single player go for the gold edition. The single player is starting to show it's age but it's still worth the 10-15 bucks that is asked for it. In total, if you want both you are going to be paying around 20-25 for both single and multiplayer, which is a slight overprice for game this old.			"

												If you enjoy military RTS games, then you will love this game.Well balanced, and even handed - one of my pet annoyances within this genre is how the AI will magically 'know' where your units are, or move out of an incoming artillery barrage for no apparent reason, or tanks that have excellent visibility when buttoned down, etc.Happily, there is little evidence of AI advantage in this game, which gives an indication of the thought put into the game by the designers - they have actively programmed in real world constraints, rather than be lazy and not balance the AI, like so many other games in this genre.Gameplay is easy to pickup, giving newcomers and old hands a smooth introduction into the game. From there, expect to have the hours stolen away from you, as your men valiantly fight off or through Panzers and infantry.Well crafted game, with plenty of replayability, and with it frequently on sale, there is little excuse not to have this fine game in your collection.

												Company of Heroes has been a hugely successful RTS series that has set a new standard for games of this type.This Real Time Strategy (RTS) focuses upon the key events of WWII and the Allied and Axis forces. Commanding units, ranging from artillery, tanks, infantry and aircraft, is rewarding with cover use and destructible environments.The Good:- Destructible environments. Waging war in a changing environment gives added depth and realism.- Balanced forces. While each force has its' strength and weaknesses, the remain reasonably well balanced for multiplayer matches- Graphics. Not of the highest detail close-in, but quite good, given the game's age.- Cover use. Multiple levels of cover type, destructibility, and protection.- Units. Authentic of the era, great audio to match and very diverse.The Bad:Multiplayer is hosted ""peer-to-peer"", relying on other people's PC's. Can sometimes lead to lag issues, however, this is not very common.9.0 / 10			"

												Arguably the best RTS ever made!  It just get's so many things right:  The pacing of the game, the importance of tactics, different units/strengths for each faction, fully destructable environments, the resource/supply system (no mining!), simple but meaningful base building, etc...If you have even a vague interesting in strategy games, this game is not to be missed!  It's single player missions are great but pale in comparison to the absolutely top notch multiplayer!			"

												Played this game on disc a long time ago before I got the steam version in the humble bundle. Really enjoyed my time playing this game while it lasted. Hopefully, the next installment that is COH 2 will impress. Pro:A good fun game that is addictively fun and even so when you played the game with mods. A must for WW2 strategy gamers looking mixture of some realisim and arcadish feel.Con: The game engine needs to be more friendly to custom mods. Constant crashing seems to be an issue. Also, logging into accounts can really be messy as login seems to always fail when using custom mods.			"

												This game is a must have for RTS lovers. And WW2 buffs.It won so many awards and has the best metascore of all time for an RTS game.Its game mechanics are so complex that most people won't even know how good it is, behind the scenes the calculations going on are huge. It's not a simple always hit and do set damage model like poor Starcraft(2) with a few armor types thrown in the mix.The bad thing is it doesn't communicate this info in game (you have to get modding tools and see the stat files).The good thing is most of the mechanics work with realism in mind so you can use your normal judgement of things. Like long range - less accuracy (and lower rate of fire for some weapons). Hit tank in back - more penetration. Etc.Graphics and Audio are top notch.Plus it's cheap ;)			"

One for the Germans (Falaise Pockets) and Americans (Ardennes Offensive). Each mission have 3 parts, but it takes time, that's what's good about it. But I hoped that they added more for each mission just like the standalone version and the Opposing fronts expansion. That's just my con. lol. Love this game since it came out. COH 2 is♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												An absolutely fantastic RTS that does a lot with a little. You'd think only two factions with two armies per faction would restrict playstyles, but each army has three distinct areas of focus that play entirely differently, making it more like six armies on each side rather than just the two. If you like artillery strikes, gigantic tank battles, flamethrowing guys out of buildings, KILLIN NAZIS, and relatively fast-paced objective-based RTS gameplay, the CoH series is a fantastic choice.

												Real-time Strategy at it's very best. Company of heroes Tales of Valor being the third in the Company of Heroes series has something to show for and is a major addition to the epic trilogy. Tales of Valor includes New campaigns, each of which are playable online with a friend. The new Click to fire option on comes into play as you take controll of a King Tiger in its very own unique campaign mission. Tales of Valor also comes with a 'Customize Army' option, which gives you the option to change units in one of the 4 armies for another unique unit. This addon is not vital, and the company of heroes experience can still be achieved through simply buying the original, but for hardcore CoH fans and lovers of a unique RTS, Tales of Valor adds the difference.

Even so the graphics are still top notch and the gameplay is always enjoyable! Pounding German positions with 105mm howitzers never gets old! I Recommend this game to every gamer. Any gamer would not be a true gamer without this masterpiece. This is a game that is deffenently more enjoyable with freinds. You will not find a better strategy game until well, COH 2 comes out early 2013. :)			"

												Completely disappointed with the whole CoH2 and expansions. Nowhere near as good as 1st CoH with Opposing fronts. Replayability is boring. Missions are once and done. AI units are stupid running down fires protecting your troops from freezing or sitting in groups off to side when ordered to attack ""here"". In Falaise Gap, flame throwing tank shrugs off 88mm cannon shell from rear flank, kills the crew, then backs over anti tank obstacles destroying them all (12) in under 5 sec. Really?!!! I seem to remember 88s killing my tanks from the other side of the screen in other scenarios.Total crap as far as realism goes. Save your money.			"

												Company of Heroes remains one of the most one of the most innovative RTS titles in recent memory. Game mechanics such as map control, troop morale, suppressing fire, and cover all flow seamlessly with a superior graphics engine. If you have played Dawn of War or its sequels, then I am sure you can vouch for its polished gameplay. This is NOT your average World War II game or RTS title. This is Company of Heroes.Important note: I only purchased Tales of Valor through Steam in order to get the unlock code; I previously purchased Company of Heroes: Gold as a disc. I STRONGLY suggest you purchase the Gold Edition!			"

												If you enjoy military RTS games, then you will love this game.Well balanced, and even handed - one of my pet annoyances within this genre is how the AI will magically 'know' where your units are, or move out of an incoming artillery barrage for no apparent reason, or tanks that have excellent visibility when buttoned down, etc.Happily, there is little evidence of AI advantage in this game, which gives an indication of the thought put into the game by the designers - they have actively programmed in real world constraints, rather than be lazy and not balance the AI, like so many other games in this genre.Gameplay is easy to pickup, giving newcomers and old hands a smooth introduction into the game. From there, expect to have the hours stolen away from you, as your men valiantly fight off or through Panzers and infantry.Well crafted game, with plenty of replayability, and with it frequently on sale, there is little excuse not to have this fine game in your collection.

												One of the best strategy games of all time. I would argue that the Axis are slightly over powered in this game. Some will tell you that it's a bunch of bull, but my opinion still stands. Regardless, this is by far my favorite real-time strategy game since the Age of Empires II and Starcraft days.... There are alot of mechanics in this game that other strategy games haven't even come close to utilizing. And, the game still remains easy to pickup and learn, or teach friends.			"

I just can't understand why the game gets so much credit when it purely boils down to APM. CoH differs in that is much more strategy based. APM isn't a necessity at all.
